The use of a stock-documentary of the creeping bats given by BAT HUMAN is truly the most effective. It creates bats hanging from ceiling caves, caves flying, or creeping bats approaching the mouths of the caves. It's just enough to worry about: Do you think that all of them are creepy after you? They are actually a patch of bats attacking a police car that splashes on the windshield, like a winged egg, with a show-stopper sequence with a forty-minute mark. The problem is that this sequence is about fifty minutes to recover from the movie, one or more of the most waking people around, shaking hands with an excitement about some poor goofball who can win the plant by a bat <br /> <br /> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Fear that he comes with rabid. exercise. So here is an effective summary of the movie: A few young men continue running on a romantic escape when they are finished with a bat. They try to erase it with boldness, but it tries to convince those around it that it is a little more than rabid, that it can not control itself and that it is far from everything. Now, some of you are shouting in the mouth to foam, sweaty, one of the cheapest passengers, and you are shouting at you, away from him. <br /> <br /> Therefore, do not try to give him a drug, do not try to tell him he loves it, give it a place to the boy, go home, and try the next year's run. <br /> <br /> People in this film act as moron, insist on pushing the boy to his throat, and some of them turn into creatures of the human half-bats and kill a number of non-essential secondary characters. There is nothing wrong with this, but the movie forgets the budget's low budget feature and tries to be a type of psychological learning. Instead of a monster movie, this man is able to get a lot of people working around trying to get a cold pill, and as a result, he throws people into the hills looking for a lot more people insist on trying to persecute him <br /> <br /> The most important thing was that it happened in the first fifteen to twenty minutes, at the thirtieth summit, and had to be after the film's owner. There is a journey there, not a BAT personality. Indeed, it takes about eighty minutes to get steam on the front, always bringing an entertaining Michael Pataki to an exciting character sketch, which always has fun Michael Pataki, who lost his spiritual superiority and captured the late Paul Carr as a doctor friend. <br /> <br /> This film is terribly long, about fifteen minutes long, and left a chance to create a beautiful, memorable little one. RATMAN, I saw today and then saw this one inspired to regret it. <br /> <br /> Even though I and my brightest thoughts, the scene in the police car was a trifle: very bad, we can not be in the twelve and twenty minutes. <br /> <br /> 3/10
