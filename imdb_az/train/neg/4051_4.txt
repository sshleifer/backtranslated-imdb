Lindsay Anderson is a very European filmmaker. David Lean, Ridley Scott, and Alan Parker create a spectacular film that attracts their lover on a visual scale. Anderson's film is much more about social commentary and subtext, so the primary function of the message is often the same as the English movie artists' thoughts on the entire film that should be entertained to entertain viewers. I believe that Kinoun is a universal tool (the best Brit movie tries to imitate Hollywood), if you want to send a message, try the pony expression, and the film is ambitious and built in much of the 1960s. In 1968 was the year of France's love and student rebellion. You can imagine every French soloist throwing this movie into a climax. French new wave filmmakers will surprise the abstract surrealists of some of the scenes, but a key international will not love it, and many will not intensely love it
