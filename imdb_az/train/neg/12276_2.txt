The film had many potentials, unfortunately, because of a weak / incredible story line, error, and content / substance was unclear. Sean Connery, one of the most obvious defects, played Arab man, was unable to write his Arabic name! It might seem like a minor flaw, but it seems that it does not make any effort to focus on its details. The quality of the game was straightforward. <br /> <br /> The only saving saving grace of the film was wrapped in the most recent plot; and a French song (I do not remember the name). In general, it was a movie that Sean Connery could not see.
