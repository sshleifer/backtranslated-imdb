This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. Here are the things that have been thrown into me at once: 1. The forests were like many hills in Los Angeles with several trees and brush. No fear. News Break, if you shoot a movie in the area of ​​Southern California, the big bear is just an hour away. They really have trees. <br /> <br /> The writing was undoubtedly the worst dialogue I have ever experienced. Each line in the film was unusual, stereotyped, or simply stupid. For example, the name of the camp is "camp blood" (the naked), the clown name "killer clown" (naked). What is a clown in a forest anyway? Was this the only mask they found? 3. Last, but of course, at least an actor. Certainly the worst actress and actress team has been assembled. Virtual blindness and rough operation of shitty lines. The worst part was when she retreated to this fatty girl who was naked for a random photo. It's a really long scene, and I think she should be sexy, but she's not. Also, for me, it was one of the pleasant parts of the film, and this was a "must-have" tool. For example, when he is bored with the film, he takes a few rocks and bends with them. Later, he is preparing to flee for the clown, and he immediately becomes aware of the fact that he is far away from athletics. Oh and Kat playing girl, stop the good Lord singing. The song you have written for credits wants to kill me. <br /> <br /> For this reason, if you see the movie, it is recommended to watch at least the special features. The jackasses band, which has featured this film, is truly a genuine story. In fact, one of the girls says, in fact, that some of their comrades do not allow the script to be read, and none of them can predict the end. Apparently, it depends on children.
