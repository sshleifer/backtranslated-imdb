"Fever Pitch" is a bad movie; This is a terrible film. <br /> <br /> American film critics and critics are talking about lobbying and lobbying Hollywoods that they like to glorify even mid-film with praise, even with laughter in the sky? The only reason I can declare this awesome romantic comedy is that I have good comments (and I used it freely because it's not funny in this movie). <br /> <br /> I sat with this movie, writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel for a moment thought their script was funny. <br /> <br /> The bright Nick Hornby is usually a good translation of the movie. In 1997, he adapted Fever Pitch for an English film with Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell; Peter Hedqs found Hornby's "About a boy" (2002) and in 2000, when he wrote to American for "High Fidelity", writer D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg were wrong because they kept the essence of Hornby's mind and humor. <br /> <br /> Why the American version of Fever Pitch will not be so painful? <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel Hornby have done everything that is funny. <br /> <br /> In order to eliminate good and unique ones, Mr. Steven Hornby is making the story a reality in the United States. <br /> <br /> They have turned a comic story into a formulas romantic comedy, and never comes out of an unhappy formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girls each with a distinctive function. One is overweight, the other is frustrated and ambitious, and the third is romantic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> Life is a companion. In this "Fever Pitch", six supportive friends say or say something particularly funny. They are very insignificant, not even decorative. The only reason for the film is because of the formula. The weak Ion Skye, the wind with a stubborn role of a Lindsey. Lovely Skye would have to have Lloyd Dobs come in and ask him to take it. When it comes to thinking about it, Cusack made an excellent Ben. Of course, Cusack is very smart to add himself to this awesome script. <br /> <br /> There is no single point in this movie that does not seem original or forcible. Because each field turn is predicted, every jerk joke is telegram. Ganz and Mandel are laborers for laughter. The first 45 minutes are over-exaggerated, and you think that scratches write a comedy. In this movie, you can record the plot queue by watch. It is possible that Ganz and Mandel wrote it with some screen capture guru that is attached to the wall. When they came to a certain page, they looked at the formula and said, "Guru says it will happen now." And presto! <br /> <br /> The directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly do not help the movie. They do not have any idea how to present their stories and characters (they are given to another boy sitting behind Ben's Fenway Park, not the protagonist). <br /> <br /> Barrymore and Fallon are talking about some unusual start ups. <br /> <br /> Barrymore is the most loved and beloved. Good laughter is as good as Goldie Hawn. But even its sharpness can not hold this unusual horror movie. It works hard to get some energy and humor from this story. Lindsey Ben, about 30 minutes into the movie, says, "You're a funny man". The only explanation for his statement is in this script. Fallon says nothing for me is laughing away. Fallon is neither pearl nor funny; <br /> <br /> Fallon had no benefit on Saturday night. He was probably the least funny person in the show. Let's remember that sketch of the mind about a radio DJ who made all voices? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fallon's cohort, <br /> <br /> They think I'm funny, and it's still rare, really funny. This is true for Fallon. He thinks he is hysterically funny when he climbs a difficult gig. His stutters, self-confident, did not work on the small screen; <br /> <br /> Do not be surprised, the role of this film also requires a few dramatic moments for Fallon. If you think his comedy is bad, wait until you get the burden of his dramatic stuff. Particularly two scenes - the first in the park, the second in front of the Benin school - is painful. The scenes need a person with dramatic talent from the actor, but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to work. Within the limits of his emotions, the Gamut from A to B is inevitable. <br /> <br /> I have no personality and depth. Often it comes as a bull. This is not her lover. Lindsey thinks he will find something attractive about himself. Compare Fallon's performance to Firth in the English version, and you will understand Fallon's Ben, and how wrong it is for this role, straightforward, unfurnny and forced. Watching Fever Pitch in Fallon is a long time running for Ashton Kutcher's dramatic depth and comedy nuance! <br /> <br /> As "high fidelity", the American "Fever Pitch" could have worked brilliantly. Only better writers, more talented directors, and the strongest, stronger, glamorous, intelligent leader needed it. Do yourself a great blessing: Avoid the rotten film; In 1997, he performed the English version and read Hornby's book.
