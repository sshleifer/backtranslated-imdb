For some time, everyone is making one of Disney's favorite cookies movies. It is up to you to the very end. According to the tradition of the Caribbean Pirates, this movie is a ghost and kills and aggression of your village. This is horror. If you want a foolish, meaningless, predictable "action" movie, you're right. I believe that young children can love it, because they are always good. But I like films that I want to win. This film does not allow Bad Guys to have the top. Finally, when the heroes stay in a "failed" pit, they only know that they can come out. Everything works perfectly for Cage and her friends, no matter how complex it is, no complexity or puzzle for more than 10 seconds. If you want to see several impressive designs, watch this movie, if you want to see a good movie or a good movie. Going to watch a superman movie, it would be shorter and the kids would like more. For example, Cage is a scene that flies from armed gunners and bullets lead to the whole fire. (And I'm Not Talking About A Fence or Something, Only A POLE POLE) This movie shows the filming and film industry crash and the cheap gags and dull, non-realistic activity that keeps this huge amount of movie.
