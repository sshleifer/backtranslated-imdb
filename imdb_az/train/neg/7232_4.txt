I was very well acquainted with Bilal's graphic novel, and when I saw a trailer for this movie, I was amazed and saw more of Bilal's self. The film, however, was a great frenzy. The visual artifacts are close to a rich and flawless piece of art, and the story is weak. Bilal chose to pay attention to more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he did not do very well. <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel is friendship and hatred between Nikopol and Horus. Both were forced out of their time and place, and were forced to each other. Most importantly, they were funny and pleasant. It is not here. Nikopol does not have any personality, and Horus is a hilarious tweet that just wants to be sacked. Although the film is French, it does not have to be Horus! <br /> <br /> We have seen all of our favorite films, but we will not recommend it for any reason or anyone else. I do not recommend Immortel to anyone, as a warning to avoid your ability and resources. A masterpiece of Bilal, but not every master in visual media.
