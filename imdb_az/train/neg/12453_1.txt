I've always been a great Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman when the Sci-Fi Channel runs this movie. I have to see it. Very bitter disappointment. This is just the movie Wonder Woman. right suit [he had not made big changes or had ordered,] and the plot worked like a poor man James Bond. One of the things that will successfully accomplish the heroine of the comic book will be humanitarian power or a certain will. bad sleep. I do not even think Cathy is alluring. I do not waste time on this.
