The previous comment wrote to me. Muslims' photos and serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed up). This comment only says that this idea can be done by racist. Now the race is nothing. I'm a colorful curtain. I look like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not Ireland. I'd like to add that I'm not 100% Serbian, there is a blood of Austrian and Croatian, but what is my point? Am I a dark, half-breed? Lantos (Producers9 and Director are accusing me of being a racist racist prejudice for my life, my family, my country, as Yugoslavia, Karadzik, Izetbegovic, Milosevic, Tjjman are monsters for them, in hell, but they will not return our dead relatives I am proud of being a Serb and am proud of my brothers, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Macarians and Arabs (yes, I am from Serbia, I have many families) .This film embraces the suffering of Serbians or hwats living in Sarajevo, terrorism of street networks and Muslim extremism. Attachment: I pray for and pray for all these innocent sisters and brothers, Muslims, Catholics, or Orthodox Christians who were killed in this battle: our care and lying humanitarianism do not help, Lantos's pockets do not fill more Helps her!
