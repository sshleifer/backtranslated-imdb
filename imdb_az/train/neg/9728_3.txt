Tobe Hooper made great films, so it could not be BAD. I have not read any reviews and tried to look at this unusual joke. <br /> <br /> "I have not commented on this issue," he said. there <br /> <br /> Someone says that this is some kind of Firestarter clone, but it's really. According to this opinion, there are all these. It's a combination of horror, comedy, strange religion / gods, funny darkness, simple effects, drama, horrible action, incredible scripts ... and more. The Spoiler * Story: The government wants to create the final weapon using nuclear energy or something and during the process the child is born for 2 test persons. When a mother reads a child after birth, it burns both husband and wife, and it depends on one's own. The government leaves everything and this child lives among other people ... and then this child grows and, for one reason, is born and understands that he burns his brain. After everything is incredibly messy, something really explains something and when the government realizes that "it can completely fire this job", it intends to use this person as a nuclear poisoner where it takes him to normal illness BECAUSE can kill him, Can not beat! .. and argh, I can say 100 more strange things in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a good laugh, it's best to watch it. Gosh.
