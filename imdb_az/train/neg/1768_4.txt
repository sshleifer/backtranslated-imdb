This is one of the big movies. The basic foundation is good - immortal cats that kill to survive, and so on. - some kind of vampire concept. <br /> <br /> What is causing the breakup of everything is the general hurry of the main characters. . Even sociologists know that if you want to stay alive, you should keep low profiles - how long wait for Unibomber to look and see why a family member is figured out. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the child (and, to a lesser extent, the mother) behaves as imperfect. The child kills without proof or proof that he or she does not abandon the witness. <br /> <br /> This is really shameful. It was written as much as possible, that is, written in writing, that is, the pressure on the people living in the Caucasus continues. I loved the end of every cats in the city when I came home - every time I lit the verandah and our cats suddenly fled, I think of this scene.
