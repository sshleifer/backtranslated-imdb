I went out of nearly six films of my entire life. This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I do not know I'm sitting in an hour. That night I have to be in a coma. When I left 8 years ago, I saw it in the theater. She could not remember her name, but I knew the role of Penelope Ann Miller. It did not really matter to me that my time to comment on this today. Yech! Vomiting! Barf!
