First, let me begin by saying that I hate the comedies they play as stupid as every character is written and played so I can go out of my own feelings. /> <br /> Now I've seen the first three American Pie movies and they've seen the most beautiful films (though open masterpieces compared to the three "Americans") <br /> <br /> Also, I have a few questions there are: <br /> <br /> This is a reasonable use of studio funds and production resources? <br /> <br /> Who approved the final script (and what was the smoker when they confirmed it)? <br /> <br /> Finally, why did I think that the average cost per story was worth $ 10 to $ 15? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As you look at the land for eighteen minutes, The biggest thing I can see is that the movie is wrong, it's a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> The Caucasian tells the viewer that he has a miraculous smirk on his face it's almost impossible to make any of the jokes (which really means better than rubbish), saying "I know it's a tricycle and I'm wasting my talent, but hey pays for me, so who cares? As I mentioned above, most of the rest really have been on major television shows, although Tyrone Savage, the Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order), says only a slow and painful death istəməyiniz üçün dözülməz görünməyən və rahatsız edici bir şeydir (tropik dəri xəstəliklərinə öyrədici şeylər var) <br /> <br /> Bu filmdə növbəti film, yalnız bir MPAA ətrafında ala bilmək üçün bir hekayə xətti ilə yumş R rated, this film is sexually explicit, with sensitivity and sincerity to win the X rating (the assessment team should be drunk when considering the rating for this rating or medication). <br /> <br /> Twenty-five years ago, when Wes introduced Craven Elm Street to an Appraisal Board for the MPAA rating, it was forced him to take twenty-five seconds (I believe that <br /> <br /> < strong> X> did not have the option to avoid getting the rating or would not release the film to do that <br /> <br /> this unnecessary attack can get the R rating today because if this movie is done under the name of comedy, if it were a dramatic drama or horror movie, it would be a great sadness and could endure this fear X rating. <br /> <br /> The most recent thing that really disturbs me is that the film is a very juvenile and unusual is written to play as a thirsty dream of a twelve-year-old child, who has a lot of sexual imaginations, about every single case of the body's movement, It is ridiculous that any intelligent viewer is moving away from a mile and symbols are simply a telegraph that ignores stereotypes of stereotypes, frequently attractive sex references, and constantly unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior. <br /> <br /> This film feels like a low-priced first-year hack by a few initial unmanaged movies written in class script writing. <br /> <br /> uzun və qısa bir şey daha əvvəl hər hansı bir aldadıcı əvvəl bu seriyası öldürmək üçün vaxt çaxnaşma və hücum, bu pasta yol alma ilə doldurulur.
