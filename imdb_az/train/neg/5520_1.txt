This film was shown as a comedy in the novel. This is a great tragedy. My illness made me mad. I hated it. I think they must be fair enough to reflect their true intentions. If I were to watch this movie, I would not see this movie. I think the trailer should reflect the themes and intentions of a movie. I'm tired of this. I really wanted to make a fun comedy and I'm very disappointed. It's been a few days today and this movie has a bad taste in my mouth. I have not been disappointed in a movie or commented on a bad film. I think I'm real, that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intent of the film, nobody would have seen it.
