This film is a terrifying movie (Amis is the worst), meaningless and self-conscious "fallout", an open shock tactic and a prey that embodies everything that goes wrong with the revival of very awesome English films (not like "Rancid Aluminum"). <br /> <br /> The final summary is, in the best possible way, strange and the assertion of the entire organization (some kind of "internet terrorist group" - ooh, how modern) is an attempt to become a pretty 'edgy' that does not blame anyone. It's always nice to see Katy Carmichael on the screen. <br /> <br />
