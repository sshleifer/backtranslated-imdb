The case is the best part of the film, but it is not worth the purchase price. I just "a film based on a true story" movie just miserable and poor with non-related slaughter house scenes clips shot home videos waiting to find a hodge-podge.

I have a theory that the film even before the half when baslamamısdım and a better ending, but if you were down and had seen much worse, waited. I was able to put it down, it would be negative for a decade. Learn Səhvimdən save money and time with this.
