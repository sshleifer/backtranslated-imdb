At one time, I thought it was the worst movie in the movie The Stoned Age ... I was wrong. The Hobboblins did not get it in every way I could imagine. I hated the characters in the "brown era". I hated actors at Hobgoblins ... and everyone involved in creating this brutality. I will not add a teaser to this movie, I am not brutal. You could not succeed as innocent as yourself. In fact, any discussion of the plot of this film creates meaningless and erratic. <br /> <br /> The words I use to describe this film are: insipid, asinine, and ingenious. <br /> <br /> Finally, do not see this movie. I'm begging you to a movie other than a lover, but not to one person, PLEASE. DO NOT WORK FOR YOUR WISDOM AND WISDOM. Destroy any copies you have encountered.
