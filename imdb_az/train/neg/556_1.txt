In my book "Basic Instinct" was a perfect movie. Stone, Douglas, and all of the supporting actors had a major influence on the smallest role. There were spectacular photography, music, and noirest noir scripts. <br /> <br /> This is added to a good movie that's coming soon! <br /> <br /> This is the contrary, on the contrary, it may be worse, direction, it's really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that draws you a bit is a relatively short waiting for the next scene, which is a precise recurring copy of the original. These copies are very bad, they make you laugh and I was laughing despite myself, because it looked at the ruin of a bright monument. The only thing that is good in this terrible confusion is from Jerry Goldsmith's BI1 account. Michael Caton-Jones and the midfielder responsible for the scenario included a "No smoking in this room" dialog box, and even though he was away from his lawyer (now a lawyer)! <br /> <br /> I apologize for having seen this horrible movie I have never seen before! It's damaging to the original, so bad. Only the cost of recovery can realize that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure that Ms Stone can get the best surgical money) can do a good job, but can restore the obviously original improvement. It also applies to filming about the human body. Must be a law: You have to go on a perfect movie!
