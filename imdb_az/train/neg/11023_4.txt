David Mackenzie's brilliant Young Man's follower is a story of a screaming sorcerer trying to confront some psychic problems with his mother. He wants to be gritty, realistic and mysterious. <br /> <br /> To achieve this goal, the movie works hard to be young. <P style = "text-align: justify; There are some hand-drawn letters visible to Juno, such as his original soundtrack, which is a bit flawed, with fast paced indie rock trying to convince the audience that Hallam is OK. the film is something other than the young. <br /> <br /> Like the young Adam, the film is the woman who is drowning in the mystery of this film - the mother of Hallam in this case, the young Adem keeps her secret quiet, surprisingly well and is good enough to hit with truth Hallam Foe refers to his character's psychosis so clear and early that he does not do anything other than the really expected parameters The opening scene is Hallam in the tree watching the sister's sister walk around with her lover. <br /> <br /> Around my mother's drowning the mystery of his father by his girlfriend to check whether it is suicide. The audience really believe Hallama, besides being creepy because of his disobedience think it yaxınlasdıracagını dəlilikə. This would hinder a hidden element for me because Hallam is still relatively still. When he finds some tips to support his claim, he runs away from home and looks like a police officer at first. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, she with her husband, with the clarity of her psychological needs. This movie is not a mystery, it's still a blur. It tries to be a realist to deal with such issues, but adds a trail that reflects itself. It measures the magnitude of the building, locks the locks and raises a heavy Noise Trainspot to help the root of the audience for a hero who raises camps for voyeurism. Adventurous adventures filled with this city, Hallam's, are hard to deal with, and they are not sexy, odd or unpleasant. They are neutral than anything else; Do not put forward the character or story. Mackenzie understands Hallam, but he failed to create a common ground. <br /> <br /> He wishes Hallam's trials and troubles without much ideological grounds. Film focuses and engages in voyeurism / prospects for viewers. Certainly, most people would be surprised by that. And Hallam Foe realizes it, but it does not allow her to see the hallmark of her decisions. He tries to fill his inner space, from man to man. There is a line that is particularly disturbed by Kate, who is interested in Hallam's love. She says drunkenly, "I love the creepy guys," probably inviting the audience to do the same thing. The line tries to postpone its idea (its motivation remains the same) and tries to keep us judged. It is not difficult to love Hallam, but it is very difficult to participate in his adventure - even if it's an adventure. All of these are trying to use a magnificent recording movie to disguise the original sound of the movie. <br /> <br /> Great speeches are made with a weak third-party movement, dirty development, and an uncertain direction from Mackenzie. Recently, this movie was released in the United States and why? Not only is it a bad thing, but the truth is that Hallam's character is never a 'mister' name.
