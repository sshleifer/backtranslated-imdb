The film "Drink No Water" is incredibly bad. It is based on the 1966 Broadway game by Woody Allen. The comic genius Jackie Gleason stars behind The Honeymooners. Director Howard Morris appeared in several Mel Brooks comedy films (Life Stinks, High Anxiety, Silent Movie) and made a note in the animation (Gopher, Jughead (Archie) and Beetle Bailey from Pooh). <br /> <br /> In my opinion , the purpose of this problem is to perform effectively to work effectively. Allen's original game was lingerie, so Broadway and Allen worked again in 1994. R.S. The scenario by Allen and Harvey Bullock is far ahead of his death and makes many changes from the original game. <br /> <br /> Gleason's wife is an example of the fact that this version of the version has an original headache, pulling this air version. <br /> <br /> Acting is not better. Gleason can do all he can with the material, but can not keep it. Gleason was a comic genius, and he was a great actor in the "Hustler" and "Rain in Soldier". Its abrasive personality could have worked here, but an unfortunate post did not even give him a chance. Very bad. Estelle Parsons' airplane will take napkins 20 minutes later. See how he expects his drowning. <br /> <br /> For both Bonnie and Clyde and Rachel, Rachel's two independent actors, she's a shame as she's a good actress. Woody Allen hated this movie in 1994, rebuilding himself with the film, and finally Julie Kavner (Marge Simpson). They manage to shoot all the right notes and the movie itself is a funny masterpiece. The video is finally over after a long battle. Eject and find this version. <br /> <br /> <strong> All works in 1969 are good for unwanted guests who exceed their kindness. <br /> <br /> From 4 stars 1/2 *
