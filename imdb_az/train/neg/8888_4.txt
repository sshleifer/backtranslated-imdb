I appreciated the main instinct 2, yet the movie has a rating of less than 4. I have only 4 of this movie but only 7.3 out of 600. <br /> <br /> I do not see any reason to love this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is boring because it leaves those rooms in that broken house. And there are only 5 people in this movie. This is about two hours, which is absolutely unnecessary. Most dialogues are slow and meaningless. The sound of the movie is also a blue color that suffers to watch. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds Hou Hsiao ssien "Three times" that is equally boring, and the dialogues are equally boring. It also has a high rating! <br /> <br /> This film has no passion and no excitement.
