"2) This movie does not really want to be realistic and the story looks, but my wife is just an inexperienced character (except Janosch) Yes, I know that this movie is 17 but I do not believe that there are some experiences with German schools and German youths. <br /> 3) Sexual Awakening is really an important thing for a movie on this subject, but I do not doubt that one of the teens should do "dumping on the dessert" that everyone in the woods During massive masturbation, strawberries should sprinkle with sperm and should eat sperm-moist cookies after being infected. <br /> <br /> 4) Benjamin's family and father have a subtracting betrayal - still, what can I say about the serious attempts of this movie? I do not know why it is there and where it is. <br /> <br /> Yes, I personally hated this movie to have Benjamin's character because you did not have a message, concept, scheme, and attempts to become dramatic and serious. However, some people may find these pictures that can be sensitive and touchable. If you love "Other Sister", you probably will be like this. <br /> <br /> 17-year-olds should not write their biographies, and if they do, it's a good idea to film. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 2.
