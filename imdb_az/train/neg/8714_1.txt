I could not stop laughing! This movie is incredibly funny and stupid! But do not think anything, it's fun! You do not have to pay attention to something in this movie! Acting is the same - LAME! The dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, I have seen the T-Rex heads for a moment) The predators are identical to Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is ... But some scenes look like each other and some kind of kindergarten fails the project looks like. Moving quickly, sometimes very fast, in fact I'm talking about speedy arrangements, they're so fast, so we can not see rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! late, they are rubber! <br /> <br /> <strong> Rick Dean </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
