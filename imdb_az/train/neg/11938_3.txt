The movie started well enough. Getting a friend, superpowers (telekinesis, x-ray view, invulnerability, flight, dog-speaking ability, superspeed, heat-vision and ability to grow large and fast plants), was to get hit by a bright green meteorite, and fight crime. <br /> <br /> Meteor Man takes a suit from his mother, fights with his own gangs, and meets with network leaders who are very disappointed, confused, to serve you. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br> /> <br /> Despite this nonsense, the movie has good points. Obviously, if you try to take a single bunch, they will come back home and harm you. Networks and societies state that they must see their true enemies (big bosses who use honest people as ghetto entities for their own purposes). They also say that people who want to work as a community do not need superheroes to destroy the harmful predators. <br /> <br /> Voters must provide elected officials (Rudolf Giuliani, Marion Barry, Ronald Reagan, George Bush and George H. W. Bush).
