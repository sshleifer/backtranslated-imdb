I saw SXSW with the film director. Very few people went out and the audience ended with appalling applause. <br /> <br /> Among the 60 or 70 films that I've seen in this festival are among the worst of Frownland. <br /> 106 minutes, at least 95 minutes longer. You can watch the unsuccessful attempts of the main character in long-term communication. <br /> <br /> A site really compares this to Mike Leigh's early era. What medicine should you make to make this statement? Considering that Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song, maybe you enjoy the Trout Mask Replica on heavy burst to evaluate this movie In an incredible way, you won a jury prize at this festival and you can claim that you can not win the audience prize.
