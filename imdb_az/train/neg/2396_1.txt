I only saw this movie on television and I must admit that I was a little surprised. There was a large number of walks, worsens, and bad regulations that would have been a good idea to watch an old episode of Sesame Street. The act was okay, but please really feel the "Flat Video" feeling. Casting / crew made this movie a bad melody. Yes, there's a message in the movie, but wait for ten minutes before you hear it. Trust me, you will not even tell the difference.
