The film has never been unbearable to watch. There is nothing to illustrate, or to show sex-sexy Alicia Silverstone, sexually explicit sex, to reveal sexually explicit dresses to talk straight. It's easy to follow the story or there's nothing to follow - you can see it in both ways. There is no tension, little movement, modest dialogues, dissatisfaction feelings, the same boring places, and a very soft player. Kevin Dillon is absolutely worthless. Silverstone ... well, I confess, his player did not concentrate too much. However, as I said before, it would not look bad if there is nothing other than watching a movie. 4/10
