As a South Baptist, I'm sorry that I need to put down an average rating for a clear Christian film. Undoubtedly, I do not want to distract cinematographs from a genre exploited. Still, the "Abiding Love of Love" is a low-budget, low-key, self-conscious Christian film. The arson is predictable, moving mediocre (I am acting) and the editorial is miserable. It could have been a little bit like a television movie, but left it as a feature film. Try the kids. You have a movie about the true Christians who are in one place. Can I apply to G. K. Chesterton or C. S. Lewis for some inspiration?
