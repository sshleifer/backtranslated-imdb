I gave 3 votes for this movie because it looks nice as all the Greenaways appearances. But this "art" sex and ambitious crap was his usual blend. I know many people like this movie, but I grew tired very quickly. Not necessarily for everyone. Everywhere I think McGregor's obvious part, but it really did not lose its time. I hate to bring everyone to the lying corner, but I ask ..... !!! In addition, it is very appealing and music is glad, but I can not see it until the end and can not say for many movies. I usually watch everything, but it's unbearable!
