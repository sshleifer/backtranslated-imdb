As a 'Hydrosphere', this incredible film, released in Australia, has to hypnotize and watch the end, just to see if it can lead to evil ... and it does! <br /> <br /> According to some of the movies, children who are from childhood resemble each other. From the proximity cupboard of "General Recall". <br /> <br /> I saw that this movie was so bad I laughed most of the road. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell hangs his head in shame. Obviously, you need money!
