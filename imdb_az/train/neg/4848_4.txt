I love a good war movie and got into the category "I've been there, I've seen it." So, I would like to conclude that I have not been reviewed (IMHO). Only by watching this movie on DVD, I can safely say that there is a pile of rubbish. <br /> <br /> It's impossible for me to present this movie to you. </ Strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> I was shouting at the television saying "do not do it" with me ... but soon I realized that our work experience was a barrier If so, I'm a little cool. But when I was on the opening scene, I got a bad feeling that this movie would be predictable ... I'm right. <br /> There were no logic to EOD scenes. I know that the army command team had the most sick rebels on the other side of the wire or the far-away circle. So, I always scratched my head. Children in the middle of the hustle and bustle themselves around their mistakes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Saudi Arabia> It just did not mean anything, and she wanted me to cross it. I really tried patiently to get them so dragged. I started with "Contact Right" and went fast. If you have a British password, you fired, but if you were part of the EOD team, you would have hit a great shot and saved your day. So the story stretched out over an unexplained time, without adding anything. <br /> <br /> Therefore, they hit each other several times each other to laugh each other. Nothing has been added in the movie. <br /> <br /> My life has gone to the edge of the wire to open one of the main stars, as it seems very boring. This can be the most funny scenery you watch most. He could not write all logic and good writing ... it was meaningless and terrible. I still do not understand that it's time for it. To run from the busy streets just to return to the camp, I was laughing at the ground. Clean comedy :) <br /> <br /> It is a sad fact that this story takes part in the show without solving what really wants to be. I thought it would be stupid complicated EOD scenes, but then tangents were trying to get something different. But, just as I was tested, I was just about to die. Everything I wanted to end has come to an end. <br /> <br /> There is no way I can make this proposal. <br /> <br /> This is a counterfeit style of stupid scenes involved in stupid, meaningless, action (scenarios) scenes. Maybe my work experience affects unpleasantness, but nausea is not really the case. Something more sensitive than this is the rating of a high IMDb ... this is a 24/7 job of a PR PR team using this website to think that everyone is good. <br /> <br /> Thank you that it will repeat you.
