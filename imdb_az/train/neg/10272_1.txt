When I read behind the DVD, I thought it was not really interesting ... so ... my mother threw it into the movie box at the "$ 4 for $ 4" section at Blockbuster. When we came home and filmed ... in twenty minutes, we returned to each other as we "sucks" ourselves. I will admit that some of our friends in the caf√© smiled at us a little. But let's have at least some decent actor! Every time in the film, if the player is bad and the film does not continue at a very fast pace, and as it really seems interesting, I can close it and make some lines of laughter. But I can only do a lot. <br /> <br /> In this film, actors are laughing hysterically, and there are crying scenes as there is no delivery for their mouths. <br /> <br /> Everyone who comes here is watching the film, he said. This is the most meaningless thing I have ever been dissatisfied to watch. DO NOT FILL THIS FILM OR ADD THIS !!!!!
