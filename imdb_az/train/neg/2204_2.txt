I love shark. And mutants. And explosions. <br /> <br /> HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy was supposed to be the best film. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Monster, Power Rangers, has approximately the same rubber movement. It can be a good idea if manufacturers are not quite proud of their designs. That is, for a boy in a large rubber suit on a scroll / scifi / horror rider that can use some of the mystery, sharks often appear on the screen. Naturally, this is generally tremendous and unusual. <br /> <br /> Still, the camera man in the confusion that is a scary thought. <br /> Camera goes to a man to eat, goes with camera shark. The camera is back to buy food, but now it is shouting and sleeveless. And that's why. <br /> <br /> The costume is worse, the player is poor and sub-par special effects, but the writing is bad. Things can happen in a totally random manner so that more people can eat or explode. Because if I tell you, this film is definitely more than the people who went to the explosion = better mindset. Characters hit cars and have a massive explosion. They hit the helicopters, there is a massive explosion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;" > It's a good idea for babies to have a very difficult shark to believe that everybody is thinking about having sex with a woman half a shady shady. That is, this man is a crazy scientist in this film. <br /> <br /> The bad thing is that the movie is casual (and sometimes boring), even its evil is really the long-term interests of the person. MST3K might be a good thing for your friends, but in the past, it happens to catch the bad guy, you give a blessing and change the channel.
