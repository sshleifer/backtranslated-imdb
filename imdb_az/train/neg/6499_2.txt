What a bad mess. <br /> <br /> I saw some time ago with a friend and we both thought ourselves to the miracle of cinema, but that's not certain. <br /> <br /> There are some ideas / concepts that can be a good thing, and of course, some good speeches (under the circumstances), all of which are buried under casual nonsense. Sir Anthony suffered from the same gene on the Natural Born Killers, U Turn, and the same filmmaking scheme, or perhaps watched himself in Nixon for inspiration. <br /> <br /> <strong> Tell him what you want about David Lynch, but at least he often has no way to get mad. <br /> <br /> Says that the film is a joke, all of which implies. It's not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
