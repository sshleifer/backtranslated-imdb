Normally, I will not rent a movie like this because you know it's just bad looking at the box. I've also hired seven films, including Science Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven's New Nightmare Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I came home, I found out that the videotape gave me the wrong band. I found this stupid movie in Wes Craven's New Nightmare box. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredible drilling, the player does not give any meaning to the evil and scheme. It's hard to write a good review because I did not know what the film really was. <br /> <br /> <strong> Max Power from 1 to 10 "I appreciate this movie: 1 <br /> Corrects Korint's look (right at the bottom). Robert Englund , naked horses, etc. The guy who did these things was Mahmoud, played by Julian Mer, not by Robert Englund.
