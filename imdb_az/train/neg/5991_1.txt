ba ba ba ...... this science fiction near the battlefield in the field of dream. Cin francis (aka general hospital's laura) plays a minor role and should also say that this movie should be bad ... In this stinker and in each other I have kingsley (Academy Award winning actors) worthy actors. You have to wonder what they have to do to decide this horrible movie. Music dramatically grows as a dramatic drama. Despite your attention, plot can not be tracked. Impressions are also mediocre and seem really dated. All actors speak directly, and there is no reality in their dialogue. I can tell you how bad this movie is. At least this is not bad with Battlefield Earth, it's funny, but it's just b. Avoid when you do not want to be lulled to bed.
