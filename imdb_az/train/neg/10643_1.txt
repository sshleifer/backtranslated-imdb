Normally I'm a bad fan of eighties and an admirer of the early ninth movie, but this movie is still there ... but this movie was incredibly terrible, it's a real test of tolerance to sit down. Girls dressed like girls were deadly - but never had such intolerance. Corey Haim's performance was as luxurious as ever, Nicole Eggert was not the best. Even though this is the first admirer of an actor / actress in the garbage box, there is no indisputable quality - stay away!
