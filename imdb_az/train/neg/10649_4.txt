Johnny Weissmuller's "King of the Jungle" film, 16 years later, with the role of TARZAN and MERMAIDS, has to disappoint all but the most beloved of its fans. Former Olympiad of the 44-year-old Hollywood's most active "party animal" has long been trained and tired of youthfulness (although he was at a previous point in TARZAN and HUNTRESS). his role was too old; Johnny Sheffield, a quintessential "Boy," (a 17-year-old sheets) grew up in personality, so she wrote in the pretext of "being away from school." Brenda Joyce was still quite sexy at the age of 35 in his fourth film, Jane (Lex Barker was the new Tarzan in TARZAN'S MAGIC FOUNTAIN in 1949 and would have had the transition as it used to be in the past). > <br /> <br /> By Left Loser, a minimal budget product at the RKO, castle and crew enjoyed cheap labor with shooting in Mexico. <br /> <br /> A young adult named Tyrone (Tyrone) says that the future coming of the Power, Linda Christian), when Tarzan rescued from a jungle river, a local high priest (one of the worst of the longest lives in the film) George Zucco) will not make his tender offer to a living "God" by learning that the locals are actually slaves. The girl was chosen to be the "God's" bride, and she ran. Tarzan, then Jane, the colorful Spanish character 'Benjy' (charming John Laurenz, singing several melodies) and a government commissioner, stop God and the priest (behind the poor Cheeta), when the girl was abducted by her relatives' relatives and returned to the island. After a series of discoveries ("God" is just a man in the Aztec Mask, working on a rich pearl bed in the island with a priest in charity), a little fun, funny relief and songs by Benjy, everything, TARZAN and MERMAIDS has a musical score by the brilliant composer Dimitri Tiomkin, and is better than what you expect from this B movie! <br /> <br /> Although the film is less successful than Weissmuller's time at Tarzan's pottery, it will immediately begin playing Jungle Jim, more critical change of Ape Man <br /> <br / Tarzan was buried a few days ago.
