but there are not many of them. Probably the worst "major release" I've ever seen in my life. This is definitely the worst for this year. There is no point in commenting on the field, the castle, or the player. The problem is more than that. Everything that happens on the screen is in dissatisfaction with the dissatisfaction (not necessarily). Why do not you know 1/10 instead of 1/10. Probably according to Steven Martini. He really did try. Bottom line - 95 minutes is washed out of the toilet with several brain cells. Avoid any expense.
