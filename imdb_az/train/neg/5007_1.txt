There is no reason to see this movie. The idea of ​​a good field is very bad. Everything changes in the middle of the film and nothing is meaningless there. The cause of the crimes is not disclosed. The player is strange. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. He was good in the bedroom, but here he is scared. Amber Benson from Buffy should change the symbol of a day. Even those who enjoy sex and violence will be disappointed. Although the movie is only about 80 minutes long, it's too short (but so long) for a good movie, there are no deleted scenes on DVD, so they will never be worried about missing the missing parts of the characters. /> <br /> Do not waste time this time.
