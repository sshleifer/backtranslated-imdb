My friends did not know what to expect in this movie, but they were hoping for the best. When we left, we had a little more informed about what the film was really doing. Although the worst movie I've ever seen, I definitely do not recommend spending money to see in theaters. <br /> <br /> If a movie is very strange, you know that you do not know how long it is, maybe a friend has a rent for you (not even for rent costs) <br /> <br /> In the last five minutes , it is impossible to say much about defense. <br /> <br /> I think the film is worth more than you expect, and some shots were good, but all of this was dumped down with a dirty structure and poor scripts. <br /> <br /> This movie is not so bad that after leaving, I went and bought a ticket to see a good movie just to clear my mind. I advise you to take the first step and see a good movie instead.
