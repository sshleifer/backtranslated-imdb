Josh Hartnett's dead eyes, bold writing and Harrison Ford friendly-police comedy! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But their real gold age, and in the 1990s. It's a good idea to make Hollywood the person who wants to mix himself with the police and mix it with comedy, but the latter result is not at least a sixth consciousness, but a reason to ask God for mercy to God <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <strong> Past movies are the same, but the worst was larger than Hollywood Crimes. <br /> <br /> What happened to this entertaining formula? Things have not been the same for all ten years. You will have a stubborn flop that you are looking for each other. I was delighted with some of the issues to cripple you: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky & Hutch - 2004) (Miami Vice - 2006)! <br /> <br /> I believe that one of the reasons is the natural state of decades after many cinematographic films and television shows. Particularly add to it, deal with negligence and dull humor. In fact, this time is a completely unbearable matter. Yes, we found the backdrop of two loyal police and guilty cities with a second job, but what's new? Not about clich√©; <br /> <br /> Dear Hartnett, especially the player (Hartnett), is a terrible thing. This man is a comedian (or actor!). Her character wanted to take revenge for her father's death! Take revenge on yourself, he probably died without following your players! Even smaller roles have people who have nothing to do with comedy (or it's not what's here!). <br /> <br /> The director is unsuccessful when giving something funny or tough, some parts are boring at a high level (thanks to the lack of black boy); It's a rare time to be bored with the possibility of moving / comedy! Hollywood did not use itself as an Irish place with an ugly face behind the superficial attraction, or as a place filled with shining or falling stars (a few exciting moments). <br /> <br /> This is a very easy movie that can be viewed only by the glamor of the stars and is shown as a Buddy-cop movie, and one of them will end up as one of the worst cases of non-chemistry on the screen with one of the two on the screen itself. Who is it?) And Buddy-Cop destroyer more than the movie! God, I can not live enough to testify to me or my children (Hollywood Crimes Part 2)! Finally, watch Harrison Ford's performance, wanted a good time, but at least we did not.
