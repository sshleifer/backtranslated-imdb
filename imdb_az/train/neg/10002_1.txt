We apologize to everyone, I know this should have been a "art" film, but woe, people should have given weapons in balance, so that people can shut their eyes out of the brain. Although the scene design and photography direction are excellent, this story is very painful to watch. The absence of voice is cruel. The difficulties were long. How long can you watch two people sitting and chatting? Especially when the two people complained about the dialogue. I really only had a hard time with this movie. The performances were perfect, but how much can you get from these dark, challenging, acne? The only thing that loved me was Maureen Stapleton and his red dress and dance scene. Otherwise it was part of Bergma. And I'm no fan. I think everyone who says that they enjoy more than 1 1/2 hours lying good.
