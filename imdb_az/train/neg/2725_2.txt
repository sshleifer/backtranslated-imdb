Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (like Frank Cooper) US-Mexico "Border Cop". The young immigrant Danny De La Paz (like Benny Romero) is a father figure who wants to be the best man in the future marriage of Mr Savalas. Savalas is tough, but boss Eddie Albert (like Commander Moffat) can be tougher. What is harder than the smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (like Chico Suarez) should stop. <br /> <br /> If you hear about the loss of Kojak and Oliver Douglas's resignation, you need to get out of the "Border". If you do not, you can not be a stomach for the "real" cow's scene. Although not valued, De La Paz and Cecilia Camacho (like Leina) play the show. <br /> <br /> Frontier (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
