The re-team of director Kevin Connor and the hero of the wannabe action / romantic lead Doug McClure, founded in Japan, in this ghost story. In the 1970s, they achieved a moderate success, "Land of Time forgotten" (1975), "On the Earth" (1976) and others. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a 19th century prologue. The Samurai kills his wife and lover before committing suicide. <br /> <br /> One step forward is to introduce a family visiting Ted & Laura and visiting a home where the tragedy happened. <br /> <br /> No surprises on what happens next, spirits of the dead seize new residents with family friend Alex (McClure). <br /> <br /> Everything is inevitable (but surprisingly low) along with the elegance and grace of elegance and elegance elephants. The main points of interest are love-scenes featuring two weak decapitas ('Omen' has a lot to answer to encourage it as a standard set of horror) and doe-eyed but very kinky Susan George. First, the inspired piece of "Look Now" has been completed with piano music for many years; the latter with McClure is very short (likely to be persuaded), as well as extremely worrying. <br /> <br /> Every cloud has a silver lining and both scenes, so it does not lose anything. <br /> <br /> Generally, the "House of the House Distributed" is fun to garbage, an unexpected trash, or a masochistic way. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> If you are not in the genre, there is nothing here, but horror it is enough to provoke a strange nudity smile for his fans and to provoke the nod to the desire to make an effort. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another area where the BEST, the big, black, tree climbing, Japanese forced metal crabs show would be stealing. Although they are on the legendary family meal scene, her daughter is caught up in the soup, where she is seen as a respected head. When he sees this appearance, he asks how much soup (!!!!) before saying an immortal line "There's a terrible face in the river." If this is not enough, answer "Eat soup for C'mon, Daddy." Laurel & Hardy rests on the piece.
