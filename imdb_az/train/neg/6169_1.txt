Nekeddo Buraddo also sounded as terrifying as the admirer of the horrors, especially J-horror. I studied the area, read the reviews, and looked at some photographs to make sure that it looked like a good hero and scary movie to watch before downloading. It ended in anxiety and was eager to panic and was frightened when I was awaiting an incredible fear. Hell was ridiculous and even illogical and unexcused, but then horrible, and what was the effect of cartoon style sound effects? He must have imagined that it was the only thing that was cautious about it. I did not understand the idea of ​​the cactus, nor did the mothers' husbands disappear in the middle of the sea after the blinking light, or perhaps I missed it unless I really understood what I was seeing. I thank you for this; Shock and a few scenes (strange cannibalism and their mother's kissing), of course, have just dropped a bit, and even worse as they think, it's unsatisfactory, more convincing than the comedy. In my opinion, it's a horror. But this is a very funny movie and I have many laughs from me and a few friends, but, unfortunately, we were expecting to be afraid of the comedy, which is worth the look of its entertainment, but it's a dark, terrible and terrifying movie; you will only be disappointed. If this was a comedy / spoof of scare, I would probably appreciate the ninth part, when a husband's wife climbed into the stomach and tied his wounds, it was a strange scene, but I felt sorry for it.
