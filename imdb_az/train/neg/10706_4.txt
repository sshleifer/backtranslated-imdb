Wow and I thought that every Steven Segal movie was bad. Every time I think that the film will not worsen, it has proven wrong. The story was good, but the actors could not erase it. Archaeological excavations also made a lot of mistakes. For example, they do not believe that they are crafting and belonging to them. The cast was the largest criminal archieve girl. She felt a weak actress and her actress felt really after the movie had become more realistic. The whole concept of the temp knights of underground throughout these years seemed to me very foolish. I really liked how he lost me and thought things he almost seemed to be suffering. I thought the heroes were not good enough. You are no longer able to find rooted information and it is difficult to link them.
