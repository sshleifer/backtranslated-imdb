... this is the only way to describe the film with loyal subjects: scandal, gender, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst plays the role of a quiet movie star, Marion Davies, as he thinks it is "Legitimate Blush". The man playing William Randolph Hearst overtakes the screen and switches to the point where you want to swallow. Eddie Izzard is very good, only Charlie Chaplin plays, and oh, is it too heavy for part of 125 lbs? It was difficult to believe that Peter and Bogdanovic were in control of this difficult and unbearable accident, but he still did not have to wait for a movie. 30 years? Sometimes, we do not come back.
