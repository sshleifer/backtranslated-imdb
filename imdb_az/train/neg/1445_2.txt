OK. He did not film a bad movie if he was not from an original script. <br /> <br /> What does Haggard's producers, directors and writers do not understand, and what is part of this story called "No woman except Foulata and Gagoola"? I want to say that this is a pretty straight Englishman. When I was 10, I understood! The beauty of the CSR has a spectacular description of the hidden and isolated kingdom of the three different worlds, Colonial Africa, the ruthless desert and the Kukuanaland. This should be sufficient enough for manufacturers to be the most mediocre. But, nooo, they need to throw "romance." Disappointing. Indeed, offering all the evil spirits who think this book will be close. Take delivery. A Peter Jackson comes to the wannabe and can keep you reading again until it's "right". BTW, there is an after-book, Allan's wife (actually a pre-quel). It gives a story to quatermain. A little creepy, but good.
