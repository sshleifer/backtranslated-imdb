Okay, I'm bored and I decided to see this movie. But I think that the main thing that the film brought was a one-hour picture, then it was mostly repeated 4 times the same time. It consists of: 1. Collecting troops and discussing the attack plan, 2. Jealousy to their spouses. 3. A Long Line Approach to the Troops 4. The student and the filmmaker are the three survivors. 5. Calling to explain the defeat of the enemy and its success 6. Women return and perform a 10-minute song. The main film was the same, and the same order of events occurred about 4 or 5 times. and every time she began to see these women, she was the man, then her husband and she would show him. It was about 10 people or more, so it took a bit of a ton. In addition, men could not kill their enemies, except with bayonets or grenades. The music was very enjoyable and the move was great, although the movement was repeated. Generally, I would probably see it again, but not very afraid.
