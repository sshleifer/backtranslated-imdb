Here we are reaching two travelers from a far-off futuristic world: one is on a hopeless mission that protects lives, and secondly, is an inhumane criminal machine that is designed to overcome a woman who will be the savior of all races <br /> <br /> So, what can we say about the murder machine? It is almost like a kind of destroyer, or eradicator, ... as a destroyer or something. What are the words I am looking for ... things - things to do? Hmmmm .... <br /> In any case, the hero (who slipped through the blue tunic from Luke Skywalker, using a local dress) first finds a young woman and becomes her future born hero. Bad uhhhh ... "exterminator" tries to find a woman by killing some rednecks and stealing weapons and clothes, then visiting around the place and asking around around by taking a look at his name threatening people's danger. <br /> <br /> Then begins a desperate race for survival as the visible deadly and can not be switched off the "eliminating" couple around the village. At some points you can get boots and motorcycles, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, in an exciting finale, they will try to break them down under the wheels of a large tanker truck. .. Pickles. Then the truck will collapse. They will be saved ... but not! He will become stronger as usual. <br /> <br /> Perhaps he will kill the fever and take his daughter to the meat factory. At a terrific finish, he pushed a large piece into a chopping machine in the industry and once destroyed it all. <br /> <br /> I'm dealing with so many things ... Dear Protector, I kissed Sean Young at a bar and kissed him in a bar, and then I say that the child will be born in 3 days. <br /> <br /> These suits and effects are great in this movie ... When I first saw them at Star Trek, I liked it for the first time: The Next Generation! Sean Young is a big turn as a failed Replicant, and his career is sweaty at Stephen Baldwin as the Young Fat Cop Girlfriend Board. Perhaps he is importing from another James Cameron movie?
