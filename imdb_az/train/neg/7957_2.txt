Who is In twin cities, from Monday to Friday, there is a station showing the "Big Bad Film". Tonight's puppet, Carrie Fisher, said "My son" is about a really annoying woman who ended up killing her while entering her house. Bea (Beatrice) comes back to follow her husband. She wants to take revenge on her murders, "she is back." And he will not let it rest without doing so. It irritates her ... and the audience! This movie is really one of the worst films I've ever seen. Hey, I love bad movies, though (my fave movie Xanadu). When I was interested in those who thought it would be a good idea, I shook my head throughout the movie. Bea is just too boring. The area is foolish; moving is also bad; the story ... well, let it be my driving. Anyway, if you want to see a really bad movie - a really bad movie, check it out. You will not be disappointed. Heh.
