I'm insulting this movie, it's not funny ... And "Mulan" was incredible! Even though my expectations were low, I still did not think it would be so stereotypical. <br /> <br /> Indeed, there is no respect for Hollywood tradition of any random martial arts for Chinese culture. <br /> <br /> I appreciate that they are trying to turn Wendy into a normal teenage girl ... But, fortunately, most young girls, especially young Asian girls, are less likely to be less disadvantaged in life. And from a cultural point of view, it is almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are popular and fashionable, but they are quite rare. Even there are still very worthy scholars. Maybe it's another stereotype, but it's the truth. How Chinese parents work. Chinese values ​​are in this business. If they wanted to go for originality, they had become Wendy with a girl who hated love with glasses and with her family. <br /> <br /> This is the face of American movies. Asian culture is not clever, meditation and indefinable, nature-friendly expressions. We will not always smile longingly and know some kind of martial arts. We would like to thank you if you write a part of Asia that someone does not describe as a sad cartoon and somebody else.
