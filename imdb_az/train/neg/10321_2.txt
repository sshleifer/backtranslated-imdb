This show is terrible, all the jokes are terrible and simply deteriorating and deteriorating. I am one of those people who have never been a big fan of the corner gas, but at least I liked the environment in the second half of the season, all the jokes were played and the characters did not give them anything. Initially at least Corner gas was good, the Little Mosque in Prairie is a charming CBC comedy, since there is nothing going from episode 1. People who follow this show will be honest, who are the elderly or maybe just really people living in Praidies? Maybe jokes for them and they work there? I do not know a person who loves this show and can not stand on me, jokes are completely predicted and characters are less developed than Corner Gas. Hopefully, this will not last long because this show is based on the basis of this demonstration, which shows that all success is totally different to me and can lead to a great show.
