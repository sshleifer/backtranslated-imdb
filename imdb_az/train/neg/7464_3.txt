I did not watch the whole movie. He could not watch the entire film. <br /> <br /> I do not want Mafia movies both tragic and funny and Corki Romano. it can only be described as a tragic attempt in the mafia comedy. <br /> <br /> Problem Corky Romano simply looks as an excuse to move Chris Kattan (Corky) to the field, trying hard to make the audience laugh, from one field to another. Corky himself is totally overplayed and does not have the subtlety or honesty - all of his strange mannerisms are found to be controversial - Chris Kattan makes a clear 'move' instead of a role - the story goes right. Each scene can be completely predicted, and the "comedy event" that will take place on the set after each scene is presented. The catastrophic catastrophe in comedies such as Mr. Bean is funny because you can associate the character with the motivation and the beginning, and the character's end is not telegraphic. <br /> <br /> Scarcely, he only feels deliberate shot by a hopeless attempt to make a laugh from the audience. <br /> If Chris did not play such an external character, his film was not completely explained and his comedy scenes were not unpredictable and stereotyped - all the jokes were familiar) this movie could be watched. But it is not. Do not follow.
