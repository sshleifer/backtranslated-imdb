That's shame! Another beautiful Muppet was comfortable with a beer hanging on a nightclub and a poodle with a popcorn bag. What went? Disappointed! Muppets, how can this great Christmas Carol? This humor was terrible, the songs were worse than the country and west (and that said something) and it was mixed and poor like Blind Pew. The main problem I think is Treasure Island's attempt is quite small. A short tale, like Christmas Carol, is perfect, because we can tackle such defects around the Muppet. Where does the muppets go? What is the Muppets Oz Wizard?
