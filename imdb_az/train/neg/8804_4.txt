Great CGI effects and truly Oscar-worth performance by Gary Sinise, such as L. Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is the only trick pony in this film because the best actor in this film is Oscar's murder on Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> This film is a pardiferous betrayal of the baby boom generation, with the right-wing prejudices directly hidden from Forrest's service in Vietnam, starting with a "resolution" with the Jenny all the way. <br /> <br /> Along with this, it's a fun and American movie. Some parts of the film were quite offensive, and Zemeckis almost dropped this movie down to Gump. . <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and ask yourself: "How does Robert Zemeckis connect a good American?" <br /> <br /> Forrest has made the "right" choice in the last 45 years and appears "in the right place at the right time". Those who are wrong with the regime's vision are paying a heavy price. Zemeckis said he was a patriot, even american, of masked innocence and naivety.
