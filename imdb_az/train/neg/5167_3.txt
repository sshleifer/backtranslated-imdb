I would rate this movie with 3 skulls, just knowing how the girls were screaming, that could be a better movie, if the actors were good, the twins were good, I believed it was bad, but my biggest and smallest brother really avoided bad deeds, spoiler: why are they freezing if they are vampires? Vampires will not be able to drink frozen blood, and the film says that when he is alive he drinks ... but then when they go to another house, they are taken to a frozen bloody refrigerator. end of spoiler <br /> <br /> It was a big deal at that time and I was told how big this movie is, how many awards this film has won, and how it's going to be!
