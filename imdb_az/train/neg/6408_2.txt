Although the animation quality was Looney Toons, the beginning of the Disney and MGM, NPA films were surprisingly appreciated by the IMDb. Unfortunately, the UPA style (debut in 1950s) began to dominate in the last 50s and 60s, due to increased costs for the preparation of cartoons with high square rates and favorite backgrounds. For all this, filming was cheap, and they took several Oscars to prove that the animated films are the main point. Thus, the unhappy animation turned into a norm, and this trend was reversed until the 1980s. <br /> <br /> This UPA movie is one of the first. The symbols are very easily drawn (they are more straightforward and they use the stick figures), and the backgrounds were ugly - extra simple colored illustrations in color (very often and rarely by filling the items with a sponge). <br /> <br /> As for the story, it is an animated story with a strong jazz style. Someone will love it, others will find it to be very high and at a very high level. Traditional "Frankie and Johnny" story and shots, and for all, this is a great movie for children. Heck, animation and jazz are a particularly good movie for me! Some will read my gaze and, of course, I think I'm a crank. But I like cartoons very much and some of this minimalist UPA style goes a long way and you can not accept them as seriously artistic works - just too, very fast. Do not see the Oscars and try to watch some classic cartoon or something else!
