In my time I've seen a better teenage wolf movie, but it gets a sack. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" cheese-festival "c". Star quality in this movie is not bad. Simply, this path is sent to slide down. Adam Arkin plays Toni, an American middle-aged 50-year-old American footballer, due to a worm-bite lover in Transylvania. The violent part of the film was a violin player. He was battling everyone! Ed McMahon plays his ultra conservative father, who meets the end of his bullet. Adam's father, Alan, plays an unusual appearance of his game. After all these years, Tony looks out of the ground for the attack and then gets the chance to keep his position. Laughing more than the blood is spilled, this movie is a beginning of the 80s, "Teen Wolf" became a development! 1 of 5 stars.
