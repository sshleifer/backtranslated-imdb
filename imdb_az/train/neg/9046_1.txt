Now he is a very weak story for the truth - a common trash for a Walt Disney movie. When Robinson appeared, I was shocked at how bad the whole movie was. Wrong went wrong as "alice in Wonderland!" It feels as if they are mixed together to break down and throw away ideas with a little strange garbage, and they will not do it. Then I sat there and wished to end. My younger brother has lost interest in the half way and is involved in the story. The characters are weak and you do not pay attention when the robinsons appear, you just want the movie to end. Forget a movie and quickly forget it. If you have some spare time, do not waste it on this.
