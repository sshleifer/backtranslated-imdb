This movie was really boring, except for the music I really love, so what's the point of making that movie, anyone who reads this movie will not watch this movie, it's a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emraan can move, but it's really miserable. It was really bad in this movie, especially as I am ashamed to be one of the fans in this movie. <br /> <br /> Celina does not have the ability to act in the movie, she can not move, and she has no sense to be in this movie, but the other girl is as good as Radha, but it would be good. <br /> <br /> When is the loss? Get great music and watch this movie.
