I think Danny Dyer is my favorite and Gillian Anderson is a talented actress. The start was interesting. I like the relationship between the two stars. He then jumped to the main pit that was attacked by a strange group, and Dyer was beaten heavily when Anderson was raped. They then decide to take revenge. Sounds good, right? Yes, that's not it. The story is drill and side-by-side, and certain things are really strange. I will not give any details, but everything will happen so I do not want to see anything. I love to give all the movies a doubt, and I really wanted to do something like this. It just did not work. I gave him 3 out of 10, mostly for the player.
