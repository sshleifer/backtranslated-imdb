I did that in the test exams. Everyone can say: what ... hell? This movie plays smoothly as Mickey Mouse reads scripts for "Scarface". It is strange to do something small in this sense; <br /> <br /> Steve Irwin, his wife, tries to keep the crocodile "recommended". a CIA forecast. <br /> <br /> After coming to return Ireland to CIA Ireland, Irwin makes them mistaken for poachers and calls them to "stop". <br /> <br /> It's about the whole story; The rest of the Australian culture is lampooning ("Didja see dat?" and "Crikey!") and strange choreographic action sequences. At one point, Irwin fights with a CIA agent over a fast RV and knife fight. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin fights with a knife on a RV above the knife. This is a guide for this ridiculous film.
