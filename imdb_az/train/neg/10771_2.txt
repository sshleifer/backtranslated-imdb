For several years, I have not watched children's films, so when I go out for the first time, "Come tigers here". I did not even see the Bad News Bears when I worked for the guys who worked for the movie "Warriors", "Who Will Be King" and others working on the Rocky Horror Picture Show in the 1970s? ) Now I check old or small movies and love to find people who have come to a great career, even though they are less than early films. When I stayed in this movie for a few minutes, he could not get more and jumped to the last credits to see if he was a young actor going to bigger and better things - at least watching his appearance, he did not do the trick or acting. Well, I read Wes Craven's name as credit and electricity. He has made two or three early shockers, but Freddie Krueger did not create or create "Scream". Maybe he owed a bounty and this piceline helped. More surprisingly, Fred J. Lincoln was dubbed "Aesop" as a ridiculous character in the film. F.J. Lincoln, just 70 years old, appeared and produced adult movies. He was related to the juvenile "The Ozporns", and this title is more than just the attempts of all the "Tigers" that combine in humor. Despite the fact that an adult actor is putting on a child's film, show how the people who film this movie are asleep on the wheel.
