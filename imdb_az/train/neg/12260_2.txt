Sometimes I am resting my head, and I think about the reasons why films about killer sharks and / or crocodiles are still being used these days. Since the 1970s, these nude "jaws" have been made, not like they did something better. The idea is still the same. That is, there is an animal that kills people. First, it throws some mid-level characters, and then basically, starting with attacking the main characters playing a few nobody, except the one who is slightly more popular than experts. One of the main symbols is that others die before they kill animals directly, usually with an explosion. Then, we usually say that the animal is still alive or has an egg, and so on. We get the last shot they see. "Krocodylus" basically uses the same fundamental ideas and does nothing to make a little change. If you do not think "specialist" is a captain in this variation, then your standards are pretty low. It's funny that Duncan Regehr plays as he used to be completely Zorro. I'll give you a bonus point for that.
