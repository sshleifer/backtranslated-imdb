Like Pulp Fiction, you should love this movie as your favorite and hand-held cameras. I think ("I think that Pulp Fiction is the most-made film ever since" The English Patient "), and I liked the story, which was interested in finding realities, but interesting. It is not "on the shore" or "Citizen Kane" and is loaded with European fruits. But the worst part is the handheld camera. I saw that you waited anxiously for the movie to end. I do not think the bigger the directors are the bigger the method of filming. If you are inclined to motion sickness, stay away, the hand-held camera will have nausea in about 10 minutes.
