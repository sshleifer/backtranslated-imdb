This film has reached a low point in human relationships by the Brothers Brothers. Remember, those who use words such as "art work" when considering this film were not to be dragged into the mountaineers and not to shoot films on some eccentric people. No, they were forced to finance their projects when they found these two poor poverty people (and imagine that they were telling people to sell their money to the project). Then they became friends with two very sensitive women. Here is a mind meeting or a lack of real agreement. These unhappy Mays smiled, kissed donkeys, doing everything necessary to collaborate with Beales and deliberately exploit them. One would like to think that these hustlers were sometimes thought of conscience and guilt. But the filmmaking process, planning, actual shooting and then editing has taken a lot of time and their purpose has not really had any effect on people like Beales. The exploitation film made by the most sly people. According to their calculations, filming was seriously painted with their work here. They are exposed to their reputation as a human being. People will remember them. Grotesque hustlers.
