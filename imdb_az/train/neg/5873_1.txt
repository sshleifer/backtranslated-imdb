I did not know they were thinking. They did not even tell anyone about this disaster. I saw very bad movies, I saw really bad movies, and then it got. When writing the screenplay, he was forced to show what would be the most promising dialogue on writing. This is not a good thing for the film, either technically or at any other point of view. it should have been released. There are just a few well-known names in this movie. In fact, I'm afraid to use the word of the movie rather than a random set of scenes that does not belong to another and less than 0 sense.anyway I have never seen anyone with any dignity. It was really cheap, and if I had taken this movie for free, I still got torn. I'm still fallen. 0/10
