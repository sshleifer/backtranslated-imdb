This is a recurring horrible thing. I went to see this night. The first day I waited and my heart was too much to handle. But in the first half hour we knew it was a catastrophe. It does not fit the created creature, but insults the original blockbuster. The scenario had gaps, and there was little improvement. An excellent player, Mohanlal, did a good job. Amitabh was good ... The director wanted to describe how bad his character was, but he led a strong conclusion. Ajay was particularly disappointed with this role. Even the new man does not let you start on Prashant. It is not proud to start a career with such a thing. Rajpal Yadav, who was thrown into a laugh, could not smile anybody for the sounds of great humor and noise. Nika Kotari proved to be one of our worst actresses today. In general, I thought RGV was one of India's most talented and talented actors. He has taken on such a great challenge and responsibility for re-creating and removing the best Indian films.
