... but I'm not one of them. Caro Diario could have been watched for at least a third, but the dull and abnormal part of the movie tasted us in this unusual self-confident confusion. Moretti thinks he needs to do this, but he feels the audience should stay with it, but he really does not want it. Film about Italian politics and elections may be of interest, but this is not a movie. At one point, Moretti and his friends stood outside the headquarters of the Communist Party, discussing their talks with party leaders, but we will not see anything in this movie as a feature of this film. The events that led to the birth of a boy that Moretti had associated with political sabotage and the subsequent baby film take place with the baby, and then baby Pietro (the film will drag us through the election for several years and more). We look forward to seeing some decisive sequences or consistent arguments, but never come. Undoubtedly, I can still be patient to sit down with Nanni Moretti. Succeeding for an hour and twenty minutes seems like eternity.
