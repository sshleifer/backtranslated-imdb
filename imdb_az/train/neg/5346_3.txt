I had to watch this movie because the terrain was very angry and the movie was up to expectations. In fact, this time it is a very disturbing review. Unlike other Meyer films, sexual ants are minimized. Several scenes of violence are unnecessarily empty and insulting. <br /> <br /> This movie is sad and some players and lines are in fears. <br /> <br /> Film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy that is a cruel and immoral window of slavery and is unsuccessful in all counts. Meyer tried to prepare for sexual exploitation with a higher moral message. Meyer knows they are guilty of admitting that Susan was showing a provocative outfit by a dazzling dominatrix call from the early stage. Then he turns into a film about the pinnacle of evil against evil, trying to return to the righteous path. But you can not end it because nothing can do away with each other. <br /> <br /> Because in so many ways, you really appreciate the art of casting a horrible film in a really bad movie. possible dad Perhaps it is so bad that Meyer falls into an unacceptable situation.
