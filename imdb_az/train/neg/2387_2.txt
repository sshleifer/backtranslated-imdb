I did not believe how smart and meaningless this was. Basically, there is nothing to laugh in the movie, there is no hard scene to deal with in the rest of the film. This movie drew some great stars, but in my opinion they were frustrated. In my opinion, Keanu Reeves had to take some action lessons a few years before watching The Matrix. Uma Thurman looked very simple and modest. Fortunately, I bought this movie for a very low price, because of course, it does not memorize it for any good reason. I will not write anything about the film's story, but as you know, it's meant to be the most famous horseman in America because of his big thumb. I'll give this movie 2/10. Before watching this movie, I wondered if this movie fell to only 4.0 / 10 and now I know why. A very thrilling film. If you see under 5 TL, do not buy it.
