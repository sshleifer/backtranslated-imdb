I do not know, this movie was on my shelf for a while at the Mill Creek Collection and I decided to watch it one night; though I do not expect much. I was surprised that this film was made under the footage of Filmirage while circulating around the loans that began first. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker brought wonderful stinkers to the world such as "Troll 2", "Nailless Ator" and "Search for the Great Sword", and I had to watch. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is about to be quite decent, even if it's illegal. Gore's scenes were extended and more frequently improved. After a while, I started to drag into the movie quickly and I thought myself "Well someone else was killed better" or "One better mutation". At the start of this drag, when I lived these ideas, some of them may have been killed or mutated, but as we have noted, unhappiness and impact were not very good. The situation was even worse, scene transitions were confusing; For example: Dr Houseman would first of all be in Zoo, then there was a flash of killing one, finally waking up in the bed - a "zoopark?" To the audience. <br /> <br /> Hussein Hussein's character was pretty good, but we did see the doctor's metamorphosed end to the end of the film, and I hope you'll laugh - it's the only reason to see this movie at least once; <br /> <br /> I hope Huseyn Huseynov says that this film is inevitable as a long joke. <br /> <br /> Doctor Houseman's suit is Joe D 'Amato'nun "The Sword of the Sword" in the same year. You must love Filmirage movies, always reuse the same things!
