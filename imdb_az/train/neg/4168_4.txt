Yes, this movie started out funny, but it soon became worse. I thought it would be more 'adult-oriented' humor based on the first few minutes, but then the movie was a great way to Disney Channel, especially into a long-running go-kart racing scene. Alana De La Garza is fabulous, but has really fake Italian accent. The film looked at a very independent and low budget and sounded. It was a very favorite moment I'll just call the serenading scene, but it was generally a yawner. Laughs are too small and far away. The last surprise for "Mr. Fix It" is so ridiculous, and I'm worse than anything else. You can keep it for free or TV, but do not waste your money to buy or rent this movie.
