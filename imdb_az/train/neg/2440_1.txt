Koen Wouters is a flamboyant singer and presenter. At the beginning of the nineties, he had his hand tested on his chest. But this incredible piece ended the actress's career once and for all. In addition, the acting actress of the Dutch actress Nada van Nie, a television presenter and software developer, has also ended. I really saw this (almost empty) theater, Koen Wouters, because I'm an admirer of the Clouseau band. I spend a lot of money on it. It is a cheap, seemingly terrible story and it's done in every bad way. Some people think that's bad. I'm not one of them. I just had incredible time and money.
