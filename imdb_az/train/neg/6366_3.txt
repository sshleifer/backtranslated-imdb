There was no single retreat factor in this film. My girlfriend and I love action movies. Especially fighting scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer were awesome), but this movie was not fun. Five-minute action, followed by twenty minutes to talk and "angry" facial expressions. The main hero is a troublesome character who is fighting and therefore is always sidelined. The army broke the bowel movement to improve combat methods. Music is also not good. They fight against the streets' rap and hip-hop style because these guys are rebels. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is classic B-style. Actors deliver their own lines as they read from the beacons, and the lines themselves should be burned and burned on some rotten Hollywood roads. The film is called "Honor", but there is no honor in filming. <br /> <br /> This is just what I consider globally simply a waste of money and spending money. <br /> Look at Felon instead. Scenarios and scenes are more realistic.
