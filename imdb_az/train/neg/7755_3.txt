Three giant sabretooth tigers (the "genetic breakthrough" derived from a fossil material created in a laboratory from mitochondrial DNA) may be accidentally associated with a number of events (eg virus infected by a computer geek to unlock a security lock) the security guard is open to a door while looking for a page missing from a porn legacy from a knife that threatens the lives of those who are in contact with them). Tigers are always hungry, but they do not break their food. Almost tigers have just torn the predators. Victims include a group of college children (a gothic girl from stereotypes, jokes and technology nerd), security guards, and slightly offensive accusations that easily humiliate and await a horrible death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " And when the last death sequence is so ugly presented, you will demand time in the deepest ghosts of your soul, which is really a horrible exercise in the canon of life. There are some good humorous humor that comes from the head to the neck, but the prosthetic work here is true. Prosthetic body parts and sacrifices as a result of bloodshed, crying for help, and ignoring anyone. I'm starting to sound like a broken record, repeating myself in every user comment I wrote for these intelligence channels. Maybe it's time to go to another cinema. Robert Carradine plays a role as a ruthless businessman who is an obscure attraction of a resort / zoo with genetically-created sabretooth tigers, a "Primal Park" opened by a truly attractive old brother, Nicholas Bell.Stacy Haiduk is still incredibly yummy, Brian Wimmer is Haiduck's lover and his role is an efficient mechanical storage operation. <br /> <br /> Bell's fate is a fortune-teller Carradine's film, Bell, produces a great deal of its arch nemesis, showing the brightest color when it moves toward them.The film eventually dropped out of the dark corridors (cut off the nerve virus) and is concerned about their safety.The college students commit to hit certain items (.. a scavenger hunt type) and enter into a fraternity / alarm. The player playing these children does not climb the clich√©s.
