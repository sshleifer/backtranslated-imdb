I can not be a great admirer of the original Creepshow, but his stupid continuation makes the anthology look like perfection! And think of this is going into waiting for this one more time. Five years after his predecessor, George Romero EC is back in the comical style of the comic style, giving the scenes for Steve King's three stories. However, the direction is given to Michael Gornick. The film extends in this aspect, largely by Gornik, with unequal brushes. But most of the sin will have to go through Romero's terrible static and intolerable scripts (especially in the first and last story). Moralist messages (primarily a symbol of fury) simply took the black humor. Oh, it was painful and it is possible to say about the liveliest musical account accompanying the picture. Three tales (Old Chef Tree, Raft and Hitchhiker) are a great, exciting, and exciting story story created in the form of nostalgia (80s) animation. I love this segment very much, and the sense of slackening was bright. <br /> <br /> The first story, "The Old Chief Wooden Head," sees a two-year-old owner of a common store, George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour, in a deceased local community. He was killed by a few punks living in Hollywood and eventually killed. There is a wooden statue of a Indian chief, who came to rescue his children from the front of the store. <br /> <br /> - Look at the eyes of George Kennedy .. And wait 10 minutes for your loyalty to 'great' union. It's a great time with a nice touch. Yes, like Kennedy's speeches, it is a colorless and overlapping substance that does not come well to this beautiful place. The writing is straightforward and the performances are straightforward. These two factors really add our headaches. When the Indian colonies come and go suddenly, goons face the right (even strange) death. Impressions were spectacular, but what was the free flowing hair? How could Hollywood beat the hair? Ugh! <br /> <br /> The second floor is "Raft", which consists of yahoo teenagers who smoke smoke cigarettes and a sea lake. In the middle of the lake, the storm is trapped on the platform because of a dark-looking creature hiding in the water after swimming. <br /> <br /> It's better, it's better. What you started after your main youngsters are running away is becoming a mysterious, creepy structure filled with dense and claustrophobic tensions. And such a nudity or fierce bounce will not blaze. It is very ill, and it is also a sense of humor. It's a strikingly ironic end-to-end touch. Speeches from the dots can be taken without a big sign. Gornik's direction is bent over bad and very delicate. Despite this, the exciting musical score on this occasion dashed the right chords. The sludge-like creatures on the lake (as we have often mentioned) are seen as a black chimney floating in the water (the only one you read!). <br /> <br /> Finally, the number three ends with The Hitchhiker. A rich, but sexually explicit woman is delayed when she goes home with her male gigolo. When it comes to thinking about some of the ideas to explain its delay, he runs off the road and crashes by mistake. Instead of supervising and checking, she hopes to come home to her husband. <br /> <br /> The killed bus driver was killed by the funeral. <br /> <br /> - I was not terribly absurd, but we did not really enter this funny laughing exercise. Compared to the first two, this tone was very different and instead tried to curl funny bones. Lois Chiles was a good starter, but it was a pity that the constant security and the little conversations with her were painful and tired. Live make-up effects are well illustrated and visually intravenous. When it comes to fighting, it is cheerful, cheesy, and overlapping. From now on, we repeat and repeat the dead autogalter in infinite terms? and repeat the line, "Thanks for your wife's wife!" This happens every time you decide to manage yourself. There is some courtesy for the dead. In general, the second short story "The Raft" and the unpleasant, well-imagined effect of this is extremely low.
