<br /> <br /> I attended one of the last nights and got the following observations: <br /> 1. Because you manage a tone music video, you are not qualified to make a movie. There were many shots in the film that could create no sense, horrible angles, and terrible lights. The arrangement did not help this evil. <br /> <br /> When Dixie is late for memorial service, her mother speaks, but does not clarify what the conversation is. <br /> <br /> The site had a say, but the scenario was thin and Ford Truck was full of dimensional holes. We can not understand what drives the characters, what is behind the conflicts with each other, or how they are solved. For eight days at a distance of 4 days, it is literally erased by magic. The deep conversations were broken by foolish clichés. (In fact, the whole city was a big cliché of southern life.) Toby's "Either he fled inside your blood vessels," half of the audience cried ... we treated the insipid line, but not once. !! Openings were falsified and dramatically confessed until they were "stupid and stubborn". 3. Imagine that they should be able to work. Toby was dark and pulled most of the film, but when she smiled and was illuminated, she was attractive. This is shameful because it does not have more time screens. Kelly Preston's moving sticks are quite rusty and show. Lindsay Haun is a talented writer and writers do not blame the writer for blasphemy because he did not have such a thing at the beginning. Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper could do more of this movie, but they still had little or no loss. (And really their characters are missing in this movie!) 4. If you're a Toby fan, you'll love songs. But often I felt like a scene that the film is just like one of its songs - or in its sound recordings, like painters. For example, the movie's official love song "Crash Here Tonight". You would think that you would play on a competition love scene, but we've been hearing about 45 seconds before going to a memorial service. They said, "Well, we should use this song together." <br /> <br /> This is the best thing for a movie shooter. <br /> <br /> An area that hopes for betrayal will not fully develop and the film is heavily inequitable. Toby Keith's music and product deployment tool for Ford Trucks. Broken bridges are trying to think about the musical power of the people who are recovering, but the story tells them that the two points are missing from this growing music video. I love Toby and really wanted to be like "Broken Bridges", but it deserves one of the popular boats that you know is what runs out of the people they count to leave.
