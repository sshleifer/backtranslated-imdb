What did they think in Cannes? One of the most disturbing films of all time. Even though we can see how meaningless each detail of this film is. If I could look at her again, I think I screamed. The point of this film was to show how Rosetta was a vital life, then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the film and then the credits should work. But no, we had to see many unnecessary scenes over and over again. The whole thing was packed with un-likable and unempampatic characters. They deserve the suffering of Rosetta. And I thought I did not go through "Tumbleweeds," this is a very boring film. It was just as exciting as watching the growth of herbs.
