One of the worst films I've ever seen. How can you define "worst"? Both eyes were rolled back and would prefer to be forced to dance more later than seeing this miserable dreck. In any case, One-Hit Wonder Zwick has also directed a movie that frustrates Elvis fans, Mary Kay salespersons, Las Vegas, gay, FBI agents and any other exploration of humanity and has forced it to be abolished . Elvis Presley Enterprises could have allowed Elvis Presley Enterprises to be used in a film that Elvis's "Elvis Presley Imitator looks like only one dead". The worst part of this confusion - some work - mangled script: words and songs voiced by Elvis in the 1970s and sounded in the 1970s! Worst special effect? Oscar, like the tomb of Elvis, is probably the pyramid with a golden color placed in the middle of a park, as it is potentially the world's most well-known grave. Potentially, the biggest audience in this film will be Elvis fans. But the deceitful folly (Nixon gave Elvis a DEB sign, it's not the FBI credentials ... and I can continue) that really leads to conventional wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this stupid movie. This is really a terrible, horrible film.
