There are several talented qualities for this show. Someone has a good melody for theme ringtones. There is a beautiful place in the show. And I think I'm still a minor, but I love Wanda. I love the truth that cares for me, and it's more of a parent for Timmy. <br /> <br /> Behold, this show does not love me, it's not najis, but I think it's very annoying. <br /> I say the best animated show in Planet Earth. While using this process for an animated film, I think of Peter Pan and Pirates, thinking of Darkwing Duck, thinking about Scooby Doo and thinking of Talespin. And I hope that I'm not the only one who denies the fact that only Wild Thornberrys is a loving and entertaining thing. In my opinion, Odd Parents is not the most attractive show in Planet Earth. I am making it worrying and overrated in a number of ways, but it's not the worst show on Nickolodean. That is, the chalk zone, the god is indescribable. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> the thing is animation. Heroes, if I insult me, have a great deal of surprise, and many backgrounds are boring, and there's no color to look at Spongebob Squarepants and Wild Thornberrys. Except Wanda, characters are very worried. Tara Strong (aka Charendoff), such a talented voice actress Timmy can not express. Timmy I love it as no start character, she is annoying and sometimes patronizing and she is also a poor decision maker. And his voice gets me crazy. Strong, but I'm not in this show. Another annoying character, Cosmo, is a so-called funny character. Instead, jokes are as cautious as they can be. They either (a) attract, or b) fall in love. <br /> <br /> Timmy's parents do not touch her son and their personalities are well-groomed. <br /> <br /> Many of the story lines are, I've seen it before. The episodes were not followed after the baby I was thinking. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's not a bad show, it's pretty weak for an animated admirer, and it's pretty worrying. to sit. 3/10: It returns qualities and I understand it completely.
