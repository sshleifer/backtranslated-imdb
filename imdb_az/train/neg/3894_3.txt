The Unbelievable Melancholy Man plays as an episode of Six Million Dollars, but with violence and some nudity. I know that this movie is a bit strange, but it's impossible to do something like this. <br /> <br /> Acting and script is not the best. But the effect is good for a 30-year movie with a budget of $ 50 - the character of the hood takes quite a while to really melt, but it's pretty impressive; There is also an inventive scene that involves electrochemistry. <br /> <br /> It is emphasized: <br /> <br /> <br /> After a few hours, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It was tough and naked, but I thought it was very fun. You can get worse.
