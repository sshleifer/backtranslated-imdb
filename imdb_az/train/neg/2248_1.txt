This movie is a huge steam pile. <br /> <br /> Why I do not think anyone should think that the Garland / Mason version should be redone, nor would Striesand think it would be the first choice on the star. <br /> <br /> To do this, our people (Gay Americans) are mostly committed to betraying Stries and a treasure. At least, in my opinion, she had come to the top with a professional girl, and what was Bogdanovich? <br /> <br /> Give yourself a blessing, and let the Judy classic, even the original (its beautiful movie), but please skip this stinkpot!
