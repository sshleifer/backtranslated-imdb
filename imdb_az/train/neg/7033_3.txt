Black Candles are a mix of the same director's "Vampires" and then "in another part". I note what I saw amongst others. In any case, there are some love and somewhere a pin is built on a voodoo doll, and then there is a place close to the torso, and the man passed. I'm not sure if either of them is good or not. Look at the place or anything else that your sister came to read and hear from the desires of the house. Certainly, everyone else is a worshiper of Satan. It's really hard to say who's who is in moments of the movie, and sometimes a little confused. Although there is an animal scene simulated by black goat to spice up everything (I hope it). Ugh. Sometimes, "Rozemary's Bebi", on the contrary, is transferred to the baby, because the hostess always gives a woman a teaspoon of tea, and any evil deities are from these places. However, herbs are not something that belongs to this movie. The latter seems to be the beginning of the restart, and many viewers are interested in where they are in the middle. It's not unwatchable, it's just not good, and I'm all that depends on what you want to see in movies, and here's a lot of things for me that's not much here. From 10 to 3.
