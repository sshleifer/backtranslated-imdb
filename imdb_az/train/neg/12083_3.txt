Summer! ... I think. It is difficult to say. It's hard to have a sense of a movie that has no sense. This film is sterile as a surgeon's scalpel. There are several stone columns for a setting, some stone seats, several stone crosses, and some stone actors. There is no feeling! The only thing that keeps this film is Hamlet and is part of a literary text of the Hamlet. Dublin is not really bad. The film has come to a dull, gloomy, dangerous, life-threatening atmosphere and sounds revealed. <br /> <br /> I saw three times in the 3000 versions of this magnificent Mystery Science Theater of Hamlet, and I was on the verge of leaving the television three times each, despite being MST 3K. <br /> <br /> Increases the production of a very good dignified drama.
