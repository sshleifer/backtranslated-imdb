I saw the novel taken on this movie and it looked great, I went out and bought it. What a mistake, the player is something, special effects (if you can tell them), look like something that will not go beyond school. Some characters are very ridiculous in this movie, which, unfortunately, often happens once they appear on the screen. As for a story, forget it. This is a warning, you should not waste any money in this movie, it's one of the worst things I've ever seen. So if you do not watch Troll 2, you'll be very happy with it.
