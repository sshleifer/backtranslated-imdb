I recently felt a lot of this movie, and I longed for this movie, which I almost have to see. And now, just seeing today, 5.8 ratings can be completely understood. I think that if you think that something can cope with it, it's not worth it because it's a very difficult one. <br /> Of course, Tufts have moments of 2 eyes. There is a very nice and advanced story with good relationships with the true product, but all this is to show that it is very difficult to watch. And if it was not for Wes Craven's production, it would have nothing to do with the original remake. <br /> <br /> But all this leads you to go "Had it been horror or comedy?" Because there are many ridiculous moments and a foolish liner (IE "There is one hand in poetry!" Or "I'm just killing you!" POLICY: (This section contains spoilers, be careful The film begins with a mutant baby-bearing woman (ooh la la!), Then blown into a black color with the head of the screen and is a monologue, and then we go to this office, which is accidentally placed in veteran mannequins. <br /> <br /> Let's just say a few days ago, when the captain called them "a good job in dullness," on the last day they used the desert where the family of the last THHE family was in New Mexico, though things were finally wrong, people were dying and ... <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <STRONG> Here's no flashbacks, and the end is pretty safe ... but a twist year ! Stupid one, that is. Ultra Super Directorate and a holographic cover of "The Hills Have Eyes To 3" ticket alternatives sonunlarÄ±n but at this point I'm pretty sure all of them will be displayed do not take care of me. <br /> <br /> So if you love the first THHE, it's almost a sin to avoid seeing it. But if you have anything else, do not spend any kind of money. <br /> <br /> 3/10
