Until this new season, I am a great 'small mosque' fan. <br /> <br /> The new Christian vicar has destroyed all the intentions of the show. Always living together to overcome immorality. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Christian and a Muslim, but I love watching and seeing the friendship between Amar and Ravaya. Not much more. <br /> <br /> Just cancel it and be with it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
