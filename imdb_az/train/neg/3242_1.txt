An overview for people like me. This movie suffers from the beginning to the end. The popcorn threw on the screen and I applied myself to a la MSF2000. The field is based on accidental events and is based on the folly of the people to be smart. The lead falls to a person and may be related to him, so it does not happen to him. And he's rich? And he is a famous psychologist ????? Come, people. When everyone comes together to talk about a merger, is it only the most convenient moment? It was such a scene that it felt like a slap in front of the semi-filmed demonstrators. It would be an insult to the rain man. I also acknowledge that the Mamet dialogue is rejected by some people as eating meat, war booties, and passion for treasure owners. My hatred is complete, it is against logic. But I'll give you a shot. It is good that you do not need to be real. Do not care about me. This is everyone's direct conversation. Mamet can not create characters; Everything that he can do is to raise his voice over different actors. Its actors are not even wooden. Everyone is confused about those with the same character. (But his subsequent films are getting better.)
