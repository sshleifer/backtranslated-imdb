This movie was so scary that it's almost as good ... it's almost as good. We love music, but it is not. Though terrifying sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who can not sing or dance, Anthony Rapp has succeeded in achieving a really good performance (especially toward the end). The character of the drunken lady, Marjorie, is also welcome to watch. <br /> <br /> The tragedy was unexpected and could have been a funny song and funny without poor piano music. Adminsely, some songs (fantabulous) are pretty charming (but not in a good way). <br /> <br /> Open House - it's a funny movie just to watch out for it's awful! We are thinking of having a good music scene (with perfect actors).
