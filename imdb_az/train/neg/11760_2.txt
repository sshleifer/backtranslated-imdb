Amen for Magsel. There was a lot of confusion. First, how do you know which movie you bought? Henry Cele attends each of them. I bought this movie I thought was miniseries ... WHAT? It would be a comedy, but the young girl was raped. David Hasselhoff (spelling) is good for popcorn TV, but it was not convincing in this movie (where there were English accents) and what is with the love movie? The movie claimed that a young man should rise to the military power - the captain of the slave, not to be an attractive person to investigate the British girl and his father ... <br /> <br /> If I have paid more than $ 7 for that, I have to call the film to the police - can be!
