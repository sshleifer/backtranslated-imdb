As a young black / Latina woman, I'm always looking for films that represent people's experiences and lives. Of course, when I saw this movie in my video store, I thought I would love her; Unfortunately, I did not. Although the topics presented in the film were interesting and relevant, the story was simply not prepared properly. The film just keeps drifting and many of the characters on the screen come and go to make a contribution to the overall movie. If the director had done a better job of linking the scenes, perhaps it would be a bit more. If it were to be honest, I'd recommend a movie like "Victor's upgrade" every day. I was just not very impressed.
