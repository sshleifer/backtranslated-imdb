Poor access to John Howard in the Bulldog Drummond series. Usual funny banter and antics but plenty of space. Barrymore receives something like an inspector, changing the shadows to follow Drummond, Algy and Tenni in a desert gas surveillance (largely circles, the budget is heavier than normal) and wanting to make Drummond to be drowned to save the poor. For those who keep this account, Drummond plans to ask Phyllis to marry him, and Algy is concerned about the missing baby. Shopping and Tennis are decorated as fishermen for fishermen, but it is only slightly understood.
