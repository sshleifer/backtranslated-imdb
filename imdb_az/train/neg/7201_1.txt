Fortunately, I did not pay to see this movie. Also, can not detect even spoilers because they are enthusiastically abandoned after forty minutes of the movie. That was bad. Once laughed, Yahoo! the billboard fell on the board and the song came from the subject. But this was after I thought I was entertaining, but I still did not understand the position of the product. <br /> <br /> I loved the cartoon. I was almost religious. (though I missed the last episode, they heard Dr Claw show, and there was nothing more than this claw, someone comment on the show's page) There were many films on Penny and Brain in the animated film that came to the point. I hated the creation of everything reminiscent of the robot. Broderick left the screws with Inspector Gadget's full sense. He is not asymmetrical as an animated film. Another truth is that its gadgets are actually working to the point where I saw the oil slick except. He was also bowed with the sound of "Wowsers" used to be an exciting tone. I was very disappointed that they did very bad animation. Everyone felt this way too. <br /> <br /> We love the 14-17 year old cartoon and love every minute. <br /> <br /> I went out with an open mind knowing that the movie would be enhanced with animated films. I was amazed at how perfect the film was. Based on visionary gags and foolish dialogue for humor. Disney is based on pain and physical mizraca to push a child's movie. The product placement in this movie is meaningless and shows. The wise cracking machine did not create intelligent people. Gadgets seem nice, but they were pretty brilliant. The cartoon was a better look. Silly scenes twisted. I watched the movie 40-45 minutes, and did not hear a laugh and laughed at the Dudley-Do-Right front view. This movie should not be watched by people who want to explore in family fun. Unfortunately, I highly appreciate "Iron Giant". This film is a transvestite to the whole family drama .------------ 1
