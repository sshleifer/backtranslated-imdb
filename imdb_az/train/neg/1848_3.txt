There are bad movies, and then there is a bad film that turns into an art. It's one of those films. My partner and I are still shocked by both types of shells, you know when looking at space and drooling! You can say that people have been involved (hoping to change their names to protect themselves) and that they are definitely not shy. I can not give only three of them already, because it is a single protein and really bad effects. I smiled in most of the film, so I can say that she has a good time. Avoid the viewer, the above words do not interpret in any way whatsoever that this is not a good movie because it's not. I must say that it was not possible to play a movie with such a GREAT title!
