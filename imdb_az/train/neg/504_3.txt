If the Italian cult cinema has something in common, there is something in common with the Ganttling Horizons and Giotto's hybrid (with a strong dose of Erotica), even though the Devil's MARK is more related to the instrument? they really worked in a terrible way! Here we get an ordinary group of people (a moving troupe) which is stranded on an island (dead call for his missing spouse, because he is from a leading lady). The characters are pretty much stereotypes: an average, but stunning hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and is more than a family's historical tragedy), silence heroism, freestyle comedian (Mae West remembers and a very delicious, mysterious gardener (once, (everywhere), a soft, but dedicated dance manager know what I mean), a strange servant (although this is actually a ensemble piece by name, although Femi Benussi is a nominal star), a fan of idols, a hospitable fan and so on. not to be missed, terrible dubbing, snail speed, strange production (scenes depicting the dark sea that some black-and-white film has taken), and the murders only within half an hour. At the same time, Marcello Giombini's account is, in fact, inconvenient; that the revelation proves surprisingly surprising (here there are no shortcomings in the suspects).
