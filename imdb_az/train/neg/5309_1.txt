I watched the film one night in the cables and did not believe how bad it was. I usually use bad movies, but it was fun so I did not even have fun. Some moments of this film are absurd music that plays throughout the film, some of which are neon green and instant splitting with a laser gun, and this disgusting act of acting, ugly special effects. In fact, the show is accusing me. I did not recognize any of the actors in the movie and I hope I have never seen any of them. In general, after seeing this garbage, I recommend leasing this movie to learn quality movies (you can find it, I can not imagine a video store I carry this trash).
