Snow White, in Locarno, where I only had the chance to see it, is, of course, the world famous fairy tale. And this applies to coca. In the end, the real deception of the Swiss Alps also plays its role. <br /> <br /> So, all three aspects of the title are shot in this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; Unfortunately, a weak area , an unprecedented dialog box, a very unusual decoration and mixed mobility, not add to the originality, so I remained untouched as an audience. <br /> <br /> Then there were clich√©s that twisted me: Snow White rich and spoiled upper class girl, of course, that her parents are divorced and she has no love for them because they are not always busy, and they have the best lover who loves and cares for their parents, one of them (a steel worker and a housewife) , poor and happy, and unaware of the desperate situation in her daughter, the good guy (= the prince) is part of the Swiss-speaking part of Switzerland (!), less economically <br /> <br /> Therefore, he is a migrant from Spain who does not accept his or her own way of life - until the father admits his serious illness and his son's admission to the hospital bed. . <br /> Naturally, a drug dealer is brutal, bankers are heartless, club owner is a playboy and photographer, although a woman has only a career when exposed by Snow White on artistic pornographic pictures <br /> <br /> there is no need for spoilers to add these numbers to an open field. I love other movies by Samir, for example. "Forget Baghdad," I was very disappointed. Let's hope for the next.
