<br /> <br /> Collective student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is an insufficient, rich and unusual extraordinary "thriller" who is the victim of hallucinations and nightmares claiming to be the wife of Sean (Casey Affleck) after a traffic accident. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie in this movie: they all do not believe me (then their roles are not good). It is a joke to propagate this as a film of fear. Do not worry about where? <br /> <br /> How was this project going to get green light on Earth? Writer-director Steve Carpenter does not have the vision or ability I can feel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
