This movie was made and shot from my home town. <br /> <br /> Twenty years have passed after a few days after the film was shot. <br /> <br /> The story is wrong, and one should remember that it was a comedy, and so on the cheek but there is no real oomph, these are basically transperant, and little information you do not think about them is just not interested.I heard Kylie's recapitulation and chic of Australia, and I like to see a child I go to school in. The film does not completely replace the film, but the film's nature (the films of the 80's / fear of the worst film), but the Aussi actor would be nice. <br /> <br / > Many actors, such as casting, seemed to be concrete (especially the two main songs - "director" and "producer"), and this is never a good look. Also, shots were rude about them. Probably burnt? <br /> <br /> The murder is not just one, it's not as smooth as it is. My Lord Could it be more intimidating? Although there are some shocking factors, there are some wrong scenes. I liked the movie, but it was not good. It took 90 minutes but could have gone less. Perhaps they would have been better if they were to compress the scenario. There were many characters that were killed, but no real killer was built on them. Maybe it would be better if you killed a few people and were in a really horrible environment. <br /> <br /> Now I know that these comedies and elements were funny. Or they were incredible, they were funny. <br /> <br /> LM.
