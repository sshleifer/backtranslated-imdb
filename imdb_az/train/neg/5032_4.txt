This film was a fantastic fantasy 50 years old. This is very similar to the first Gozilla movie, and this movie has scenes with American actors who have no real reason. An interesting thing about the scenes is the Cold War tension described between America and Russia. Like Godzilla, Gamera does not touch Tokyo, because no great monster film has been drawn to Tokyo, it wakes up with atomic bombs and spread to the world. All this is a good movie. Some of the scenes surrounding the gamer, especially in Toly, are spectacular and have special effects that are very worthwhile. If you love Japanese giant monsters, you really need to get a shot. I give it to 10 to 4. It would probably have been 5 if I had a Japanese version that I could not follow.
