I'm not sure who wrote these <br /> <br /> <br /> brilliant views for this movie but trust me. I've seen hundreds of horror films, and they are intertwined, and this is just about 80 minutes, and I believe that I can get it all. The area is terrible, and it is even worse to act. And there is no development. <br /> <br /> Even David Cocteau's movies are better. Stay away from JIGSAW. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Remove the window. <br /> <br /> I do not believe everyone can be as long as this visit is a good review.
