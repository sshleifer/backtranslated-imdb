In 1979, with a friend at a dollar theater, I saw this kinematic dissatisfaction (when the tickets really sold one dollar). It was on the screen with my "Dude", "Laser Bra 2000" sketch. Apparently, I and my friend reacted to the film. Not that I did not find the film's attack (either at age 18 or now), but rather the mindlessness and patently unfunny, deprived of humor that Ed Wood did not want to be watched. <br /> <br /> This is not just a matter of understanding Mike's "vision", but the ultimate reason for NBC's refusal of air (to break the film's bankruptcy). <br /> <br /> I was surprised that this movie did not look like it had written a "The Worst 10 Movies of All Time". Undoubtedly, I'm mine. You have been warned.
