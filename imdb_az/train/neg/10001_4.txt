This was not the first thing I did not put my finger on: the charisma on the part of the leading actress. It has become an inevitable chemistry deficit with the leading man. Even romantic scenes come out just like those in the game. It would be great if the filmmaker thought he was wrong about the actors. <br /> <br /> But is this a scenario? Who was the chef chef? His culinary skills and restaurant, and ultimately, self-esteem and his young exploits surprised more than anyone else or anything else. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed in this movie. But you have forgotten that you are a candidate for Oscars, so be proud of yourself.
