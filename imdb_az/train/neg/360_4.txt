I read the book and really liked it from beginning to end. But when I saw the movie, I was very disappointed. Above all, Deborah did not despise Raffi, but only 24/25 a woman was playing. The former Christopher Rever was the same reason for the mischief. According to the book, it was about 30 years old. I would like to see a little more exploration of military life, a visit to see her friend, Red, because Elli is an important part of the development of the character. Miss Beasley also mentioned that the book is a Plus Size lady. The film did not have the budget of Madison County Bridges, and I believe it was released at the same time. <br /> <br /> But for me this was a very poor, low budget, a miscast movie. As we have already noted, Miss Spencer retired and wished to write a script for his books. He knows his characters better than anyone, and I hope he can cast it. The movie left me!
