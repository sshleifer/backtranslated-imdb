Here's a great example of what you do when you're a big idea here. Is not this a problem? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and its execution are no real substance. It is important to keep you from the beginning, and then draw some of your senses, interest and symbols. It is not necessary for this film to fly and continue the flight, and therefore. First of all, do not pay attention to the characters, because people are not presented in a way that can be attributed to one another, namely the Superman or the Missions Mission, but here is the normal people who are stressful. They do not believe that they are acting and interacting with them. Example: Jeffrey Combs does not always go here as a policeman on chewing, calm, frowning and closely watching. I mean, what is this? It looks like it's in the toilet or something. She liked it again in the animator and earned money when playing a tight / neurotic, unforgettable medical genius. But it seems too intense and rooted for it, but it is very difficult to compensate for it even in a soft neurotic way, naturally, I was surprised that it did not empty the jaw when filming. The film is mainly supported by life, but there is a pulse, and I never expected anything to come to me.
