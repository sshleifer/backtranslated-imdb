It would help to know how long it took for a film prepared for a movie like "The House's Next Gate", adapted for the film or television. The book was copyright in 1978. One reason for this may be the problems that make up the 'home'. The house in this lifetime is really dirty, so I can not imagine anyone who bought it. <br /> <br /> A few days ago, ten years ago, my wife went to my wife. The main heroes are not some kind of person to look for something in life and are one of the strongest of this book. Without the witnessing and analysis of the events described in the book so well, the author is a kind of devil (or the devil's personality). But this is a low book for most of them, and I do not think I'm going to appeal to lifelong people. Maybe someone will present another version of the book in the coming years. A better home ... better music ... better screen and darker lighting ... of course will help.
