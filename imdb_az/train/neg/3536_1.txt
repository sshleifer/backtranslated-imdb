I do not think I did not feel like leaving a movie before. Since I loved the previous two films of Guy Ritchie (I do not think Swept Away - she was blind), I was hoping to see it. <br /> <br /> The prices were poor, and then I still do not trust the press. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> More worrying the internet was buzz that was a little stinker, so with some treasure I'll give you $ 4.80 a afternoon. I'm not one of the main reasons for explaining this movie, and at one point I was honestly asked to come up and approach, and I just asked them not to buy it! <br /> <br /> I think Ritchie is in the trap of her husband. It was not good enough for me to make a good laugh, laugh, strange dialogue and good movie. characters. <br /> <br /> The Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, The Courts Of Suspects, Vanilla Sky, Kill Bill, Actor Jason Statham and Ray Liotta's performances were really good and really a charming story and editing / directing. <br /> <br /> So bigger, bigger than me.
