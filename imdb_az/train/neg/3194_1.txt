I can not believe this movie as it was in 1984. There is a little funny player. Who would want a fat Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker to accompany an Italian who returned to Italy illegally in Mexico? <br /> <br /> The title of the movie tells you much about it. In fact, as I can imagine, there is a general theme for this film's film / film. <br /> <br /> Lucky I saw MST3K with Mike and fishes as a shield. Women's drawings are based on Seinfeld's Elaine resemblance ("None of these are sponges") and do not stand on the weight of Baker. This movie is probably no worse than Mitchell, but the fame of Baker brings him here: After leaving the title at the start of the film, Tom says: "If I were illiterate, it would not be okay."
