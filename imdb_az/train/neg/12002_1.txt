This is a sad movie for sad people. While filming my hair in the theaters, trying to break down the chairs in front of me, the film poured into a series of cheering scenes that followed one another. <br /> <br /> There is no plot that Nikhil Advani has about 6 hectares, and there are people who are laughing behind me. and there is no interesting character. The scenario was complicated, probably because of the drunkenness of writing this movie. None of these stories have a strong stand. It's nothing new, catching viewers and full of dialogs you've heard for a million times. One of the stories is that these couples do not always have sexual intercourse because of the series of disasters they want to do. So this story is really serious? It is not funny, creative, but proves that Advani is not a comedian. One of the stories (the only story that I am interested in) is based on the kufr of a man, and ends with the old satin-parmeshwar shit. I have no idea what to do about the Salmaan-Priyanka area. There is no problem as the land does not have a plot. Can not get Karan Johar's film because he is forced to marry Salman? Why can not she marry her and still can not get the film? or Advani and Priyanaka want to prove to the world that women should not act in the movies after marriage or marriage after marriage? With six actors in the film, Advani explicitly prepares the film. Thus, the Times Group uses the full range of sponsors such as the Filmfare magazines. Some of the women in the movie are sometimes seen as some jewelry brand! I came to the IMDb to give the worst rating, and I was shocked to hear messages praising the film. It only goes to show that he hit the loyal state of Bollywood and hit the stars of the star. Films such as Salaam E Ashk will be continued and worsened.
