It is one of the many mediocre zombie films to be able to feed the masses after the hard earned dollar. Offer? Hold your hard earned dollars and say that only the good old theater has one of these teams. What plans do they talk about? Seize over zombies. This time, according to originality (?), This film is part of Rhode Island and I'm not sure if I'm seeing a zombie buzz on Rhode Island to be honest. A government-controlled television channel is likely to keep the "normal" broadcast of those who have never been seen or left without thinking that any remaining citizens will not think there is no problem in the world. Some of the commercials released by this station are probably the most entertaining part of this movie. In fact there is a story, but I'm not concerned about it, because after a while you will not fall asleep or worry. In any case, this has a very bad move to overturn all the "previously seen" things that are taken out of the camera. Trust me, find a lot more than just watch your time. From 10 to 3.
