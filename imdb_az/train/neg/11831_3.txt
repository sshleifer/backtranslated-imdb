<br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my two children (5.7). So I do not understand how these animated films come from. They love quite a lot of animation (like many people rated this movie). The theater was full, and I was looking forward to seeing the movie with an outstanding castle. It was unwise for me to speak directly. It was incredible and could not be predicted. There were several trails along the film and that was it. Of course, they tried again and again to get cheap laugh, but they did not work. My son almost always tells me that after watching the DVD movie we will not want the movie we want, but it's not about it. My daughter fell halfway through. Also, children thought the character animation was strange. <br /> <br /> Trust me, I'm not the kind of thing I think is negative. But they are of a quality quality and they are very few, like cartoons thrown there.
