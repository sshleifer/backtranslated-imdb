Although I can not only remem- ber this story from Melville, it's not a valid attempt, I agree. It only insults the nature and nature of the original story to move the story to the 20th century; Perhaps you could have transferred it to England, but it should be part of a period. Even our storyteller narrator, the proprietor, continues to do so somewhere until 1800. At the end of the nineteenth century, a strange disobedient worker would be dismissed. And the 20th century? Come on! Give me a clear pause! Even in around 1800, this behavior did not work well after the end. And the end of the movie? I did not know what was happening, because I did not watch all the trawl - I should stop. This Elizabeth was known as the "Tramway Desire" by England.
