I'm probably one of the few watchmakers who did not recommend this movie. Thinking with all Ang Lee's eyesight (each frame is worthy of a reputation), I'm truly disappointed with the incredible speed of the film. <br /> <br /> During the Vietnam War, at the very beginning of this event, many young people (Roedel) were fighting against the British troops, geurilla Jayhawkers, and their associates. He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles, played by Skeet Ulrich, joined the group after his father was shot and his house probably burned by Jayhawkers. This story fights with Roedel and Chiles's reactive adventures and other relationships with war victims, including Bushwhackers (played by Daniel Holt, Jeffery Wright), and warriors playing the Bible Game. Whenever the film developed the story to an interesting point, it turned into another subplot and left things that were not developed. For example, due to the merger caused by former slavery Holt's roedel group, the campaign was quickly demonstrated in some conflicts with property and protocol and then dropped to the film. A young villian / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs much courage and violence against him, but we do not know why. Some heroes never go to the surface; I think that this film has many history, as well as many people. <br /> <br /> The historical details were excellent. Housing, furniture, clothing, etc. I loved looking up and I stumbled upon a little dialogue, though I thought the leading actors figured a wonderful job of humanizing the characters. If you really do not enjoy the history or do not have a great Ang Lee fan, give it a pass.
