This is a bit of a terrible production, giving you headache as a nightmare. It's a gentle blend of live motion and ugly stop-motion animation. It's strange, but it's a strange journey that's not fun, it's all about to be expected. This is a charming, cold, non-human, hostile, frightening, or even creepy form of entertainment. There is no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. Cosgrove-Hall made more attractive things with stop-motion. Interestingly, this is French production. Thus, the French does not have the concept of fear, which re-applies the stereotype.
