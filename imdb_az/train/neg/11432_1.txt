<br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh have been forced to spend five hours (or indeed a long time) of this unusual incredible script. In the beginning, each piece of this movie is incredible. This film giggled me a few times, but mostly shocked that the director / writer really waited for us to believe in the many scattered elements trying to put this movie together. <br /> <br /> The film's focus is Boz (Graham) and its immediate surroundings. <br /> <br /> Interesting is not an interesting thing. Instead of turning this story into a convincing and unpleasant thing, however, the director takes Gray to these unhappy works, which in essence give no sense. LGBT personally thought what this film would think of heterosexuals in the process of their departure. If Cavanaugh and Graham (meanwhile, understandably understood) would not have been among the chemistry, they would give me a negative 3 stars. (I'll insult if the writer is queer).
