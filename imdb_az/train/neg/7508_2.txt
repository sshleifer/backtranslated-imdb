I wish I could choose a different name for Spike Lee. The film "Sam Of Summer" gives an impression of the sad serial killer, David Berkowitz. It is not. <br /> <br /> Berkovits is a sharp, outlook portrait of NYC's street life on the hot summer of the 77th year when it is turned into terror in this city. <br /> <br /> The film follows many young heroines in an Italian-American neighborhood and their reactions are the son of Sam's threat. Vinni and his wife Dionna; Richie and Ruby and a few other characters. <br /> <br /> The point is that these characters are unpleasant. They are often annoying and sometimes unbearable. Lee then belabors the chaotic lives of high energy, which is filled with anger, lust, and aggression. <br /> <br /> Vinny's and his wife have at least two sustained battle scenes ranging from rich disco dance scenes, countless gabfests ... I have been repeatedly curious about: where is the movie editor? <br /> Along with this, the film gives you a feeling of fear or a sense of fear that comes from a great deal of Sam in the background. <br /> <br /> Lie is more successful in showing a distinct danger from the vigilante in the neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Acting is good direct. By the way, with the disco of the 1970s, you really feel like you're in an Italian-American neighborhood in NYC in 1977, paying great attention to costumes and production design. <br /> <br /> The atmospheric origin of the movie is a bit of a strain on the lives of very strange irritating people, and it's not enough to write overblown scripts.
