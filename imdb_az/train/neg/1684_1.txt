There is such a situation with Columbia Pictures' 'The Grudge'. This murder persecution began when a Japanese was prepared for an ambitious "Ju-on" television movie and was inspired to correct the film in English. <br /> <br /> This is a virtual tsunami of bad decisions that winds winds until it is washed down in Orlando, October 21, 2004. <br /> <br /> The courageous Momma ghost, which looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette in Tokyo, is a sophisticated, but second-class pupil filled with her terrible sidekick. Is there anything terrible from a creepy 8 year old Japanese guy? Certainly not! Count Chocula comes to mind. With this whimsical band, we have to add a mysterious black cats called Chim Chim. (Remember Speed ​​Racer?) As they have already guessed, they are convicted of being killed in this place of residence and now wanting to kill anyone entering the premises. If one dies in anger, as explained by a Japanese detective, I will forget if anyone desires vengeance on anyone who has a designated character or similar feature. <br /> <br /> The story begins quite a bit in a pretty innocent prince Bill Pullman's balcony death. My guess is that Bill Pullman has been begging for his children to ride to the Tokyo Disneyland. Then we can withstand the gentle narrative of Nurse Yoko, "oh no, go there" screamed the audience, but it was as if it were a magic lantern instead of anxiety warnings. About 30 minutes after the movie, we see America's hero Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar may be an adult actor, but she did not care much about Buffy Vampire Slayer, so she drew lots of attention. Jennifer Anniston is a star in a film about the adventures of six friends in New York. Try as much as possible, but stop thinking about another popular project. But I'm abandoned, Karen, nurses spooks r us as a substitute for the original care that disappeared. <br /> <br /> She snoops around, responds to ghosts, coma lady dies and some other things happen. When I looked at a fair-haired vixen looking for bankruptcy, his creator waited for him to come out with an abandoned amusement park named Gower, to find the dreams and remove his mask! "If you did not interfere with the kids and the dog, I could use it too!" <br /> <br /> Takashi Shimizu, competing for becoming Asian Ed Woods, made two unfortunate decisions about the sound. First, he chooses to use a soundtrack when only one is killed. This is a great way to eliminate any regression, because the audience receives a two-minute warning to make a more predictable killing. Secondly, dreams sound a strange noise that sounds like a dull gopher. After the movie, I heard a few people laughing at the theater and laughing. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar ends with only one survivor. Of course, we learn that the fire we burned to burn our house was extinguished in time for the next chapter. However, given the humorous reaction of the audience, they did not apologize any further. "The Grudge" can easily be re-organized with comedy, perhaps for its camp value. Baring, it will fall as the biggest cinematic tension since "Godzilla vs. Megalon". I would suggest to wait until the movie comes to the local discount theater.
