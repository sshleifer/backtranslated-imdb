Before watching this movie, I read a review here that maybe one of the best movies ever! ha ha scenic scene tension improves ... this is the frustrating character of this movie. She was shouting at the little girl and trying to strangle a little boy, without warning in the murder (and who was the guy who talked to a little boy?) ... She was unresponsive in this movie. When I look at the film looking into one direction, then it does not just go somewhere, it goes in a new direction ... and ten and ten ... <br /> <br /> The actor is great, but the writing is awful. Each scene tells every character, or something so unbelievable, unrealistic, and a friend's reaction / reaction is simply strange. There are no resolutions for advanced problems throughout the film, and it is confusing and, ultimately, a great deal of time.
