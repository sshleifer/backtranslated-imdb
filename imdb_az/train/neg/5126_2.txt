I leased this movie because they were hoping the whole family would like it. Although the movie was family-friendly, my family did not like it, because it gave God the wrong appearance. If you obey God and obey Him, success will not be met. Your football team does not always win. You will not get a better price magic. Infirmity is not always cured. You will not always rise. <br /> <br /> In some cases, you will be stuck in an old car. <br /> <br /> God does not respond to any kind of behavior. Instead, we were created to glorify Him. Sometimes we thank God when things go wrong for us. Living is Christ; to die is earnings.
