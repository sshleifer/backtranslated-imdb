I liked the original scary movie *. I'm a great admirer of parody - this is my favorite humor form. Sometimes it is sometimes regarded as the most glamorous humor. The Wayans guys understood the concept perfectly in the original film, then temporarily forgot it. I think Wayans is a family of funny geniuses. Dear, even geniuses are wrong. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a word. I liked the "Exorcist" parody, especially the "exit, ma" sticks. Now this is Wayans-quality material. But besides, I can only guess twice when I'm laughing: 1) Tori Spelling is deceived by a soul in the middle of the night and then polished and talks about getting married. By the way, he says, "It was just a predatory call!" It was a moody funny one. 2) The "Save The Last Dance" parody for a girl who mistakenly applied Cindy's new motions. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is pure garbage filled with cheap sticks. But short-haired comets are not suitable for the sneaky laughs of the first intimidating film. The jokes were enlarged on the most delicate or intended first movie. For example, Scary Movie I is meant to be a few innuendos character Ray gay. It was fun. However, in the Scary Movie II, the entire penis-strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was mind-numbing and incredibly unfunny. This is an example of a whole movie. Shock humor * is far from enough to shoot a single movie. Unfortunately, this was a tendency in 2000 and 2001. <br /> <br /> Regarding the shootings of a film, I'm worried about the low level of Waynes.
