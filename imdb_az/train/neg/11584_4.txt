It was about twenty minutes before the movie, and I enjoyed it. Unfortunately, these symbols were quite elegant. Sometimes it would be an unpleasant thing, but then something would be slower. Fortunately, I was finally rewarded for my patience, and the end of this movie was not bad. But it was not good enough to justify sitting in the first ninety minutes. So, I would say that the film is generally general and considering all the victories, I would say this is a disappointment.
