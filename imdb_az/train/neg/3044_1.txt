<br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the Prince is a strange movie, taking into consideration that Cuba lived in a cloud in space and fought against Satan and his little ones. <br /> <br /> There's a real laugh. Although each is deliberate, of course, it is disputable. This movie is not good, but I can say it is very happy to watch it. <br /> <br /> I'm in this movie "Conquer Santa Claus Mens", Dudley Moore and "Santa Claus" by John Lithgow "The Santa Clause" with Tim Allen.
