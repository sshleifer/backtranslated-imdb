The first 10 minutes of this film was terrible. It's hard to believe that they've put money on anyone other than John Cusack. <br /> <br /> With some of the anti-war / anti-war films thrown into the box office, it is almost impossible for any studio to be related to this post. <br /> <br /> Firstly, Grose Point Blank seemed to be a recurring, politically motivated affair with Akroyd and Cusack (s). But about 90 seconds to the movie, this is a perfect attempt at DR STRANGELOVE. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to risk the sight of this DVD. I do not know if Cusak is enough for me to follow another feature despite the other feature. Cusack was unwittingly damaged by his willingness to commit suicide as he had hated George Bush and the Iraq war. Tom Cruise had not been here recently. Not even close.
