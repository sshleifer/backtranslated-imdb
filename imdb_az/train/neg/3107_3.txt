Woody Allen made the "September", proving that he could force "even genius." This is Mel Brukun's "September". Monumental foolish, boring and unfunny, I have to admit that I did not watch it until the end. The flick takes you into a sleep or a few (for example, "Pul Piyi", "Exit to the Sea", "Spitfire Grill"), which forces you to reach the back button. And just say, as a faithful Mel Brooks fan. He should be loyal to comedy and leave only social commentaries. The same person who called "Young Frankenstein" and "Spaceballs" pushed like a dog. Avoid all costs.
