The film is boring, characters and scenarios are inaccessible, incredible, action-packed. This movie is a great confusion. When opera music starts, the most effective stunt is used. Both votes dubbed Mr McGregor or Steven and changed his voice. This film has a lot of dialogue and is very bad for everyone. The film is a great sleep treat. The war laughs. Bad designer drug addicts were worthy of the devil's shape. The main villain was a joke and his character developed weakly. When it was used to describe the main villain through questioning, it would only throw random areas such as "CTX (its designer drug) will be in the water supply." again in the movie. It is highly recommended to pass this movie.
