If you are not beaten by the Russian people or the shells, this movie is a betrayal. Actually, I was asleep for about 40 minutes and had to fight only with the desire to leave the theater. I wish I could. <br /> <br /> Even Silent Hill was scary. Heck was even scared at the Pan's Labyrinth. <br /> <br /> I am still uncertain about what should not be scared in this jerk. First of all, I'm very talented in films that use "pidgin rus" as in the beginning, like opening credits. Since we brought a group of Russian friends, I was embarrassed and we're all confused. <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, fortunately for me (and probably you) this movie has already fled my brain and I went out an hour earlier. <br /> <br /> I saw a completely fragmented version of this movie, because I do not believe because I do not believe it. <br /> <br /> <strong> I fell into the star and wanted to leave in 40 minutes, but I woke up and did not leave.
