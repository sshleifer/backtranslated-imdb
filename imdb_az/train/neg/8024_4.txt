When I sat down to watch the 14th season of the bachelor ("Love wings"), I knew that I would be in an "exciting" moment. I watched the passing of one of the previous semesters; watching an episode or two and the next three missing or missing. <br /> <br /> "On Valentine's Wing", a 31-year-old commercial pilot, Jake, travels from Dallak to see that bachelors are often attractive and interested. , Texas, as true love as you can find true love in a season-long reality-drama show. Jake met 25 beautiful girls from all over the country. It starts to get to know a bit, but it's basically the surface; How can you get to know someone in a few minutes? Jake is trying to convey his true intentions from the very beginning to the audience. He just mentioned that he did not want a love or a good time, but he wanted his fiancé or his wife. We only think that it is open to competition in women. If so, she can explain some of the women's actions. Women are very competitive. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Dangers, retreat, and "Caution!" Warnings show that all these women are not good at all. Jake said he was not looking for a "touch" despite only sexually charged appeal. However, the girls pulled out all the stops to try to influence Jake's sexual intercourse. Have they come home with their perfectly dressed clothes? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> One girl, Channy, Jake is a "good boy" He could have been a "mischievous girl." He said that Jake could "run" at any time. <br /> <br /> So, a real demonstration can not be so bad, can it? Besides the subject of sexual intercourse, <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; > Another problem is the early emotional relationship that many girls are connected to. Jake for herself, especially a few girls, said: "If I do not make my first impression, it will kill me!" <br /> <br /> Michelle, especially when he is not yet familiar with him and he speaks of a certain laugh. <br /> <br /> Michelle, in particular, adds some of J sələlər.

The only logical consequence is that America is quite comfortable. One thing is clear: America (in general) likes the reality TV and the tops behind it. <br /> <br /> This is asking me why we love reality TV? What does this involve? Do we want to make sure that we resemble our own lives or that we are more stable and more tolerant than others? No matter what happens to us, we must protect ourselves from the media and entertainment that will fill our minds. I'm not saying that all reality TV shows are bad; But I say that we should evaluate each one of us. <br /> <br /> Episodes used for critics: Season start and Episode 2.
