First of all, I felt very strong about this movie so I signed up for the IMDb to review it. And my review? <br /> <br /> The film's title is fascist, secret, time travel and so on. Interestingly, however, the sequence of movies failed to bring these elements together. Remember South Park's episode, manatees wrote Family Guy using "balls of ideas"? Did Manatees write the Bible? He wanted to have all these different ideas as a writer, but he had no idea how to tie them together, and then, to make less logic, Donnie Darko-esquire, the chronology of time travel, > I can tell you that this was a bad movie from the early days. The special effects for something better than DVDs were very low. Acting was not very good, but I saw badly in fairness. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie or something vendetta, but I'm honest, I'm proud of the speaker's paintings, they're creepy, but the bad Nazi butcher boy was funny. <br /> <br /> Even in the horror genre. But this movie can not be described as a tension or drama. This story would have been a good film if it was a good story. But this is a trick. Waaaaay was over-cut.
