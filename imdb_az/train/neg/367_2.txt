A young man earns a lot of money and begins to live right away. Unfortunately, the person who really is very bad about his money. He wants his spoils back. The grocery store tries to get her back when she finds out who she is. He is kept by this little boy, who is lucky enough to be in the hands of the wicked. Criticism, I'll bet. It is not too long, but not interesting. Come with something different, oh kids?
