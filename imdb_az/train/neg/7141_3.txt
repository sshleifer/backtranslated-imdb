Okay, I went to this movie, not really expecting too much, and thought of an action like a Furious and Furious. Some nice cars are worth some of the beautiful girls. Unfortunately, this was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Do not get me wrong, the car was good and the girls were good, but it was a real misfortune to put something nice in the movie. The story never denied your attention, and the film just looked like one another. In other words, this movie is not a bad thing, but if you are looking for a movie to go to the end of this week, I would go about it so far.
