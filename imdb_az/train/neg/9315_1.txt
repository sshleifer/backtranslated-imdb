This movie was bad! It was awful! It was terrible! I do not emphasize this enough! The operation, the management, the story, the characters and everything was bad about it! It was very fragile and clone. Do not be fooled by the lid, or there is nothing to laugh at the label "Texas massacre". "Do not cheat you? <br /> <br /> The first two minutes of the movie are as good as Brendan's main character, but now I turn it off, something that I get from the movie is a group of ugly, annoying and untrained goats into a cabin in the midst of a forest and a clown killing them illegally and fraudulently. <br /> <br /> This film is a waste of my time and money, which can be the loss of your money and time! I propose to most of the film because it was terrible, I did not want to see how bad the actor was, and it was not worth it yet! Looking at the lid is a waste of time!
