This film, using a suspenseful-looking actor like Walken, is more of a trick to play this sparkling piece that looks like it's no better than playing a awesome role! Although the movie should be about some witches and, in fact, despite the almost ending of the movie, it is also a point where to watch or watch while watching this annoying movie, and all the time dragging actors and actresses who have gone through a film have all this trace you need to pass and decide on it and the money is spent just neglecting all the time there. I would like to watch cartoons for good. Leave someone, please!
