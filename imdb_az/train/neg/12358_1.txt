Demi Moore's appearance was selected for the SEALs. It was a bad start and the film was down here. The area was completely unbelievable. It is not enough to make a tough military unit. This film did not satisfy the woman's physical ability to fulfill my mission. <br /> <br /> Trying to claim that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone's intelligence. The differences between sexes make life interesting.
