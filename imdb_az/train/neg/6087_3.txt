This movie is not about a job as I expected it to be. A little strange heavy UFO conspiracy paranoia-fest has a few seconds of glow. Most players are mediocre, but are full of pregnant women for the 1970s. A photographer and a model witness some strange events in the room and soon become victims of the same victims. Flying saucers spotted, more people disappear - but this is a group of guys or guys covering their ultra secretive government? Soon, enough correspondent and "UFOlogist" (probably modeled with the character of the writer), this buzzing is thrown into a fiasco, and they are the target of ultra secret agents, which are as intimidating and foolish as they are. <br /> <br /> The film is about a mean UFO conspiracy theory, but it must be praised for its very seriousness. Camera work is good for a low-budget movie, pacing is very good, the script is legendary and absurd, and has long-term sustainability problems. I said, is the glitter for a few seconds? I'm honest, I can not say more than spoiler. At the end of the film, at least you can not get the middle, it's worth paying fast.
