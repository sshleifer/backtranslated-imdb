I went to this DVD two years ago and just decided to watch it yesterday. I do not know what the Inspector Gadget show took, and even the new Gadget and the Gadgetinis. Although a bright color palette and a modern animated film are all technically advanced, there are some missing things that gadget down the toilet. <br /> <br /> First of all classic inspector Gadget theme song and music are completely disappearing. The composer is trying to compromise by winning similar sounds but is still not good enough. Gadget-mobile is now a chat tool, not a car that can turn into a van. Moreover, instead of having a flat cool, many cuter and rounder appear. <br /> <br /> Penny has no computer books and she and Brain do not look anymore. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; It's a form of change and some things that Dr. Claw uses to do, but that's what I get." I do not know what a contract with a short-term / giant Italian man. <br /> <br /> <strong> According to Qafqazinfo.az, <br /> <br /> <strong> What is a secret called "the last job"? </ strong> <br /> /> <html> This is a hate of an unusual animated DVD on DVD, but do not allow this to buy inspector Gadget DVDs, and finally watch it and then sell it for seconds, no child will love it or appreciate it and there is no admirer in the old show who can not stand it.
