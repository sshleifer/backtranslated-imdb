This film is a radio, television, magazine, and so on. About almost every hour or every issue. So when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex, our expectations were very high. But oh boy, how much this movie is upset! Hollywood-style film about a movie in the film. The shadows show that we are not ready to make a "great Hollywood movie". I am not a movie critic, but I think that a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. As in the theme line, this is nothing but looped. You can only watch television without seeing something. We had this feeling when we saw your shade. Shades BAD PRODUCTION!
