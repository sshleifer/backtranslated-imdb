<br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> Stephen King's films are simply unusual It is a film, perhaps a few exception. This is not one of them. Although it's good enough, and Fred Gwynne is always beautiful, I will not complain to the player at once ... And I'll donate to the lack of all the parenting skills needed to prepare the story here ... <br /> <br /> But a sequence There was a point that I could not help, but I did not bother. And it was very close to the end of the movie, and at least two characters took part in the stupidity of the stupidity. The moments I said are: there is a small zombie around the house. You're suspected to be under the bed. <br /> <br /> (a) close to the bed, before lifting the eyelid outdoors, let your whole body know that such a child's inflammation can cause harm to you or go away from your bed (b) you're completely dependent on the position of a slightly increased security or at least a bit of a mini-terrorism. <br /> <br /> I know, let's go with (a). I feel like I'm offering myself a slaughter today. Bleh <br /> <br /> Although a fairly fun movie ... I'm just not too scared.
