The world's greatest joke. The biggest, most spectacular joke joke in the world. <br /> <br /> This film, which is decorated with ornamented streets and "hummies," undermines the attraction of this movie, as it has been properly evaluated by the legal persons writing the book. <br /> <br /> Asking the audience to take on an unusual role of a lawyer, and then he is awake with an exciting generous hero. <br /> <br /> All movies are free to find time, listen to music and work the novel. These are their goals. When he was doing one of three of these criteria, he (half a dozen) turned his attention to the audience, but then he gave it up! The director and film director, Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth, completely eradicate the audience's motivation and even encourage him to find a hero that he has thrown in the past to complain about his lack. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The great stumbling block, the secretary of the legal secretary is unsuccessful, because they need to be explicitly explained to the audience every time. Without this acid, the audience did not see anything particularly strange. If you do not have to explain how funny your audience is, humor is only effective.
