This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I hired a few jokes, waiting for a giggle of the first few scenes, and let me tell you that I just laughed so much in my life. The first scene in which the ninjas came out of the air and which led to a huge and ridiculous fire is one of the most incredibly funny foolish motion movie moments of my life. This is not a dinosaur film, but an entertaining (and does not mean) genre of action. I did not see the first two, but when it was judged by the complexity of the plot, I do not think I missed it. I do not want to see a beautiful movie with six packs or herbages, rents this movie, and does not want to go back and watch the 100-year adventure in the cinema,
