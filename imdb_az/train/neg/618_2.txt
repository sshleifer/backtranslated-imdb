Probably one of the worst teenage animated cartoons I've ever seen. I'll start with the bad points of the film that covers the whole film. Above all, nothing can be done from anyone: MEN'S OPERATION. They took a casual boy on the street for what I gave them. Secondly, LEGAL / INJURED CHARACTER WORKS / DEVELOPMENT. You know half of the children killed here. All of this is in some way or another way. The scary character was overthrown and became a cheap rip-off of other great fantasy killers like Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOG: Fear was a terrible laugh that would make you laugh because it was terrible. Just like the "Let's get some small animals tortured," lines just like a single eyebrow. Last, but at least: Next: BAD CASTING. How old was the man playing Lester? Like 30? The back of his head revived for God's sake. More about this movie, I can say that it is a "middle class class" effort like cheap special effects, but the point is understood. This is the worst movie in a bad movie. When it comes to seeing what's going to be good, I can say: - Supporting low, low, low-income people can help sleepless sleep. Very cheap laugh, even a giggle.
