Hazzard Dukes are a great success? A $ 53 million movie is worse than any episode of a 25-year-old downmarket television show. The area is fairly talented, but mindless fun can be found and casting is quite strange: The hero of Johnny Knoxville is more passionate, M.C. Gainey's Sheriff Roscoe, a gentle thief, is a tedious look of Michael Weston's Enos, a very striking look by Willie Nelson, with Burt Reynolds, waiting for the desert, with a little bit of old movies, at least for Boss Hogg is a curious choice, but there is a good moment with a heckler and a hundred-dollar law. Do you have difficulty in a movie when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic displays? The worst case scenario is Jay Chandrasekhar's hopeless direction: it seems like a funny time conception without being able to do more than two basic shooting and as it seems to be a shooting of a car. Stunts in the film it seems to be determined to remove any sign. In every episode there are neat post-modern moments that swirl around the Confederate Flag and Daisi's stereotypical role, but Hal Needham does not have any movies that lick the days when things like that could be good (and bad) when directing such things.
