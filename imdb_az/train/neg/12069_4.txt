A grade film director Carl Monson was one of the most productive directors in the low-budget gory mayhem industry. His films are full of strange, funny players, boring subfields and weak dialogues. The mysterious black-haired family kills their guests at home. Unfortunately, this movie is almost dry. You really do not see the murders, except for shadows and a few blood splatters. Speed ​​is lethargic and the plot is quite uninteresting. competent, but the disadvantages and disadvantages disappointed me. More than 10 generous. Just be careful not to mistake the Monson film with the equally poor "Blood Law" of Andy Milligan.
