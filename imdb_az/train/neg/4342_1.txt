I have to say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. They were quite a good storyline to go, but much worse than messed up with it. First of all, the railroad is completely wrong, it came from van peeble (crap actor btw) and puff daddy where ??? It appears that Carlito came from the title and used to hang on some real idiots. This film is not justified by Carlitos Way. If I first saw this trash, I had never given the pacino version the chance to go before the Carlito's Way tale. And in any case, pacino's reading this story seems to be the same, and instead has finally come to an end. Carlito's path: rise to power - from 10 to 1. Carlito's path is 10 to 9.
