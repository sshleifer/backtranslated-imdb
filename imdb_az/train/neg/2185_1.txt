And suddenly, unfortunately, and because of his rescue, his fianc√© cut his head in a traffic accident, because he was responsible. He keeps his head in a pan (or strudel) with grief and fills it with "adreno-serum" (sic) to keep him alive. And then he wakes up, though his neck has been clearly violated in the vocal cords of his head (speaking so), he has no mouths, so he could not speak. Unfaithful b * fiance does not appreciate everything he does for her. Just like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Therefore, the sadness becomes horniness because she seeks to vaccinate her beloved first bleb bimbo body, which can drive her head out of the street.
