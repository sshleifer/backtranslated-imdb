Towards the end of these trillers, Ally Sheedy's last daytime image is used to create more than one hauntingly bad image of creation. He can brilliantly perform the role of the evil Bette Davis type. Unfortunately, I can not find many reasons to see this. If you're wondering if Shady looks like an old glasses (but why?) You have the answer here. For the rest, Sally Kirkland's sexually abusive woman is really tiring and even wanting something more, and we must admit that the tension has deteriorated during these scenes. Savage's insurance agent's drunken rabble causes the same disappointment, but at least it's a small role. Among the actors, Nicholas Walker does not give any sympathy for the difficulty of Paul Keller, and his toy is wooden. Dara Tomanovic is better and she's a little rising during scenes with Sheedy. Shady's careful and efficient performance (although often appearing on an automatic pilot) is admirable, and the rest is beyond the context. The devices are mixed, camera work is inconvenient.
