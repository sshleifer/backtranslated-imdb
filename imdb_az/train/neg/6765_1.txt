* Spoiler * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is a brutal critic of the violent media abuse. However, this argument does not take into account the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could portray serial killers as innocent, inhumane killers of innocent people and would be able to meet with anxious media in an unhappy way. Instead, he justifies them. The film describes itself as someone who is worthy of harming the victim. Stone, who deals with harmful stereotyping, provides victims with unpleasant cartoons - silence, broken English-speaking immigrants, and lazy fat people. Homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. Of course, they use old, hallucinogen-american-indian - because they are fashionable, dude? Let's give it an astonishing character. Fat, Chinese officials and "hicks" are not uncool, so look like they deserve to die. Instead of defective, hateful, bad deeds, their sadness makes them happy and loves them more. Mickey and Mallory are made sexually and cool and surreal visuals are linked to more impressive people. Justice is fair. Police and prison officials are described as cruel, ugly and cowardly compared to GQ killers. Still, the film is not a reality in the film, not in media reports. There is no nuance or delicacy in the film - it's just improvised performances and visuals. The film's violent decision is not something new or special. The actual real world reactions that prove that the film's message failed. Some of the impressive young people who watched this film inspired them for their crimes. The "message" of the film is a failure, because people lead a counter-productive lifestyle. Smart message is not in one place to be seen.
