My guess is that the director / writer tells something. Let's see what could happen ... a. The fog storms would be creepy? b. Can I say "C" a few times as Tom Cruise and look like bad Patrick Rafter? c. Break my spouse and say "F" every 2 seconds. When I looked aside, I really liked the storm and the frost. The rest were relentless, long-lasting (slightly modified), a very neat failure. I'm very glad you are! <br /> <br />
