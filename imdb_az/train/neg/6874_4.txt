Jean-Marc Barr (Being Light, Big Blue, Dogville) directed this strange film and interpreted it as the second trilogy. I can be wrong, but I do not think of a part of the manifesto of the Dogma '95 manifesto. I'm not sure what I think about this movie. All actors are good. They deliver exceptionally good performances, especially Rosanna Arquette and Jean-Marc Barr. The story is a little interesting. I do not know, there's something about the movie I do not like. Sex scenes are a very long way. I'm going to go through an interesting erotic piece of craftwork, exactly where it stands. Of course, this is not a bad movie, but I will not see what I can not tell them to avoid telling them. Save as much as you want. If you think you're curious and open-minded, you can do it.
