Speaking of the conventions in the city of Nevada, Elvis Presley's strange comic serendipity with a cosmetic merchant entering into the sea ... and accidentally killed him with a little sin. Kim Basinger likes to shoot interesting films to play, but still a charming player of a significant merit, but this terrible scenario (by Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) does not have a good luck. Stereotypes and low ball gags are not meant to be a classic comedy squad, even shambling, embarrassing levels, picture crude and sloppy. If you are watching, there are many outside shots behind the pink Cadillac's wheel, and you always have a non-plussed appearance in the same position and face. Hopefully both he and Elvis were well paid. NO STARS from ****
