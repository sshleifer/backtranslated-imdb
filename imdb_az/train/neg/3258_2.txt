DOC SAVAGE: BRONZE MAN (1 outta 5 star) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dreadful, and five assistants, all professionals working in a number of areas will be able to fight against evil. It was a pretty hockey series ... but when I was a teenager it was a little fun to read. I knew Ron (Tarzan) shot the 1970s movie version of Ely ... but I have not seen it. I would not play in theaters where I live and do not show on television. Now that I've finally seen why I can understand why. The plot and the heroes are not treated seriously ... it's like any kind of tongue-cheek and campy ... like the old Batman TV series ... just without the benefit of being funny ... or any visual longing. Rooted dialogue, special effects with cheese, mute styles, angry mobility scenes and bad, bad behavior. In fact, I find something attractive in his filth ... Maybe I thought? Arnold Schwarzenegger is known to play a leading role in bringing up a modern agenda ... but I do not think it would be better.
