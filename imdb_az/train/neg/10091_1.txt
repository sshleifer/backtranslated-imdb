I do not believe this movie was created. I believe that the director is trying to create a work of art, but it is even worse. The zombie eyes seem to apply too much eye makeup. The zombie movie is only a few minutes away. Finally, there are five or six zombies, not a nation. The best part of the film, if any, is definitely a loan because the painful experience is finally over. To replicate other user comments, voodoo priestesses are strange and not very significant in the entire film. In addition, there is no sense in the sense that there is a snake and a scene with a romantic girl. Never been disclosed.
