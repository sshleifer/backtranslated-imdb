In standard view, this is a completely scary movie. However, the unwanted comedy scale is a perfect score. As I watch this movie, I can imagine a few actual comedies that make me difficult. The ghost that Andy Griffiths produced in a local American dance dance makes everything hysterical. I'm not going to slide into the video store to get into the boiler or power, but if you put on the couch in the morning and watch on TV, check it out.
