A group of children set up a theater all night to watch a horror film marathon. But just as it happened at night, some of them kill each other. Who ... and why? I saw it in a theater way in 1991. I was waiting for him - but boy! It never worked. The stage is good, they have a very pleasing young cast like Dee Wallace Stone on the boat and have some advantages ... but it does not work. The story ceases to be half (due to some major editorials before the release of the film), the murders are relatively flawless (this R rating is above me) and, at the end, it was boring and stupid to open the murderer. <br /> <br /> It's really bad - this movie has potential. With a better script, this could be a great fear film. Although it's mostly forgotten and looks embarrassed by the cast itself (I heard Stone say it's not about something). I give it 3 and it's just for casting.
