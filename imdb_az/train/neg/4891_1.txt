I want to clarify a few things. I'm not familiar with Ming-liang Tsai's films, and I've been familiar with art cinema; <br /> <br /> Art films were truly ART; as dyes. People have done this to express their inner feelings, and will not really worry if they understand something else. They were beyond commercial values; <br /> <br /> The Wayward Cloud has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> This is an opportunity film to deceive judges and critics by playing a lot of things without saying something. The lack of water encourages the government to nourish watermelons. A desperate girl, public baths steal water from the WC. There is a porn start (adjacent) trying to take a movie with an invisible actress who feels comfortable with her. There are several romantic wakes up between the girl and the porn star. The delivery ends with a sex scene (not pornographic) that many people are shocked, but less likely to be seen by the American Pie or Violence History. <br /> <br /> Two basic characters never speak. Sometimes a musical number explains and explains what happens in characters in 60 styles (with one song). These video clips really come out because people just looking at each other without previous scenes, dialogues or music, often take 4, 5 or more minutes in the movie. <br /> <br /> There are a few things about "It's hard to get sex without love," and "the human mind of the pornographic industry." <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, this film festival is designed to deceive jury and critics. There are a few lying shock scenes (within the censorship of Taiwan) and many topics are open, but nothing has been closed and is nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> These tricks have won a number of (controversial) assessments in the film and won a commercial success that was not worthy of the film (I saw the French movie and the theater was full). <br /> <br /> But, please do not be fooled. There is nothing new or original in this movie, or nothing at all in the movie. Heavy and empty; really a fraud for the public. Boogie Nights (I really did not like it), Sincerity and 9 Songs are better movies.
