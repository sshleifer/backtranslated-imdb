You need to give a warning about the need for watching the movie. It is almost an insult to the courageous men who do not give such a magnificent amount of money. The special impact was terrible, and I did not expect the general failure of the director's military technique assessment. How can a machine gun fire at about 1/10 be shot 600 times per minute? How can it come up when a bomb exploded in front of soldiers? How can people survive when they have 20 feet of artillery shells? <br /> <br /> The Caucasian was killing me. Yes, these standard dialogues were met by the LOC line after the Hindustan me hai and Pakistan's abolition. <br /> <br /> Shobha De is the truth that he wrote. The director worked and showed without a sketch. No movie stream available. There is no progress gradually going from one battle to another. This is a next weapon shot that is not related to the overall scheme of the war. The scenes are terrific. Head of Army Staff does not seem convincing. They did not show a film within a three-hour period, according to a four-hour film to further aggravate the surprising issues.
