<br /> <br /> This, other reviews, tells a story, can give the viewer all the smoke and mirrors, but still curses. <br /> For 30s art deco (my favorite), and I think the idea of ​​using all digital origin can be a wave of the future of the film. However, it is clear that the filmmaker is interested in the digitalization of the film and has forgotten to shoot many scenes, which is a great help to this stunningly inspired film. (SPOILER) They began crying in a loud voice, forgot about the existence of a villain! Okay, they have one, but the film's death took place for 20 years. Conran misses a point of escape from a villain. As for the action, the Sky Captain (the Law) has shot a robot before a duel (Dex (Ribisi) stops firing on them), and most robots spend most of their time losing their time and fighting for battles. Polly or Peggy or Punky, or something completely wasted in this movie (a reviewer who commented on who and Kim's law on the Chemistry issue) and I was a little sick to see the recurring shots of a camera, he only said in the TWO TIMES showing that both were frustrated after the film, one of them was unusual and quite funny. Nobody except the law and Paltrow have no significance on the screen, and this is the true defect of the film. A spectator is not certain of robots, but a hero to root and need a distinguished foreigner to hate. Without that, plus a good story story, will help the whole CG of the world.
