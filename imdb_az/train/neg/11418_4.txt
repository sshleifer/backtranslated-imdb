Joel Schumaker is the author of the script he wrote and owns a group of Georgetown band facing adults. The storyline is a mess, but some scenes are really good. There are many talents and time here. Casting is more effective than film. Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. The most prominent is McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is pretty surprising. It is not so easy when it comes to age.
