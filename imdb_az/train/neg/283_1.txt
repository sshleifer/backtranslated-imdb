I felt as if this movie falls below the budget and lower everything after school exams. It was supposed to have some kind of inspirational film, but it did not work for me. Flash Dance like preachy.it has many pale shades, but what? This movie is not just an excitement. compile a dialogue and clichéd for death. Of course, all the movie feels like a bad 80 cliché. the actors were even better, although there is much to do with what actors are doing (or not). There is, however, a bad song selection with really bad words. all actors were involved. All of them are talented, but you can not tell about this movie. This is of course my opinion, but the Flying AKA Dream is a 1/10
