Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) was not so stupid, but the 'Blue Desert' could have a semi-acceptable and more unpleasant excitement potential. When a victim of another attack on the streets of New York, the comic book artist Roberts moves from the West to a small town. In his early days, he faced suspiciously bare Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer, who played this part well) and eventually would not leave him. Undoubtedly, the friendly city police, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, convinced of red lanterns that the author did not seem to be convincing enough), feared for his safety after two occasions before. Smith needs Roberts co-operation because he says that Atkins is guilty and guilty of sexual assault. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Cops do not have evidence to put it in the past. <br /> <br /> The film has enough structure to shoot at least an interesting movie because it should rely on Roberts soon enough. However, as Roberts's character does not react to simple questions, as any reasonable person thinks, most of the intended suspension seems very difficult. And his delayed answers allow the majority of this loss to be easily and unquestionable, especially in the finals. Perhaps Sweeny is the wrong choice for this role; many infants reminisce Kevin Anderson's identity as "lying in the enemy". Or, if Lisa Roberts is written to a more powerful character, this is enough. Meanwhile, the film is not as big as B-triller.
