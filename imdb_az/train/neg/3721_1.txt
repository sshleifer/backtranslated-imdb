The two films are useful for people to scare God and this Event Horizon. One has a significant and surprising message, both of which can be a religious film, as well as a dimension. Too bad Paul Anderson went to the damned Resident Evil movies, and there was really something. <br /> <br /> It is clear that at night there is a thief, many prominent independent film features (acting, storytelling, dialogue and convictions) and the intentions of the movie. The Christian film industry did not learn from this failure, and we were compressed by the Omega Code, Left, and other Tribulation films. Their main element is worrying about selling their message: "Detainees, peoples!" <br /> <br /> Generally, this is what I wrote about a movie that's ineffective. In general, I do not believe. Completely leave and return to Sam Neil's eyes. 5 out of 1.
