it comes with a brilliant amount of fragile dialogue, shallow area lines and cheese comebacks, with ABC family charge blockbuster "more inexpensive" attempts. With two good players from many people, this movie was a big disappointment. His Hollywood-wannabe ditto is a filthy area now. After all, most people would have been softer because they needed actors. Thus, the actor is not five stars. The area moved pretty fast and the curls were bad and terrible time. The character of the characters and the "last relationship" were too soft and clich√© for me. Protect yourself and rent something better.
