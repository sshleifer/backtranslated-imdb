Tori complained when he first treated his lover as a robot and then appeared to be a designer of artificial intelligence for a new comrade (killer)? I think so. Scenes for the cigar tasting: montages bolore, a lantern with a kimono (what you say when you put your clothes in a suitcase instead of seduce) and a climate fight on skis! Adjust absolutely for the start and end, but you can get a sandwich during the second move when the entire plot occurs. Is CO-ED CALL better than GIRL? Nah. Tori to this paradise, even snow? Nope.
