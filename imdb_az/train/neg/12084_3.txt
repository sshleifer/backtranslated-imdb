Copy of scene design. <br /> <br /> "Hamlet, Prinz von Dannemark" <br /> <br /> I listened to Hamlet's radio show with Maximilian Schell. Hamlet and I were very disappointed. I hope that filming will be better, Schell will have a body language to emphasize at least what he says. Then set ... minimalist design is not everyone's taste, but usually it's just enough on the stage to figure out what the scene is and what's more. Unfortunately, on a scene, in a theater. In fact, it will not work in a movie based on a game with convincing parameters. The idea of ​​the set was that Schell was copied from the theater production where Hamlet played ... If only for this complaint, let me say ... I asked myself that Schell was able to get a portion of Hamlet first and Hamlet was the second to play he said he could give. If you have a choice to choose one of the six films based on the "Hamlet" movie, this is a tracking if you're not a masochist or really want to have fun in hardcore or untalented actors.
