Films like Resident Evil must be a purely clear rule, not the spirit of blowing everything possible in the spirit of the game. RE was a surviving horror game and was one of the damnable effective, yet Paul WS Anderson was able to come up with any other video game movie. In the dark, just like Resident Evil is the same spirit, so the director is not a movie movie, but rather a part of the brain to make a film of fear. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Only in the dark" film proves that there is no longer any hope for the release of video games. <br /> <br /> This body, though not obviously a matter, has many problems with the film. The film stops after just a minute and sits simply when you hit the rest of the object and begins with things that can be described as a five-minute scroll text. There is something about a children's home, some artifacts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy, and some demons, all of which combined with the fact that the audience could not really follow. It moves to the floor and place in the form of a cartoon, and some have great structures for meaningless deaths. Basically, I can understand that some demons were released and Edward Carnby (Slater) has some connections with some of the operations that have been given to children in the orphanage that led to his failure. He finds a work of art that covers the demons, and brings an old girlfriend anthropologist (Reid), of course, without any cause, immediately maintains a sexual relationship. <br /> <br /> In some cases hell remains empty, and couples end with a military group led by several team teams (Dorff). As you can see, there is mutual hatred for Carnby. <br /> <br /> Everything is ridiculous, and I'm not really sure why it's tricky and desperate, but it does not really care about anyone. <br /> <br /> If you recommend, do not recommend this film, recommend the opium ball or something if you are recommending it. <br /> As terrible as at least one should lead? Extreme bad, this film is like any other destroyed shit that has never happened, and is therefore part of the main chickens, with enough speed cut. <br /> <br /> <strong> The first scene of a man with Cranby's follow-up is one of the worst I have never witnessed, and the rest are good. The jinn seem cool, even if the ghunes are eliminated from their effects when they are powdered. The scenes covering a large number of weapons that need to be cool to watch, such as the light source of the light and the approach of the instrument, and faster panoramic fire than a crack addict. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, children spend the night in bed. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; Slater is not something that's important to the whole movie, though it's more talent that lets you do it, despite some talent <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If such a spirit breaks, Samus Aran's murder with a Middle East AK-47 and his fight with Tommy Vercetti's alien group, but unlike Resident Evil, this is not worthy of a second chance because nothing I do not think it can help to forget how terrifying it is.It is not mild, uninteresting, and apparent, it is equivalent to diarrhea; <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div > <div style = "text-align: justify;">
