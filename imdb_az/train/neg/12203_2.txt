I think that John Rambo is still alive and trying to put him behind Vietnam. This series is old and Rambo is no longer a solider, a cold-blooded murderer. Someone is dying on the screen. It was not a fun place in Vietnam, and it seemed to me that I liked Hollywood. This is not the worst movie in Vietnam, but it goes to John Waynes Green Beret. In any case, John Rambo is an insult to the majority of the Viet Cong army, and is also an insult to many Russia, taking around 50 pounds of Machine Gun. Finally, at the end Rambos is a cheesy exit ... Please !! Yes, I heard you do something else ...
