This movie was a delusional trash. You did not know what happened. The heroes were poorly written, and in most cases they were not indifferent, except for Huss (except George Eads skillfully performed). I hate this movie, but it should have earned an Academy Award (Dark Harvest, Dracula's curse) against others. It was especially sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a shameless and sticky film. Life has sank as if you were all new. No one should be sure that this director will work again in the movie. But it was also a fear movie, because scare was more funny. Shame for lifetime, for shame.
