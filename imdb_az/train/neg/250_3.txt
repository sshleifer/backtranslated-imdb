When I see the other three versions of the same movie, I'm scared that it's the weakest thanks to Scott's pretty entertaining and constructive performance. All his emotions are similar in that it is difficult to participate in the film. The role of Alistair Sim has forever improved. While Scrooge respects himself, Scott says a lot of love dialogue and is incredible when he is exposed to his metamorphosis. I do not think any actor that is compatible with the Alistair Sim version of this movie. Even the music version (and clearly the Muppets) is doing it better. Very disappointing.
