Hello, from Denmark, and one day with my friends for a movie night. Someone brought this movie with the "Russian terminator" and it was terrible. After watching less than half a minute, I decided to stop only some of the ridiculous "highlights" or say "low lights" in the movie. It was a fact that I was surprised to find out that this movie was originally made in my home country of Denmark ... this should be the biggest mistake in the country.
