This game was made by Sega. I did not expect much from Sega, but I did not expect this too. For starters, camera angles work against you in this game. Motorcycle is a tool around you. Motorcycle is the worst part of the game. When you join something, you just stay there and you do not move. You will never get rid of the bicycle or the issue. The main character speaks tough, even though it is a suitable voice. Graphs are horrible. On your bike you walk through the trees. The camera fights without the enemy. This game was not even worth the rent.
