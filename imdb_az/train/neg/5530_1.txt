The worst of many problems with this film is persistence; and while trying to revise the VHS for a college cable channel a year ago, I tried to figure out exactly what went wrong. What can happen is that they actually took a long film and then cut it off from a standard theater scene. How long? we will require a further three-hour narrative and character development to fill all the holes in this area. In particular, the film we are making is very slow and self-critical. <br /> This is surprising; Why would the Halperins be here? The previous film, White Zombie, was a successful low-budget attempt to duplicate early Universal Studios monster films (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.) and thus became closer to the zombie mythology that would be known to those in North America. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the zombies revolt, it seems to have meant some allegory for modern warfare policies. This explains the opening and Dean Jagger's character as a megalomaniac change, and explains that the zombies really do not do much in the movie, standing beside himself, watching for fear and expecting commands. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not like it for the modern war and its policy "- but I think it's not simply allegorical soldiers, but zombie films, not haters, but hate it. the film should be fun first, after all, maybe education. And definitely - the movie about the zombies should be about zombies. <br /> <br /> I really do not recommend one of the most strange films in Hollywood history, and I even recommend it for a historical value.
