There was a big movie about Steve Bikoya. Unfortunately, this is not. Denzel Washington is never the most agile actor of the actors - it is unable to convey the great character of Biko. The big crowd of Attenburton laughs. Soweto's massacres did not happen like this, and the soldiers were happy to go to their weapons with three clean lines of children (some made carpets!). With Biko'nun dead, the film flies rapidly. The fight against the apartheid was a struggle of the black nation, though it was still a matter of a white man and his family. I am convinced that Donald Woods was a decent man and he would be the first person to say that Biko was important during his absence. Penelope Wilton's accents are pure Hampshire and appear to be completely unknown to South Africa. all. The tree's family gets more lines than the dog's black servant. When I saw the family as a woman, I saw the movie - by chance, in a big, full movie, just one of the many black guys - "It sounds like a musical". There was a point. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a fairly liberal liberal goodwill film about the struggle of a radical black people. And really, there is a need for good-minded white liberals like South Africa needs a hole.
