History is right? Hmm ... Probably if you twist and the light probably is. However, clarity is not accurate, sad, weak and incompatible, reimbursement of cardboard dialogue and no compensation for a dissatisfied result. The main characters are simply characterized; "shameful and noble" embarrassing stereotypes from American hinders, "fused, but sadistic" from British officers. A striking and dismal performance of an interesting era in American history. I want my money back.
