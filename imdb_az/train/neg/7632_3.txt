Many people see it as classic, but obviously I must have left something. At the beginning of the 50's, Anarene was extremely bored in Texas life - a film about life in Anarende, Texas in the early 50's, would be quite delicate! How many people do you see in this business? After showing the last picture in the anarende, nothing really happens in the city. Duane (Jeff Bridges) gives this point to the end of the movie. But before closing, there's not much to do, so basically everything is sexually explicit. Secondary school students are planning to lose some of their adolescents, sometimes with some adults who are sometimes bored with each other in the city. You see, they do not have much to do - except to talk about sexual intercourse (sometimes with one another, sometimes with bored teens) or a local school football team. It was three times that I thought it would add a spark to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but really there is nothing else but Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), but nothing happens because Joe Bob (Barclay Doyle) misses a little girl. The only thing that dramatically adds to the film is the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms), and these people are really paying attention to the hollow of life in this pitiful little town, as they stand around while looking at the body's discussion. <br /> <br /> Piter Bogdanovich drew it in black and white, and I did not want to show that this city was gray, but the only thing I was seeing was the early appearance of actors Bats, Shepherds, Bridges and Randy Quaid. (On the one hand, how much Quaid - in 1971 - is similar to the character of Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation films). I do not think so! 3/10
