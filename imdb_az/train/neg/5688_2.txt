Short version: Weaving is nothing. It is only derivative and low. And soulless. <br /> <br /> Long version: If you have not seen any of the movies of the "psychological horror" genre set out indefinably, this movie will probably melt your face. Maybe not, but it will give you a good fuel. Opening of real animal use, cruelty videos will be enough to open your eyes and perhaps you will be able to manage an unforgettable scene later in the movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the movies are not going to come to the movie. <br /> <br /> But you do not have much experience with this genre. <br /> <br /> "August Underground's Penance", for example, you will find it extremely difficult to stay awake until the end of the movie as I did. <br /> <br /> The reviewers have compared it to old video nasties. I understand this comparison. Like video nasties, "Seeds" are less intense and less sophisticated than the main fear film. But the video nasties are still unknown to us, the reason is not just for the above mentioned reasons - something that is still popular is special. <br /> <br /> Give Gabriele Krisanti, the director of the Grave Land, a new question on this subject. - Work DVD: "We will never have such films because today's technology is far from imagination and technology is cold, many things will disappear, because smaller films will not be produced yet, great, exceptional tricks are too expensive, but cold. Today is a horror, a terrorist movie worth over a million dollars, these movies are not so expensive ... the real effects of our hands "<br /> <br /> Probably, it is wrong to approach the old school horror very seriously . But Crisanti hit the nail at his head. Even the richest abusive video nasties perform the best primitive "truth". And Boll is the place where he falls short. She has seen the movies and does not understand them. There is everything in the checklist ... BS is about "making a statement about humanity," an immoral torture scene, and so on. But Crisanti is "cold" as it puts it. Gore is all CGI. All these are perceived as scenes from other films of different genres. And pacing slowly. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> <br /> Poor film.
