Do not be deceived as I am the 'shimmering' comments taken from the DVD box. "Charming fun", "Seriously terrible freakout" and worst, "WITH PANLA JAWS". This movie is not one of the above. <br /> <br /> I'm not worried about typing badly at movies, but I do not believe that relaxing at IMDB at 7 pm. <br /> <br /> After the attack by a monster put on by natural scientists, this film is not going anywhere and goes sloooowly there. Basically and surprisingly, a girl was abducted by a monster (I will give them points for a good creation design, but this is not WETA creation) and her semi-comic family is watching her for an hour ... in the canalization of the Han River. There is no retreat in their search, yet someone called it parallel to Jaws? And when you see it, you've considered it pretty senseless. <br /> <br /> A large part of the film is committed to a government quarantine, reaching a comic space where a man spits a stick in front of a public bus stop. <br /> <br /> Blech. That was bad. I'm not kidding. Want to see a rotten monster movie? Deep Rising Rental. You will live at least 30 minutes.
