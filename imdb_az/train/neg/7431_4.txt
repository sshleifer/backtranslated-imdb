In 1972, MATRON's release was released and it became apparent that the series ended with natural entries like the CLEO, COPY and SOLUTION of the 60s until the end of the 60's. MATRON is not a bad thing at all, we have first found it in a thin area (although a group of spivs who want to enter the hospital for a contraceptive pill plan to sell to a third world) is a bit funny, inadequate nature. I think that is where the problem is - gags is not entertaining with the informal nature that starts to age. Do we need a movie that uses a man dressed as a woman to manage the field? Perhaps the worst criticism was in the second half of my day, and at least twelve hours ago I saw Carry at Mathron, and I have a problem to remember a very funny line. This is a serious problem for comedy
