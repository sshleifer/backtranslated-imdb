It's an interesting idea (four African American women who have been crushed under the hood of a society have been revenged by banks) F. Gary Gray's awful slow course and an exciting script (with Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) is packed with unwanted moments. Gray, Bufford, and Lanier, instead of giving a neutral comment on the role of urban women who are struggling to remain in a world of cruel abuse and humiliation by those who pretend to be an excuse for high-level operative tragedy. Melodrama in the worst case. Gray has actors playing on every tired line, and John Carter's lazy editor refuses to select the camera to perform the teaching of the unkind faces of the performers. Although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox (Queen Latifah fourth actress and excellent actress), need more hands than Gri to guide them, resulting in dusk and anxiety in front of the camera. Avoid it.
