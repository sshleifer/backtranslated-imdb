What did Franco Zeffirelli think? Is Hollywood responsible for this travesty, or can I find comfort in the idea that a person who does not speak the English as a first language completely misses the classic point of Charlotte Bronte? I do not think I'll be able to improve in a statement I read, as I will only explain it: "Jane Eyre is a great book, a script for a while." True, the two potentials of this film were very regrettable. But, unfortunately, the actor left all the good scenes. Jane and Rochester have a common sense of mind and reflective of the concept ... deleted from the script. Marriage proposition, praise wires ... went on. <br /> <br /> Zeffirelli felt the importance of rewriting all the writings. <br /> <br /> The end of the <strong> novel and the relationships with the Cheney Rivers family. <br /> <br /> He is merciless because he has surgically elevated the love of one of his love stories. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a blessing and find the Mini-series in 1983 (along with Timothy Dalton).
