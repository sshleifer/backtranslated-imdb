Everyone who believes that this film is not appreciated for the funny genius must smoke with two stoneware film. This movie is a poor film ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> This film and Naked Gun or Airplane should not be compared, because the next two films are well written and funny. Class Reunion is what these things are. The sad thing has such potential (good casting, good story lines), but it is small and far between good jokes. The scenes that should be laughable were smoother than fun. Stoner kids, vampire, blind girl ... FUNNY. <br /> <br /> The National Lamp has made some beautiful films (Animal House, Vacation), but not one of them. I, of course, more than John Hughes expected.
