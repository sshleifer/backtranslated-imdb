That same day, like Ayn Rand, Bigelow threw a bomb on a roadside bombarded by nickname, ruthless, kidnapped Arab terrorists described in a hometown of several hummer American hits. Bigelow exploded in a dusty, hot, ugly debris in Iraq and a new hero was born, as a veteran bomb exploded, because of the Iraq war on the background of the great drama of the human drama. <br /> <br /> The new boy John Hershey says in the book and then the film, The War Lover, describes it as a sadistic wing that is really not suitable for civilian life and requires warfare. to alleviate his immoral sexual desires and drown. The lover of war can only function fully in the war, drowning in time of peace. When Hershey punished a war lover, Bigelow honored him (played by one of his greatest roles by Steve McQueen). The army needs warlike lovers, they are protected against the protection of our enemies. We can not control the true truth, the best soldiers, and the hard-core fighters. According to Unironic Bigelow, regular men pussies, special lover of war lover, latest cowboys. And if he wants to retake his men or want to please an Iraqi boy? He is a religious denomination of sex and death. In the war, sex does not mean something that is ungrateful, lover, don't-asking, not a male affair. Bigelow does not care about it; it limits the personality choices in this kind of attempt at realism. Only one war love, between right and wrong, can be a moral struggle between American innocence and Arabian betrayal. Bigelow hides racism and arrogance behind the attractive front of journalism. <br /> <br /> On the political front, Bigelow returns to the western genre and recurring clich√©s, repeatedly says: The beautiful world of an open border is the country of another. ("You can hit people here", says a soldier); difficult, but human black man's companion, a soldier with a premonition of death, probably a crazy commanding officer, college-educated fool who tries to keep in touch with the enemy. <br /> <br /> Some people love it. <br /> <br /> Therefore, she loves the love of a great boy, but Bigelow plays straight. she does not perform sex, she only strives. If Bigelow really wants to show us, it is the ugly, confused face of the Arabian enemy. Every Iraqi person who is in actual evil is not oppressed, hostile, or any kind of good. All of these are worthy of death for heartache, and many are involved in this glyp gore-fest film. The Iraqi women are amazed, they are known only for their screams. For all that I know, drifting men can be men who are tired, you will not see their faces. <br /> <br /> <strong> Women's losses in Iraq will definitely denied. <br /> <br /> Bigelow carries all the actions one by one. He glorifies the war, and sharpens his sadistic heroes. Cowboys surrounding Subhuman Hindus prove themselves by fulfilling God's work and replacing the hellish hell with the perfect bravado and suicide mania. Until the end, I felt like roots for the Indians. In the Bigelow world, no compassion and understanding has never succeeded. The Iraqis were taken to the highest level. The killing of civilians is simply a dramatic assurance of the heroic psychological struggle of our heroes. Each USS finds the bullet mark. You need to love this guy, the love of war. Only his way, he is a real hero. He is a person who only wants to do a hard job and, therefore, he desires to taste.
