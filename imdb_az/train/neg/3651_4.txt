I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I bought a movie with some funny jokes and just did not do a lot of work. I did not like the idea of ​​bringing the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. It was confused. Only Moriarty's resurrection would be more laughable if one was new. Some things were funny. Burt Kwouk was as laugh as ever. McCloud on the horse was funny. McGarrett, 5-0 from Hawaii, was not even named as McGarrett. Connie Booth, of course, is very good with emphasis. He is Indian, but he has played well as English and New Yorker. Unfortunately, he did not offer much of the script. I was expecting a more funny movie. Instead, there is a very complex movie with a poor script. It was very ironic because Booth and Cleese were both in one place. Maybe they wanted to break in 77.
