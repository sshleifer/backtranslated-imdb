How loathed is this craze! But it's only an hour and I'm paying for it, so I'm going to live ... Unlike all the players in the 1933s that are all these days. So a small village has begun to turn all its blood into dried corpses. Local spots are, of course, talking vampires and sounds a bit higher after each body is found. Anything played by City Sheriff or Constable or Great Actor Melvyn Douglas is trying to tell them in a different way. Recalling that the dead had a great hole on each side of the neck and that there were no two closest spaces, the locals say that a huge vampire bat. He says there is no constellation vampire and that a man should be guilty of being killed. <br /> <br /> But Melvyn does not worry about two ways. Faye Wray is to enter into his lover's pants. It also seemed that the city played simultaneously with the same role as every movie he played in the mixture of Dwight Frye. The more bats he drowned, he was overwhelmed by the city's inhabitants. Lionel Atwill plays the city doctor who is trying to help the constitutional offense of murder. he was not as sad as any actor. He was close to the carton in this role, as was the case in this role. And Lionel Barrymore is also in this .... a lot of great names like guano. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie, which is very high for me, is better than the legendary "The Blood Sucker", which is also boring and intriguing and simply foolish. The point of the film follows Frye, the strange city is weird, but I did not offer much of this movie. When you look at the strange death cause and look at the special effects that require all these bloodsheds, Bela Lukas has shot many horrible pictures, but at least she was entertaining and exciting. <br /> <br /> If you feel like this really bad Lugosi clunker without Lufos, you'll think about how bad this mess is. <br /> <br /> If the good 1930 movie film is at least Lugosi,
