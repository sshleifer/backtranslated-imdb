I have had a debate about how many people have complained about contemporary movies I've seen so far in the film: "The characteristic development in new films is just as good and not as it was before." Depending on the films, this is partly due to Hollywood dumping, which is based on a variety of things, sometimes common special effects and plotting, but in the case of top-up, unnecessary attempts, like World War I < strong> Public Opinion for Filming the "Art" film and a hopeless fight, movies like dogs' fault. <br /> <br /> How unpleasant and trivial to me is to find them (until I think it's painful to sit on A la Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West, as good as Andrea Rublev and Dogville). I've put this movie for 45 minutes, which is 30 minutes more than the truth. I was not interested in any characters, and we did not find anything beyond the thin cover of the groundless bad. In an attempt to tell something about the cold of society, this film makes it very sincere, unkind, strange and exploitative. Of course, I've seen many awkward movies on the same subject, but there's even better films about pesky people (Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Storytelling, Reverse) with characters that have really great emotional depth and personality. The Dog Days chose not to see any real intelligence about the truth in the truth, but rather to make a dull, terrible and desperate attempt in the "art" because the eighth grade student was nothing more than a betrayal of society. It is not an unknown or illusory observation, but characteristic of society's boards, not just a dull and worthy thing.
