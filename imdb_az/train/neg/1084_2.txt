I leased this DVD for two reasons. Great actors and director's crew, despite Robert Altman's shot or loss. In that case, it was a great miss. The altercation's inaction attempt fell on his chest. After seeing Kenneth Branag in a good movie like "Dead One", I did not think that he would be able to help such a Turk, and I hope he did not destroy his reputation. Robert Duvall lost most of the Oscar winners at once. The lower spiral that operates on such food-and-money movies. Although the best performance was not the "Mercenary Mercy", but the "Big Santini", Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films. This movie really has spent a lot of time. I'll give it to 10 to 2.
