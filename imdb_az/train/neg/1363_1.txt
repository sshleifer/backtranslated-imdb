This movie starts slowly, then rises. I went after watching for an hour and not seeing anything. So nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The heroes are the ones that most dull people know. If the producers try to sell it in the form of "action", they can be claimed in the courtroom. No action. I can say that the same "story" is to be photographed with a few pictures. The script is joke. Just horrible. I doubt any scribbler around the world can save him. My biggest regrets are not 60 minutes of my life watching "Love in Time", but not that I miss a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to go, but I waited a little longer. Instead, I came out with about 20 people.
