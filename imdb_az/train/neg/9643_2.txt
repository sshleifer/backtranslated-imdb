Based on music based on the poorest music under the middle film? Simple Script and Direction filled with wrong scenarios. Salman khan was in his usual behavior. The appearance of the agent, especially Rock Star, was heartfelt. There was only one demonstration of acne. In general, I waste my money in the movie. Salam Khan is 10 years old, compared to Aamir Khan, remains immature. There were many boring songs in the film, except for Man Ko Ati. The most important song to surprise the UK Music Sponsor was unimpressive. "Khanabadosh" can easily be understood by the British Music Sponsor. Another movie I saw last week was "Eight Wake up", although it was a medium-sized music, although it was a good, slow-moving, love story
