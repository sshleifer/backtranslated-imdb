I read very good things about this adaptation of my novel ... because my expectations were constantly crushed. But they were unexpectedly crushed. In any case, in any case, the workers at Toulon transformed a camp into a ship that was changing. slave slaves. Bishop Myriel's scene was beautiful. In fact, except for the shadows, Fantine survived until he quit. Because we do not want bad things to happen to a good woman, she does not cut her hair, sell her teeth, or become a prostitute. He leads the worst to the mayor and spit on his face. Bamatabois is completely eliminated. Though it should not be for the children to marry, Tholomyes is not an irreparable pleasure, but Fantin's dead husband. Valjean can bring fantasy to Cosette before Champmathieu's work, so it brings happiness. Then comes a monastery, which is a difficult scene to force. Fortunately, it was saved. After three minutes of clarity, the film is again facing the Classic Novel Cut. <br /> <br /> Cosette and Valjean go out to Marius' meeting while crossing the park. About Reform in Prison. When he comes to Valjean and Cosette, he says a line that screams in the movie. "We are not revolutionaries". I heard Victor Hugo beat him in his grave. CHANGES IN THE CENTURY They want to rebel against the pseudo-monarchy, rebellious scenarios in favor of another republic! It is a historical fact that the uprising against the government in 1832 took place. <br /> <br /> At one point in Cosette, Marius will give her father a gift for the reform movement and meet with Eponine. Besides ... Eponine is not. Or at least it's Eponine of the book. This Eponine seems to be a good working secretary working for reformists in the prison (they work as Café Cafe Café Café). <br /> <br /> Prison reformers (the most vulnerable under Enjolras) have never been seen. The issuance of ballot papers is not good enough. That is, they will build barricades. I know you, but I have never heard of the reform movements that attacked the streets, barricades, and government forces. About three hundred people (not so many) began to attack the National Power and set up many barricades, and so on. Eponine dies for Marius, thank goodness. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film, Javert's suicide, minuscule screen time and surprisingly insightful thinking are hard to understand. The film, along with Valjean, looks at the Javert jump river. Valjean would never let Javert drown. He saved the life of a man before, and now he dies? <br /> <br /> Valya is totally throwing Marius's confession, his deterioration, and his death on Marius and Cosette after his death. <br /> <br /> In general, I blame the script for problems. Although Enjolras and Epon have at least partly participated in the film, they have been misinterpreted as the whole scene in the bar. Removing the damage caused by Fantine is a great regret for us. This Cosette knows Valjean's past from the beginning. I did not see evenardier and Mme. Thenardier was just a few seconds from the screen. It's the same as Gavroche. I liked the description of Frederick Martin Valjean, one of the paid features of the movie. On the other hand, Charles Laughton misses the mark with Javert for all his good deeds in other films. His lips shivering, shouting unnecessarily, and in general, his actions were completely wrong. Also, like many Javerts I've seen, it does not seem to be intimidating, it's a character. <br /> <br /> Yet, if I did not read this book, that movie would have been better. However, I do not recommend piercing books. I also say that the film would be a good fit for the time.
