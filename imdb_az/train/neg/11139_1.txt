<br /> <br /> There's nothing to say about this movie, it's awful. <br /> <br /> The player and dialogue are even far from ahead, the hybrid wolf's story is not very well explained, and the whole thing is CGI is something you do not want to see. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> </ em> <br /> <strong> Gag reel. Everything else, just spend time and money. I hope nobody will buy this even if it is not worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this.
