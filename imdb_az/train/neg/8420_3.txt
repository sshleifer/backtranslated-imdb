Although it is a perfect cast, this is a disadvantageous film, especially in terms of aviation. Sometimes it may be better than "von Richthofen and Brown". "Blue Max" is the best of a small market for the last 35 years and is fun when "Darling Lilli" is not accepted seriously. It is interesting to speculate what ILM can do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new, high quality WW I aero movie.
