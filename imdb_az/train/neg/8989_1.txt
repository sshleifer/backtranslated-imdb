There are some good things about the movie. Music and cinematography are great. Alex Wilson gives a warm and great performance. Ryan Bauer is also hot. The production actually gave them the production value and they delighted in the production. Many guys in the movie Jonny Vincent (Sean) are also very cute. Why is Amy playing the actress with a credit? Brandon Alexander performs a great comedy like Clitarissa Pink. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the film is probably the star James Townsend. He can not move. He is very scary, though not beautiful. His weapons are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They do not have muscle tones. You do not have to shoot your own movie and leave it alone. No one will lose it. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is not as convincing as a gay friend because she is gay friend. If they want the best of the film, they should lead someone else. Still, maybe he wants to use this movie as a tool to launch a mildly basic porno career, perhaps with some actor classes, because he certainly does not function realistically. Sonja Fisher does not look like any actress, but all this is a movie The soft-core porno and Skinemax are no better, even though Alex Wilson is probably the best thing about this movie, so embarrasses, and does not want to be related to it.There is no picture on the IMDb page and there is nothing in the list, That's why Alex Wilson is probably a scene name, and, of course, I have just fled in West Hollywood for a while, and when I talk about it, she turned around and I understand.
