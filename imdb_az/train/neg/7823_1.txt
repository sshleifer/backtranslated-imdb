This movie was thought to be very weak in all respects, except for technological. I stood and watched the body of everyone in the theater, their faces in front of their eyes, and wondered whether their neighbors were alone when they were watching. That is, the movie really can be bad. No one will accept it, and the Emperor does not have a classic job. "Whom do I ask a movie that stops the jet liner?" But in fact, every member of the audience thinks what I'm writing. I really do suicide their faces. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Lois is only moving forward by the authorities, Superman will not have a cup of coffee with Supermen and his watchdog. From his "eyes" he can not see the depth or the like of his soul. In the Old Supermans, it was of a related level, it was not primarily crucial, but strengthened his "torn" character. Henry Kissinger, this would have won Lois in front of Clark Kent. <br /> <br /> And now, official, Kryptonite, Superman is not eating anything in McDonalds. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN "ONE" loses his father from the land, then finds his true grandfather, the story makes every step of the way attractive. He is a person, communicates with people and feels love for people, connects with schoolchildren and links them to distinguished people. He says. <br /> <br /> It connects Südermah with only Superman, and it seems that he does just one job when he reaches people. </ Font> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is something about Clark that Lois loves, Without Superman, he fell in love with Clark (at least this shows whether the intention is or not). Superman Returns is a love story between a woman and SUPERMAN, as a pile of horse maneur for Clark Lois. In the real sense of the word. <br /> <br /> SUPERMAN TWO I just watched it again. As a child, I liked the idea of ​​"I thought", but now I know the story that holds me, watching again and again. <br /> <br /> This film has many hearts, souls and super powers, sick. <br /> <br /> Generally, there is a three-way love story between Superman and Lana. <br /> <br /> Generally, Superman, and Clark, just overcomes humanity and Clark's inner qualities make Supermen's power because of his superhero nature, and SuperHUMAN (who works with his super powers), he is in love with the Superman does not see the power, it is SUPERpowerman, but SUPERMORTALman loves it - and is really SUPER. And when she called Clark, she "surpassed her Superman," she was surprised, and still had a human relationship. He wants not only steel bending ability, but also for whom. <br /> <br /> Clark's super sneezes strike for the kid - helping humanity to get a strike. Moreover, it is the use of powerful forces. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Disrespect towards the people living in the Caucasus <br /> <br /> Moreover, There is nothing in Superman Returns. Even at Superman 3, we see the damages caused by the world domination of Nemesis. When we suffer, we see how Pryor and others influence people in the middle of it .. no damage, esp. Sensation from the Lexin structure to immerse the United States. We see a crystalline castle thrown into the space. Superman had to create a lot of creativity in the first three supermen, but could not "enter" his superior powers only to stop the assassination against him. First, he had to erase the history to stop the two missiles that went to different destinations and then violate his universal mandate and save Lois's life ... (this was three years ago!) The second was more than three people, but Lexin the unclean tactics of the wicked men, the kidnapping of Superman was not enough, he had to work against the other and had to abolish them ... Superman III was not enough to win his superpowers. He had to be out of the computer that counted everything he saw, he could not use aggression, because he would use a good acid because he had predicted it before the computer hit the computer only when it was deadly and he could not get his broom out of a firefighter before he had a chemical fire. i found acid, so its superbrains - he was carrying water, he went into a lake and froze. Now Superman Returns, it only brings it to the edge of the island like a night tempo for UPS. He does not need to understand anything, only uses his "superpower". Lex Luther's glow was shown at a junkie premeditation level just fleeing from a junk. <br /> <br /> Kyrptonite was stabbed with a KNIFE right then he had nothing to say that he had thrown aside the island itself and dropped the kriptonit spores on the island itself, but he prevented only though he looked Gray Poupon preventing his eyes and nose .
