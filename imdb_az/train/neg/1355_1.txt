Crispin Glover's "What?" Ann Arbor movie festival. Undoubtedly, the film is called at least as it is because the writer / director knows that he can not answer. After the screening, Mr. Glover said that the film was a short film to show the film's ability to use low-syndrome players. However, this will not be enough to create a movie. <br /> <br /> Crispin Glover also said they wanted to resort to taboo topics. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; Yes, it does, so why? There's no posture in the movie, there's no reason to do something, does it mean that these things should not be taboo? does not give such an indicator ... Taboo is not interested in taboo, it can not be indifferent to the nature or irritation at any level because it has not cared for the audience in any way. <br /> <br /> For a moment, it's really a shocking thing, how badly the film was to be filmed, cinematography, and other technical issues could have been extremely amateur, and I think Glover should have been filmed for $ 125-150,000 and that money should be spent on different designers (Glover actually it was a design itself - I know at least the sound design in the credits it is good, but it is badly used.It would have been nice if the feelings were to go for any purpose, but Glover feels comfortable only in his hands. <br /> <br /> In the first place, filmmakers are filmed as a low-quality movie for the first time in iMovie, where filmmakers see what they see. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest problem? I can not understand how serious the film will be. Some parts, like Glover, shout for you to think seriously. At other points, it appears in its small joke. <br /> <br /> <strong> Glover thought he would never be able to attract his own film. <br /> <br /> <strong> Glover first wanted to be a short film. If it were alone. Within seventy-two minutes, the film runs out of sight and thoughts in the first twenty years, and is controversial when it is sufficiently designed to claim that it is so in this era.
