Edmund Lowe, the top ten actor of the Philo Vance series, seemed to be the most disgusting, but it's a great way to see the track. Jockey, Douglas Walton, hypnotized explicitly when looking at space, and said something like "I'm going to be killed and killed", I felt it was impossible for anyone to get it after being killed. The police said that he thought he had committed suicide! After the hate horse owner, Gene Lockhart is shot and killed, Frieda Inescort goes to death and jumps from a bus at the same time. Lowe finally laughed at saying, "I bought it," supposedly a revelation. However, the guilty party was cleverly hiding and it appeared when he began hypnotizing Lowe to secure the party to jump over a roof.
