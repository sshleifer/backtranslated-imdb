This time we get a toy toy, called "Joe Petto" (gosh), which creates live, ill-fated toys that kill people. <br /> <br /> Himself and his mutant robot son, Pino (still get it?) In the house where he lives, he just simply goes after the family who just lives. <br /> <br /> It's probably the worst (and hopefully the next one) in this subcategory, and this and previous movie looks like gentle porn movies, but without sex and nudity. It's like the "Halloween III", "Puppet Master", "Dolls" and the low X-ray hybrid of bad home movies. I suppose, in 2000, they began to open the sixth chapter in the series, but they were abandoned and never finished. <br /> <br /> <strong>
