An expedition led by Hunky Captain Storm (Mark Dana) goes to the Valley of the King in Cairo to learn what the previous expedition was. They get acquainted with beautiful mysterious Simira (Ziva Rodann). Soon they get their blood mummy and they only know what's going on in Simira. <br /> <br /> True snoozer. When I was about 10, I returned to the night at night. Put asleep! After reviewing all this, I'll look back. It's slowly moving, the mummy does not even show up to 40 minutes (and only 66 minutes long!), The action is bad (Dana) for REAL bad (George N. Neise), and no violence or blood will be found. <br /> <br /> This movie looks good at three degrees, everyone is playing it straight, Diane Brewster has a good player because it's the second-rate playwrights (covering the foolish love triangle), short and mummy attack scenes (all three) is not bad. They are not only mildly creepy. Still, this movie is pretty bad. Reliable fire treatment for insomnia.
