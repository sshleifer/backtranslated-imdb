This film, which has been living in Japan for several years, does not reflect the Japanese culture and does not come close to explaining what Geisha is all about. Unfortunately, it was a great opportunity to bring the Japanese culture a little closer to the vast Western listeners and to shake the country of the Geisha world around Kyoto, the Zen, the Samurai. Some of the most terrifying moments in the film are when Americans are shown around Japan. Geisha's dances are not real. Chinese music has long been used. A small, but important detail: the proper use of incense sticks is nowhere seen. The scenes of the beard were almost immoral kitschy! Interestingly, some Chinese actors were quite satisfied with the Japanese people.
