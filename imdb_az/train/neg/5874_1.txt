One of the worst films I've ever seen. The disaster does not help the scene of action and really bad behavior. Only good parts are Gary Busey's parts, but it does not make much of this movie. B, and the test runs flying colors. Despite the entertaining events that began several hours later, I was worried about the loss of my money. I do not recommend this movie for free or when you watch for a gift. <br /> <br /> Really BAd. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
