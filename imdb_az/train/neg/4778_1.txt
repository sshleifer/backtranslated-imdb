This is the worst show I have ever seen. I believe that TV should be removed because of disability. I can be so dumb when I watch. Caucasians: Mac says it eats sugar and eats sugar in another episode. Almost everything in the world is sugar! Eddie Monster episode, Eddy Terrance, when she screams, she falls twice on the plate, falling down and falls on that side. What a stupidity. I can not say the word Fosters Home. I even wrote a song with my band on how this show was flawed. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
