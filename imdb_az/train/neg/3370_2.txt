Just a terrific old movie. The first Stanwyck son is really dumb in his feet, and then he flies off his feet in another truth. To save him, Stanwyck is still unlucky and goes to a runaway prisoner. There is a chance to kill him, but it is very unsuccessful. Finally her husband rescues and Stanwyck tells us what the film's silence message is. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > How beautiful is your nose? Such photogenic? The film works gently with more than an hour. Although the director feels that he has been in shock, he thinks it best to keep a similar lid.
