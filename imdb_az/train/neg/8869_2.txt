The release of the Swedish film industry "Farligt FÃ¶rflutet" really hit the bottom. In the past years, Stefan (Jens Hulten) lived in peace with his wife, Marie (Regina Lund). One day, Stefan's old friend came to ask him a favor. Stefan is a small courier job. With a Swedish-German customs understanding, you need to bring a heroic suitcase. Unfortunately, things in Germany will not work as planned and Stephen is in great trouble now. It's always nice to see a Swedish movie that violates the traditional family-drama pattern. Unfortunately, people who are involved in production can only imagine how to write, cut, or cut a movie. Content may be corrupted by bad behavior, incompatibility, or irony. The only point in the film is the incredibly beautiful sex scene of Regina Lund. It takes about 90 minutes to clean, and it takes about a few seconds.
