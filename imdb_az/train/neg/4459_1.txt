I do not mean that the production values ​​were very low, but they were not too frightened. This shot while washing your hair on the girl's shoulder? Do you really need to sit there for a few minutes and watch it at the same point for 5 minutes? It was terrible, the lighting was just bad. But if you see something and talk about the characters, you could only hear what they were saying. Have you watched the whole movie? Of course, we have not missed the majority, and I do not want to hear that everyone says that you need to watch everything first to judge. This film was executed in such a bad way that even with independent and low budget standards, it's just a terrible thing. Strangely enough, the film is a good laugh, but no time to spend it, but then it's the reason why the production is so bad, not for the "comic" lines of the players.
