When a theater employee finds an old film and decides to show it on the night at the Night of Life, they think it's an old front-wheel drive. Unfortunately, in fact, it is not a true mind controlling experience. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the hate of this movie. A budget with a lot of camps is an independent production, but here's the "1.1" in the IMDb. This is a very fun thing. It is clear that cinematographers have the knowledge and love of old horror films and have created an entertaining feast that has been split into different references and rewards. <br /> <br /> The killing night (which is very similar in many respects), the Dead Dead 2 and the Dark Army and others have feelings. <br /> <br /> Although I have been hypnotized by the zombies really just thinking of being a zombie, it actually came to possess incredible features of life, but I appreciate the efforts of the writers to explain it. <br /> <br /> I'm very glad of that.
