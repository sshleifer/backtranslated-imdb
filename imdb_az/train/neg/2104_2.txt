I bought this video Walmart for $ 1,000. I think it's too expensive! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi became a long line of 3-degree films for small studios (in this case, the makers of most of Monogram - Bowry Boys). The sadness of most of these films is that despite the fact that his latest films (Ed Wood "The Beast of the Witch" and "Plan 9" from "Outside Space") do not approach the level of extreme horror, however, poor films should be avoided and all of these should be avoided. I'm a movie junkie, I gave it a try. At the same time, some of these little movies were pretty good - it's not just that. <br /> <br /> Lugosi is another bride who is a mad scientist who wants to keep her strange and violent spouse in the serum. <br /> <br /> Why should a bride be found or why she should be a woman or what her husband should be? they asked. <br /> <br /> In any case, a truly frustrating female reporter (Jimmy Olsen or a Lois Lane type without Superman) has been sacked, wants to reach the bottom of all these killings! So he follows all the clues to Luke's door. Lugosi's house was completed with two strangers, his wife, a female assistant and his son's helpers (an ugly princess, a princess and a dwarf). Of course, this daring correspondent sounds repeatedly on the film - it looks like a narcolepsy and a good research journal! Finally, all the maniacs die - mostly with their own hands and all are good. As a result, the reporter and the doctor decided to enter into a new marriage. And, of course, the opposition's steering cameraman will happen at this time. If you have not seen, this film has many weaknesses. Or maybe it's such a slow and surprising movie that just fell asleep!
