Unlike others, I as an excuse for a film of this senseless style over substance victory (preferred style do not want to) refuse to call. <br /> <br /> Həyat yoldaşı ilə görüşmək üçün bir neçə gündən sonra baş verənlərə baxmayaraq, onların sağ ağılında olan bu ağrılı və qarışıq qarışıqlığa yaşıl işıq verdi. Hollywood Biography of Porn Star? Find out who he is, what he is doing, and how it affects him? Great. It's fun to be entertained. <br /> <br /> Holmes is concerned with a series of free, severe, Rashoman-style investigations. Is the career ending? Who are in hell? What are our ideas? This film does not see the most interesting part of Hollywood's life - it's a porn star! Wonderland could belong to anyone: it is almost unnecessary for the main character to be the most famous male adult film star in history. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> director (and I am using the word soft) or a lot of other movies with them and put them together, and they occur between technique they decided to call a movie that confusion: "Narc" and "Traffic" in view of fashion, bleach bypass, or "minority report"; frequently inaccessible, "cut off natural killers" or "28 days later" to shoot films in the film; "Goodfellas" or "Blow" featuring the works of noise noisy noisy, noisy, noisy and full of noise. "Velvet Goldmine" or "Autofocus" or "Catch Me If You Can.", "Groovy" retro header sequence. The list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> I would like to love this movie. I found real hopes for this. Wonderland Avenue has been around for years; In the context of the crimes it was more emphasized than the crimes, and I think it could deal with it. Crimes (and Holmesin growing attraction to other types of sensitive LA) or at the end of a kariyerin when it comes to the end of the swinging 70s, I thought it might be the meaning of the film; could have had one purpose. As is true - it is meaningless. It's meaningless. How many perspectives do there exist in connection with a number of offenses common to the public? <br /> <br /> This movie should have been the third act of The John Holmes Story. This is so. Period. And it could have worked. What is this? Well, right, they did not want to say the traditional rise and fall story. They did not want to "Boogie Nights" or "Goodfellas" or "Star 80" or "Autofocus". He wanted the films to be different. Right? <br /> Well, in a sense, they have succeeded. There is a big difference between those films and "Wonderland". <br /> <br /> These films are good. <br /> <br />
