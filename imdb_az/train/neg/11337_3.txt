I'm a regular Spike Lee fan. Indeed, it takes a little time to get into his mojo, but you see a clear message and a story close to his heart, Lee is a genius. Unlike the 25th Hour or Bamboozled (two of my favorite films), there was no clear story in this movie. I understood the choice of Washington to fight well or to be influenced by others, but for some reason Lee did not get the true sense. Washington has done a decent job with what he has been given, but you can say that this is not Lee's favorite movie. Lee just did not shoot this movie and wrote it. You could understand. The camera job was strange, and the writing only caused the film to decay. This movie came to the full circle, and it would not have been great. Lee did not have 100% behind this movie because it was dealing with the right thing. One of all the films I see in Lee is his most brilliant and modest movies. It's almost a Hollywood movie. I do not know if he did, and did not run away from the right things. but this film did not show her true talent. <br /> <br /> It's a chance for anyone who sees this movie and maybe not for a moment watching Spike Lee watching something that is directed by this movie. Do not get me wrong, I see what's coming with this movie, and why I want to keep my back, but Lee is growing. His job is much more than his own, and you see the transformation from the desire to earn only the best movies. It was a little time to watch the 25th hour, but I would say it was a bright glow. Maybe the actors were perhaps the story, but Lee made an extraordinary great movie from a man's journey. I think this is what I hope is the release of Mo Better Blues. It's a really dark journey to a truly grown man's life, but Denzel Denzel is instead. <br /> <br /> He is one of the most versatile actors of this generation and I consider him Sydney Sydney Poitier, but this is not a movie to show his talent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I do not know you and your family, but I do not think I can take a sex scene with my sister. No matter who the actor is and how much money I earn, I will never do it. It's just something I want to see, but it looks like Spike is different. She went ahead and showed her sister's complete lamp without any hate. It was sad and even messed up with me. Besides, I need someone to answer me. What has Flavour Flav introduced to this film? So, I'm sitting on my couch, ready to start the movie, suddenly there is a voice recording the studio that has taken that movie, and then accepts it. This story was not built up to be strong. Still, Lee did not actually pay for the talent in this film. How could he pay Denzel and Wesley the same film without any explosion in the same film? <br /> <br /> In this movie, there were two great scenes to value. Do not get me wrong, it was a very bad film, but there is always a diamond in every alley. Bleek was excited about the scene where she accidentally forgot her. He went back continuously and touched the confusion that proved to be true behind the camera. The rest of the scene was a sight-seeing scene lost in the confusion. The other scene forced to watch, Lee presented the movie and ended. By keeping the same pacing and direction, he could turn the tragic character into a circle and give him a chance to change his life. <br /> <br /> In addition to these two points, the rest of the film is not worth the look if you do not want to go to the black market. <br /> Level: *****
