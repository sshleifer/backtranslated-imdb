I just did not use this movie. But then Babe, I liked the Pig in the city and talked about pretty well done animal films in every way. The animals were unpleasant. All this made Chris Rock's guinea pigs especially irritated, but what can you expect from this, Chris Rock? I believe that I smiled a few times in cute colors, but that's it.
