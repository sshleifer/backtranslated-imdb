Simply, the quality expected from Morris (Love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). This is not a very bad student film. What is upsetting me, so why not win the BAFTA? Morris is entertaining in most of his work (Nathan Barley) with 'adjusted mediocrity' (Ayn Rand), and still pulls this piece of skillful back and tells us the rain! <br /> <br /> Hopefully, when we choose a topic (the Terror of Humanity - Four Lions), I want to fight it, it does not embarrass itself, it is the difference between general ignorance and ideas about these emotional and distressing events.
