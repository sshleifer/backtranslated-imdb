This is the worst movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> I say that I have not seen a worse movie than this movie <br /> <br /> And I never say <br /> <br /> A great fan of horror films B. <br /> <br /> I was exposed to the worst results of the film industry. <br /> <br /> I was shot with the title of this movie. I say c'mon ... what a real fan of horror will not be intrigued with a theme like "Vampires vs Zombies" ??? In my head, the songs of the "song", which fights each other with "horror" dance. I thought myself ... "It must be seen" <br /> <br /> Sorry to say good .... "I wish I did not see it" <br /> <br /> This movie title is at least it is very wrong to say. There was no vampire fighting the zombie. In fact, there is no blemish! <br /> <br /> If you were to ask me what this movie was, I can not tell you honestly. <br /> <br /> There was no plot !!!! <br /> <br /> There is no story! <br /> <br /> This film does not mean anything in its entirety! <br /> <br /> At the end of this crisis ... I apologized for the poor souls who invested in it. Of course, there is no business reason for giving money to this project !!!
