What can I say? I think we have to write "Spoiler Alert" and then use the "Discovered" F-word in this movie - as in both sentences. I have never liked this movie - a lot of information about sexually transmitted infections, sidesteps, and betrayal. And the pen was completely out of the window. I gave this movie "3" and these two points were for sexual acts in the dance floor of Mira Sorvini.
