Near the "Godfather: Part III," Michael Corleone's son wants to leave school and become a musician. Michael Corleone does not want it. However, her old companion Kay, Anthony Corleone, tries to convince her to watch the music as she wanted. So he does it. <br /> <br /> This is a small field point and can only be seen in a single way to start a review that has nothing to do with a great deal of action. Just carry me here; finally, what am I going to do? Now let me know about the basic plot. It's about Michael Corleone, who wants to get out of the good crimes (he has left all the elements of the crime in the family business). But after a while, Vensen Manchini comes from an illegitimate nephew. Certainly, Michael should endure another brush with the crime and the severity of weapons and all the good gangster stuff. At the same time, Vincent Michael has a semi-strange relationship with her daughter, Mary. Oh, and they try to burn all the disastrous things that happened at the end of Michael and Kay II. <br /> <br /> This is a soap opera. A terrible, terrible, 169-minute soap opera. Gone is a type of development, romance, and emotion that strikes the first two films home to extreme levels. After a 16-year break in Francis Ford's Coppola franchise, he was completely incompatible with the first two films, once again his "Apocalypse Now" in the 1970s. worse, "The Godfather: Part III" is not a logical follow-up of "The Godfather: Part II." Michael is a completely different person. He has not just touched the tissue (it may be legitimate even if you do not have fun to watch it). Part II has become a kindness that we try to make all the tragedy of this destructive masterpiece. It was a bad idea to admit to the priest, but a moderate diabetes attack led him to heartburn. She's back with Kayla! For heaven's lovers, as the 2nd movie has long been clear, there is no way to go! She left her baby and her Sicilian upbringing looked down on her. <br /> <br /> Francis Ford Coppola did not even think of these things? <br /> <br /> I did not start the work of Mary and Vincent too! Such a romance was forbidden. Sofia did nothing for Coppola's assistant player. He made a smart move in his life as he crossed the front of the camera, because he was the worst actress I've ever seen in the best picture candidate. Every line that he presented was painfully memorized, and every time the drama was giggled, all inconvenient, based on its ability to function. On the Climactic scene - I do not go in detail, but you know where you are talking about the scene - when he looks at Michael and says, "...... Daddy?" <br /> <br /> According to some reports, for a couple of years, review it with a description of Anthony Corleone's musical ambitions. After 140 minutes of small drama and irrelevant incidents, Anthony Corleone returns with an opera! So Michael, Kay, Maryam and Vincent will go to see it, and about 10-15 they are trying to assassinate a few killers over the course of a minute, and I can say one thing about this bipartisan sequence: it was really good! But for the slaughterers, they were pretty boring I just loved the opera, some great music and some really great works And, as we have shown, the story reflects the origin of Corleone's family. <br /> <br /> My biggest wish is that Francis Ford Coppola was alone, but it was a ghastly opera and I would bet that Michael Corleone was delighted to have his son go to music from his law school. Anthony Corleone took a 169-minute opera and beat the remaining melodrama. If it were better, I would like it to be "The Godfather: Part III" at all. Part II gave us a perfect end. <br /> <br /> P.S. This film is not a gut reaction. I watched all three canvas movies a month ago (even though rewatching the first one). This does not just mean that the expectations of Part III (in fact, I've put the bar down at the bottom of my hearings), but also I've had a good time to think about three. Although the first part was a bit disappointing, I thought more and better. But I was worse to start with Part III, then it got worse, I thought more. It is a pity that many people will stop in I part but watch Part II, probably going to Part III. If you have the will, see Parts I & II and never use it as part III.
