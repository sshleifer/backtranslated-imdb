After seeing the high rating on the IMDb, I decided to look at this movie. Apart from this high rating, I avoided deliberate consideration. <br /> <br /> If you consider my rating, you can see that I am disappointed. I enjoyed developing the main character, Mike Ensley. I was also pleased how the hotel manager was working to tell her how to get into the hotel room. When Anslin entered the room, I was ready for some scary things. <br /> <br /> The first chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin reacts convincingly. He was angry. I encourage and think myself, it will be good. People who understand this film are less well aware. <br /> <br /> But what happens after that is great. Subtleness is replaced by a fast-paced shotgun approaching ... The audience book has blown up with every Hollywood scary tactic and I hope that something works. The one hour radio we open, opens by itself? Well, it's always scary. Objects moving in the room? Well, you can not complain about it. Blood drops and sink from the walls? Great. Suicide ghosts? Well, good. Another thing? High noise, shaking, fire, more shaking, room, more blood, and so on. And all was done before. <br /> <br /> Excessive attention is paid to the fact that we have violated our attention deficits with all kinds of things in a fast sequence. <br /> Well, that did not work for me. And what else do you know? When you see a horror film in a theater, it's typical to hear a few girls from the audience watching something that is distressing at times of fear. But this movie did not have fears. The audience was silent and uninteresting. I did not feel any cold in my back. There is nothing. <br /> <br /> So who are all these people who say that this movie is one of the best horror films? The director's friends? Sorry, I just did not get it.
