I got it from Blockbuster for 99p. The man behind the counter was so cheap that it was torn to exaggerate the disc, but the film was so cheap because the film made a tough effort from Paris Hilton in a hotel room video. It is possible to say that whenever a fair game is played, it is possible to say that the actors, technical writers and screenwriters have been talking about home movies and movies. For the weekend, the product with a budget of £ 8.00 falls down the stairs with a Casio keyboard (soundtrack) - and then some slack on the shelves (me), just slap to get at home. But here's the first one - I put it in this direction quickly and drew it to one side, ready for smooth ... Hellbreed (£ 1.99 home and a different Blockbuster) while watching Darren's Day fear until the next night. Now this movie appeared as 'The Grim Weekend', an Exorcist, and I also took Grim Weekend to catch some of the moments listed on the beautiful IMDb boards that the fans claim. I guess that once I got out of pain, pain and horror, I had a fresh straw in the implementation of Grim Weekend, and I enjoyed it, I'm happy and entertaining. And there are many. Check the boards. Then check the flick. Hell can even be worth it. AWWWWW CRAP!
