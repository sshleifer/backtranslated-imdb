<br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <! <br /> <br /> In another statement, I do not think that this is the best RTE ever prepared, really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest form of intelligence, and there are actually some really comical smart sticks that really laugh out loud. People do not really appreciate the quality of gags that are not good, it seems convincing by popular names by comedians. Overall, it was mediocre with some good laughs, but it can often be quite mediocre. It's not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens products. I find Benny Hill tape.
