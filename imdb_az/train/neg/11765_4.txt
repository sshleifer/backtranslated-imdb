You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. A sappy, trite verse and $ 3.99 will thank you very much. Let's be the same as an Hallmark movie. Here we report that we are retired as a nine-year-old Ernie Borgnine, which, in fact, is not dead. Poor Ernie is a poor spirit that married Ethel Merman a few years ago and lasted for several weeks. This flick, Ernie describes the father who throws his first legs and closes his long lost pips. We've seen before. You can enjoy this movie but have not been notified.
