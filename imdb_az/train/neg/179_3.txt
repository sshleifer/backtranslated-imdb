Just go back to the lake ... it was not enough. A fair portion of the film should have been shot with a regular video camera because it should have very little budget. So, on the same stage, you'll be able to shoot some of the coolest camera shots and simple video cameras. It causes a strange mixture! I think we need to find out more about the "home video" effect! <br /> <br /> I think this is different because you see the actual CBTL because you can see and compare differences. But if you do not see the original CBTL ... you will never want to see this one! Perhaps it will look very cheerful and avoid even caring about the original.
