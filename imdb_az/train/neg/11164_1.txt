<br /> <br /> This film tried to copy the "advanced" comedy, but this movie was auspicious, sick, and slim in the worst movie tradition. Jack Black's actor / role was self-affirming and self-dependent ... and other characters were equally sophisticated and uninteresting. The soundtrack was exhausting. We are Black (but), but none of us did more than hitting a compelling beater for the term. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> This is the drive before registering for the script?
