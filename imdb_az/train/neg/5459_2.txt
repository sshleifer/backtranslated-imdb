It was a very short episode that appeared in one of the "Night Galleries" show in 1971. Episode, Sue Lyon (Lolita movie fame) and Joseph Campanella playing cellphone and vampire. The vampire hires a baby watchman to watch his child when he goes out to the night for blood (it appears to be a kind of victim or cannabis). The baby's caretaker does not forget the appearance of the vampire for the first time, and when he sees that he does not reflect in the mirror, he begins to put two and two together, there is only one collection of books in the secret library, and the vampire listens to strange sounds. He may not be the first to think of the employer. He screams at the door, the vampire becomes embarrassed, and the episode is over. What is the purpose of a short episode of only 5 minutes? They should only extend the episode 5 minutes earlier and jumped them. Total effort.
