There was a genie played by Shag, whose name was Kazaam and his hearts were sharp, these lines were foolish baba crying bad actin, bad dump, a little stupid boy on bad special effects, next thing? <br /> <br /> According to some of the movies, this movie just a few days ago, move in a stupid movie with awesome special effects. Oh, and confused as hell. I will not even go. Let's say that this is a "very bad, funny" category. Follow your friends once and get a good smile. But I do not expect something spectacular.
