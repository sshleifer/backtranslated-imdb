I was very much looking forward to this movie. Its a good family movie; However, if Michael Landon Jr's editing team worked better for editing, the film would be better. Much more scene than context. I hope there is another film from the series, all of which is very good. But if something else happens, I wish them a better care. This story was on the ground and did not have a center. Other series of the series were great because it was unsuccessful. I love the story of Willie and Missy; but also great role models. The romantic side of the audience is always experiencing a good love story.
