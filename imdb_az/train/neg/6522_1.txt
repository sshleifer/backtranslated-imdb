This is not a comment about the actual movie, but the DVD version of RUSCICO for North America. I do not know if there are different releases and innovations, but what we are renting is 2000 copyrighted. Anyway, the mixed sound on these DVDs was terrible. Levels are often yo-yo-up and down; When the scene was cut to a panorama of a battlefield, the orchestra poems were so loud that I did not know that I would first dream - my ears or my speakers. As time went into the dialogue, the volume would normally be something that was heard very often. Sometimes, the orchestra and the Foley-Business dialogue would remain loud while at a lower level. My husband and I found that we could watch any movie from this DVD, and we kept away from the DVD to constantly modulate the volume. And as another user commented, when we selected English, the dialogue switched between Russian and English; and sometimes the symbols were not in the French when the dubbing in their native language was spoken in Russian, or you did not understand it. Finally, we did not watch the first disk. Before you capture $ 50 + for a movie on your DVD for your library, of course, it's advisable to get your hands on a rental sheet to see if you can actually use this epic figure when downloading it with such a bad sound. read books and really want to understand the storyline.
