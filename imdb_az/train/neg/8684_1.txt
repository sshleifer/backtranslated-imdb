Capital with "A" is indispensable. This is the most subtle feature on TV, if not the least. I'm deceiving that I'm fighting against the branches, but this show also giggled me. What Bouchun thinks of the president is absolutely nothing to love or do with this crap show. "Sugar" is not ridiculous. For example, on a scene with a lilac bushing, "Welcome to camp Al-Qa-eeda!". There's nothing funny about it. Is it even necessary to joke? The shows that were shown during the weekend show were more entertaining than the show, and it was sad. Hopefully this is not accepted for the second season. Not even the first one.
