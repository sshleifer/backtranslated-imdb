It is difficult to believe that everyone will put this movie in the same context as Exorcist. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most beautiful sights I've ever seen, but it's a low spiral for the patronizing exposition that never makes the images unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this film was peaked when compared to Exorcist and this interest in my official website increased. The website had a large number of "actual" stigmata throughout history. However, the scene scene is obsessed to look for the "truth" that is really first of all funny, and then it is difficult to watch the end towards the end. <br /> <br /> The Prophet (saas) said, "Indeed, it is a miracle of worship to anyone other than Allah." Christ (Stigmata) begins to get wounds and is surprised and overwhelmed by this difficulty. A priest is sent to correct the Vatican. <br /> <br /> Is there a boat for Frankie Satan or Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> Only this miracle is finally over in this movie.
