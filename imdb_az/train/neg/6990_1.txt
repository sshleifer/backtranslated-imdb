What is hell? One of the most terrifying films I've ever seen. I do not understand why people like this site love it. Its baseless and naked for no reason. After his worst Resident Evil. Chessy, I do not recommend it in a very good way unless you want to watch a bad crap. Stephen King's It, The Shining, Jurassic Park, Jaws, and more. See real horror movies like. Lease this rental when there is nothing else to rent. It's as bad as Crudy vs. Gayson. <br /> <br /> The Killer Tomato attack is better than this shit. <br /> <br /> Wound beats zombie. We need movies that are damn well. <br /> <br /> Outta ****
