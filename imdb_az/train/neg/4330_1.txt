Last night I decided to watch the prequel or I would say "preteker" on the way to Carlito - "Carlito's Way: Power Up Rising (2005)" went to the DVD ... no doubt ..... absolutely .. Say% & KS! I think it would be a good hint of time to watch it and write it down .... I do not understand how De Palma perceived a movie to make a movie ... just a fact that I raised my hat ... Jay Hernandez, a young Brigante player. De Niro reminded how Godfather II entered Brando shoes to describe the young Don Corleone ... but De Niro was incredible and even took an Oscar for it! Jay Hernandez has the courage to try to be a good young Pacino .... I do not think he's going to play in the film, and after watching this movie down and watching the original Carlitos way to get a bad taste from my mouth.
