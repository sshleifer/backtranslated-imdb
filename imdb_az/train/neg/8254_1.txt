I've seen better quality of production on YouTube! I am sorry for the writers, because their writing is terrible and shocking. He does not know how to handle difficulties - I really doubt that any actor can save this movie, even though it's good. Heroes generally did not develop and seemed to have never gone anywhere. The film's premiere is good and good because it could be a good movie with quality, direction and scripts, because it's really a shame. English actors sounded strange - you would not even laugh out loud in a dubbing, it was not a comedy.
