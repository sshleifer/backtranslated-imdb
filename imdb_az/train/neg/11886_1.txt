In this film, Josh Kornbluth's 'action' is reminiscent of my first-class television production class, where 'not funny' had the chance to prove how realistic it really was! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The article, when wannabe tries to synopsize the comedy. Jokes are sophomoric and telegraph. Delivery is very bad. OUCH !!!!!!! The article is just about stuffing. Bob Saget is something for the show. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is painful when watching a live sketch (post belushi) on a Saturday night on a Saturday night. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie and return my money!
