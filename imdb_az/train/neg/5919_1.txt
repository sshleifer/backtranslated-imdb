I rented this movie yesterday and was attracted to something that is constantly being produced, so I can make my imagination worse in Laura Ingalls. I'm not sure if it's a terrible post or bad guide or both, but we're really sorry for a viewer who has had time to watch this flock. It consisted of a weak naive story line, very weak lines, and simply sold to pretty scenery and beautiful people. Unfortunately, this is not enough. It would be nice to rent a tape with a static stick rather than spending time on this bend. Lindsey Wagner has played a very sad part as well as a guy who does not have a very difficult job at the same time; Anyone near any village knows this is obviously written by a young man from Los Angeles and most of the world knows.
