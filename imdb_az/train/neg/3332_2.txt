I sold this movie on a car, so I did not expect it to be the same level of horror as Elm Street (1984) or Eye Eyes (1977), but it's still so nice to watch. But it was at least unpleasant, but instead of the actors and the general movie, ways to kill the "unseen killer" and how all the people killed are just young blonde women. It was a stereotypical horror movie. <br /> <br /> 1) Three blond women are in danger, most of them are killed. 2) When one is persecuted by the killer, he crawls in the dark and survives. 3) Surprise surprise came as a help pneumatic rifle! <br /> <br /> Using three simple points, I was able to save two odd hours by summarizing this poor excuse, so lucky you are not enough to watch it.
