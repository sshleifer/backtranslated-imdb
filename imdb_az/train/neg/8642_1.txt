This is a movie, in fact, when you see this movie as a guide, it is a documentary document. When I watched it, I laughed at myself thinking that this man really does not believe that it is true? So, I'm looking for it and now I see it as a movie, but now I'm not a documentary, it's a movie that's now a bad act. That is, in any case, it's pretty bad. In fact, I did not finish. I have to shut it down. I was a NYC Police Officer and felt that someone was trying to deceive people by thinking that I and a colleague were a documentary with the intention of making a terrible day. So I took a little personality. Maybe I'm blinded by this and is not as bad as I personally think. Everyone has their own ideas.
