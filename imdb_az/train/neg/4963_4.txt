Another ridiculous science-fiction channel appeared to be a failed attempt. I'm not sure who is writing and commenting on poetry, but it's a young 17-year-old teenager who thinks the film will have an extreme line of structure. AAAAAAAH! When I saw this part, I lost hope. Then ... Christopher Columbus got into the boat in a ship! When it comes to Heorot (a Norse Mead Hall is supposed to be), the slavery group decided to look like the hetorot as a huge stone castle. when he saw this part .. he wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but science figures have not yet made a good movie, so I do not know why I got my hopes. Oh ... and Grendel and her mother are stupid. (this comment is related to "Grendel"). If the sci-fi channel is read from anyone, it's a good idea. WITHOUT ANY TEMPLE, WHETHER THE QUESTION ARISES FROM THE LIFE IMPACT IS READY FOR FICTION! And also, MORE FEEDING OF LOSSES IN FILMS like STEPHEN BALDWIN! HELP YOUR PICTURES, HELPING THEM!
