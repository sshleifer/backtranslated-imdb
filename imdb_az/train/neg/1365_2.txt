The concept of a legitimate gray area in Love Murders makes up about 10% of the film's appeal; and the other 90% relates to his ill-treatment. Sean is something that Young speaks of on the wooden board, which he acts as a district lawyer. She tries to persuade young people to devote hateful hatred to her eyes with her mild suits and unnecessary hair gel. Why is he asking his only friend to go off as a prostitute? Can she arrest the police trying to get them? This hatred is also the only reason why women have stopped a devious photographer who is entertaining and moving force behind this undecided film. Despite the fact that young people go from cold to full frontal nakedness, there is little to raise interest, but this is where the ghost of a lake falls when a lake falls next to it. He deserves the right to rent Love Crimes, watching his rent and hating himself and associating it with sexual frustration, but it goes down and down there. Despite his desire to bring Patrick Bergy's character to justice, his police abilities disappear from the peaks of his tired lust and passion. Patrick Berkin does a pretty decent job as a bone-dried sausage; When he lets the enemy sleep, hell can work. But I can not help but am not surprised at the controversy with a film that can lead to a young man's energy shortage. I guess it, and in the end, everything becomes "excitement" with good and comedy excitement.
