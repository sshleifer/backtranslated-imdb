I watched this movie last night and even after a couple of beers, this movie came out of me, just giggling, I really watched it. In short, this is groundless. Unfunny. I completely believe in the black trivia tidbit which is sorry to prepare this trash. When barry levinson reads the first page I do not believe that this script will be thrown out. In addition, I do not believe I've been looking for more than ten minutes. <br /> <br /> For the love of Christopher Walken to create horrible movies, I've given 3 out of 10. Also, the horse that is simply available in this movie is really laughable.
