<br /> <strong> </ strong> <strong> Director John Keeyes, inside with a real threat takes a simple idea of ​​a fake haunted house. In most cases this should be a slam dunk, but this little stinker goes out quite often. Cinematography is at a moderate level and the player is the best mediocre, but the story and writing are just horrible. The slower scenes are dragged forever and the scary movie is far and far away without any real upsurge. The crushing mood is at the outset, but it loses its glimpse before any horror transpiration, and I found myself prepared for death and another sandwich ... I'm interested in cover art and I think that a good story to get rid of an unhappy budget and an interesting ending you can achieve something.
