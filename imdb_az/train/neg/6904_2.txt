It seems to me that a new film school graduates that the New Zealand film, which has reached new heights in this era, is that the general public thinks every New Zealand movie is great. <br /> <br /> Sion's wedding is a deadly mistake. <br /> <br /> This is completely overrated and funny, and IMDb comments far away from other "hilarious" movies. <br /> <br /> The only funny thing I've seen in this movie was Derek, it was a black person, but besides, jokes were recycled for what we had heard in advance. <br /> <br /> Half of the samoan's worthy wanted to see how the film would deal with the Polinezian representation. It was a complete ball - I know this is a comedy, but I did not feel as though the heroes were anything like a Polynesian personality, even if they were in a language. I was most disappointed with the ending of the film and the character relationship - Mikaele was just a mixed player with white women, when the "Naked Girl" came to town, she turned her way a bit, she had an epiphan, maybe she was looking for a constant connection, rejects it and accepts the position of Polynesian Playboy for palliative women. <br /> <br /> Generally, it was very disappointing. My whole family went to see that he was waiting for a good laugh, but he ended up really suffering about paying to see the murder. Sugars are the best, especially Sophan's lover, APPALLING, a legendary player and I would be happy if I put my hand on one of these pirate copies of the movie to save myself a $ 15 ticket price. /> <br /> The only good thing that comes from the movie is that it is the second step when the Polynesian cinema was born (of course, this is a movie that is more than a movie). I hope that in the future, Pashe directors will be able to reflect on Polynesia's wedding dresses and learn to have something more meaningful and sensitive. Even in the case of comedy.
