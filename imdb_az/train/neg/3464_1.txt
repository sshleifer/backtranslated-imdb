As you can see, some of the films that they were watching were first watched by him because they were close to where they lived. What is this call for? If this movie is shot somewhere near me, I will review it. This is terrible! Several reviews suggest that this is a horror movie, a tragic or dreaded horror film. It is sad that this movie is considered as a comedy, because it is not just a bad attempt in a horror movie, but also as a comedy. <br /> <br /> There are two good things in this movie, the mask and the weapon of choice, unfortunately, would be more interesting watching for one hour, half of the table and a weapon set at a table where a trash can be watched. The public comment behind the film is funny, young and stupid. Do not worry about this movie, you will no longer spend this movie when you read this review. Arrggghhh! It is angered that these films will be shot in such a way. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Alan Smithee, a man, usually a filmmaker, a name he used when he did not want to go to the street, was pretty bad, so I was expecting a crew to be drafted into a squad. <br /> <br /> In this movie, nothing was worth the cost, I spent $ 1.19 on renting and I felt the collapse. Avoid it. 10 to 1
