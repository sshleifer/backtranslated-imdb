I'll repeat it: this movie was completely naked. Kids love it, but adults ... are suspicious. All this, basically, was a genuine rehabilitation of the original, since they were thoroughly exploring the entire concept of the first film, but still had to completely adjust the whole film? I want to say that everything from Little Mermaid is done again. The worst part of this is Morgana's "Ursula's crazy sister" and Triton threatens ridiculous Melody because she is associated with her magic trident. Why did Triton do anything about it? Because the plot demanded nothing. I can continue, but I will not. All this was a shameless attempt to earn more money than the Little Mermaid, and they were thrown in the same place without any obvious thought, because they knew they would sell it. In general, this is a tough time consuming.
