I wanted to see the movie because of an article in the movie. Not a highly recommended recommendation by the Critic. This story is different and I'm sure it could have been a good movie if it was in the right hand. The director and the players were terrible! I've been watching a movie with many amateurs. Although the film began in a hopeful manner, it was worse and worse. I'm not an ordinary movie but an unusual movie. I still think it's worth watching as I did not see movies talking about gay pornography. Do not keep your expectations high, then you'll be very disappointed. * exit *****
