I have heard a lot about this movie, and people have told me that I should write it because I'm a fan of bloody and bloody films. I immediately handed myself in hand, but something or all the time I was dependent on watching him. <br /> <br /> This movie was strange. Although the worst thing is, it would really be a lot better. I know it's Clive Barker and the whole story, and I have never read this story, but it seems to me that if you do not like me it's completely soft and completely disappointed. <BR> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeRUFRQ"> The film starts pretty well - actors are convincing, the story is interesting. The first scene is bloody - a good way to draw attention. I thought the blood looked a little too bad, but then it was the first scene I hoped for. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br> /> <br /> <strong> WTF? CGI's blood (even using any "real" blood, things that are made in my home look better than what is used in this movie), incredible personalization actions (eye eyes that hit the head, nobody remembers BONES in our whole body?), Very dark scenes (every scene is either a single color, or hiding in the shadows) ... it only gets worse and worse. I mistakenly found it by mistakenly pointing to it. There are so many. Add what you might have and should be a great killer killer movie that eventually turns into some devil / supernatural / monster movie ... thank you! Must be kept as a creepy man who irritates people in the subway - Okay, a conspiracy theorized and many photographer. Maybe they kill people and sell meat with meat plants? Plausible, doable ... and I think better than the "real" story. It can and should work. Instead, it has become a living creature at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows it, but when you read a book you say good things. Tragic, how terrible it is to film such a potential. If you love foolish blood and body, you will love it. But if you have half a brain in your head, you will absolutely hate it. Stay far away.
