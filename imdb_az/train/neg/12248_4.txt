The only surviving person in the film is the death and the reaction of the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> In every way this film is Jaws, Lake <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the 1990s, each one takes his clothes at least once. . Undoubtedly, the females have a better agent. <br /> <br /> The whole film covers the shooting of really dumb bread sports, which they call surfing surfers and surfing in sharks. In this film a huge salty water crocodile is also found in the region. People eat. The film ends. <br /> <br /> I'm not against a horrible horror movie, but I hate a dreadful horror film, which is definitely a must.
