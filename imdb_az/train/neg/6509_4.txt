Sean Bean is great as photography, space and clothing. But the plot is slightly mixed and the result is straight. This plot is better than Corneline's novel, but has been changed. Unfortunately, this adventure is read very well. Although Sharpe was worried about his new roles as a prominent officer in the area, he seemed to be more intelligent and decisive, unlike the literary alter ego, was very narrow here. I poured by a "real" officer in Sharpe and after a quick look at a pause and piercing, the striking and cowed officer liked the short sight of the right-descending back. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
