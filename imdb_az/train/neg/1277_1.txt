This film still strengthens me for bone thought. This movie is not as bad as it's in the budget, it's a bad move, and so on. The problem with the film was intentional, trying to disturb the audience and make it a great success. I would like to know, should this be a scary movie? I would say that this is a terrible thing, but I do not need to be afraid of films. I could see the first part of horror and failure, but what is the hell out of the second? Only dissatisfied. As the third-party pupil is watching a student film, it is strange that it is the least painful segment. It's a disrespect that the movie is not low at 100, so give your voice to people (1/10)! I know some people know these good reviews, but the good thing is that they make a sadistic attempt to deceive you. Believe it, it's impossible to love this movie. The only benefit of this film is an incredible lifestyle: just after the first half hour, it feels like you're watching this movie.
