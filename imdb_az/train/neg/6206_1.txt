Thomas Clay is confused with the wrong species. <br /> <br /> The problem of youth today is not respected. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this film can not be avoided in any way. Movement in the main body of the film is slower and more stubborn and ends the drug as a ghost, and as a director, it does not go any further. We get acquainted with the character of the main character, which is slightly outsourced, we collect it in a place that is not quite suitable at school and at home, as many young people feel dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> This film is really about Clay's failure to understand the relationships between violent incidents and violence. . Clay thinks that a courageous young man has worsened with the battle scenes on our television series. still pulled out the most abominable part of violent violence. <br /> <br /> If Clay does not see YouTube, will he be naive and unaware of his film with a brutal peak scene? Anyone who wants to see the most demanding scene from the end of the film, I'm sure, will be squeezed by people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is meaningless because it does not have such a violent act against the film. Clay is not only cursing young people who are actively involved in preventing the war, but also curses as a result of excessive violence. <br /> Of course, interfering with everything.
