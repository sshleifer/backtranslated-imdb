Who Loves The Terrible 'Comedy' Show Like a Little Mosque in Prairie? There are two types of people who follow: One, every Libyan defender of Muslims and self-proclaimed Liberal Democrats shows a show of Muslims because they are so excited that the show is good? or no funny (that's it). <br /> <br /> TWO, old people and comedy are quite predictable, poorly written, old jokes. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> CBC really has to investigate who they are and what their listeners are. If they really only write comedies for old people, then let's just guess what they are going to happen, their viewers will soon die and leave the audience. Would it be interesting to even write for this show? Muslims are hip and funny teenagers? <br /> <br /> Older white guys who write the same jokes for the same CBC show since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> When you look at CBC's comedy show, Air Farce has just dropped out of the air (thank goodness!), but we still have 22 minutes and we're paying for Rick Mercer, naked ducks, the "comedy" in Prairie, Let's not mention this poor excuse for the Little Mosque. Should it be offencive and funny? Only CBC think that this naked show is all offencive or funny. Unfortunately, only a few people are worried about the CBC because of our tax frauds.
