She watched this movie really well over the years, from Gregory's Daughter. It was put into action. The field was bent over the 14-15 year old girl on the short skirts of the teacher and her companion. The previous commentators think that this is not trivial, but I find it very bad. If you have kids at school, the last thing you want is to think that every young teacher is lusting after his students. We were surprised that the scenario was going this way. Along with that, the film was only time consuming. The scenario was weak, and John Gordon Sinclair tried to spend a lot of time trying to rebuild his school image, a bit unreasonable, and dropped out of the wall. It is incredible why he wants everyone's wishes after this performance. This movie counted for me. Terrible. Please do not lose your waiting period. Life is too short
