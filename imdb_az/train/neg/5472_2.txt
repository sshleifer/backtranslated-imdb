I have been watching dinosaurs all day long and have the same basic problem all day long. <br /> <br /> They do not believe in firearms. They have not yet seen a single thing or something. Bullets of dinosaurs _bounce_ off! Perhaps, they had been half a million years before the deployment of the barrier, and the laws of physics were just then different ... Aah, no. Come on. If they are close enough to chemistry today, they should be sensitive to fast (even subsonic) leading missiles. It's simple. <br /> <br /> Look, today, the most difficult reptile reptiles of the planet, crocodiles and crocodiles are completely sensitive to the main rifle fire. They are not magic anything. You can shoot a pistol round by heavy scales. They do not buy armored bullets or anything special. Small bullets penetrate, but not kill them. A little (but indeed) large bullets are chosen, because the problem (like many games) is to kill the animal with a shot, so it does not work. (Hunters consider it immoral to run away from predators and let them die). <br /> <br /> Many animals, including predators, are easily exposed to gunfire. Most of the noise, even the pain of a deadly wound, will escape. Exceptionally big bears are those that are bewildered by only deadly wounds. Cape buffalo is considered to be quite dangerous, as they are well aware of the injury. We saw the videos of the great herds of a herd's flock to save a calf from all the pride of Lion. A big cat will work, but if this is not possible, it will disappear as a lasting hopeless one. A T.Rex is not known where this spectrum is appropriate. Their behavior was simply not observed. With these large animals, safe hunting is a matter of applying large and stronger shells and / or at a rate that is fast enough to counteract some of them. Of course with T.Rex, this can be a serious problem. I saw a T.Rex skull (in one of them there is a museum in town) and carry a large weapon for bust, which can be impossible. Chewing the neck with very small shots can be a more favorable approach. Small flowers still open them, they would not just splash because it was too big to kill the animal! <br /> <br /> So here we are Cortez and his men (this is a previously famous Mexican campaign, designed by Americans to sacrifice on the pyramid). As you can see, all these human victims welcomed the bloodshed of T.Rexes, who attacked the continent of the day. Apart from cutting their hearts and feeding the lizards, Cortez and Aztecs talk with them allowing them to hunt and kill. Okay, maybe there are no M-16s as children in the Carnosaur series, but they have lighter, crossed, spiked bars (those made of wood) and swords. Maybe it's less inequalities than a full-fledged carrier, but there are a few kids and I bet on a dinosaur quickly. Oh, wait, there's a one-on-one about 4-incher. This is a ticket to the Tyrannosaurus skull! So they are trapped, squandered with a squad, sticks with balls, and the first T.Rex are attractive, as they use a pretty brown girl. Cortez needs to shut down the range until they can be set so that they do not need time to reload. T.Reks does not ignore the garbage of flames and we both look at a crossbar - _and_ top ball _bounce_ off! Forget it. End of reliability. A cross bolt can defeat the Cortez's torso armor and the 4 "ball can penetrate the body of a wooden boat, so that no animals can hide, cross, or skull to go to the planet. Do you think that they can follow the 4-point ball? And here it is still bleeding, but there is still T.Rex, so Cortez looks like this crunch, so it falls on the signal sticks and penetrates it (witchcraft) and kills ... Yaaay, the sticky sticks! <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs do not interfere with firing - they open the eyes of another one with a pistol. <br /> <br /> Some bombarded dinosaurs are made of a tree full of piles and gemstones, and my money will still be in the ball, the design function, - to concentrate on the target, Bomb is the most widespread application of force The _real_ bomb (Gourd is not a bomb) has a very high pressure steel box (see: a pipe bomb or firecracker.) Fireflies thrown into the fire will go to POOF. (Trust him.)
