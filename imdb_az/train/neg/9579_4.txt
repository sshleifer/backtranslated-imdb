PRISCILLA's horrific version: Melinda / Mindy (WOMAN'S DEATH 3) lives in a deserted neighborhood, like Clarke, Candy, boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr), who was accused of bankruptcy. It ends in a borderless Southeast prison by Borderless Head Screw (a toupee an overacting Robert Englund). He and his beloved pet poodles end up hiding a gas station monastery until transformed by a new boring meteor. The dogs are returning to the creeping shoots queen "bitches" and Candy kills the forked tongue, which speaks, kills, and can not handle it for too long. <br /> <br /> First of all, Clarke is fantastic and what it takes to create this movie. You see a very funny man in horror scenes and rifle scenes, including strikingly distorted latex bodysuit, which is noticeable in many different foams and masks ... and you are surprised at how great this actress is. <br /> <br /> The rest of this prayer attempt is so bad that it does not fit the promise. <br /> <br /> Successor director / skripter Ssiamma is quite denied to support the laughs, the annoying supportive characters and foolish dialogue are indispensable for a true sense of humor. Another nail in the coffin; the movie looks cheap, attractive colors and sets have been strangely silenced by dirty photography and dusty desert places. Fortunately for Sciamma, Clarke keeps watching just because she's in her movie.
