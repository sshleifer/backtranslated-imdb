This movie is just bad. It is not worth even to entertain her. Open Professor is just sensitive. Even if it is to stop the blasphemy (to be good for bad movies) to allow invisibility, and this movie, which gives extremely foolish victims in a horror movie, more than that. If you are looking for a shower room scenes and casual sexual encounters for women's dressing room, if you are looking for a good movie, get something else, porno. If you just want to spend time with just a teasing bad movie, you can rent it.
