What a disappointment! At IMDb, the 6.1 score was a bit lower, but I was disappointed in my dream. The first thing angered me is brainedad, stereotyped university children. Yes, childhood of teenagers and so on. I know they can, but why are they always described as full braineade morons in the film? There was a character I thought, but he (he did not show) had set off until the end. Other symbols were poorly executed, even though the alleged hero / hero did not just do it for me. On the other side: The area is pretty good and the products are valued for this kind of flick. Rutger Hauer played a minor role. But all of them fail with soft and brainedad characters. Just do not care for them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and generous ones).
