To find the squad of this movie, I had to search for actresses because the title was now Unexpected Love. This is not really worth searching, but I'm not familiar with both of them and wondered why despite the lifetime of a lesbian break. Everything is quite limited and you do not really think of those characters, as a watcher, I could not emotionally invest in the story. I do not think it's a target audience, but I'm not sure who it is. Everything is silent and soft focus and earth tones ... nothing is too exciting. There was something I was interested to see when the two women would be seen, but it was so frustrating that I was disappointed. Rent Personal Best instead.
