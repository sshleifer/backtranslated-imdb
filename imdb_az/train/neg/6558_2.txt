We rented five films for the New Year's Eve and watched the first one. Everyone can say that after looking at something, there was no place to go. It was meaningless and strange. Harvey Keitel's script should be easy to write - just like all three words in a curse. Andie McDowell is surprisingly good on a character roll, but there is nothing else to offer in the film.
