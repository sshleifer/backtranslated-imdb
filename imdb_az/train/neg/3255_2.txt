I saw this movie in the beginning of 1975. I was 13 years old and then I enjoyed it quite and a bit. Then I came to discover the Doc Savage World through the Bantam novels of the old pulpa magazine. Before the Doc's world, I had no idea, but soon became one of the most enthusiastic Doc Savage supporters who could meet with you. I read all of my Bantam's books (and still myself) and started to enter into the comic book shortcomings (along with Star Trek and Doctor Who and all kinds of geeky fatty children) and had a wonderful time with every adventure I had with Doc and ORIGINAL Fab 5. Philip Jose Farmer's Book - The Apocalyptic Life of Doc Savage has become a biblical book for me, and so far I'm very glad of my Doc stage. That is, in a few years, I must admit that this film really missed the ship. This is a movie that does not know what it wants to grow up. The scenario was a baby and very little to the story of pulp. These 30 stories were short, and one after seeing Lester Dent (AKA Kenneth Robeson) writing them, turned into a PERFECT 3 actor drama that screamed for screen therapy. One would think that it would be good for George Pal and Michael Anderson to lead. Oral elements miss the target, and more serious moments are almost there, but then fall short. Although they are interested in watching the second-generation actors (children who really have fewer players and additions before this film), they all know themselves very well. Of course, Paul Gleason plays a good player on every side of the entertainment, and Bill Lucking is a television set for many years. Everyone else just dropped from the map. I do not want to have a copy of this movie, because it's the only movie version of the hero, but I'm not afraid to watch it as it hurts. I would say 0 but instead of the direction of art (Docun was a nice touch at the end of the voting machine) and 10 to 2 for the weight of the third stinger to win a moment in the sun.
