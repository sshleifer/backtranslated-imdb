I had not heard Larry Fessenden before, but with the help of writing and guiding it, he should keep his day job as a passenger. Like many other people here, I do not know how to classify it, it is not scary or strange, it can not be called horror, the structure was so subtle, it could not have a drama, it could not have been a tension because only Blair Witch Project If you're an admirer, it's a bad movie you need to see. People who love this film used words such as "uncertainty" and complicated and subtle, but they read something that was not there. People like Blair Witch were scared because they feared that they were scared and horrified. This film, in fact, started a good deed with the local community after a deer with the "meeting" of the family. It looked like a salvation of a modern day, but the next 45 minutes (more than half of the film) was nothing but the family leaked to the festive house, which was very beautiful and elegant, but not the least fun. It was clear to the locals that they would be involved at a certain stage, but Essendon had no idea how to make a movie. Finally, when something happens, it is not clear how his father was shot and how he died (the nurse was just galloping), and he always follows this wendigo-inspired shooter very calmly with the 3rd degree special effects. The film is called Wendigo, but no attempt is made to explain it in any way, the film ends and is very disappointed, I'll go for 15 minutes, but I would like to see if this movie can afford it. He did not do it.
