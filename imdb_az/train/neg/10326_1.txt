Canadian television once again disassociated itself and created a show that did not take place after the premiere episode. <br /> <br /> Last time I remember that sitcoms should have us react with business laughter. How funny is it to beat all the white people's stereotypes that think of all Muslims as terrorists? Perhaps it can be a joke to be committed to the masses. But it's not 30 minutes. This is called a horse throw. <br /> <br /> Also, the SNL knew to give up after the commercial break. <br /> <br /> Also, there are some conflicts in these scripts. Will he or she be able to serve a cucumber sandwich to fast in Ramadan? When will Ramadan begin? Ohhhhh, this is Emmy's winning here. <br /> <br /> And the characters! What characters? They want to come to the next situation, there are cardboard cuts without anything interesting. The situation is the comedy point. We need to have strong, interesting, dynamic characters because we are always attracted to the TV every week. We have to take care of these characters to worry about the problems that will happen next week. If you have never seen these characters, it will be very soon. Fortunately, I can not remember one of their names (CBC note - this is not a good sign). <br /> <br /> And the player is very soft. There are more problems than casters in casting. None of these people embody the characters they really are playing. They act in parts of the week as they work in a movie. Sitcommers require actors who live and breathe this character - put us in love with them - where the characters are indistinguishable. Take a look at any American sitcom and see how easily identifiable characters are. Part of the problem is that if the actors can be a platform for better and better things in the project, they will have to have a great character for a lifetime that they will spend for the next 8 years. Characters and projects do not have this level. But to be honest, there's nothing much to say about actors and not to drop any furniture, taking into account the bare concept and horrible writing. <br /> <br /> Another commentator notes that this is not a sitcom but a TV movie. <br /> And lead or not there! What can I say, Canada has so much talent, see what the Comedy Channel has done with killers and punished puppets. Watch Trailer Park Boys (movie theater does not cause great helium dogs). <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> <br /> <strong>. Remember "One"? No, do not try to find out any characters in this show because you are sure that this is the way to dodo. <br /> <br /> Generally, an EXTRA strike that exploded, hopefully there is nothing like this from the south.
