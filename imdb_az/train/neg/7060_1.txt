This movie is terrible. The characters are absolutely incredible and contradict in a bare way. Some of the terrific and classroom scenes are worthy of each other and cause discomfort. <br /> <br /> In fact, the quality and characterization of the script suggested that this film was written by middle school students, and that the school was not safe, in fact, the writers never went to school. In many cases, those who are moving were weak, though most of them fell into poor script, but I'm not sure that any actor would have to wait for this movie. The road was good and the cinematography was fine in places (even though the adjustment was poor).
