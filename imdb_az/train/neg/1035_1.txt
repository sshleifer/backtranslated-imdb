Terrible players, horrible shooting and cheap props. It would be much better if the action parody was designated as a style film. Which is a waste. Starting on the film's name. <br /> <br /> It would be better to call the enemy "Operation Film". (contribution to parody effect). A 60-year-old footballer looks like a yellow girl, always with the same hollow dull face. At the end of the film, they work together to throw her and her bad guys together, and every time they swap a word, they feel like a cheap sex scene before a sex scene. Terrible. Do not waste your time.
