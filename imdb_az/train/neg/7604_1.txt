Undoubtedly, it happens in the west, but the headline looks like a conventional western. Instead, a woman's sheriff film. Do not make a mistake even if it is a bad movie about a woman sheriff. When his husband is killed, he becomes a sheriff; This is just a surprise. His main goal is to go after a poor woman, but the boy hires a boy to kill him. Thus, the hero is in love with the killer and vice versa. Thanks to everyone who was killed in this film, thanking the new sheriff is totally stupid. The killer bars were more than just a few luck, but I did not like it. The murderer is also personal reasons for being too indifferent to the mayor after the mayor. This movie is very boring and not worth watching ... they are not one of the better episodes of their MST3000. Without it, I can not imagine anyone who saw them, because that would be more painful. Corman is not the director of a budgetary budget, and he knows people better than to go somewhere else.
