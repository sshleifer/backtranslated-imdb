I was really looking forward to finding a new life when watching this movie and separating it from many new and sophisticated Mexican movies. I did not know why, but I trusted Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas, to bring freshness and reliability to our non-existing industry. Perhaps this was a different soundtrack I had heard before watching the movie, perhaps because it was attractive to have new faces (attractive, ever-standing Mexican filmmakers Demian Bichir), perhaps because of modern social behavior, perhaps in the artistic scene, bright and realistic. The film was a great hospice and a great frenzy. Serrano really deals with the old fashioned "fight of the breed", as is "all men are the same" and "all women are ...". Blah Blah Blah. It is not even a new thing, it uses even so much space and cliché that ultimately deceives itself without giving a valuable reflexion to the condition of a woman / man. The audience is full of trampolas as a safe clue about the cliché I've talked to my spectators of old (always working) and the clicks (a good-acting movie in this context) .. and I mean full screaming. The first more compelling characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir appear to be more horrible than Serrano. I did not completely agree with Serrano, he was not acting in this way just to serve as a marionette for his lessons ... we were convinced that we received the HI message and completely destroyed our only solid foundation. It could have been a story. In any case, it's sometimes a very funny movie, and if you do, you'll have a good time (if you're manipulating it).
