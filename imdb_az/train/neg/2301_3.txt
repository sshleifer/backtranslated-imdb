Is someone really helping somebody or does it just make the audience angry? When I go through the channels and when it comes to the show, it's half to watch from a damaged interest. I understand that Pat Roberson is not all together. I do not know if his followers are like him or are good people, and they think that if they listen to what they want, there will be a better life. Pat Roberson is a very small result. old man who is an old thinker. The fear of cursing is already affecting once (thanks to God). Now, if someone answers my question, I will leave the lightning bolts for ever.
