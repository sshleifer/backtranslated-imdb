A family traveling for her daughter's volleyball league decided to take the "route route" and will no longer be in the middle. <br /> <br /> His father is a photographer and when he hears the old left side show in the city, he decides to find some other way to draw some photographs. <br /> <br /> Of course, the show is inbred <br /> <br /> Only a beautiful event about this film is how the family really struggles against the captives thrown into their own. Apart from this, there is nothing valuable about the movie.
