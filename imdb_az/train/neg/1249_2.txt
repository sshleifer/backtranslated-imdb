Especially in the light of the provided budget, technical resources and talent meeting, what a disappointment. The main rule for philosophy / drama is to stop the disbelieving disbelief in the audience. The POA creates a savings account in 2001, but afterwards, Mr. Burton forgets that his filmmakers are working brains. Helena Bonham Carter's greatest freedom of liberty, the emancipation of the human cap, the ease of escape, the unusual skills of the horse (this is an astronaut and suddenly full of tilt-banding), massive and immediately human rebellion is incredible. Mark Wahlberg has never been surprised by the real fear, danger, or sense of meaning in this world. Comparing Chuck Hester's nakedness, the outgrowth of the kind of events and the fact that he does not miss his surprise. Uniform Wahlberg keeps humble, but also keeps it in a complicated position with noticeable control and control, and we are not really surprised about his happiness. Unlike Heston, it is never really dangerous. Tim Burton should use f / x budget of some authorized scenarios. In fact, why worries about the fact that after the low fiasco, Hollywood producers have difficulty creating scenarios and directors? Let's go to them. The trained monkeys could also do as they did in the Planet of the Monkeys in 2001. I believe that the repetition theory of these efforts will disappear. It could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step for imagination. Another chance lost.
