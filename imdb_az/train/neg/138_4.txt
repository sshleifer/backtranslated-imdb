Well: I liked this movie very much, because it was the first fear movie I was watching for a long time. <br /> <br /> As we know, the storyline and the structure of this movie are incredibly weak. There was nothing more to this. The roads that killed the killers were terrible and disgusting. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <strong>
