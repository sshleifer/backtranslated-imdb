I recently saw with my husband and realized that Caine was better than he believed, although that was not the case at all. The UK's biggest screen player is not interested in this role because it can be uplifted in the game with more love. It is perhaps not surprising that Rex Harrison's character is badly written. <br /> <br /> <strong> William Holden is better, but his screen is delayed, and his character is not well scripted yet. <br /> <br /> Beverly Johnson is a wonderful woman I've ever seen, but very few movies could have earned much more by paying more attention to her story. Ustinov plays at the show, but he's playing a funny character, mainly because he keeps a serious tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> Richard Fleischer should be responsible for not doing this job more efficiently. It is one of the many meaningless adventures of his own. a furious unexpected film director and this is one of his weakest movies.
