<br /> <br /> So far, my second favorite, and even worse than Lazarus and Ghost in the Machine, I thought. Let's start with kindness. Teaser was incredibly good and emotional. <br /> <br /> In this episode, it was fun to see many beautiful animals. <br /> <br /> But then there are all the evil and I believe there is a lot. In a small sense, animals were abducted and imposed by aliens? whaaa ??? The dialogue was also terrible. There was one or two word lines. <br /> <br /> And worse, it was very unpleasant for me to have quite a lot of animals. In the end ... what's the point? all died pretty much. <br /> <br /> We did not learn something in peace, did not have fun, and could not find anything sad in Sophia's death. is shameful, because Season 2 has done a good job.
