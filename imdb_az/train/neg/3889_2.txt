I always love to love it because I love cheerful movies and believe it with a similar theme "Amazing Melancholy Man" would be great fun. <br /> <br /> Not really. That is, the toy was fun funny, there were some classic bad lines on the script, and I liked it because of some special effects that seemed to be the leading role player. Unfortunately, these moments are really accelerating. When I returned to tax, I decided to watch the last half of the film. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the film is a pleasing one. <br /> <br /> However, if you love bad movies, you'll enjoy Fat Nurse's dramatic performance and the perfect act of Dr. Ted. <br /> <br /> In order to be fair to a poor person, he must present a straightforward striking line - a conversation with his spouse to follow me: <br /> with a geiger counter. "" It's radioactive? "" Just a little. "<br /> <br /> Well, the plot, Dr. Ted, is just about to try to find an armed super-armored zombie killing machine just like a mini-Dyson, a brave man. "The god is his ears!" Ted tells the audience, I'm so glad to be so pleased. <br /> <br /> I'm very entertaining to make this movie just 10 minutes, but, unfortunately, it goes on, and the incredible Melting Dude, in my opinion, has a hard time making a sticky confusion when eating more people, if you were really stoned, you probably love it, there's no pop-tarts in the movie because the leading actor It looks like one.
