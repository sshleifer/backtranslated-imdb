This movie has lost me with a cross RPG (rocket ship). It was as if one of the robocop cut and stuck one scene. <br /> <br /> I was watching it because I watched him because Chris Bruno liked the Dead Zone TV show. She chose a strange accent, but at least it was consistent with the whole film - unlike any cost. <br /> <br /> There are many comments on how this film is different from the welding material. But even the movie itself is not the best one. It's just boring that the low budget will not give pretext. The low budget means that at least a good story, dialogue and decent work. There are many things to do. <br /> <br /> Life is not short enough to watch this movie.
