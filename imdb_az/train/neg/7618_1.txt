This is not a movie. Not talent. This is informative. Do not be afraid. This is not fun. <br /> <br /> This is because my cousin says "Diablo! COOL!" Yes, it's true. <br /> <br /> The only thing I'm cool about this experience is that I did not buy it, but instead rented it. <br /> <br /> This is a bad soap opera. Waiting. Soap operas at least LOOK professional ... sorta. What is this? It looks like it's hit with someone's camera. Do not worry! Unhappy! This is sux. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is insulting! Who is this director? You do not even have enough care to look at it. It's STINKS! <br /> <br /> The performances of these poorly-guided actors were better than this crap-fest. <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
