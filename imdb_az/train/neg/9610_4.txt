In the 1930s and 1940s in Hollywood, each studio could be western, except for Warner Bros. They work several times, they are always ridiculous (maybe, perhaps because of their being killed by Boots - this is a cavalry in the West). I read that Humphrey Bogart, sitting at the head of James Cagney, said this big cowboy hat: it looks like a mushroom. True! Cagney and Bogart are a very western film, to be valid in the 20th century western film. The story here was not a surprise and they did not help. Every 10 minutes, I see that Bogart and Cagney put their hands on a machine gun to reduce their small arms and move away from the black machine in the 1930s.
