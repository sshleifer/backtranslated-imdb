When I looked at the box at the video store, when I saw Lisa Raye - she told me that she was Ernie Hudson A.K. * EVERY movie "Le Kiss of Death". Its almost * guaranteed * will be bad (eg, Congo) if film Hudson (deliberately campus and bad Ghostbusters movies). Despite my instincts, I just saw the Civil Brand, another movie theater with Lisa Raye "Tour de force", and I rented it. Finally, I did not see the Hudson instinct in OZ and started watching a very high quality series, so I thought I would give this movie a chance. <br /> <br /> If the lover of bad movies should take a definitive look! It's got to be the most unwelcome funny movie I've seen in loooong time. The area is fairly simple: Racheal (Monica Calhoun) is murdered by a brick band (controlled by Bobby Brown) and, like many action films before, bends her arms over a LAST TIME and promises to take revenge for the sisters death. To do this, they combine the title of Roses (probably based on the true story of a female band) and they go out and take full revenge, and along the way are several golden gold buried in the city. <br /> <br /> It's a nice thing to say about this movie, since what I can say is that the stars have slid their eyes and look at ALL the big galloping. <br /> <br /> Funniest (not funny in the album) scenes? When Stacy Dick's character is known or the character of Calhoun is characterized by the character of Lil 'Kim or Lil' Lisa Raye who was killed by the character of Lisa Rhine or the character of Lisa Reyn or Lil 'Lisa Raye's bag or Asian Chick or Macy Gray's "Borrowed "I can not remember except for the character of Kim who agreed to join the character, Calhoun Racheal and Bobby Brown's Sol-Eye. <br /> <br /> If the director went for a parody and a big comedy, that would be a great movie. Unfortunately, for the first time without exposure, sound design (hip hop is a difficult job) is trying to appear negatively without designer design, writing or periodic research (either me or the cleanest people in the ancient western mouth ?). Normally, when I see a movie that is not very good I can say to myself, "Can you do something better?" I'm asking. This is the answer unequivocally "YES!" This is the first time in a long time.
