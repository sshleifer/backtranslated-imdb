For such a great classic tale, the setting (place), Grendel was heartbreaking. As a writer, I blame a scenario that is not entirely barred from dramatic tension. The club story story is useful and has a new character in the literary classics. Some of the strange reasons Rubrikan has fallen early. It took me 21 days to get to know me, "she ran" and unfortunately shows. Now you have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I'm talking about the FX, I can really cope with the pitiful CGI, but the script has rock, and it's just too slow, spartan and not in drama. I would blame the actors ... but because I know more than the actor I will choose my colleague.
