As an engineer, I say that the first season of this show was very encouraging. Most of the mathematics applied were somewhat acceptable, and the relationship between Eppes' brothers and their father showed an interesting edge. <br /> <br /> But after the first season, the show began to get worse. <br /> <br /> Most of the mathematics and technologies used in exploration are now facing reality and are very funny for all those involved in science and technology. <br /> <br /> The presence of actors is still felt and I'm fair. <br /> <br /> < I'll follow it, just go to the first season and probably the second one. After that I do not waste my time. <br /> <br /> Season 1 - 8 stars Season 2 - 5 stars Season 3 - 3 star <br /> <br /> Come on up to 4 stars. Since Charlie does not know his math now, I will not worry about my accuracy.
