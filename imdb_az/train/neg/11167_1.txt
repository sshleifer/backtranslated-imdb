Jack Black can normally smoke me through the breathing, but in this movie ... <br /> <br /> Besides the director, writing, plot failure, permanent abduction (supported by constant plain camera shooting), and a The average of .050 jokes was meanwhile there was no time loss. This idea sounds encouraging, but I'm spending some of the worst things I've seen on this part of the world, with a lack of comedy. <br /> <br /> I'm very negative about this movie Mexican. Undoubtedly, this is really a film racist. I think this is a result of a "creative" team who try to find something more "cartoon". <br /> <br /> But for racism, for love of everything, PRICE! on the one hand charges. Everyone who has good money and time to watch this stack of remaining nutrition beans to be betrayed when you fall into it, IMO.
