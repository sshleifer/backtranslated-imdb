Everyone in the 1950s, 60s and 70s was a movie or two by American International Pictures, a distributor of the same sort as the giant Cannon Films of the 1980s. Everywhere you go, movie makers will be there to provide AIP's latest vogue titles - horror films such as' Voodoo Woman 'and' Undead 'came in the' 50s. In the 1960s, Frankie Avalon-Annette Funicello had beach comedies and biker flys like 'The Glory Stompers'; In the 70's, grindhouse level garbage such as AIP, 'Cannibal Girls' and 'Sugar Hill' produced. <br /> <br /> Dillinger, produced in 1973, captures the true spirit of the higher 'AIP' shooting movie; is one of those unequal, multi-tiered parts, which ensures that the masses are cursed for fun, craft and healthy thinking. Generally, it is typical for the cycle "Dillinger": fun and a few hours worth, but, of course, it's not memorable. "Dillinger" was a fair effort by screenwriter John Milius ("Magnum Force"), but he was strong in both activities and historical truth, but of course, he had a place for improvement in his wide career. 109-minute "Dillinger" - epic for AIP coverage - FBI Midwest's review by Melson Purvis's actor Laureate Ben Johnson. Purvis was a revenge-seeker for four FBI agents killed in Kansas City in 1933, so the gangster saved Frank Nashi from justice. Probably the expert in crisis, including John Dillinger (Warren Oates), Pretty Boy Floyd (Steve Kanaly) and psychopath Baby Face Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss). Dillinger joined Floyd and Nelson in the end with Homer Van Meter (Harry Dean Stanton) and Harry Pierpont (Geoffrey Lewis). He also links with Billie Frechette (Michelle Phillips), a French and Indian prostitute. For several months in 1933-4, Dillinger is primarily an intelligence film, Purvis's works, and those who want to kill and kill the men they want by J. Edgar Hoover. <br /> <br /> 'Dillinger' has a documentary feeling, list dates, and places while giving a blank summary like Johnson Purvis. Milius maintains an honest Depression look using the original fashion, car, gun and building; he is also sprinkled around the scenes of black-and-white photographs and gangster shootouts. The film is not elegant, it moves fast, it is fast, it is moving fast. Event scenes are a powerful position of Dillinger, modified by Fred Feitshans Jr in his last professional effort. To prepare this film, thousands of empty ammunition tours should be used and should not mention explosives. This film, of course, is indestructible with people who are shot and killed for everyone. <br /> <br /> <BR> <strong> John Milius is somewhat overrated as filmmaker, focusing on the event gives. Effective and comparable scenes of action (mostly blood-stroke) with any major crime scene of the era, including "Bonnie and Clyde" in the 1967s. But we just know many people about Dillinger and his network members; The vital relationships between Dillinger and Frechette are discussed only during a minute's conversation at the bar and just as young as ten minutes later. Melvin Purvis has become a remarkable figure when the Milius movie is not to be opened, and appears to be jealous of the event. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the film's main crimes are ignorant of the historical fact. Most of the 'Dillinger' movies are just movies that make these examples and make them permanent. Those who know the story of Gangster indicate that John Dillinger is not the last person to die because Milius's scenario and the documentary style of the film encourage us to believe. In fact, Dillinger Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter have died before; he was not about to carry the weapon at night of his death, nor was there Billie Frechette. <br /> <br /> Milius said he would not be in a state of inaccuracies and that they did not write a great story around them. <br /> <br /> Warren Oates's Dillinger performance is pretty good, though sometimes it seems unbelievable. Oates describes how humorous and beautifully how Dillinger was abandoned in the American press with more lifestyles; But we will never feel the danger we call her life. I give Johnson Purvis a lifetime, but it's more straightforward. Michelle Phillips brings the feeling to Billie Frechette's character, and it's really bad that Milius's scenario does not appeal to Dillinger. In addition to a stereotype of an easy girl involved in menacing no danger, she learned what made her a cold-blooded killer. <br /> <br /> As part of the 1970s, Dillinger retail sales agreements have been ignored. The roles supported by Kanaly, Dreyfuss, Stanton, Lewis and short-sighted Chloris Leachman can be accepted for such talent. I got the DVD version of MGM for $ 4.99. The film is presented in subtitles on large screens (in the French and Spanish language) in a beautiful way. Dillinger theater trailer is added individually. The Gangster film is largely forgotten by fans and fans of enthusiasts, but does not invite the film to add anything else. <br /> <br /> Caucasus refugees and internally displaced persons,
