I read the man who escaped from Kings books like Bachman and felt the main character John and his family. This movie could have been a lot more. Unhappiness? The big action movie was set during the nudity. I watched the film and it was all over my head. I did not feel anything for the character, and the reason was little. Yes, though I did not keep watch in my eyes, it was funny scenes (or smile). <br /> <br /> When you read this movie, you can feel the fire and fire in John's heart when you receive the last revenge. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a few. If I had not read the book, it would not have been down.
