No? I did not think so! Here's just one thing to do in this case, stay away from the remotest "Do you want to know a secret" because it's just the fifth pointless post of Scream slasher, which is absolutely no cost. The land is very funny; the heroes fail to be impatient, the small number of gore-factors, and everything is just boring! As you can see from the film's headline, this film focuses mainly on the film "I Know What's Getting What's Going In The Last Summer" because the events occur in a similar situation and the motive of the murderer is equal. Why it is a secret for me if everyone wants to steal the trash ideas like "IKWYDLS". At least this movie may depend on the precious shelf of Jennifer Love Hewitt, but the girls in this lane are unreasonable, very unkind. A year after his wife's still unsolved crime, Beth Morgan, a new low-lover and four other thought-provoking college students go to Florida to spend the Spring Break holiday at a fantastic beach home. The murderer did not move all year, but now he follows his position in Florida and begins to scream when leaving a titled message like some business card. Indeed, the writers' attempts to conceal and mislead the face of an unspeakably ridiculous mask are obviously embarrassing, so there is no immediate horror-expert. Since the plot is very subtle, most of the film is completely irrelevant padding, including subfields associated with unauthorized Floridian police, and a "mysterious" FBI inspector with personal accounts to solve. The offense goes out of the screen (do not hate it if you happen to do so), and there's no good T & A to get you enjoyed, and you do not get the quality of better dialogues. You suffer from this kind of misfortune, and you understand that the slashers of the 80's have a good passion.
