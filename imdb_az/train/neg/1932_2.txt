If the creators of Atlantis say something in this movie, the subject has drowned (in its full meaning) with emphasis on "special effects" on the character. It is said that, as the attempt to "continue" with the rest of the blockbusters in the summer, Disney has come up with a movie, characterized by a Star Wars "shoot-up-up". with stereotype heroes and villains. <br /> <br /> Art cartoony and manufacturers think that I can rely on flying fishing and underwater computer generated images (CGI) to fill the gap. They are inaccurate and beautiful, gloved animated days flippers the window in favor of the CGI assembly line. <br /> <br /> This film is a heartless whole curtain. <br /> <br /> Some movies are coming to be a good, precious movie, but by avoiding to talk about an irritable thing, rather than choosing to go with glitz instead, it's already angered. <br /> <br /> The film is pacing. Starts with confusion and then a heedless story begins to put a rocket on the editing style. The watchman, along with Milo Thatch (well-known by Michael F. Fox), fled the door and said, "I think there must be many things to happen after coming to Atlantis." Unfortunately, not much. The secret of Atlantis remains hidden with those who tell stories without knowing how to explain the legendary island / continent. They are afraid to say where Atlantis is in a strange story. In the Atlantic? In the Mediterranean? Who knows? Nothing is even hypothetical from a fantasy-based perspective. When asked by the audience about the theater, "What was all this now? What is the purpose of the film? Why did many Atlanteans from the right not know how to survive the disaster" to the present "? Why did Atlantis leak? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < the excentric zillioner, the collective consciousness of Kida (spoiler), and the people of VOLUNTARILY, who have found more expanse travel on the planet! The crew gathered 2-dimensional people who went on anachronically in 1948, P.C. (for 1914). race and sex. He meets demolition experts as soon as they leave Warner Brothers' Bugs Bunny. Most of the pictures are a lightweight liner that has been abducted largely by the audience for two reasons: they are rapidly delivered at lightning speeds and are often murmured. It is difficult to convince the supporting players to make a moral return to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Disney for trying to create animated cartoons for adults and this is not Disney's favorite, chattering animals or objects - it does not go through. Small children will be scared by some motion scenes and have to remain in the dark in a large number of subtitles (when the character is talking to the Atlantic). In the first five minutes of the expedition, about 200 people were killed in a second thought. Obviously, if Disney thinks you do not know who these people are, then what should you pay attention to? Again, the film has no feelings at all levels. Mulan and Tarzan were the latest animated films produced by Disney. Unfortunately, Atlantis returns to the unsuccessful attempts of the past Black Bull and Nuremple Dame Hunchback. Disney should turn to their roots. We go to Peter Pan soon after, but nobody knows how to do it until you see yourself. Now, he hopes that he will understand that Disney Science Fiction should be the kind of genre that's different to him. We also hope that Treasure Planet, which is in line with Robert L. Stevenson's "Treasure Island", will bring him more heart than Atlantis: The Lost Emperor.
