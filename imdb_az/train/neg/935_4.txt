Users who appreciate this movie just did not see enough good movies to compare it. Did all this sneeze your brain? <br /> <br /> The movie about the first film is just a movie. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; take it to the end, and directly made of a prosecution. And another. And another. And another. Sometimes you see a pattern emerging? <Br /> <br /> another iki Bourne filmini görməsəniz, çox xoşbəxt oldunuz. <br /> <br /> Pol Qreqrassın nifrətsiz tərzi United 93-də çox yaxşı işləmişdir. Bu, baş verməyəcəyini düşünməkdir. Bourne və onun davamlı qəzaları yalnız tamaşaçıları xarakterə cəlb etməkdən çəkindirir. O qaçır. it atlayır. he's punches. he exploded. High-premises clean. Yada yada it or not. first of all - he survives. he's just funny stuntsları all kinds tension draws and any tension that deprives a plastic action like a man survived. So chasing the building? Why? she will remain. Slow. <br /> <br /> Bournenin's love interest in the previous Incarnation were killed and thrown into the mix, because it's a girl, but she just dekoras Iya. <br /> <br /> Bournenin their trip a unique discovery of the first film does not hesitate and non-formal bilmədiklərimizdən us to be reported. He turned into a murder machine. Great job. She finds her true identity. So what? <br /> <br /> The end of the "bending" telegraph and is weak. Oh, dear, I hate it more than I think about this movie! At the time of writing this comment, I downloaded my account to 4! <br /> <br /> I love having a good action and I love a good tension. What is Bourne Ultimatum? It's noisy, reproducing a series of tedious adjustments, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​"guiding" the Bond franchise is completely bent. Casino Royale throws it in the water.
