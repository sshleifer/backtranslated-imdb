From the beginning, and then from Q & A, I can collect this: Some Irish people want to make a movie. Especially nothing, any movie. So, one night of the party, he teaches a classic cashback rehearsal to some old words; Gram Parsons's body was burned at JoshuaTree, telling Parsons that his body was stolen from LAX. Wow! <br /> <br /> What a great idea for a movie! Rock n 'Roll (well, country), grab pee, run, friendship, 70! If you think you can get Johnny Knoxville from "Jackass," this is the kind of toy that Knoxville wants to make a "movie." <br /> <br /> Well, this event is not really interesting ... We need something to fight for Knoxville. After the money they look like a psychological girl. !! But Parsons was married. O.K., nobody knows it. Besides, we can get Christina Applegate. But if the audience does not like the idea of ​​a corpse, what will we do is join the chase, but eventually we will let it. The Parsons' father killed himself when he was 10, actually an orphan's status and tragic childhood, the main parts of the Parsons mythology. Mythology? "We're making a movie!" This is the solution of creative problems. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> It is an experience that is uncomfortable for anyone interested or interested in this topic. Applegate's presence doubles crushing. The Beverly Hills prostitute who invented her character from the very beginning - could have wandered around a cell phone in the hands of the whole film, and secondly, what kind of a harpy parsons? Facts are not just distorted or left, but are DONE. <br /> <br /> In Parsons, STEPfather found the foreigner who wanted him to try to get his body back. <br /> <br /> And music, oh, my favorite music. The music is surrounded by the cunning new indie band Starsailor, after which the hacked music (here's a song bridge, the chorus) was forced. My girlfriend asked for an unnecessary, but irresistible question after the movie - where everyone, writer, producer, director, actually a Gram Parson fan? Yes, no. She really did not hear the Gram Parsons, but of course I learned to be fortunate, and I have a faktoids that I read in bio online. Another man touched the coolness of Parsons, saying that he wrote "Wild Horse" in combination with Kith Richards, and was involved in many truths as a non-core film. Another man asked, "Would not it be morally unreasonable to rewrite history when most people were only aware of this movie?" <br /> <br /> Therefore, he has permitted the Parsons property with the permission of the real royalty (he has been identified) and said that all those who have earned money are great. <br /> <br /> But if the movie I really really wanted was a million (1 million), the original Gram Parsons fanist would not have been a spectator, and he really asked for a shocking, terrifying sound of the Parsons Geek. The director and writer thinks there is no figure with any fanbase, although I suspect that Mojo magazine has read, the country-rock 70 musicians agree. But a group of British postpones it, and they just did not care about Cosmic American Music or even knew it was available. It's not just a right Parsons flick, not even the right soul - it does not even fit into the legend. At least one of his songs should be sentimental. <br /> <br /> In some films, on the one hand, we would like to tell a lot of people. <br /> <br /> I have to remember that the film was a good idea of ​​a group of stoned college kids, the edge of the slope, and Johnny Knoxville. But if you are a fan of Parsons, if you do not see the title, a movie for Jackass supporters.
