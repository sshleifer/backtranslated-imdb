Okay, this is the main idea. In 1933 Peter Sellers was Dr Fu Manchu, a 168-year-old Chinese man who lived a long time. The film begins with a birthday celebrated in a special potion (the film is never called), extending its life. On this occasion, an elixir of an elder (from Kato Pink Panther films) falls unfounded, and he orders orders to find 6 rare items to disperse your little ones. It creates a global man fleeing from the diamond museums and trying to get out of London, to find out about Dr Fu's German, Retired Scottish Yard Detective Nayland Smith, who is also trying to stop him in the future. his last full-length feature film before he died. The terrible tragedy was in him. Sellers with such a gifted comedian and memorable 'comic' role in Panther films and particles in the 'The Party' movie are something in this film. This film was definitely tortured to sit, and I did not even finish it. She was totally confused when watching DIES and Sellers performance. How can I do it a year ago after the great deal of "Do not" and how did we do it? <br /> <br /> As the first person says, the first 10..15 minutes is ok but then ALL DOWNHILL ... <br /> Avoid as dead. <br />
