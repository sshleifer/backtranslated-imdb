It looks like Edwin thrills a beautiful story of Torres. The story in this movie book is unseen. <br /> <br /> If the screenwriter saw the first movie, there are many discrepancies with the original film to surprise. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (original and still the best Carlito) comes out of prison, the original of the original. Here, Carlito enters paradise with a woman. <br /> What happened to Gail, Lorain, Ohio? According to Kleinfeld, according to Klienfeld, it does not mean that Carlito is back and maybe marry another girl. I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also love Mr Guzman playing a completely different character in this film. Pacino's days were Pachanga. Now he is a murderer of Cuban Nacho Reyes. I remember playing Nacho Reyes a bigger role in the book. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since I read the book, but where did the character of Sean Comb come from? Also, in my opinion, this film shows that Torres's racist tension in Harlem is really glamorous. The group can not get treatment in the book. They are also deleted in this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the films belong to the Pleasant Avenue group. This film could tell a great story. This is a great disappointment. Read the book. Better use of your time.
