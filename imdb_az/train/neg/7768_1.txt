This God has postponed the film, it takes three steering wheel millionaires collecting a group of people to play a deadly game and earning a million dollars. Above all, the player is strange and the film does not give any sense in any sense. It was not the least scare, it made me laugh that it was stupid, so it earned a star. The film is not intense, but quite confused and generally attracts women's hearts all the time. and some of the characters are very boring and bright. Moreover, in this film monsters are very striking and fake and not scary, just want to shoot something on the screen. The latter, however, is at least end-to-end. I do not want to give it to you, if you really want to see this paragraph quite strange. <br /> <br /> Poverty, rudeness, and gross profit are not appreciated (but R must be).
