Brief overview: This movie touches everyone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Firstly, I am not a puddress, and it can be fun for a few moments. Horoscope is not bad. But in general, it's not just boring and exciting, it's not funny. A few simple jokes are repeated and repeated. <br /> <br /> This movie is only available to squeeze a few dollars recently from Laurel and Hardy, a commercial brand. Manufacturers can not have any real respect for their place in film history or in their talents. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter liked me, and I was like a parent;)
