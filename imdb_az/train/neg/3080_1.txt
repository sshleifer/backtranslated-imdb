Hee hee hee. This film is so bad that it does not even try to hide that it's a great time. I remember the day I saw MST. The sun was bright, it looked like a good day. and then I saw the product of Rick Sloane, a terrifying plush doll that creates air on the festoon of the 80's. Kevin, wussy extraordinaire, tries to impress his girlfriend, helps the security guard, fights rats and has more in the form of a very bad look. No plot or story is needed. As the film proves, it is clear that no action is needed. An army boy and a sexy girl will not want to leap from a cliff, and a friend who is able to start a phone sex will say, "There are some beautiful red shorts." Of course, I hate an old security guard and wish her a car accident. Just wait until you get to the Club Scum scene. <br /> <br /> When I see this movie, I strongly recommend a good bear to get good emotion and foolishness. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good stroke to show him how much we appreciate the crapster piece named Hobgoblins.
