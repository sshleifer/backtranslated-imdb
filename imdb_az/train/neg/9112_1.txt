Basically, Cruel Intentions 2 are cruel intentions. The story is the same as the first one (even some lines) with only a few exception. The cast is more unknown and definitely less capable. Instead of drawing me to be attractive and watching, I ended up with my ugly feelings, as compared to soft gentle porn. I'm not sure if I'm blaming some sexual lines against actors or writers ... and I always say bad, because I know how to complicate both of them ... but basically two are hours of my life. It's astonishing to me that some movies will be shot and this is no exception ... I do not believe what they want to do.
