Have not seen any movie in a shocking way? I can think a lot about this union, but there is nobody to implement it. The cast is all terrible stereotypes lumbered by a straight dialogue. I'm ashamed of all those involved in doing this. Everyone keeps the phrase of fear that does not come out of the plot, but this project can easily nix his career. Even Diaz's many charms do not provide enough for himself. It should not be avoided that the Americans are really a movie style that they do not understand. If necessary, look at the final result and see what I'm talking about, but I'm not telling you ...
