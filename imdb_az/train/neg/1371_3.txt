I do not understand how badly anyone can get a budget for a movie. Television station is hopeless for something, nothing like it. Many are under the snow, the power is blinking steady, but there is a magical light on a permanent background. What is this (false) light? This is a stupid twist between the characters. They try to find ways to live more than complain about each other. It works to help people in emergencies and situations. But because of this bad behavior and action, Florence Nightingale will not apologize with this flick. I agree with negative reviews, and I agree that this is one of the worst films ever.
