Underground Comedy is probably the worst train accidents I've ever seen. Fortunately, I did not pay for this movie, and my husband agreed to watch him sit in an awkward position, but I needed to prove how awful he was. I like color comedy. At least I thought that would have been and I would have liked it. No, instead of the player was terrifying, "jokes" were very fond of, and there was no place to find. Maybe it should have been a field that I can not hold against this movie. The funniest thing in a comedy is Batman's frowning face. It's a pretty sad thing to be an old woman ... A man wearing a baseball bat that creates a bat. You. Just genius. The creators of this film have created it and laughed respectfully with their friends. Perhaps this was full of jokes that we did not understand. Perhaps this is the worst trash part and must be locked in a vault and thrown off the Arctic Ocean. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not take this movie!
