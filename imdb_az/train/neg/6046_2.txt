This film essentially drank two-hour Dafoy's character - almost completely - death. The only surprise in this movie is that you do not have enough tips or character knowledge to surprise. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is the perfect actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent player. But this movie just sucked. Slow film was not bad, just bad. The sketchy plot, mixed with the ramblings of the anamorphic details, is not drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot, except that it emphasizes a number of similarities from the perspective. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but it has forced me to sleep as fun. (I slept seriously and had to watch the movie again - even worse). <br /> <br /> I generally do not want to make negative comments or comments on others' works. They sucked, but this movie guaranteed one. It is very bad that these great players are embarrassed with this final result.
