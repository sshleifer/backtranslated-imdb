I remember this movie once in a week in Barcelona, ​​Spain in 1970. It may seem incredible, and I can not provide any explanation for this film, art and great qualities (it's Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Buelluell, and ... Predicted Adam). Some people have seen this (lucky people, no doubt) and no mention of this very boring SF movie can be found on the Peter Nichols Science Encyclopedia or the author of the original novel. Very Indicator. I remember that, after all these years, no story seems to be actually ridiculous and has many special effects. In some countries, the processing time is 90 mm. and the mother 77 minutes. Well, it means a bit more pain.
