After reading the comments on the site, I had to write for the first time. This movie looks like Marmite and distributed audiences. Although I agree with movies, I do not have to be unpleasant (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to deal with the characters. I have to say that I should not be able to give Mr. Green one day or another cardboard gangsters living in the midst of the day when Lynch is completely sucked in with the deadly lesbian problem in opus. <br /> <br /> At the same time, if you say that many people have tried and you do not enjoy it, I have to agree - I enjoyed it because I did not enjoy it. I wanted the movie to end and I did not listen to it again and again. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the main reason for writing is to ask all other reviewers a question. . Only music over black. Did I watch the Dud pressure or prove GR's ambition? Or does anyone in the movie watch the rough cut and have their names been deleted?
