This movie is bad. I am not just "bad"; "Statue of pessimists was bad"; "It was also bad on the stage ..." I say bad, as no one should be brought to criminal responsibility for removing this mixture, which undoubtedly does not want to give a public vapor. I can even say something like this (Plot?) I will not respect one explanation. I think about another reason I can watch the movie for about 40 years. a wave of waves. I do not mean that nobody goes out to shoot a bad film, or is it? Yes Yes. As it is seen ... and the guilty man writer / director Ulli Lommel. The worst of this is the fact that Blockbusters are really hiring customers to do so! Be advised. Leave it where it belongs. Stuck on the shelf, collects dust.
