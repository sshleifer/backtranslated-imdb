Andy became acquainted with HARDY DEBUTANTE (1940) and was the ninth (9) film of the series and inevitably directed. Characters were ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and Lewis Stone, front and center. The rest of the rubbish punchers and collect their checks. <br /> <br /> Lewis Stone, continuing along the series, will continue to show JUDGE HARDY's character sympathetically. The remainder of the cast would be a professional, though less or less. On the other hand, Mickey Rooney would continue as if he did not have a learning curve. ANDYs's reaction to any situation was naive and incredible. <br /> <br /> After returning to the World War II veteran at VIDEO HARDY LOVE LAUGHS (1946), the reaction to any 'tea kettle' was the same, childhood. <br /> <br /> It is clearly described in this movie. ANDY takes himself in a few incredible situations that will be solved by a simple explanation. This screensaver was known as 'idiot plot'. A tool for lengthening a script written down. Perhaps Mickey Rooneys' mistake was later Director and Writer. Most probably, George B. Seitz had to direct many, and a harsher hand would have to oversee the superiority of Rooneys. To see the overview of the series, go to YOU ​​YOU ONLY YOUNG ONLY (1937).
