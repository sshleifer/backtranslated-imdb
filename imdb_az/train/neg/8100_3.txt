Vanity's Bonfires is a film that has been filtered off in the flop. We can remember no movie that is very dangerous, provocative and trying to be important, but it has been consistently failed in this squad yet. It's like a laughable comedy, but it can not leave the scene. The harder it is to film, the more sounds of smile in every attempt. <br /> <br /> The despair of the film is so subtle. <br /> <br /> The film only laughs twice with a loud voice. At one time, Geraldo Rivera plays a prominent, arrogant and brazen TV broadcaster - it is probably laughable that he does not realize he is playing. Another scene deserving of humor is the final "great moment" of the film that Morgan Freeman has played in a conservative lecture on what moral conduct is ("what your mother taught"). The longing for the moment is an insult to the point of being absurd. <br /> <br /> At the same time, this should be a noble effort. The group of actors who want to prepare characters from cartoons are fine if there is a weak cast. The film seems to be just like the professionally designed and small cinematography director Brian DePalma, especially not effective. As you can see, the film, which wants to comment on modern morals and ethics, does not go beyond the cartoon. Satire requires style. Farce requires energy. Even the sitcom requires time. But the best Bonfire can be direct, hopelessness. Finally, you do not want to laugh, you just want to turn away.
