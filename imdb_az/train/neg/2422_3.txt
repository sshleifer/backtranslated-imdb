This film really does not have children better and better relationships as family movies, which will not be considered a family, because there are some things children should not see. If you ask me is not the best ABC Family movie. Maybe it would be better if there were less sexually explicit subjects in the film. Hollywood does not do anything to make a better movie in addition to sexual situations. There is really no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I do not want to rent my money from this rubbish. If you have anything else to watch this movie, contact them.
