This movie was terrible. I watched three times, and even all the things. Watching is not only possible, it silences the story line, is unhappy and completely disgusting. I do not write spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, look for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his dialogue and some comic pieces in the movie. This film is a little child, and the whole situation is boring. I saw this movie in film stores around America, so it was a good movie. Jesus Christ I made a mistake !!!! The whole leadership is terrible and the nakedness itself is also bare and filthy. What's more, the other main character, Starr Andreef, was not so bad in the past, in fact, he was pretty good. It's the same as John Savage. This movie is SUCKS!
