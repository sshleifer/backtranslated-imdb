If you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosini as co-stars, you are thinking of finding a good horror movie, but it's really different, as I have described as an early effort to science fiction. Carloff and Lugosi play both Rukh and Benet, as well as a demonstration of his great theory until he gets Rukh Benet. Here, the scientific - at least to say the least rough around the edges (science fiction with emphasis on science fiction), but in some way Rukh several thousand years ago, allowing him to see several thousand stars from Andromeda in the ground. "In the past historical period a huge meteorite can be destroyed by subtracting a substance called "Radium X" by multiplying in Africa.The majority of the film is in a tougher situation in Africa, searching for meteorite deposits that it has finally found to create a great weapon, unfortunately <br /> <br /> Carloff and Lugosi were pretty good here, and Lugosi was a good guy, although I was somewhat incredibly skillful during the scenes depicted in Africa The story was a little wrapped up and my attention was focused They did not capture me, this is not a horror scary, but a fantasy, and considering that intelligence is at an early stage, I think the film is a bit slow. It was okay - nothing more, less than that. 4/10
