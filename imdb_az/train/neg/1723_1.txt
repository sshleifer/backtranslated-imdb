Man, this was a deception! (I did not expect anything from me) because there was nothing wrong with Stuart Whitman, Stella Stevens and Tony Bill, as well as the "stars" ignorantly paraded by the DVD lever. Of course, their names did not appear in the opening credits of the film, and more on the rest! As you can see, the only film that united these three actors was equally dark in LAS VEGAS LADY (1975)? but what is the relationship with CRERE LAKE MONSTER? <br /> <br /> Even though I paid $ 1.50 for her to rent and chose to follow any movie monsters regardless of the movie, and yup it stunk! Because of having an unnamed and anonymous crew, an unspecified air flees from the air and laughs at most such JAWS I can do, and deliberately, two moronic layabouts-cum boats owners antics. Creature itself? a plesiosaur, namely half dinosaur / half fish? (naturally) is understood as imperfect, but unlike what I have seen, GIANT CLAW (1957) does not seem to bother the filmmakers, especially in the second half of the movie!
