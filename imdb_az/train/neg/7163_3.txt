<br /> <br /> If Trance or Eternal has called this movie, I would say to myself, "Have not I seen at least one of the worst movies I've ever seen?" A movie, action, leadership, writing and it can be at least fun and worthwhile, even if it's in a good way. But this movie is not bad at artistic value, it's incredibly boring. For such delicacy, it moves slowly with little dramatic tension. At least, the death of characters could have been cool and / or terrible, but the creator of this worm was also unsuccessful at the attempt to run down the fun. <br /> <br /> Does this movie go for it? Christopher Walken, as long as he did not abandon the entertainment that is capable of being brilliant, because he was in the parody mode and made little effort on his movement (WHY did he decide to do this in any way?). <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10, because God helps us, it has been a bad movie before.
