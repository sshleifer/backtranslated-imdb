I curse this movie. The original Phantasm had such a beautiful air and mystery. It looked like it was more than 70 horror, and it felt like a creepy, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II has been active since the late 80's, but it has kept its focus in mind. Unfortunately, Phantasm III is just scary. The strange phenomena in previous films will be dramatized in an astonishing manner and will reduce their power. It embarrasses the appearance of the original Phantasm as the cheap reenactor of the original. There are many flying sites in this movie that appear to be more commonplace as pest pests than fatal frogs. It hangs from the ceiling like Christmas balls on the party. Nobody - King, DP, editor, director - warned or careful attitude? Even worse, Phantasm III offers a mixed, unfunny joke. How different is the intensity of the first film? The original Phantasm used humor to overcome the suddenness of death. Phantasm III uses the death to create innumerable cheap jokes about Reggie's horniness: several movies "Flying ball" ha-ha, oh, I get it, collects it. Maybe the crew had been hit by these jokes, but they were with us.
