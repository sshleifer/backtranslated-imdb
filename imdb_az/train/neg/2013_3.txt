This movie sounds roughly: a futuristic version of the Cinderella legend, but with song and (quite invented) sex scenes! The film does not believe what it wants to do, and it is very difficult. While this film is more expensive than most of Al Adamsson's films, it's not at the budget level, and the audience is expecting fantastic movies. Actors are pretty bad, and unlike most Adamson films, there are no older candidates or B actors. Some music is good, but you can see why Cinderella 2000 was forgotten for many years.
