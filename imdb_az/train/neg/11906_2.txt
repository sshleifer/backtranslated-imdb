Watching the movie "Der der Umm Berlin" as a teenager in the 1980s was a profound experience for me - it could have been movies. <br /> <br /> Along with Paris, Texas, and the "End of the World", I have a special place in my heart and mind - a word from Wim Wenders's genius. <br /> <br /> With a "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Plenty of Land", a steady decline in the quality of its work hits a terrible low point. Go to stunning pictures or music. Look up or show a great idea. <br /> <br /> Everything that is left is characteristic and is politically sensitive, which is nothing more than clich√©s, and it is mocking enough of the listener's intelligence. <br /> <br /> Is it well established? Whatever the reason, it's time for Mr. Vendee to take this step or stop it.
