Originally, I did not see a Tarzan movie, but I saw on the tele that I would give it a shot. Unfortunately, I have to say I'm disappointed. Tarzan was 40 years old and slightly overweight. I do not imagine how the style will look. If I miss a cup of tea myself, Tarzan has never called for its traditional war. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Anyway, Jane was there - Monkey Cheeta was there. There was a guy there with a guitar. There were friends and good guys and a romance ... all very harmless and predictable. Nothing is bad, you understand, but it's not the same good thing. <br /> <br /> Not the best movie to introduce Tarzan: 4/10
