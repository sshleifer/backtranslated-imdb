Frank Taylor's "Home Fronts" is one of the more brave personal Snafu shorts, a series of cartoon guides designed for soldiers. Instead of the "House Front," Instead of some unusual acts that lead to disaster, Snafu pays attention to how much they offer their loved ones to their home and war effort. Snafu easily realized that he was wrong. It's a concept that has several opportunities for good gags, and Instead, Tashlin plays more jokes that cover striptease-lovers and little dance-girls in a funny relief spot. The result is, in addition to artifacts, which have little importance today or have a good value.
