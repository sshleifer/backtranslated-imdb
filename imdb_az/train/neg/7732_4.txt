Before I reviewed this, I went back and read the rest of the review. This movie was a special disappointment for me, because my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, are often spectacular Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights", "Ice Station Zebra", "The Thomas Crowne Affair"). stilted, unmotivated, and unoriginal, songs were unforgettable, a joke, and even the suit was not particularly flattering, but the photograph took a good mood and spirit, and I really enjoyed the Rochefortun Young Girls.
