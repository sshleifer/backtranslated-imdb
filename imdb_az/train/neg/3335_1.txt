The Cannon Film Tale is the worst and a five-minute demonstration is a positive proof that a full-length movie did not. The weak Sid Cesar looks at the empty place as emperor, so stupid that it is difficult to watch. Like Sly Tailor, Robert Morse has no charm. Also, the "song" of his elder boy (Jason Carter) is terrible and slows down what's just about the plot. The move is practically non-existent and adds a bit of support. Lysette Anthony is as beautiful as the emperor's daughter, but her voice is obviously a fate that many small gamers share. And the film scans a snail rapidly. When this happened, Hans Kristian fled somewhere in Andersen's grave. Honestly, at least it's not surprising that the film's footage, the video's oblivion, went straight.
