I do not want Zelferelli to use the word "terrible" to describe any of the movies he has spent on effort, talent, and money to adapt to Charlotte Bronte's novel, Jane Eyre. <br /> <br /> The scenario is flawless and powerless, and everything is inadequate to the audience by explaining it in an uncertain way. Leading actors are failing badly, horses for their star names, music scores are drippy and boring. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt did not own each other completely. It is worse than Joan Fontaine, who, as an old noodle, is at least anxious to get emotionally involved in a part of the story of exciting passion. And William Hurt plays the whole movie in one ton and it's tone smooth and energy-free. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Caucasus and vapid script to paralyze any life from such subtle actors does not help their efforts. <br /> <br /> Joan Plowright's Mrs. Fairfax, to sweeten the scenes best produced. <br /> <br /> There is no secret of Rochester's first husband's story. <br /> <br /> The role of the second wife played by Elle MacPhearson as Barbie Doll is an empty cipher. <br /> <br /> Fiona Shaw, a very great actress, just like Jane's aunt, Ms. Reed wastes. Like Fairfax, it would be better. Just like Jane's favorite school teacher, Amanda Root reveals any original sympathy or credulity. <br /> <br /> I saw this version of Jane Eyre, for Robert Young's 1997 English TV, Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. No comparison. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Youth's vital, romantic and deep-rooted version is not like a nova that exploded in comparison to Zefferelli's plot. <br /> <br /> It would be interesting to watch the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton. everything on this website. I was surprised how many people loved Zefferelli's Yorkshire painting book. <br /> <br /> Everything that I can say good about this movie is that the house is beautiful, and the cinematography is painted alive, and that's exactly what it is.
