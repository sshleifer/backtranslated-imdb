The staggering tempo of this film touches any shock that can sustain us. There is no real decline. Most of the characters were insipid. The illustrious Irish priest was naked as the interests of love. Interesting is wrong. The girl they choose to make the film's sensitivity better. The central conflict of the main character has not been solved. This movie is absolutely positive. Today, he does not want to go to the gym, but he is always going to be a coach.
