When I put together a nice mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, I do not know why they do not like this version of "Believe". I guess they wanted to create a long-term version, but of course, many things should be deleted; Unfortunately, what is going on in the cutting room, all the good wit and humor, the English morality and moresin is not an entertaining show, but just a melodrama movie. <br /> <br /> Also, the characters were level and uninteresting. Poor Mother, the captain Wentworth's abusive adolescent kidnapped the street and then missed it (and let me know if it's silly modern adolescence to read: heat is cool after working after a man like a woman). <br /> <br /> This is a well-educated woman of the Napoleonic era, and it will never happen, and of course, this is not a major hero. <br /> <br /> Some say that my reaction was not a laugh, but a betrayal. The claim of such a corruption in an Austen job is hated. <br /> <br /> Was Gaza.
