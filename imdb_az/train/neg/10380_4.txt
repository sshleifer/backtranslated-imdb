I do not think anyone who seeks to watch this movie expect something far from being a classic dream, but you should ask yourself when it's over when you are not afraid. It does not really work on this level, but the shooting is challenging and the movie is not linked to one of these happy moments. The story is about Ted Fletcher's (Edward Albert) an American couple who can write a book and go to Japan to get together with his wife Laura (Susan George) and her daughter Amy Barrett. Alex Curtis (Doug McClure), an American consul general, helps them find a home to live. In the same house about 140 years ago, a Samurai found his friend deceived and committed suicide after killing both of them. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Sometimes the ghosts live on Fletcher's corpses and they begin to act like the Japanese people they were in, and they begin to contact Laura Alex. At the same time, Ted begins to act more harshly and asks a Monk for help after dumping soup from Amy's throat. Unfortunately, the ghosts will be able to play the scene of death, as happened by Ted, Laura and Alexi 140 years ago. <br /> <br /> Kevin Connor, a well-known television director, has directed this movie, horror and science fiction films have worked with McClure in advance and in some. Though it's close to the scary or growing atmosphere, I liked two things. First, these demons do not have one of these happy moments embraced by their lap. Instead, everyone ends in a bloody battle that frustrates everyone. Second, there's Susan George here! I am always a supporter of myself, though he has been shocked, but his performances are always top notch. Also, she usually looks bare in two different scenes, and she has a unique cushion if she does not have classic features, and this is one of the reasons she's so popular. But after appearing in such unfounded films, I think it's the reason for her to be dismissed or just work for a sport. It's not a bad movie, but when Monk deserves a gritty or two practitioners in a scare, ghosts around the ghosts are convincing and watching. The following line is unhappy and I hope George has decided to resume his career.
