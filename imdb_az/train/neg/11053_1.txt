One of the movies you have always heard but you have never seen is "very good"! <br /> <br /> Unlike Troma movies, however, it's 100% pure serious, deliberately filthy and camping movies (and I'm not having fun). <br /> <br /> However, a pervert killer robot Solid Gold Dancers is a slippery trip and a jolt of the East, and the magic first mate that turns into the Good Witch of the East so seriously admits it to the evil edge so far that is a full circle around is entertaining. <br /> <br /> That's why it's pretty neat.
