It started with an exciting moment. I always love the Civil War and the oldest secret societies. Despite the greatness of the film, I realized that this was the best B movie. In the latter half soon will be a C film, then D, then F, and then "Oh, that's not a rent to put it in a microwave!" We can say that it was very bad to act in all situations. Writing, but ... I have never read my book. Perhaps the book is well written. The scenario is 10 years old. It was a ridiculous amount of conversation, tension and uninteresting, 5 cents, interesting as fertilizers. I really hate this movie as my spouse. I am a Christian and I have no problems with movies supporting or supporting Christianity. This film caused a great deal of damage. Terrible, terrible, worthless. If you like it, I strongly recommend Superman 4.
