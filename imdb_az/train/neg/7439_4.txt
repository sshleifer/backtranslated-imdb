A distinct appearance of horror. Style differences between American and Russian films are interesting. But from my American point of view this movie was just good. The main character played by Anastasia Hille, Marie, was not a good character, and I had some difficult time with her. He was often dissatisfied and was confused after much time. A lot of time has been spent to bring the film to the forefront. It took a long time before any real suspension. After this happened, the volume was used as the main effect of being more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-Video movies, and they did not use sex to prepare a thinner. I would recommend it for rent, but not for theater artists.
