Maybe I can give this propaganda film 6 or 7 because the propaganda film shows when and how successful it is. If you are watching this piece and think, "Jews must have seen something to be treated in WW2 in a good way," the film is very cleverly 'why' and the wrong people's experiences. Why is the propaganda film better? The place where the American movie about Rothschild's family is involved, for example, is being used here in a very sad manner. There is never a question that the Jewish prosperity can not be avoided by the officer. <br /> <br /> In addition, the level of excitement (or hate) in the film is gradually increasing and the aim and the need for propaganda to end the film's resolution. <br /> <br /> The film has some kind of simplicity that touches the audience's most basic emotional thinking. The film is a kind of day, so in fact it does not need to talk much about it. However, with this simplicity of ethnic cleavage, a careful watchdog may relate to today's cultural hatred, violence, impartiality, and integration problems. Generally, a good litter.
