Such a bad film should be removed from all the stores in the world. With such an awesome attitude that is full of awesome, boring, unknowable characters and a constant, thoughtless voice for every movement and sensation, this film keeps a record for the hardest movie I have ever seen. I paid for myself, I saw her and I felt sorry for that. My head is frustrated with very dull symbols and their insignificant, plotting little life. A group with zero information about something is terrible and worst of all, and a terrific dialogue takes place as the main character tries to get a date with the girl. Do not knock, so my friend was hated and I was shamed red as I pulled 6 AZN. The DVD was on eBay the next day and I did not withdraw most of my money. Avoid as tuberculosis.
