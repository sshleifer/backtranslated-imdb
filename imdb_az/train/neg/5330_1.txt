Someone commented that this is the worst ELVIS movie here. Yes, they are just a part of it. For me, this is the worst movie ACTIVITIES! I'm nothing like this movie, I have never seen anything offensive, insulting, or against human nature. Motion Picture is a real shame for the industry, which is not so bad, it's good. There was no nude fun for you to be here, as was Elvis's other bad movies like Clambake. It's too dirty to sit in a painful way. Pure Garbage. Native Americans should apply to court for poor stereotypes and stereotypes. In fact, maybe ALL humanity has to abuse the offense, and this movie can have a kind of gender. Level: F.
