SCHIZOPHRENIAC: WHORE MANGLER is an example of what happens when bringing together unedged people to create an "extreme" horror movie. Exit the window to create any kind of actor, production, storyline, FX, etc. ... "shocking value". Now I am not mistaken - I know better than "shock" movies and sleazer / gorier / nastier, but it's still nice to see some of the capabilities of the movie that's taking part in the movie. <br /> <br /> SCHIZOPHRENIAC celebrates the life of Harry Russo - a drug-addictive freak-show that ordered to kill his ventriloquist's puppet, Rubberneck. He wants to hate whores and other casual people and hate what he hoo-uhs ("New York-ese") and how to rape her in Esh Sheikh. There is a little bit of low-profile neurophilia scene, fewer eyes and some nudity - but there is nothing you can not see in a better movie ... <br /> <br /> Our mother, whom we can find in this delayed movie often comes from Harry (unknown?) Cheerful sounds. Everyone who wants to kill everybody and his donkey is away and away from him, and after a while it becomes quite funny. Actually, I'm almost wrong to think that this film should have some kind of homo-erotic impression, talking with all the donkeys and Harry's continuous shooting began to loose. In all honesty, this joker is then more likely to be in this movie, and then some chicks that show some T-and-A (and a few full frontal measurements). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is a gentle entertaining, like 1 hour watch, but you can really recommend it to those who want to say that they only follow SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER. To be honest - name is too far away - the best thing about this trash ... Generous 3.5 / 10
