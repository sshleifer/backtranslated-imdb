I thought the film (and especially the area) needed a lot of work. The elements of the film remain in the west and try not to try to create a sense of the East in the film. <br /> <br /> When you told Wendy that she would help her learn Chinese history, I was happy to give the audience a little bit. Information on Chinese history; the fact that the movie actually did not show Wendy's learning Chinese history; but instead, the film shows that Wendy uses the method of remembering what he has learned, which is heartbreaking and terrifying to me. <br /> Second, what really disturbs me is how the heroes explain about monthly cakes - cooks moon and moon cats and how delicious they are. But they did not mark the real significance of these. The Festival of Autumn, which they did not correspond to the moon's taste, which they talked about, they did not explain and did not go deep. They talked about the moon's rally - the lady of the month. The myth begins with the appearance of ten suns in one day, and each one begins to rise, but one day all the sun rises and rises up with rising hot heat; Thus, the Divine Archer, Hou Yi, had just nine out of ten days left in the sun (there are different versions of Hou Yi's eight suns). Thanks to her heroic contribution, she would live forever in the ten days of the sun, and immortality was poured, but her husband, Chang-O, stole her. After stealing, he ran to the moon, where he met a bird. Later, an idea came and he turned the pool into a pile of pills, so that he could put all the pill on immortality everywhere. (This story has a few options but during childhood, I've often heard this version). <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Think how important the Chinese history is for the Chinese. Terra-cotta Warings serves as a link to China's past, and the monks who are in the movies are ready to destroy this relationship (at least possible, if it is necessary to kill the evil). <br /> <br /> According to world media, Wendy will not destroy these invaluable works, given that Chinese and Chinese are not fully informed. and you want to fight for yours ... I want to say that Confucius evaluates TVPG because of the violence against mutual co-operation and harmony. In general, the producer, the writer or the director or all of them, trying to avoid violence, did not do their research thoroughly and instead made a dirty and easy job. I would suggest that you do not publish this movie or re-capture the movie that contains more accurate information; But I would give credit to Asian and Asian Americans to eliminate one stereotype of being smart and calm (2 stars).
