First of all, I really liked Henry Fool who put me in a very small pool of cinemas. Parker Posey is one of the best actresses on the screen today. But this movie was a complete transvestite. Hartley and actors talk about the movie in extras - so proud and starved in making Star Wars an unusual one. This manufacturer's part (HDNET) was maximized. A real example of the Emperor and his new clothes. I feel that HAL has forsaken HENRY FOOL forever. <br /> <br /> Remember my words, some of them can be broken down to somebody ... and so on. The manager is nowhere to be found anymore. Unfortunately, this is a good example of the lesson taught at ADAPTATION. The story should be exciting and active, or the box office's expectations are really weak. Do not expect any decent story. <br /> <br /> Hartley's account is not boring. The drum takes a walk on the whole conversation. <br /> <br /> When I saw the figure, I thought they wanted to enter a new audience. But this is really this ridiculous way. I'd be happy to spoil this movie for you, but it's all over. Rotten. FOOL franchise is dead. Long live Henry Fool.
