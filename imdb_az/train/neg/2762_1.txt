... there is no one else watching the movie. My husband and I went to watch last night. It's a small theater, but there's usually a decent person there. Not this time! My husband and I were the only people watching Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> The film was one of the worst I ever saw. Yes, CG was good, but that was it. Acting, scripts and dialogs, routing, editing and more. Since we are alone in the room, we have been released from the film. That is, we talked about how bad Mighty Morphin reminded of the Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat and the Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> We were expecting to describe the commanders of Rita and Lord Zed Sauron's army. <br /> <br /> The creatures were ridiculous. You can not submit dino / dragon / lizard leggings loaded with balloons without comment. The Lord of the Rings has a broad spectrum of characters, but consists of three films, but not for one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> Stage passages are terrible. I did not fall asleep in the movie, but it was an extremely simple project, but I lost myself. <br /> <br /> The heroes were Americans, but they spoke almost fractious English. <br /> <br /> The last scene that could get back the value of the film ... failed. Etan Sarah did not cry when she died ... but she has long been known for her life. He was very upset to stay at Mordor, did not know where he was and how he got back. <br /> <br /> Maybe God's love did not understand where he was or where he was. <br /> <br /> The spirit of Sarah was dressed as a loan from Queen Elizabeth? Another thing ... all of the main heroes heroes were reincarnations brought to finish the job. Sarah completes her mission and moves her way ahead. Jack also does it. Why Ethan screwed? She remained alone, without the girl, without a map / compass / helicopter to help her return. What to do? Send smoke alarms? And if he is home, he just goes back to work. <br /> <br /> Some of the heroes should be shown the same kind of killing in the film. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money in this movie. We just finished because we were paid for it, but after the credits hit, we left the door.
