I felt the brain dead, and I'll tell you. This is the worst movie I've ever taken. (in my ignorance I thought it was Peter Jackson's same name). The performances are very scary, they make them laugh. Special effects did not stop the time-test and seemed strange. Scenario propagates this kind of television movie, moves at moderate speed. The tattoo view, as they learn from Joey Tribbiani, have a look at each and stay in it. As long as I sit down to watch it, I have never been involved in a movie. A dream or no plot is so terrifying that it frustrates within minutes. Avoid as a plague.
