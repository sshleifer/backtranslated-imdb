<br /> <br /> The first impression is really positive, because the entire film is shot in this color, embroidery, post MTV tissue. Quick Sequences, Cool Angles, Rooted Camera Movements - for the moment you feel like watching another "Snatch". <br /> <br /> The solution starts when you actually start It feels like a multi-dose amphetamine. People are no longer illogical. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> In the conversation between Keira Knightley and Lucy Liu The story spread. Lying. This conversation does not give any explanation. On the contrary, in the second part of the film, Domino's taste comes in the character of Lucy Liuu, making the audience more confused. <br /> <br /> I thought that maybe this is a rich girl's movie, but it's a dysfunction that has managed to become a tough bounty hunter. Anyway, this is a message delivered with boot scenes. But then the question of Domino character is completely lost for the crime scene. In short, YOX is not a movie about Domino character. <br /> <br /> Then I thought it was probably a story of robbery. A beautiful bloody robbery. 10 million have gone missing, bountiful hunters are pursuing suspected robbers, mafia children are executed, hands are removed, why does Domino not receive a grace certificate this time and why? But soon this impression, this time we are faced with betrayal of a obese African-American woman, who is driving a driver license in the local MVD and causing a 28-year-old grandmother. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> URgh, well, nobody knows. <br /> <br /> After a while you start to think, "Oh, how does it distract us from our society and the media?" things. "Bounty hunters have been squeezed by a group of Hollywood actors who have always been entertained with their nose cuts and drifting around a lot of crime scenes. </ STRONG> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> and Chocco, mescaline episode, FBI surveillance operation ... <br /> <br /> Can all the things mentioned above be able to participate in a 2-hour movie? Be judged for yourself, but my conclusion is clear - this is a real confusion!
