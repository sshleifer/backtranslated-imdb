If I had time in the movie, I was also defeated by death. The only reason why the film's integrity is really bad is that I do not believe how bad it is and I believe it will be better. It was really a scary movie. I did not seem to be a 4-hour part of my life, and I was terrified that I would never come back. Missing in the other two hours. Please advise those who want to torture this movie and tell them they will kill them to stop them.
