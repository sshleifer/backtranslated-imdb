Only one reason is that "The Norliss Tapes" deserves any star, Angie Dickinson's participation in the game. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> David Norliss has written a supernatural book. One day, the mysterious disappearance comes after you call the publisher on the phone and think that he has something to do with deadly danger. The whole series of this angry pilot, as it seems, is intended to be a series of flashbacks by Norliss tapes - a set of recorded audio tapes recorded by the writer in the investigation of supernatural situations. <br /> <br /> A rich sculptor dies in a pilot episode - but a native reader will give immortality before he dies before buying an ancient Egyptian rattling ring. Soon, we will discover that the ring will not last forever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> Since I watched your "Scooby Doo" animated film, sculptor (Dickinson) attacked a dark night. <br /> <br /> This man is a vampire, so that through mutual acquaintance, Norliss keeps in touch with his wife for help in solving the mystery of his delayed husband. <br /> No. Despite the fact that you have read and heard, there is no vampire in this story. The sculptor does not drink the blood of the victims - he collects it. How? I dont know. We only see that he is attacking, not collecting it. Why? To fulfill the second part of his proposal for immorality. This recurring sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if a clay and a human blend form a statue of a devil named Sargoth. <br /> <br /> Lastly, Sargoth statue plans to use when entering our world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < As you can see in my text, the story is a terrible, ill-thought intrigue. Operation and dialogue offer better. This is not ambitious for such a "very bad" award. <br /> <br /> Sometimes bad is bad. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to find out on Fox Movie Channel on 10/15/03, after listening to groundbreaking stories about the great pleasure of Norliss Tapes. <br /> <br /> For the first time two days ago, when I screamed, I could hear any applause you heard from other IMDBs. funny memories and reviews of the show on the nostalgia of young people. Or perhaps they are loyal fans of Dan Curtis. In any case, they offered you the wrong explanations of The Norliss Tapes. <br /> Pauly Orxid - October 17, 2003
