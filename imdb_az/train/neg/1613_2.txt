Now, Che (2008) has completed a relatively short film in Australia (extremely limited: 1 screen in Sydney, after 6wks), taking on the role of Steven Soderbergh, "At Movies" can also unite the hosts. Soderberghin's latest stinker, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), was also missing a story, so the narrative (and editing?) Suddenly Soderbergh's main problem. Strange, after 20 years. Perhaps the story was a good story, hiding only in "edgy" projects. <br /> <br /> None of them forgive this fault, almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warned, "two parts (or even China) do not combine all." <br /> <br /> Only for Epic Biopic, Che (2008) is regarded as a movie! <br /> Even Margaret Pomeranz, even more Australian films, even Margaret Pomeranz, is no longer in the spotlight. Soderbergh, duo, Soderbergh's recurring wasting (HD digital storage) said, "You're in the woods ... you're in the jungle ... in the jungle ...". I was surprised that Soderbergh did not give us 2.5 hours in one place between the two existing parts, because he left massive pieces of the "revolutionary" life of the desert! <br /> <br /> Soderberg checks his trail, if he does not intentionally insult, because of an important but legendary historical personality biopsy. <br /> <br /> Never give up most of Che's story; <br /> <br /> 2. apply unreasonable film shooting mainly by duplicating the widow; <br /> <br /> 3. ignore a story of true Hinduism and events; <br /> <br /> 4. develop a thought or a character; <br /> <br /> 5 is the claustrophobic episodic; <br /> <br /> 6. What are those who ignore the necessary context for scenes? <br /> <br /> 7. Linguistically the whole audience (even Spanish speakers will mix with unusual expositions in English); and <br /> <br /> 8 blew his main theme in one dimension indefinitely. Why, at this last stage? T-shirt franchise is a success! <br /> <br /> Our sense of claustrophobia, of course, is that Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen are based solely on Guevara's memories. <br /> <br /> Soderberger's product is restricted in the future. <br /> <br /> The audience is captivated in the same limited information, scene and condition. "revolutionaries", but it does not reveal our sympathy. Instead, he understood that "Ahmed Soderbergh was trying to keep his followers together with Latino peasants." But this was a kind of illiterate Latino peasant who sold a good doctor to his enemies. Why does Soderberg need to equate us with them and keep us spiritually impetuous? <br /> <br /> The party is not chronological than the 2nd part, but rather ridiculous bush-bashing, the outgrowth of the outlook, and the lack of different or characteristic springs. DelToro's O does not allow him to grow up as a human being when fighting to raise his own badly-trained soldiers. The only failure, and sometimes the indigenous peasants or those who are deprived of self-control around food, are dealing with deeply ignorant "revolutionaries." <br /> <br /> Vigilance, which can be considered terribly part of the party, remains episodic: nothing has been telegraphic or contextual yet. So, scenes with Fidel Castro (Demi√°n Bichir) are both unexpected and surprising. Any selected events are described in a minimal and Latino orientation, replacing time interviews with partisan interviews with the Bolivian president, Joaquim de Almeida, and US government officials promising CIA intervention. <br /> <br /> Part2's "forest" and the rest of the night-time blue filter frustrate the audience until they see the performances. <br /> <br /> Maybe DelToro is a truth, the invariable history of many non-American Latinas exploiting China in their own countries. Foreign governments still do not offer free press to their peoples - for any reason, it can be seen how a good American reader can start to read ("I could not"), but I'm not illiterate - Chief Executive Officer (1949)) to their local cinemas. The obvious neglect and light simplifications of the film show that little known WHO STILL SPEAK LITTLE focuses on English language concepts. If so, they would have read about it and criticized the relevant social issues themselves - learning history as needed. <br /> <br /> Such concepts are still in the public sense - the remaining non-literate Latinos of Central and South America - still Che (2008) proudly delivering. Soderbergh leaves his head because he is weak in the narrative. If I knew it, Benicio DelToro would deliberately see Soderbergh for this project and gobsmacked it. <br /> <br /> According to US President Barack Obama, although the United States "Part 1" is "unequal", part2 really "falls down from there", "The last campaign in Bolivia is in dreamer detail", "... it can be an unbearable slow and frightening feeling. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> All the second semi - only is performed with the dramatic - yet tragic capture and execution of the above - mentioned humor and film. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie theater is just a mess, and Soderbergh must avoid all sorts of prints. "Indeed, it is necessary to break the hearts of those who know nothing about the subject. (2/10)
