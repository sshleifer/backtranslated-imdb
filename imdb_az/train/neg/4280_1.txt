This should be accompanied by a special rating and warning: NORMAL PEOPLE NOT PROPOSED. <br /> <br /> Daneliuc's drowsiness with the most dirty body functions here is a real nightmare. Moreover, it is clear that this is a misanthropic, and hates everyone - his people, his countrymen, his actors. This hatred makes him blind, and he forgets his profession that he knew long ago. <br /> <br /> This is not an artistic value and vocational knowledge called "film", but an ugly radio that is just disgusting. A good taste and good sense is an insult. Shame, shame, shame!
