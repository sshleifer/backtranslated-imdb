You have a moderate family. Dad is a famous rapist, we have an "incredible teenage daughter", a white boy and a lovely little boy. And we have an innocent housewife, what was a married woman like? Is there a mixed Brady Bunch? Summer! When I first went out, I thought I was really young. Music was bad. Raps were very bad and very g-rated. All raps were about family, friends and problems. The father was a father of "Full House Danny". Always advised. But it was not a strange one. There was a goalkeeper at home. Remember? The fields were largely a problem of Lil 'Romeo ... or not. Oh and maybe some preteen drama. Yes, these things are good. Not really. But it's still a good show for kids. But Nickelodean could do better.
