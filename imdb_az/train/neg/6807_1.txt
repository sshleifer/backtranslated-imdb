Spoiler? Maybe there are a few details, but nothing related to anything. It does not sound like this movie. <br /> <br /> Air Rage is clearly violating the executive's decision regarding the average air infiltration. Ice-T guides the fourth "elite" commandos team that we can only imagine: we have to hide body armor without their appearance (as 3rd-class students use Star Wars in the playground) fireworks are full. <br /> <br /> There was something that made me so much funny about this craze. You will recognize Cyril O'Reily as an actual person in a movie, though you will not be able to place it before (Porki's). Here Cyril plays Paxton's character in a worthy way. Very Sweet, Porker Gil Gilard is so fat that you will not accept it as television Buck Rogers. Instead of marrying a mild heroic past, Gerard gives the unpleasant performance of the hard-to-die fatty man, which is clearly understood by John Goodman. Finally, Alex Cord gives us a nice hybrid look like a Chuck Connors / Kirk Douglas type. Ten years after the new Jack City, the Ice-T player has deteriorated. It is not like a breach of lines that can actually be remembered. <br /> <br /> One of the items included in this movie is a coded CD-ROM. Gerard's NSA character is hand-held despite the danger of aura, and this image is incredibly encrypted. What a joke. I suspect that none of the information that is meant to be on the CD will be stored in a portable format. <br /> <br /> Although firearms are on a closed plane, gunfire is as high as conservation, and no-one has budget. The sort of weapons you choose is pretty laughable. The use of a coffee bag by the flight attendant is the most accurate picture of violence in the film. It's very stupid when he's intuitively approaching the mini-Uzi pistol, one of the best pistol designs. The true elite team would have been customized for something of this sort if the MP5s or perhaps SOCOMM .45s, even if it's really the old school Hi-Powers, or maybe something new to FN 5.7 ... Lame-o standard issue 92Fs Lethal Weapons It was completely unbelievable that I lost most cool after I had. Probably the evil guys who are fortunate enough to be a functional barrel amplifier that is not silent like the mini-Uzi pistol and the Tec-9 above. <br /> <br /> There was a realistic touch that I'd like to rectify for other reactions: the flight attendant and the Ice-T have dropped 10,000 feet (10,000 feet) of craft for "shooting into the air" before opening the door. And I also have the impression that the flight attendant is unable to close the door, mostly refusing this point. As for the flight, there was no word before the covers were about 2 seconds before touching. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Dukes, who is in danger of begging Roscoe P. Coltrane at just the "pass" can embarrass the use of this movie scene image. Certainly, they chose the incredible (and retired) SR-71 because they could not get the F-117 funds. Although they are mothballed in 2001, forget about a moment SR-71 B-2 is a clean secret plane and the point is empty range ... Well, I'm no expert, but I doubt that it will not appear on the radar. <br /> <br /> Others say they were laughing at the F-15s when they showed F-15s. Details of 747 were foolish. No airline company will not let these few passengers begin at 747, and should not say anything about it. Pay attention to the use of an exposed electrical cord. <br /> <br /> Wow. What a show. Hold on to the star or something. Do not pay rent, but watch out for laughter. There is no movie with the No Holds Barred, at least the peculiarity of filming in the movie.
