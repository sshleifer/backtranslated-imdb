Hollywood is doing it again. There is not much money, no creativity. I am convinced that oxygen is something else when writers write. Based on previews, I thought it would be a funny movie. But if you are not in the last stupid pop culture, then you will miss most of the bug in this movie. Why do you spend time? <br /> <br /> You can sit in a day with something more fun and nothing more than this movie will provide. <br /> <br />
