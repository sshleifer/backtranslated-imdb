There are many hype related to this movie. Although the film does not have the best actors, let's talk about the main reasons why anyone will watch Leo and Cate. I was not a good actor, and I say they are in this movie. Special effects were worthwhile (and I would say that film artists are doing a good job of boating), but there are also a few major defects. For example, after leaving the boat, you see an unfinished blue screen behind the main characters. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me, I love the story of REAL Titanic, but find this insult to this movie. <br /> <br /> - There is no reason for a movie to be longer than 2 1/2 hours (except for MAYBE's biographical film) and the script and scenario was frightening. <br /> <br /> Music is probably better than I have predicted (only "My Heart Will Leave Him"). There is a scene for me when I sink and bass music. The purpose of the film can be very good. As far as extreme mood is concerned, it is very tight. <br /> <br /> In some cases, I saw a tremendous story that made Titanic a wonderful story, and I saw a strange spark.
