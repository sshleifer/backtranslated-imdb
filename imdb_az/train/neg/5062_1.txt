This movie is strange. Better put, this is a "freakin" strange. "I could give you a summary of a plot, or a benevolent analysis, but I will not lose your time, two younger sisters, everyone who should know about this movie, an insulting relationship, and a really disturbing infatuation.You feel like you need to take a shower in a good way, like "Pulp Fiction" or "Fight Club" at the end of the movie, as if you were a teenager (or no matter whether you were a college student or not, I'm still a teenager), and you just did something that you do not want and B: You can not find anything about your parent who hopes for the Good and the Grave of the Earth, and nobody likes it., I recommend that you do not justify your mind and watch the talented cinema dirt Take some time to do something awful and watch the "Kazaam" (yes, read "Kazaam" to what you want "criminals").
