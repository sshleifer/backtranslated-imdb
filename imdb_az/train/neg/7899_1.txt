All the interior jokes are what makes Munchies a classic of a kult. Although the nature of casual events and characters is considered, it may have been a much better (and funnier) movie. <br /> <br /> Judges, as many viewers have already mentioned, are something in the Gremlins parody. So, all references to the film. The film begins in Peru during archaeological excavations. Despite having a career in the film, Paul, a drufter dufus who wanted to uproot a comedian who offered no sarcasm or humorous jokes, remained in the caves with his father. His father is an unconventional archaeologist looking for caves instead of circumcision or mums or something, not the UFO's evidence. And Munchies's picture. It's a bit of a ugly little mutant, looking like a rubber doll, rubbing with a secret Gizmo voice in a rock slot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Arnold (if he killed his father, he would send his community to the college to get his "real" career). The rough side-by-side neighbor, the poor carpet, Cecil (TV veteran Harvey Korman), explains how wonderful the neighbors are. So, he and his lazy son, some of the hippies of the type of airplane (his character should look more like a biker or heavy metal enthusiast) to go to Arnold. Why? Of course, get a rich quick scheme. And, of course, Cecil's son is too tired to look at Arnold. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> It was just plain horrible. The munchers always hoped that he would defeat and hope that Paul and his girlfriends were morons. At least, it will be a way to get rid of all bad deeds that really act as hams in this movie. We will not talk about bad effects that are not like hand puppets. And really bad about writing - it was not even funny - even if it really is a young policeman can cause a killing in your eyes. I said that Munchies had a good parody if they were given a budget and better players. Skip.
