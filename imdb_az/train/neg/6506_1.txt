If you are not a geeky filmmaker wanting to see everything, this movie will not just be a waste of time and money, but a frustration beyond belief. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hopkins's first script, first score, and third movie will choose a hard, hard, and highly unstable project, as everyone can guess. Perhaps he played with him for as long as he was known for himself. <br /> <br /> As a result, he proves that there is not enough experience or skill to achieve any result. <br /> <br /> Even the most bizarre Carpenter and Lynch films are 90% less characters and 99% more story flow in the name of just two non-thinkers. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony you target the stars, but, unfortunately, we missed for a few light years. Please try to operate, in this department you are an unbearable giant and nobody should ask you more than you, even yourself!
