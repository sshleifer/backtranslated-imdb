Michael Keaton was not really a good actor; Tim Burton's Batman films always fall in the shadow of his great darkness. Here are the stars like an elderly husband who chooses radio frequencies that seem to be dead people trying to get in touch with their spouses ... <br /> This should have been a very shocking tension, but it really runs out of everywhere that shocks you. There are so many things that can not be explained, uncovered, or endless. So, when all this takes a bad film, WHITE SILVER brings something out of yourself? Actually, it's a bad move and terribly modified, this is not something to watch. Michael Keaton tries to turn a tension back, but has lost his target more than ever before.
