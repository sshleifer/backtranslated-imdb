I liked the first two films, but this movie just spent time and money (for me and studio). I'm still wondering why they made this horrible movie. The plastic weapon and the toy car that can come to another home are ridiculous. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern were so funny in the first two films, but the terrorists are not so ridiculous and funny. Believe me, this movie is just a waste of time.
