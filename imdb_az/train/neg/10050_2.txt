Writer Hammda and director Dante are a big disappointment. The previous co-operation with Homecoming of the first season was wrapped up and dark in all the right ways. This worst case of an exciting moment made me angry. The "repayment" of the common foreigners who produced something from the brain of infected psychopaths was totally dissatisfied and explained nothing. If the cause of the story is to lead to the purity of the planet on the edge of human casualties, why is it so true of a loyal and obedient fashion? Why not open Stephen King's "The Stand" with women who have a completely deadly virus rather than a woman who is a female presbyterian? As I watched, I hoped that the episode would improve, but more ambitious and predictable. Religious subtext seemed simple, but it turned out that Sam had thought deeply about her weight. I love Dante and Hammin many things, but it was just unwatchable.
