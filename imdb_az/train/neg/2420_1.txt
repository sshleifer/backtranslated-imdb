I usually comment on movies I love, "everyone tastes their own taste," but I want to exclude it. The premiere of this missing film is a perfect right for these two adult adults to go to Las Vegas, to be drunken, to marry, and to compare with their own bewilderment. children. Even allow cultural breakthroughs, they do not have the courage or responsibility to wake up the next morning and return what they are doing. After all, "love" is not all that important, is not it? Everyone is hell. Certainly, the things that "work in the end" are not the truth; In fact, this is very insignificant. Considering that disrespect for others, especially young ones, is highlighted and reinforced in the film, especially if they are in a dependency position. These "parents" have more abusive behaviors that can undermine the social workforce in the heart failure.
