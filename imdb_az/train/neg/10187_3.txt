A fool of a jet who is never employed by aircraft-operated mechanics (tested by Burgess Meredith) is stupid, with simultaneous follow-up of McGyver spare parts such as Chris Makepeace and a fugitive technician, followed by a Porsche race car operating in the decades-old petrol sediment run by Lee Majors we have learned how chemicals can be used and used to produce high explosives in a perfectly civilized society that can convert all the frequencies to a radio receiver. Sound as moronic. Burgess Meredith's horrible loss, but Chris Makepeace may at least be forgiven for his second film.
