I have to give this movie to 1 because it's bad, but I do not think it's a pleasure to watch, because I laughed and laughed, and even asked a few questions. So half laughing at half, "What are these I say?" I said. or "Why can someone do it?" and cetera. I often flooded the horrific fog effects, the 80th style nuclear scene / battle / dialogue / nuclear scene, and the swords of warriors in the wind. There are some malignant patterns (do not they have to be a real tree?) And still do not realize that they found this boy in the cave, what is hell? One of my friends informed me about these films and I thought I would give myself a test, and I liked the film as Ed Wood films, and I did not really enjoy the movie, which meant what was going to happen, and I'm looking at it myself. So if you think that this is really an action movie, do not worry about it, I liked it for some other reason. Too bad, Evil is worse than dead, yet you look at life as if you were thinking. I do not know if the best thing for most people is a few drinks, some friends around and laughs in this movie. Maybe it's a little tough, but I do not think you'll rent it. Yo.
