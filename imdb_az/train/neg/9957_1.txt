One of the most used romantic films is this: A serious, unhappy man falls in love with a deadly woman who dies before his death. Sometimes this story is good and realistic (like "The Flight Theory", as an excellent mouth), but more often than that, the hero dies from the "Old Film Disease". You know, you have a terminal illness that has no symptoms, a sorry laugh, and you have to sleep all the time to say goodbye to your beloved; and your images are not a bit affected (and this is not your sex life since the 70's). <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst versions of a special story that puts together two incongruous and incredible characters in a script, and they are completely played by actors in the sea. <br /> I'm the worst performance of Al Pacino's career and I say just after two days before seeing the "devil's lawyer"! He plays an unusual, emotional, predatory racing driver, and plays an unusual character in play. He always asks himself to be around Marty Keller (the audience is so) and he keeps most of the movie there. The only point that shows any sign of life is to the end that his character is changing to save himself from salvation through the fierce evil Mae West imitation. Hey, this was seventy! <br /> <br /> Marthe Keller is equally afraid of an immortal interest; his character was brave and free and invulnerable and exciting and lifelike, though likely to be played by an actress with the sensitivity of Vanessa Redgrave or Julie Christie. Instead, they have Keller, an expressionless face and a heavy German accent, which is more like a lovable than a terribly Teutonic stereotype ("You VILL Eat Ze Omelette!"). He is designed to reform the Pacino and dare him in spirit and fill all of them, but it will not work, as he harping on his shortcomings in the possible fashion of more than hell. This is one of the most convincing romances in the history of the film, and you do not believe it is with someone who believes it will be with someone who is so worthless. Some bad movie fans call this a classic classic, basically Pacino's patiently "free" Mae West imitation. The scene is a scene, especially in the context, but it is not worth it to sit along the rest of the film. No, only if you see the movie, there are numerous Kimya EksiksizliÄŸi or Very Bad Casting (especially in terrific ways, but Pacinon's other girlfriend looks and actress, like Keller, with a shorter hair). <br /> <br /> This is not one of the worst movies in Fateh's bad movies, it's really a really bad movie. <br /> <br />
