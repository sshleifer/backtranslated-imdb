<br /> <br /> But a budget movie can not be surprisingly good ... this is not one of them. <br /> Yes, Brad Sykes is also miserable. The player is dirty, except Emmy Smith, showing some words. The camera aspect needs serious work. And more "catch and run the camera" gimmicks; it just does not work. Special effects are unimaginable, there is a problem when the impact is detected in real time. If you are going to knock down an ear, do not allow the actor to see his real ears under his blood. The decoration is mild and boring (Mr. Sykes is similar to other businesses) and a conflict between music is cheap motel porn and a really bad guitar-driven metal (see description of the scenery). <br /> <br /> Do not have any real space or character development? As you can see, there was no script writer. <br /> Who cares this boy ... please. I saw some of his other "home movies" (I do not plug in) and they were as bad. Normally a "director" will grow up and learn from his previous efforts ... this is not a man. But there is something to be an amateur film maker but everyone can be hacked. <br /> Of course, an exploded bullet film ... of course, chewing popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort. /> <br /> Award: The worst military tricks in the film.
