For me, each art work should be evaluated according to these criteria: form, function and meaning. Guernsey forms appear to be dedicated to: beautiful pictures and sometimes interesting players. Long-term convergence implies a function that the audience may be able to fill. The story is quizzed because of the lack of texts. Intrigue offers a human depth, but sometimes there is nothing to say. This film acts as an invert human. If you have not read the topic, you can not see that Anna has changed her mind about life and has a suicidal (and an unanswered question Why?) That casts doubt on her. "Why do not you talk to me?" He asks Sebastian. Anna does not answer, she only starts looking at her for a long time without saying a word. What is the function of that stroke? What does that mean? My question is like Sebastian: what does this film mean? What does this film mean? Reply to me: This shows us a few physicians with a passion for water. The story of their lives is simple and boring. Behind motions motifs are not shown. The rest are skins, flats and landscapes. It is a beautiful and artistic work, but it is meaningless without 'instructions for use'. In my opinion, this film is prepared not for the general audience but for other artists.
