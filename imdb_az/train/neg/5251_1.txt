This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" easily guided the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotion, touch, rhythm, skill, humor ... repeats the same situation. There is no character development. It does not even show any violence and / or sexuality and does not add anything new to the psycho-killer sub-genre. <br /> <br /> The first film should be shown at movie schools as an example of what we will not do. <br /> <br /> Where is BTW, where hell is a "talent"? There are scenes shot almost in the same way; There are scenes with two or more master-throws, and it's pretty scary to skip a skeet from one master to another without throwing it for a reason. The camera did not believe that the very talented artist was afraid to show that he had no visual abilities. Actors playing key roles act as amateurs and support the player is incredible. <br /> <br /> Indeed, a film and a talented director have a really heartwarming film.
