Brothers Quay, are directors of conventional thinking, judging by making a short film to be shot. I really liked the first feature Benjamenta Institute, but judging by their sophomore effort Piano Tuner earthquakes, they have not come close to feature length equal to the genius of their past'm willing to agree to. Piano Tuner without a doubt, is a gorgeous film to look, to listen, and often is not. Unfortunately, its convoluted narrative and glacial speed limit is painful to sit through. Read the plot synopsis, it sounds like a pretty good story. Brothers bring to life but failed miserably. something they should consider avoiding in the future: dialogue. God, this is terrible. Big bust.
