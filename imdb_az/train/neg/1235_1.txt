I really expected to see the Apes Planet, but it was a great dissapointment. <br /> <br /> Parameters and masks are great, but this is the only good part of the movie. All other things are really boring. Mark Wahlberg does not act, he is looking for fools in the movie. Other actors are also not very good. <br /> <br /> But the worst point is the story. This is absolutely funny! For example, monkeys are lying on the ground, but people do not attack them, otherwise they will not rise again! This is an example for a stupid story, but it takes too long to explain everything.
