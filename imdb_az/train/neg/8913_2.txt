When I first heard this morning news, I thought, "Wow, finally a fun". It was fun for a week or so ... However, we have to deal with this news reporter (if you can say that), there is a lot of "time playing". <br /> <br /> First, I thought Jilli had breathed fresh air. But seriously, this woman has not taken at least a journalist. He is not very professional. She continues to cut Steve as she begins to inform the audience about a particular news story. <br /> <br /> Jillian is not a good journalist. Hell is a celebrity who likes to become famous, so he immediately becomes a chat around celebrities, which means that he is interviewed. <Br /> </ p> <br /> <br /> He is not very professional, and maybe he believes his celebrity relationships more than just unsatisfactory journalists and that is why I can say almost all of this. <br /> <br /> Also (with disappointment) this show It's a great deal of news about something that serves and / or serves the best interests of the world, the government, the United States, or the public - they pay close attention to sexism, and everything they say comes as a commercial product on the other hand, field reporters are curious. ... <br /> <br /> I believe in "Good Day LA" for young adolescents and celebrities, and this really is about the news about CARE <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text- align: justify; "> Today ..." ABC's Good Morning America ... Diane Sawyer will not be a very serious way.)
