I never imagined that the standards of adult movies would never fall in the same way! <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film has a ridiculous story that is of no interest. Kareena improved her figure, but it's not a good actress anyway. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. I can say that the role is not good. <br /> <br /> Great cheaper. I thought the movie should be a "comedy part." Since the last few films have been flopped, should Yashraj movies do such trash? It has a very good film history. <br /> <br /> Generally, I was completely disappointed with the movie.
