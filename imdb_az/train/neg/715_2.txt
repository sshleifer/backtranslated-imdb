Here's a really interesting movie. Nazis, hidden, government conspiracies. I was expecting a DaVinci code or a little-budget Nazi version from Brazil or even from Shockwaves. Instead, you're getting something different, like David Lynch, more psychologically, and more. This was actually a plus. <br /> <br /> The road called Hope is only in fear. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the body are cast. Andrienne Barbeau's character was a bit scary and afraid of the moving side. Of course, he does his best, but not in his age. His son was thought to be a comedy. The majority of other actors thought that it was merely a strange thing, or something like that. <br /> <br /> Siri Baruc was his daughter Siri Baruc. It started very slowly. So you can be tempted to slow it down slowly. However, she gets revenge for a while after her suicide and later. But shortly afterwards, all this becomes a turmoil. <br /> <br /> Some points are appropriate, but most of these are just indispensable, monotonous and weak. <br /> <br /> The real problem is not just a good movie to watch. Slow, boring, none of the symbols are alike. Use lots of drawings and sets. Some of the movies you see in the characters are subject to torture. In this, there is an image viewer. There are some creepy moments, especially creepy Nazi artifacts and credits, but the rest of the film is just tedious.
