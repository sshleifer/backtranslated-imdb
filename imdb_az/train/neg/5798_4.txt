This movie is a strange blend of music, romance, drama, and a strange movie with no-nonsense. <br /> <br /> This film is an attempt to get Mickey Rooney more seriously like an actor. An old child star who always star in a happy comic and musical compositions at the start of his career. He chooses a different approach in this film (he's still in the music scene). But the role of the film is actually quite laughable. Mickey Rooney is a difficult player? She's looking for a very small boy. She was actually in the 1930's, but it looks more like a 16 year old. Listening to her tells a wonderful thing about women and speaks for only three times as great as gangsters. <br /> <br /> Because, as the film mixes many different genres, the story is really a very bad thing. At one place there is a criminal plot, and you are a romantic line of lineage and imagination, but none of them really works because of a bad attitude and manages it all. It's not just an interesting or catchy movie to watch. László Kardos, despite his continued career in 1935-1957, is a director who has only ten films in his life. He must have been a manager of a struggling industry in a difficult time and was given a fewer scripts to work with. <br /> <br /> His films are all unknown and usually not of high quality. <br /> <br /> Let's remind, it is more than 50 films, but it is one of the 40's or maybe the 30s. This, of course, is made of black and white. <br /> <br /> It's a strange sight that Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his team are talking about themselves. Generally, black and white films from '50 often have a low-priced sense and this movie is an exception. in a sequence. It did not just appear in the Armstrong movie, and it would often be open to such films just like himself. I do not know if jazz lovers still enjoy watching their music in this movie, because there is a lot of this movie. <br /> <br /> A film shot and shot from Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> 4/10
