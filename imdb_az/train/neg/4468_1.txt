OK, straightforward and straightforward, if you are an admirer of other Tomb Raider games (yes, even AOD), stay away from LEGEND. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's the most frustrating TR game. It looks so beautiful, it sounds great, but it's completely useless and I refused. I feel like I'm robbed by Eidos. <br /> <br /> It's very simple. TR was a PC game before anything. You are using the Lara keyboard. 6 Tomb Raider was the controlling standards. In AOD, they were "sticky," but still the same general control sequence. In legend they have completely changed their actions and control methods and are completely uncontrolled. <br /> <br /> I've seen comments other than those who say "use mouse". No, why me? Others say 'Use gamepad'. No, why me? Others say, "But this is the standard for managing the 3rd year, and I do not need anything, it is not the standard of another TR game Oh, I know because less care about the original, loyal fan base <br /> <br /> Any advice on a serious TR fan is far from this game and you are complaining about Eidos if you buy it. on the forums, others, and others on the other, so they have been dishonest, maybe listen.
