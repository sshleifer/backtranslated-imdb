I do not love children's films, but it was a tearjacker with some rescue qualities. M.J. Fox was a perfect voice for Stuart, and the remaining talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie may be incredibly funny, but this film is not given a chance. Sugar is sugary sugar and will not appeal to anyone older than 7 years. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc or Shrek instead. 3/10
