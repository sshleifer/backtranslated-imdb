I liked Frankenstein's curse so much that if Chantopher Lee was not present, I would say "Frankenstein should be destroyed." For a great disappointment, this film is not just Lee, but also entirely without Frankenstein's Monster! Was it a situation where "if we can not get Lee, we will not have any monster"? Why will they do it? The monster is half of everything! This film is devoted to the quest for Baron Frankenstein and his experience in brain transplantation only before his asylum. I found the scenario very weak and stop the blurring of the audience. <br /> <br /> Piter Cushing is a totally brilliant actor who plays pure filth, but this movie is not full of me, but he took it out of the movie. in this movie. To become one of the most loved actors and famous sweet men, she can play very dangerous and insulting. If he is frugal, he is skillful, but very few, even the young doctor and his fianc√© Frankenstein blackmail. A bumbling police chief, along with his laid sidekick, is offered to create some funny relief, and then they have completely dropped out of the movie! Why? We believe that police chief Baron will be the main nemesis, and then we believe he will be a young doctor and then become a victim of Frankenstein's brain transplant experience. There was no tension, we were not invested in "living things", and we were unequivocally determined not to leave the last one because it was clear that they created another order. <br /> <br /> Also, there is actually no "horror" element. Yes, at the beginning (outside the camera) there is a head and we can cut two men's heads with the Cushing voices (again camera, off) and most uncomfortable and comprehensive unnecessary aggression scenes (90% camera). I understand that "the viewers are imagining everything, because their imaginations are worse than we can show," but I'm not going to give you a monster, at least let us know a few "horrible" elements you chose to include. <br /> <br /> I thought the director was very flat above a rich scenario. There were a few good shots, but no excitement, no atmosphere or tension. This filmmaker did not "curse" in 1958, and I thought it was a great way to go ... Like me, this movie was groundless. <br /> <br /> The film is strictly for the mighty, nuanced performance of 10 Peter Cushing ... besides, I found something worth recommending in this movie. Instead, follow my suggestion to "Frankenstein's Curse" and see the movie really scary Hammer.
