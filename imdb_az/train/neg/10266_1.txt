1st Watch 11/07/2004 - Dir-Can Keeyes: The 13th (What's Version 1) on Friday is the over-the-top rehabilitation of over 70 possible horrors. Here (or I can say one thing) I think that many older children turn around a foolish group listening to a radio program, so suppose. But in the end, a stupid man has to do with his true story, because his sister was one of those killed (though somehow it is even foolish). Why? There is still a criminal, and we are away from the beginning (any mystery goes). Besides all this, why "police" do not, and why does not someone call them? I do not believe that this movie was funded and prepared by someone. You thought that at the moment the American people would at least be judged at a slightly higher level in filmmaking, but this is not a movie.
