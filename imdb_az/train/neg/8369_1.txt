Since this picture is classified as a "pure fun" job and there are so many comments about it, I would like to address something here about humorous exploitation. Marlon Wayans plays a joker in this movie. Of course, when he is involved in casting, he always acts as a little man - the actor can change his or her customary style, but may change his physical appearance and may be the last if necessary. But since I was far from anticipated, I saw an image of a forty-year-old criminals inadvertently revealing different aspects of baby life. And the ridiculous happy ending. So what's the point? Many factors are mixed, some of them are violence, sex, and crime, mistakenly written, and there is no solid opinion: Vanessa, when her house is broken and her husband's life is broken? In addition, the diamond is bigger than Cullina No. 1 in the world! But the most fascinating facet is a continuous attempt to build a submarine with the physical weaknesses of the little man. And they call it humor. Diamond is precious, hard and fragile; It can not be cut off by any substance, but only one male can not be conquered by the warm blood of goat. So no longer a diamond, but fragments of debris.
