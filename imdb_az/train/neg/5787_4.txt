HEIST movies are becoming increasingly weak. Sustainability is pretty bad, there is not enough character resistance to feel as you understand any symbol. Peter Falk is great and one of the reasons he deserves to look at. There are some nice lines like Falk's "get some saugages" or something like that ... they are a few beautiful scenes, though they are entirely related to the actors' efforts. Direction, script, and editing are pretty bad.
