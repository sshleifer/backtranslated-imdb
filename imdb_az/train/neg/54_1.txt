The only good thing about this film was the filming of Goldie Hawn, whose small French cut bikini panties, and she giggled and cooed many other immoral women without struggling to remove her missing little cotton balls. Ooooof! His arm is competing with Nina Hartley's opponents. This movie came out at the age of fourteen and I was almost killed. I had forgotten all that, until I saw the television another day, that I was part of the rogue Roladex, which actually made the middle part of the square benevolent, with a strange daughter, Goldie Hawn, in the '80s. Kurt Russell was an entertaining life.
