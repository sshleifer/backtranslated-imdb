Note: I will open the main part of the plot, but if you look at the DVD cover or any promotional material you will know it. <br /> <br /> This film was not very bright, and it was a very tired person when he wrote it. The writer does not know the difference between chemicals and organisms. <br /> <br /> Remember that the UN and NSA are demonstrating in Hungary. Do not wear scary gear (even gloves) after this master intelligence agents kill you in about a minute. These are quibbles in the context of the movie. Within this story, the scientific world goes to the 2 + 2 = 6.34 and the weight. <br /> <br /> In fact, the people in this movie (except for a few exceptions) do not treat human behavior. Almost every time a single character responds to something that is inaccurate. <br /> <br /> The hot story (of course, one) makes the soap opera scripts look like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that free rent of a movie in this case has wasted.
