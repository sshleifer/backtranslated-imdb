Oh, my God. my god, I can not get this movie. God was terrible. terrible, terrible! Do not even waste your money to buy your 99 cents. <br /> <br /> This was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. <br /> <br /> First of all, G-girl? You are joking. Become a genuine reference to some kind of new Barbie doll .. Super Women? You are joking. False false counterfeiting was false. The city's population did not even think that it was a flying blonde who made a path around the city where the fire was kept. <br /> <br /> Jesus, this is just me or the movie seems offensive? Maybe you need to be a super hero? <br /> <br /> If you are trying to be romantic ... .. god, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Love is love, if some of the love is to drive to an art show and to have sex in a bed and in the air .. love is more than absolutely loved! <br /> <br /> Of course, everything went too fast. First, she was more than G-girl. .. After leaving Hannah more than her daughter's history .. and .. continues. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this movie surprises me. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie in any way.
