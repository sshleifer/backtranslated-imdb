I did not know anything before getting this movie, but it sounded cool and I wanted to see a Viking movie for a while now ... Unfortunately, this is not what I want. I hoped for the best, but instead of a 84-minute working time, it was as if a Nordic soap opera was dragged too long. The purpose of the film is quite interesting: the Viking War Leader and Odin, who opposed his God, have such anger that he cursed the son of a war called Barek, death like Berserker, and began to revive. This Barek boy is forced to live after the lifetime of angry, argumentative and fierce lifetime. The film was sufficiently laid, some of the richest cinematographs and actors performed very well, but I still asked when it was time to end it and questioned it. Filmmakers have had the opportunity to do something entertaining and semi-exclusive, but they have fallen into the pit. Perhaps it could have been thrown out of a bit of ugliness and very similar to the cheap tactics ... So are we talking here from Berserkers? The Vikings were supposed to be quite loose, everything that started with harassment and hijab, so why should the Berserkers be more extreme? In general, if you're a "The Young and Restless" (and so on) and you're actually a crazy Berserker who loves self-torture, I suppose that this brave celluloid part will run away.
