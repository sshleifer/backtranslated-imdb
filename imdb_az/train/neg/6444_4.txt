Most college students see the academy being lost in the bubble, away from what they have learned and living in. Their conversations are conducted with other students and college faculties. <br /> <br /> Steven Greenstreet's documentary is just an example of a college student, and all members reduce the number of members based on limited contacts. <br /> <br /> The document describes a small group of individuals. representing large groups of population. As usual, the most sincere people get the most out of the media attention. Besides the wrong presentation of the film, the documentary was well-prepared. My only controversy is that the feelings and rebellions shown in the film concern not only the few people who express them, but also the entire public. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is ridiculous to investigate such a dispute and to warn people about the differences existing between politics but in the actions of several radicals.
