Was this movie foolish? Yup. Is the depth of this movie? Nope. Character development? Nope. Stack? Nope. It was just a movie about a high-class Springer show. Some people show their length of time to get their trophies on television. Molly Hagan has done a great job as Jaime Pressly's mother. Jaime .... good ... GORGEOUS! This flick was not a "breakthrough" film, but rather a life in a trailer park (I live in a trailer park and it is not like this in our movie) Everyone is lying in bed, all the girls are pregnant by different children and kids rusty-up '66 Ford buyers (exaggeration, of course, but everyone has a picture while talking about "trailer park"). Some people analyze movies (hotspot: Star Trek freaks). I watch movies only for fun; Do not point out that the girl will wear a different shape in a different area (would it be better to read Goofs bit about Connie's shirt?) Of course it was funny as hell.
