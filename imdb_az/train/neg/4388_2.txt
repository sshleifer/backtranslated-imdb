O man, I know your thoughts: "I can not go wrong with a similar subject!" Uh yes. I liked the title, but I also hated my mother, my brother / girlfriend and boyfriend - I hate all those people who hate the stupid boy playing the "little helper"! People sometimes watch it. Because ONLY who can not get 1/10 of this is satisfied with the low budget, they did OK. But oh man, I hate these actors, so stupid! I knew it would be bad, probably they were making a lot of money by using attractive masks and finally Jesus' suits were very ridiculous. O pain, do not follow!
