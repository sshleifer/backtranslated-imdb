I understand who wants to make a movie that is kinda different and different. I understand the earlier interpretations that this film is a well-understood film. My idea, after finishing the first commentary of this movie, "uses a grand prince to be a movie star and there is no talent" ... uses, directs and pays the father's money to make a movie he writes ..... No doubt to understand that there are no character development near the film and there are no starting, middle, and end directions ..... the screaming part was good and weird, but what was the point? A woman went to a house, found some pictures, shouted the guard, checked the sounds, and turned out to be a cold night (not the wrong one) to work on the guard lover .... the movie ends ..... who teaches my ignorant? I would like to know what the truth is .... the directors' perspectives ..... what is the development of the dead beloved? Why is there no background on guard? What is night vision? What is the lipstick on the car? Why a dead watchman? Tell us about why you are running a mentally ill / peeping tom? What's the matter? Oh and the lamp, whose house is there? Territorial? Why? What makes the guard feel like home? this aspect has never been pursued ...... as for William Defoe ... I hired this movie, because I was in it and I met the sad symbols ..... Write down and say what you need to learn. .. I am a mother who loves the first American movie ... Chris ....
