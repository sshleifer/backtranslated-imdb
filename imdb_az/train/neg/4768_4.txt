I was recently poured out with Nine Dead and I read the current reviews thinking that I could deal with the mid-film. But this movie was slightly below average, but it was beautiful. The scenario was poorly written and the actor was at a moderate level for a B-level movie, and the couples were in pretty good shape. The plot is limited to Saw, teaches people how to make a mistake and tries to evaluate more, but the place where the comparison is over is really. Nine dead people are trying to put their hearts and minds on unusual unusual thoughts. The main benefit I found in the dead was just 3 minutes before the movie, and it was completely unnecessary and after a completely incomplete ending that people would not see in bad ways. I do not want to stop or even weaken any of the spoilers I've seen so far in the movies. Good flick, bad moves and ends ...
