The film's premiere was explained and you do not claim to be a movie critic if you go so far. The film said that my idea was pretty low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike, but it's in DOA 2 and 3, and some (many) go into it with a great deal of work. <br /> <br /> Because the movie seems free, there is nothing wrong with Takashi's film and Takashi. This is a high school student approach to the cinema. For the rest we will not be able to find a child for half an hour, and for whatever reason, heartbreaking (and, of course, this film goes away), the tempo of the film reaches almost the level of rigomortis and moves ... well ... hmmm. <br /> <br /> If someone is a fan of Takashi, you will see him at your fingertips, despite the peak of your interest. Any originality that is caused by lack of faith (see "Neverending Story") or any character development. <br /> <br /> It's not that we're hoping that Miike's identity will be smashed, as it is pointing out that this is part of the first Miike movie. on the screen. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that you only have to enter Miike, go to some standards such as Gozu, Ichi, and Audition. Later, Blue was filmed for his works like Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Chinese Bird Society.
