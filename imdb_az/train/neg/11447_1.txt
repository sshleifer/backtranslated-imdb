Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen; I'll go in the first ten minutes. People were laughing at the theater. I do not know if I'm wrong, I love silly, stupid movies like the next gal, but stunk all premise, writing and humor. It seemed to me that they would be able to bring a "Napoleon Dynamite" - a strange and random scene to a devastating audience. Instead, it ended up being compulsory, impartial and strange. <br /> <br /> Only a bright light was by Isla Fisher and I felt very bad about (and Sissy Spacek) signing up for this terrible thing. /> <br /> Thanks for Gosha.
