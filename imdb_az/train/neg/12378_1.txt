Creepy & lascivious monster. The young "Red" is full of make-up, very short shorts and shirts. It took about 20 minutes to realize that the pedophile's dream could be real. "Star" music sounds like something I heard in a striptease club. I really think this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. With my daughter, I was happy to wait for this, and I do not want her family to think that the quasi kiddie porn is normal to see together. It is sold as a very bad, very sad family movie, Joey Fatone is probably ashamed of it. And what is the ad with "special effects spectacular" ??? Impacts look like low budget, frightened.
