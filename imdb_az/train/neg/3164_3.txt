Obnoxious Eva Longoria dies when an angel's ice sculpture falls behind a truck without a wing on his wedding day and dies. <br /> <br /> She is trying to disrupt her new friend with her previous lover, her relationship with a psychologist. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the unoriginal film will not be bad in a klichel type, but Longoria's character is the hate and disgrace of all the movies. It is cleaned with abrasive ears. Being fair to Longoria, or casting or crew, is not a problem, but God's scary script, which leaves the legal process. His only real fools.
