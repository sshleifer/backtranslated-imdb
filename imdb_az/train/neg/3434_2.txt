I am a great horror / splatter admirer, and I enjoy some of the foolish movies I think are foolish. I also love it. <br /> <br /> After reading the studies of other people participating in the poll, I was convinced that this film would be a little gem. <br /> <br /> It was one of the most senseless films I've ever seen before disappointing. <br /> <br /> The player is excited, the dialogues are foolish, the point is not senseless, and the special effects are useless and edited by a person who has been dead for the last two years. Usually I see all of these features a great horror film. But this is not the case. <br /> <br /> I took 11 Euros to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> If, in fact, it is not meaningful (eg "violent sh * t" movies)
