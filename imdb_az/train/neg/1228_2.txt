Amazing! Wow. I rarely felt I had to comment on movies lately, but this is especially begging for a beatdown. Let's start from the beginning. First, writer-director Susan Montford puts Kim Basinger into the role of an old victim, complete with a necessary abusive husband and boring suburban existence. Let's just say that in this dull movie, almost all content is completely hackneyed and trite. <br /> <br /> It is not laughable to try to shake the Christmas tree to its effectiveness without any star. <br /> <br /> When she goes out for a dark and stupid night for some Christmas paper, Della breaks out that someone is parking her car in the park's most unwanted shopping night. When he decides to do something about it, he puts a bad note on the front of the car. The next fifteen minutes of the film is dedicated to Della shopping center conveniently. When he finally came to his car, the thieves resisted the note, the police were killed, and he worked and they took him away and he went away and persecuted him again. Everything can be predicted completely and not resolved. <br /> <br /> This is not all the fear or intimidation, and all of them are chosen by common means. <br /> <br /> This is all the actions, as you can imagine, stupid. Why do not the bad guys kill him instead of waiting for him to shoot with a single iron, beyond me? And once, once, in such a film, should the leader of the pack die ultimately? What are they selected alone when they all resemble one another? Most part of the film is simply Lukas Haas, "Della !!!" <br /> <br /> Some of the films are "Della", "Variable and Injured", "Sounds to the Sky", "Where are you, God?" When it is made, is it really the god? I gave only 2 pieces due to cinematography and lighting, and this is not as bad as BTK Killer, the last point to judge any horrible movie. Applause!
