.. THIS! <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The things are: when the ghosts emerge, I really liked the way; how it was done, how it looks ... only one thing was the connection of the ghost. <br /> <br /> In the first part, you would think that after the decline of things, their dynamics would be different. <br /> <br /> Some things have been slow in my mind and the crab / spider scene is not good. BUT it's really good when it's over! Of course, 'The Grudge' has explained the same story as the polished lens, but there was no samurai and I liked it more than this movie. <br /> <br /> Please refine this movie in a unique way. /> <br /> The fan of "Silent Rage" absolutely loved this movie.
