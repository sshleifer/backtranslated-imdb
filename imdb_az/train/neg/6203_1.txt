I saw it at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was terrible! <br /> <br /> Every clich√©, a fierce, rich child fantasy, was only shown how the Prime Minister would end up with all the shooting of the spouse and the first girl's aggression. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that the Q & A director / writer and writer / producer wanted to come up with an intellectual idea but could be the kind of violence. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I was not afraid to go out of my husband.
