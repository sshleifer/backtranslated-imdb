There are two points in the beginning to clarify. First of all, we all know what this year's Oscars really are about this year. It was the way to show that the Academy was not racist, and it never happened. They wanted to erase all kinds of biased ideas about themselves. Secondly, it is pointless to say what you think about the show, because what really matters? But it's great to write about it. This is the year with the Oscar! I will never watch my show. Every year they do something wrong. Crowe must be for the real winner Ralph Fiennes "Sunshine" before winning the "Gladaitor". If you see that you have not seen this movie yet, please see and agree. There was no candidate when the "Eyes Wide Shut" was released. And as it goes this year, good choice was all over the place! Baz Lurmmann is not a "Best Director" nomination! Are you kidding? "A Beautiful Wise" is Ready for the Best Makeup ???? Will the "Day of the Teacher" be nominated? The movie was terrific and Washington seemed to be out of the question, knowing how to use the four words you denied! What does this award win? Take your tongue and I almost play it! I like "Gosford Park" really, but why are there 7 nominations? And Altman, how they can not afford this on Earth! I would like to say, just what does Altman mean when people give a reward to clarify their bad impressions? People are now in the public eye for 32 years and there is no Oscars! There were so many things to do with this year's Oscar, but I still live as long as I do not have to watch a show! The highest point of the show (and only one) was when Woody Allen first appeared for the award-winning show. It will be one of the greatest moments in the history of the show.
