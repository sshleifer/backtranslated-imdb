It was very tough with the participation of Steven Seagal. Or you need to say Steven So-Dull! Seagal is very good at the same time as it used to be, or he has a lot of folly to repeat his own lines, and he sounds for someone to shoot at the places where the sound is looped. Previously, some movies did, but I do not think so much! To be honest, the movie looks very good, the script can use some of the works, but the parts of this movie seemed like a real movie! Of course not all this, this movie is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> He would have been better without Seagal, a cartoonist. Please do not worry. There is something over this thing! I'm honest, this is the latest and Seagal movie for me. How long did it take me to understand?
