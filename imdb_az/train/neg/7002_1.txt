I saw this movie and the other. My trio is my name, and I see that this is a bit worse. I had no idea why he was doing a movie, it was a stupid and meaningless apology to say that it was all. I sat there several times and still manage to film for 5 minutes. I love Terence Hill movies and love Bud Spencer, but this movie has accelerated my wall. If there was a different storyline or at least one plot and more comedy, it would cost $ 5 for funner and all the movies I bought. But you are wrong, so you have to save your money, and none of this movie or anyone with it will trust me.
