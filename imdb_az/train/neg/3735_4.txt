The actress Patty Duke wrote a deep, funny, rude, sophisticated book about his career as an actress, his crazy-quilt love-life and his manic depressive episode and almost suicidal attempts to put her best. With this rich outfit (and Patty plays himself on the final move), Gilbert Cates could have combined a movie as a television director, but "Call Me" Anna is a pale shadow of Duke's biography. For those who have not read the book, sketchy narrative is not a savings deposit, we are not allowed to buy beds with what happened and drowned in production down the budget. Actors are wrong, and Duke does not pay for its appearance - the fake reality of the movie is so thick that Patty can not bring stability to the scenario at this point. The film seems to be a sincere (and conscious) idea for Duke's latest diagnosis and concern for the freedom of mind, but it creates dramatic opportunities in the process.
