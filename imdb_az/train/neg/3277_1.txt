If you've been watching Dwarf Dukes, you know you never worry about drugs or worry about the rough behavior of little children. If you see the movie you've already seen! This movie was HORRIBLE! The main characters dealing with drugs and I think funny and cool, of course, fun. They had a spectacular show and turned it into a trash can. Daisy, who is a little embarrassed in the original show, now looks and acts as if he were in the street corner, which paid for his services. I was excited to see this movie before I left the movie 15 minutes before I was ready to be released. I was thinking of getting better, but instead of getting worse in minutes. I wish I never saw this movie. I pulled out a good impression and when I left, it was a terrible taste of my mouth. Give yourself a blessing, you see something worth your money, because it's not just a loss of money, but a 2-hour loss of your life!
