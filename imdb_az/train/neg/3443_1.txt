Yesterday I watched this movie and hoped for the best after watching all the cool trailers. The DVD cover looked good. As I began looking up soon, I would think like "my God is this whats this". a bit creepy moments, but then mood disordered with foolish music. The scenes of stagnation were rock and opera in the process. For me there was annihilation and kicking my head, thinking that I was indifferent, and deceived with a hire and cover art. Nothing against music itself was in the wrong part of the movie. There is no clue as to what they are doing in the movie. The lid showed lightning, storm on the sea. It would be more interesting but it did not happen. My wife is not the worst thing I have ever seen, thinking that she does not know anything, and this is their first movie. Another reason I'm disappointed is that the plot does not make any sense. In the beginning 2 people had all the juvenile boats, then at the end there were only 1 girl and others were either imaginary friends or ghosts but I'm not sure they are too bad. Writing a comment here, WhyteFox claims that this is a real story. He says he believes in souls and souls, and says that this film is an incorrect boat in the area. It's not a real story in this movie. I have not experienced such a thing personally, but I can not say that it is impossible. If everyone wants to rent this movie, think it at your own risk. If you love horror movies of an amateur student you can do it.
