Of course, the first thing I saw in this movie was the unnecessary amount of nakedness. She is not afraid of nudity or anything, but she does not need much. Annik Borel plays an uncomfortable woman who believes her father's wife resembles their families and believes their fate will be the same. Indeed, I found it quite interesting. The original Wolf Man was going to be a completely psychological film, but Universal never needed to see the extra Wolf or the twisted copy. I find this understanding of someone who is not really interested in a wizard. Unfortunately, this is not the movie I'm looking for. <br /> <br /> Instead, we know that we are not a wolf, so there is no excitement or twist, and that's the scenario that the film really looks like. One or two parts of the film are attached to this truth. At first I was thrilled when I read the film's description. <br /> <br /> Annik Borel is a player who plays a psychic role, or a player who is really a bad player. psychological role. The character Danniele requires little skill, since there is no brain and just snapping like a monster and worm running around crazy and snarling. There are moments that make for those moments a creepy moment, but soon the poor camera is destroyed by work and light. The idea is great, but it's treacherous throughout the movie. 3/10
