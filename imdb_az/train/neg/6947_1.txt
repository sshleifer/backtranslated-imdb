Surely one of the worst films I've ever seen in recent years. The story focuses on four bans aimed at robbing banks that hate us. It is difficult to give the foolish decision making characters. No, the police are in us, they know who we are, what will we do? ... We robbed another bank, and then we are here! Yes!?! Each character is a stereotype and easy to explain who will die.
