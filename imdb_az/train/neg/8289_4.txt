Sorry, but this is a bad movie. Do soccer hooligans discuss a travel spot? Suits? Shades? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He does not seem scary, runs fearlessly, . And for the Yeti? What is this episode? When you sit on a ride on costumes, shirts and riding passes, "when you get a mint about it." Please. <br /> <br /> And Yeti's band spoils the ICC's clothes? <br /> <br /> I do not see how anyone can even shoot this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10. Perhaps I saw the most accurate picture of the eighty-eighth hooligan crisis.
