It is difficult to criticize this movie, because I do not like the story itself, and my good activity could save it. Think of an "Raising Arizona" with an average strip. Acting is passive, but Jennifer Tilly's a way out of the top level (yet it's not enough to make this beautiful camp movie) when it's somewhere between a "Misery" and a shaky DMV worker. The rest of the others are strangers, either dependent on the stress of their parts or on the stress of all unnecessary movements. A few hours of true worthless movie. Darryl Hannah cries very much to understand the majority of the film. I can tell you how it ended, but I apologized.
