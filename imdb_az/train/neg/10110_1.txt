This movie was the worst movie ever seen in my life. I do not even cheat. He was poorly prepared and the actors could not move. It was my time and my loss of money. It appeared like a movie that we could combine with my friends. The situation in the film is a disguise. Nothing in the film looks like a zombie in front of the case. Apparently, the director or makeup artist only puts a black eyeliner under one eyed eyes and tells them the zombie. At the beginning of the film credits last for about 20 minutes. The film is the best part of the movie watching. This was a fairly horrible film and I did not believe how bad it was. Areas splashed from one to the other, and sometimes it was like what? <br /> <br /> If you think about buying or buying this movie, I recommend you look at the trailer at least. It really shows how terrible it is. I wish I could watch it before I leased it.
