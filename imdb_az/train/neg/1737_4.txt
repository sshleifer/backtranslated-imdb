Lubitschin's latest film, sophistication and silliness, romance and music, fantasy and costume drama for Ernst Lubitsch, completed by Otto Preminger after the untimely death of his production. In the 19th-century castle in Southeast Europe, the leader of the Hungarian rebellion, a hero falls into a Countess; She is supported by her father, who painted the painted appearance in a magical way. Betty Grable has never been more beautiful than a long blonde blush decorated with flowers, and her songs are very enjoyable. Unfortunately, this script is packed with mesh or different ideas that are unsuccessful for fun (by Samson Raphaelson, taken from Rudolf Shanzer and E. Welisch). The results are good, but unabsorbing. * From 1/2
