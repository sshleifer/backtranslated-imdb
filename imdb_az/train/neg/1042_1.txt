First of all, write napkins in the script. Who needs more than that? <br /> <br /> Therefore, we're not Hollywood movies. It will be good for the festival festivities. Finally, who needs some people who have been using their craftsmanship for many years? Then I get a cinematographer who does not know how to illuminate. You see, if it is well burned, it will not be "real" and the festival people do not like it. But who needs a professional-level photo? Then invite a ten-year-old employee who never misses the camera to become your operator. Your movie will make the movie "audience" a "totally amateur" touch that will make a mistake for the "reality" and emit a small strip of intellect that is less intellectual than critics and critics. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it does not believe that it's just an amateur hour. <br /> <br /> After you have done this, get your ticket at Bad Movies and Sundance Festival. <br /> <br /> Sad loss.
