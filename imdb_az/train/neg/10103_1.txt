This movie was going to me. The title was perhaps the biggest idea I could hear. I thought it was an independent movie about a zombie epidemic and a group of US and only survivors, to seek to take the band together and plan to remove the zombies. DEAD LEFT! A psychopath with a weakness to kill women's prisons happens when a group of awesome women come to the graves to get proper revenge on the police. As you can see, there is nothing about the existence of a nation or a county. <br /> <br /> First of all, zombie women look at the Victoria Secret models as a dark eyeliner and pale face. What is a zombie, but stupid, controversial intelligent, greedy killing machines, as a result of their primary needs eats? These zombie women walk around streetwalkers and runway modes, they talk like they are in a weak motion picture and do not act like real zombies. Of course, there is eating and killing, but what is misery and terrible disorder? Although this is a very interesting concept and maybe a great satirical genre of the zombie, it makes the genre fun and why "why zombie can not have vixen killing machines?" Gives the question. I would say this movie will be considered a really bad indie movie produced and made by garage junkies. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who loves zombie genres, it's not like an insult or a scary one.
