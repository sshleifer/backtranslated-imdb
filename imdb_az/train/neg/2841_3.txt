SAKURA KILLERS (1+ outta 5 stars) Maybe in 1987, this movie could be well-looked ... you never saw a good ninja movie. Cheesy's 80s music ... cheesy dialogue ... cheesy acting ... and joyful fighting times on the roadside. At the most expensive scene ... playing golf on a beach with an old Chuck Connors ... a few black-covered ninjas try to warn him and he seems to be too intent on hitting the ball ... suddenly he reaches the golf bag and ... naw, I will not be spoiled for you ... I'll thank you if you're happy to see this movie. The story is a lot of ridicule on some stolen video or something. A group of rude heroes is trained by ninja because "only one ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. It is strange that these guys do not seem to fight better than previous trainings ... Well, the film is moving too fast. The scenes of the fight can not be great ... but much ... and silent sound effects are good for a few giggles.
