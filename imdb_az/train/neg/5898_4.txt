Basically, take every Asian horror fantasy film concept and put it in one and get this movie. The story is as follows: a group of college children receive voice messages from their own phones writing their death news. Any s *** have gone with ghosts, have seen any Asian ghost movie, now is not scary. This movie was very strange, because it is a very short cut. Unlike some movies, Unfortunately, actors are brought to many ring, so it's not something we have not seen in the past. <br /> <br /> <strong> The improvement in the situation in the Caucasus, an arm leaning on a lever (I do not know how to explain it) is a cool sequence, but it's gone away because you did not see anything outside the end result. <br /> <br /> Fear of the film is small and spread. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red>, and it's really not scary. Sometimes you get some creepy pictures, but it's not enough for me to think of scary. It's nothing more than Ringu, Ju-On or Dark Water, and nobody was afraid of me. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that Takashi Miike has done a very good job, because it is a fall (and most Asian horror films). work He was somewhat deceived in this film compared to his past films, but he is describing many of his popular celebrities. Many pictures were as much like Miike (including a scene with a set of dead fetuses) and the last 15 to 20 minutes more Miike then feel the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <strong> Enter the michel This is not the best thing to do. <br /> <br /> I just mean that I'm mediocre. Maybe it's 4 or 5 years ago, this might be a higher rating. <br /> <br /> Also, I would really like the Asian horror movies very fast. How would I be a Asian horror movie that you're thinking of being good at being here (in the US)? Many of these films know that you did not know Scream, Urban Legends, and My Last Writings in Japan in the 1990s. You see everything you see. And many of these films rely heavily on hearts and footage that if they do not deliver their fears, then they are not good and nothing can change. More Asian fears are more like a story from Audition and Two Sisters, two class films, at least the greatest stories, acting, direction, cinematography, if two movies are not scared or scared. Not only are big films of fear, but generally two movies with big films. More Asian fears should be replaced by a clich√©: "He wanted to find a ghost, so the phone / video tape / home / power tool / water pipe / google search engine / vibrator / grocery store, and so on."
