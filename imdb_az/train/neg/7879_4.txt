First, I want to say that I liked the book Farm Farm. I read it with the 9th grade class, and it was very nice. We also decided that the film will be useful. The film was very heartwarming for me. The film corrects some of the characters and misses most of the book's main points. It does not explain in detail the horses and everything around. It would be a mistake if someone watched this movie without reading it for the first time. This film has ended with the most disappointing thing for me. The ones in the book were the strongest and they changed in the movie! In an alliance and somewhere, it had to be pigs and men in the form of "melting", but instead showed that the film looked like animals' rebellion against the pigs. Generally, I do not think that this movie will be a true reflection of Orwell's book.
