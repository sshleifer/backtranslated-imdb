This film is an attempt by Jared Diamonds to present the theory of "Guns, Germs and Steel". <br /> <br /> This documentary is made up of 2 discs that cover the version I have seen. hours. I think this information could be given within 20 minutes. Professor Jared Diamond, Professor Jared Diamond, watching birds with a binoculars, did not properly use a bow and arrow when Professor Jared Diamond illuminated a mouthpiece. Was this documentary supposed to prepare a hero "Professor Jared Diamond"? This part of the documentary was very bad, it could have been a parody. The worst situation is when we go to the malaria department at Diamond's African Hospital, crying and weeping. None of this helps me to understand the theory of Guns, Germs and Steel. BTW, "Guns, Germs and Steel" are spoken about 100 times. Can the Europeans take off the weapons, germs and steel from this difficult situation? When it finally comes to business, its theory is interesting and totally boring. The Europeans conquered the indigenous peoples of other countries because they had weapons and beautiful blades against stones and wooden weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me on this subject? <br /> <br /> The parts of the theory that Europeans have the privilege of conquering are interesting, but their coverage is paper. Finally, the document convinces me that only non-Europeans are capable of being Europeans. If I'm not racist, I know it. If I was a racist, Jared Diamond would not agree with the use of bumbling on the native bench. <br /> <br /> Adults are the intended audience for this documentary. Although children can be more than me. I read that this documentary is better than a documentary.
