CRIME BOSS is managed by Alberto De Martino; A partial Italian crime drama in Hamburg, Germany. An easy forgotten movie. Despite having a good car, this flick seems to be a lumber in almost the right way. New Don seizes a powerful mafia family and fights for himself. It is difficult to rely on anyone when the laws and morals of the mafia code are written, especially when millions of dollars are shot. Sexual violence is the same as for oppression and violence. This is not a shelf with a real gangster epic. Only the appearance of the movie reminds us of the value of the American driver. Even the famous American actor, Telly Savalas, can not improve the quality of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato also plays with Paola Tedesco, Guido Lollobrigida, Serio Tramontti and Piero Morgia.
