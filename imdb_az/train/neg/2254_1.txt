Okay, people, honestly ... this should be one of the worst films on the show that has nothing to show, but I'm also smiling. Basically, there is one way to get sex, gender, and 15 minutes of personal fame. Did I remember that sex was a major issue in this movie? If you've got something for bizzzzare characters and easy fun, watch out for this chance (and nothing better). <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers that pay attention! *** The most interesting thing in the film is that Jerry can get her goat (!) Show on the show and love her wallet. Delicate taste and entertaining triple A!
