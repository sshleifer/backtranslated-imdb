He pushed this movie on Sunday. I thought it was as bad as I was looking at IMDb to see that others think. I was not surprised by the amount of foolish people who love this hair. I was surprised to look at the comments to read the Hated Dog categories to see if there were none of them. I'm shocked; I always look at hate, though they are good, always hates the movie always. In any way, this movie tells me that hate was created by the hackers and proudly declare that I love this movie! I know I need to give more details about what I hate to film, but I would be more honored than worthy of this movie.
