First of all, I'll tell you that I'm funny, anime, animated, and so on. True, everyone has their own desires, but you can trust me in this movie. I will be objective. Let's start with the story - okay. I'm watching the storyline of comic books, and I've met them. But animation ... Well, it's not really terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be better if you follow the style of anime and fit the descriptions of the original comic book style. If you do not see rare effects such as fire and lightning, you can say that the film is about ten years ago and more. Since 1985 it looks a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D. For example, look at the Heavy Metal FACT 2000 - 4 years ago, the hell made a very good movie! In addition, the vocal talents do nothing, music is not something special. That is not all - it does not have the atmosphere. I was watching it, but I can not say that I really did not like it. It just does not keep you. There is plenty of blood and violence, but it does not surprise me. Never again will it be a shock to someone who does not look at more immature animations and who first sees a live animation movie (who is around?), But I do not think that this movie is a spectator. That's why they can add some nudity and spices. The chicks around Lucifer were pretty tasty and have Lady Death in Hell! There are several sexy looks, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown music, I think it will look better than a heavy rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All of this - the film is not bad, but if you want something better, you can get the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice or Wizards. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust
