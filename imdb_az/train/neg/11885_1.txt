I will compare him with a legendary director who is talking about his neurotic New Yorkian personality, because comparing it with sincerity, missing Josh Kornbluth, is just an insult to such a director. And with this celluloid disaster, I'm going to avoid mentioning the "Office Space" of the "satirical" satire. But can I compare the awakening of your own operation? It's painful to watch, and doctors do not really know what they are doing. The Haiku Tunnel is the type of movie they want to plug in at early stages of production. <br /> <br /> There are several articles about film shooting. if it's really one? it's not worth discussing, but I'm careful. Josh Kornbluth, who works with heavy duty phobias, offers a permanent job. Its main task is to send 17 high priority letters to its director. But in a ridiculous way, he can not fulfill this simple task. My reaction? Great job! Is not this a story? in the best way - a past thinking - by any self-respecting filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Trustworthy actor? If you can tell him, his rough features are a quiet logic of a man with a series of facial expressions, ranging from curling, uncut hair, and flattening. Where did the director find this shout? What do you say ???? is he the director? Oh, my calendar. It's something to play with when you are embarrassed by a scenario, but I do not think that Mr. Kornblut does not dare to be the same person as a single actor. That's not a purposeful assassination, but I've never been ripped off by any actor on the screen! My dream was even more complicated by unusual camera monologues between the scenes. So, just as the viewer needs an Intelligence peak to understand this driver, Kornbluth's more insults us by explaining the action (the first structure of the film: 'dramatic exhibition' show). Who does this guy think he is? He has no style of attraction, attraction and no sense of his Hawaiian shirts. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus> Patricia Scanlon, former director general Helen, as the former Secretary-General Helen is very entertaining giving a look and holding a grab under his face, making a harasser phone call from his basement. It made me scarce, but soon passed and I returned to check the time for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is also incorrect. Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Do not be fooled by the fact that this is an ambitious title or a movie theater that plays and does not give money in the cashier. ?????? there is a very good reason for that! <br /> <br />
