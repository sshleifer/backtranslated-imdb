Antonio's films are not old enough. What keeps me amazed at is that, besides this memorable plastic beauty, there are dull and dynamic "psychology" of characters and situations. For example, Monica Vitti or Ferzetti, who was laughing to the villagers who escaped from La Notte or La Aventura, talked about Mastroianni and the "bad capitalist" at the end of the same film. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I was reviewing Zabriskie Point. In this film, Rod Taylor's office, LA streets and highways, descriptions of descriptions, deserts, There are many beautiful and sophisticated shots that show the dignity of the author during his visit to America. Ever since Wim Wenders. Unfortunately, there are many hippie leftist clicks that break the film: - The boy leaves the meeting, stole the plane and flies out of the outside to find himself free and find "something different". - Gray suit heads always talk about speculation. - The girl looks at the "object of the woman" in the swimming and leaves her to want not to be like that. - Some of the caravans of the fat middle class talk about the beauty of nature, the construction of a hotel, and the making of a lot of money. - Last but not least, many couples who love the wilderness. We apologize, half a century after the "revolution" of La Aventura, we have the king's naked, and his films ("Le amiche" and possibly "Il grido") are aesthetic and common.
