Does not know what she wants to be a birthday girl - is it a comedy, a drama ... it just does not know. Very funny or touching film did not end in the land of anybody. The presentation is fairly dependent on a script full of interesting scenarios, but it does nothing and ends. When you look at the dash it is a shame - it is very strong all the way, but they can not afford brightness. Very disappointing.
