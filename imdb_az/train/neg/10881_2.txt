My friend's mother worked in a video store and previewed the movies before leaving, so the convent, a horror movie, was unable to keep watch when it was brought home. Though I should not be afraid, I really think it's really fun, and I can say that I love this movie in some strange ways. Yes, the actress is bad and yes, this is the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's so damn crap! "WHAT IS A BLACKMAID?" I did not know if this movie was not even released ... I thought it was too bad ... <br /> <br /> Yes, so ... usually the film is too bad (I must admit it) <br /> <br /> Some movies In one, I am very happy for it. <br /> <br /> Behold, this movie is a little laughable, but it is laughing .. THE DAY OF DESPAAAAAAIRIN!
