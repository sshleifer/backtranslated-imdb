This movie has proved to us that professional basketball players are doing everything in addition to the basketball ball. Especially rapping and moving. I can not begin to describe how bad this film really is. First and foremost, what do you think, or is your most challenging child? I would like to say that teeth can be used as a lifetime. Secondly, if he wants to pursue a career in a gin art, does he create heartwarming music despite the magical powers? Third, I read the Bible. In no form or form, Jesus did not say that he was a demon. Fourth, what was all the malicious special effects involved? I assure you that any jagged computer can have a better impact on a computer. Fifth, why is it so bad that ended? What is a hell of hell? And finally, get the word "suck" at the "totally new level" because it is necessary to create a nightmare, known as Kazaam, on a plane and on the Eiffel Tower.
