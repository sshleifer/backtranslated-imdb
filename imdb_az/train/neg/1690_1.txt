This movie was terrible. But that's exactly what I'm doing. I will never see this movie if it is given to me. The so-called fear scenes are incredibly predictable and played. It took about $ 7.50 to pay for the film's true value, or nothing, about the movie. Do not rent it, rent it, and do not read it online, because it's a complete loss of time. Sarah Michelle Geller demonstrated an unmatched performance and really should be embarrassed to erase the good name of this movie. Sarah is shameful because you're involved in this horrible, terrifying movie. Terrifying film, you do not need to see it anymore.
