Eric Roberts, a wife with his wife, had something to do with this perfect life ever since the worst life ever started as a child prostitute. However, his backdrop is unrealistic to rely on Dean Cain, which ultimately ends up completely. It sounds strange, but I also like the choice of Dean Caine. She can not hurt her because she loves her, and she is the mother of a child (I think it is not her brother, she is a child of time), but she can not forgive her for everything she has done, her sleep with her brother (she loves her love and commitment a bit of reflection) and then was part of his death. In better hands this would be a better movie, but it's not bad for something that I hold late in the night.
