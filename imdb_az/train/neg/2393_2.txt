I read Tom Robbins' EVEN COWGIRLS BLUES as a teenager. I loved every word. Hot, funny, glamorous decor and beautiful writing. But when I saw the film, I could not believe what a boring, unpleasant, unpleasant piece was. How did this happen? I think one of Hollywood reads this book and gives it under the name "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS". (This is the subject of the Congress Library). Now everyone who has been reading the book will know that there is nothing to do with real lazzans, and more STAR WARS is a real space journey. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this book was really written - written by a heterosexual man who likes IDEA (almost naked, always) on lesbians, someone in Hollywood, "uh oh, a better gay or give gay or gay people anxiety, "he said. So they gave it to Gus Van Sant. Man is nothing against - but gay can really be a hint of how funny it is to shoot a movie. Gus Van Sant drew a funny fantasy of a smooth man of the innocent girl / girl movement, and the man's voyeurism turned him into a dull, simple minded Lesbian Energy Recruiting Poster. It's like making an Oscar Wilde comedy to Arthur Miller's tragedy. <br /> <br /> Gus Van Santin had no idea what the main source was about welding material. His support allowed him to get the best job. <br /> <br /> The ignorant subtext of the novel (a flat man's fantasy, a gay pride employer poster) made her not only bad, but also strange choices. <br /> <br /> PAT MORITA is like "CHINK". Okay, recognition of name is less Asian actors. And Pat Morita, HAPPY DAYS, was pretty laughable. However, leaving it as CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita will not know that Zinka is a very funny person. (Gus was not told to him.) Pat knows it's Zinc. . . good, SEXY !!! The book is not that wise old Miyagi. More like Hugh Hefner! She knows a dark old goat and many nubile and responsive Sissy and Bonanza Jellybean a lot about gratifying. <br /> <br /> As YANGIN HURT calls "TOTAL", the book is not really a lesbian. Okay, he's gay-friendly guy. But he is CIDDY, SHAKESPEAREAN ACTOR! It's fun for the role and needs someone in the camp. John Hurt, like a hygienic, laughable man, is tragic and sad. I waited for Paul Scofield to go through the clothes like Thomas More and shake his head sadly. "Now, Richard, you know, you're completely lost, you're ashamed, my former student!" And yes, John Hurt was comic (and pretty gay) as Caligula. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> No talent, no training, no problem. Apart from the book, Bonanza is funny, entertaining, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual and loving. In the film he is dark, passive, expressionless and boring. As for the taste of women, Robbins in the book states this. "God knows that I love women, but can not replace a suitable person." Uh, Gus? Have you read this book? <br /> <br /> Like UMA THURMAN "Sissy Hankshaw". This is a tough role. In the book, Sissy is a really unusual passive and scary heroine. Still, a more successful actress could have prepared a sparkle in her eyes, or a sway in her ride, to express the secret power or secret pleasure of some of her adventures. She did not care about it, and probably, Gus had never told Sissy that she had to be a flower belt with a beautiful body and huge thumb. Uma plays a movie about a girl with more leukemia than she is in a TV movie. <br /> <br /> This film is noble and boring. And I blame you, Gus Van Sant!
