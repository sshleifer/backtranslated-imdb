An absolutely ambitious nonsense. The material material is boring, boring, and stubborn, and most of Castin did not even have the same idea in Allen's previous films. And Ferrell's Woody Allen imitation has to be heard by Frank Ferrell, even though he is second-class (though he is a mysterious figure), he is more neglecting Ferrell. <br /> <br /> Allen, who lives at 70 in a new century, appears to be as if he stops working. <br /> <br /> I really tried to involve the film, but it was not possible; my snyapses can not slowly fire. So I stayed longer than I could get up and down in the daytime, got up, left my wife and daughter in the theater and went to the car, which was a really good book to read again (George Bailey's brother, 30 years ago, the Germans.) It turned out that there was no thanks for Woody.
