When people say "the worst movie I've ever seen," they say almost any movie they do not want to say. But one of the more than 700 films I've ever seen, I was away without feeling insulting and angry. This is my first movie for the first time, and I just registered IMDb to touch the evil of this movie. When I was in the theater, I went to see it (my friend and two friends were 3 out of 5) and after 15 years I can not remember many features, but my attitude towards leaving the theater is still clear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lost herding on the alley, she goes to the end of a weekend and gets acquainted with a blonde blaze showing her interest, they are all greenhouses and it is the main pitch, a pitiful act in a dramatic run, runs along with her brother's lover, and then lives happily. Puke. First, the gags were so bad that it took me some time to understand that they were trying to be FUNNY, and that was a COMEDY. Specific impacts seem to have been done 15 years ago. The great drama was the last such hockey and it was unbearable to watch for it, which was tremendous to watch (all the cannibal family destroyed by tea-climbing teas, and they stayed in the style of Tom and Jerry when they put them). I'm sure there's more to it, but I do not intend to see it again for the update.
