Critically, I was expecting more from this movie and Tamara Jenkins. The story was thrown to only one place and did not have a point or a plot. I think it is difficult to believe that a 14 year-old girl (such as her underage or underage) would cause such a thing as her daughter "losing her virginity." Perhaps I'm too young to be with me (I was four years old in 1976), but I had no problem with Love in Shakarpar, or Life is Beautiful and I'm not right for those parameters. Casting is very good, but unfortunately, they did not give them a tool to attract viewers. Generally, Slums had moments, but I would skip it until it touched on the hinge tops and the pipe stockings.
