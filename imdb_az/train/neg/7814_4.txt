After a long period of time, Krypton is looking for the remains of the planet, Superman (Brandon Routh) Returns to Earth. She is married and kidnapped by Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth), a son of Richard White (James Marsden). Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) prepares a bad plan, using the crystals that Solitude has stolen to build a new land and immerse it in the US. <br /> <br /> Superman's unforgettable Christopher Reeve or television shows like "Lois and Clark" (and Teri Hatcher) or "Smallville" have created great expectations for the return of Superman in this Bryan Singer version. Unfortunately, the terrible story is very long and boring, with many unnecessary parts, lack of emotion and overrated in the IMDb. In addition, Lois Lane and Superman are a romantic shy, ridiculous thing. Twenty-two-year-old actress Kate Bosworth is wrong in playing the role of an experienced reporter and a mature reporter of a five-year-old child. Brandon Routh is two years younger than Tom Welling, a teenager with Clark Kent in Smallville. Parker Posey, Kitty Kowalski's character is actually a foolish cartoon. Last but not least, as Kevin Spacey is forty-five years old, and is terribly Lex Luthor, so he is older and older than the rest of the device. The mixed effect resembles and frightens a soap opera. <br /> <br /> <strong>
