A hilarious "drama" about a bunch of high-school (I think) guys who want to be non-stop hip-hop, dance, graffiti and Roxy are trying to become a DJ. I totally missed it to be completely honest, forgot it! Even people who love music think that this film is frightened and dismally unsuccessful as a drama. We should find these children nice and beautiful. I found them gentle and boring. A person who really hated him was Ramon. Metro trains are graffiti and this is viewed in a great way. Sorry? It violates public property that is not the beginning. Also, these "big" kids can enter the city's electricity and make a great dance party in an abandoned building. Uh huh <br /> <br /> Let's also note that several days before today, Songs were the best - mediocre and they were always up! They always play! I came to the point where I reached quickly with many endless musical numbers. Metro's dance fights, really funny Santa's number and climatic Roxy show - have several creative numbers (trim music and maybe a 30 minute movie - maybe). If you love hip hop, you have a movie here. But looking for a mixed good drama - do not forget. And how did this get a PG rating? There is an incredible amount of money.
