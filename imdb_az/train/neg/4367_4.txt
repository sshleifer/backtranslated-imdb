Boris Carloff's real clinker. In fact, the dead Carloff (who is about 120 years older) is a scientist who needs money to complete his pre-dawn experience. He will be transferred from Morocco to finance southern France, where he works for a doctor while trying to earn enough money to prove his theory and to be taken by someone else. She was looking for money when contracting a cotton bar with a young rich wife who wanted to die. She will finance her if she can get her money and help her husband poison her to continue gigolo (thinking I'm married). If you think I'm watching the movie, I think I'm wrong, and I have to read what I wrote to figure out what others are sending. Why? Because this movie has lost me for two minutes. I did not know what happened with my numerous characters and many convergence lines. Very little has been written down and much has not been said so far, at that time I really did not care. An imprudent confusion for Karloff's performance is sometimes strange. To be honest, I have come to visit the strange territory of Bela Lugosi. Not every scene, but a few, and wondering how much it is hanging on to me.
