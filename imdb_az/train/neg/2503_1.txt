How badly bad for the new Zealnd Film. When this film is available, I am embarrassed to call myself New Zealand and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite television (Aug 2006). Casting consists of many local soap stars. The ship is one of the inter-island ferryboats, which are in the real life, the logos (dolphins) of the company, which travel daily between the two major islands, and even ship funnel. The ship had to be a ship / ferry between the US and Mexico. There are signs of rust and aging in all places, but still a luxury ship that is her friend. One of the scenes shows the snowy peaks of the South Island of New Zealand in the background for God's salutation! Must have a very cold time in the US / Mexico! The story is weak, the player is weak, and new Zealand / American accents do not just work. I'm waiting for a New Zealand taxpayer to influence the production price of this movie and spend a lot of money on real product. High schoolchildren in New Zealand can create better movies with mobile phones. GOF: There is a truck that connects it, and they put a sign on the door of Taco's truck, apparently, it looked like America. However, some of the icons are at the top of the label - you would think that they saw in the props section before adding them. I love going, but in any case it is not worth the trouble.
