Joe Don Baker ... Thomas Jefferson Geronimo is a muddy, sweaty hurricane in a stupid cowboy suit that Roy Rogers will laugh. <br /> <br /> US President Barack Obama says military operations against the Armenians living in the US state of Texas are continuing. Not surprisingly, he was once a Texas Ranger, but he thought he was a balloon who was playing his own fate. This allows the suspects who have crossed the border to Mexico, the suspects, the armed wars that could prevent them from fomenting armed fights, prevent women from threatening women, and manage a child's life in a process that is threatened in the process. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div> The character of Joe Don, who wanders the Italian murder, hunts them and kills one of them. Then, by the order of Mr. Wilson, he leads the other to Italy, and he thinks that Joe Don will spend a lot of time. He loses Italy during the record period and receives the Malta booth that exploded in the process. <br /> <br /> Thus, as Maltera leaps between Malta looking for Palermo (Italian murder), Joe Don is the first of many deaths and disadvantages in a trail behind him. <br /> Thus, the film, where our hero was arrested, was taught by Malta's police chief, has more difficulty, is being arrested, lectures by the police chief, and so on. <br /> <br /> Joe Don, with his fleet's pistol, wants to blow your brain and do it horribly. <br /> <br /> Joe Don goes with a single blow, not for the first time he leaves Palermo. After threatening with a woman with a coat hanger, she was taken by Palermo. You are hoping that you will actually torture Palermo to attack the cellar that he put himself in, but the stripper came out of danger and took him out because he promised to defend him. <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> the ocean does not want it, and has given it to a poor Maltese family (why did they justify it?) He returned to the city, arrested by the police, lectured by the police chief ... arrrgghhh! A woman police officer escorted her to get Palermo. Why I will do something that's dead in my brain to destroy your career for this big stick out of me. <br /> <br /> They go to the villa where Palermo is hiding and start firing. Joe Don's unique tricks and kills Palermo. He then reads the latest and most striking line of the film: "I have a great badge, can you buy it for me?" Thank you for this immortal line, Mr. Baker. The film will go on to the very best, literally speaking, with the oldest, most beautiful, extremely extreme film. This, of course, suits everything related to the character. Bravo.
