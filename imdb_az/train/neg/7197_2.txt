OK. I think the television show is a favorite and always attracts some sort. So, when my kids wanted to see this movie, I decided to go into each other. <br /> <br /> The main reason for the interview is the least of the problems in the film. The field is inaccessible, the characters appear in a vacuum and, at the very least, the Gadget does not take any lessons. Apparently, Disney Inspector took all of Gadget's work on television and threw it all. To be fair, my little boy (8 years old) liked the movie, but one adult (10 years old) thought he was ridiculous (he was too young for humor, but too young for some adults). br> <br /> Generally, I love the Disney movies, but it's a mile. It is good for a very narrow age group (from 7 to 9), but not for everyone.
