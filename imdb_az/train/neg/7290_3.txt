What a long, drawn, meaningless movie. I'm sure that historically this movie is pleasant, but because it's fun, it does not cost it. Ralph Fiennes has been featured on some of the fantastic movies, British Patient, Schindler's List, but that was a refusal. He did not seem to have gone anywhere, and his character resembles it and it resembles that his surprise is that his "sister" is not interested in anything. Do not hesitate to rent this movie, instead of a copy of the English Patient.
