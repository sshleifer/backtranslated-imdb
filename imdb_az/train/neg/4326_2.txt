John Hughes wrote a great comedy in the 1980s. The "European Vacation" is not one of them. The pursuit of Hughes' first great sensitive "Vacation" (1983) hip-hopping is an unexplained, unfunny and disturbing thing as it comes - romantic Clark and Ellen Griswold (Chase and D'Angelo). <br /> <br /> I'm very glad about the 1989 Christmas Vacation, but the arrival of Griswold in Europe was gentle and compelling. Hughesin is, in fact, dumbfounding how inevitable and deprived of a story called "European Vacation", since it was at a later attempt that he did not get. There is no story: Griswolds earns a game show to become "greedy pigs" and goes to Europe through England, France, Germany and Italy. Even the conscientious physical humor, which is the trademark of the first, loses all its effect, because the next part is the fault of director Amy Heckerling. <br /> <br /> Hughes, with a cheap shot, has been put forward later, and the Fast Times director at Ridgemont High predicts everything. The "European Vacation", especially tourists represented by the respected Griswold family, are proud of insulting the Americans (we remember the greedy little pork game they won). He also hid us in the back, "Griswolds us, we always get into something because our father is a stupid one," he says. Then, in a humorous manner, he ends up honoring America and is grateful to Griswolds for coming back to a better country. <br /> <br /> Hughes was going to satira and was planning to do it in a bad movie, perhaps I should reward this 8/10 star. <br /> <br /> It's not just pretty, but Europe's Vacation will play two worst actors, Rusty and Audrey (Jason Lively and Dana Hill). They are both annoying and modest, and Audrey's charming and noisy face is confused about nearly all his friends. Hughes also comments on how he lost it, just as in the eyes of a giant bratwurst. Very enjoyable. Undoubtedly, the sounds were played on two different scenes without a good reason (until Americans commented on their love for arrogant badges in comedies). <br /> <br /> I'll give the movie one of the two stars. Thanks to Monty Python's crew Eric Idle, the film is a funny part of a few different points where the community reads the direct lines of "Holy Grail". If Hughes is meant to find that the film is only a funny part of just a non-American actor, then in the 80's, the Hollywood comedy has opened another hate to open it. Would you be damaging to make it fun still?
