C.S. Anyone who is not familiar with it. This movie should be interesting in Forrester's book. It's colorful, well-behaved, and describes a great adventure, but it's horrible for those who know the original stories. <br /> <br /> As a result, screen writers are forced to rewrite stories that work. Of course, this word differs from the written word and there are some episodes that will be difficult to shoot. But why do not the screenwriters rewrite the story simply to adapt it? In this case, the writers saw themselves. <br /> <br /> Just a few examples: There is not a well-known accusation. Experts had seized the boat after the sailing captain was completely dissatisfied, as the ship was never given the reasons for it. There was no court in the court. The trial court almost congratulated. Captain Pellew does not appear in this part of the Hornblower epic, and Col. Ortega does not have a wife. Hornblower, himself, on the ship or on the shore, did not have any brigades. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> Why, oh screen writers have broken a good story?
