<br /> <br /> This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually refer to any movie for some aspects of production, but I am surprised by the intense irritating behavior of more than half of any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> The most widespread thing is that the block building was an avalanche that crashed. The place is OK. <br /> <br /> Also, you should not try to ski slalom style. Running 10 meters on some trees does not work. Unfortunately, it's here. Some symbols are ridiculous as they are mentioned before birth and as mentioned before foolishness. In addition, about five minutes of the movie regained itself and gained some appreciation. But if you have a modification of intelligence, it will be hard for you to survive the majority of this film. <br /> <br /> For me, many quality stories are not produced and someone still pays for something like that. <br /> <br /> Has the last five minutes been marked? You have to watch the match in the best way to watch it with the cheating techniques. Totally pricey.
