I love Jane Austen's stories. I just read two of these (P & P and S & S), but after seeing this compatibility, I could reach the story of "Ivory" from my library, and Jane Austen could have written such a nonsense. For me, if you rely on a movie Jane Austen, you can not really go wrong. Apparently, it will be very nice. <br /> <br /> First, where are you sympathizing and your favorite faces? You have to have at least one unpleasant character to show spectators to express their feelings - and this has not been surrendered. Of course, I did not want Anne and Wentworth to come together, but because the story's purpose is to bring them together. Instead, I was forced to quit the television on the television and call it to watch it all the way. <br /> <br /> Mommy was generally so embarrassed that I did not know what Wentworth was. He was so attractive that he had nothing to draw. He was soft, soft, boring, socially insignificant, and faced as a sheep following his instructions. If you work well, it can still work for a lead character. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that it has been several days that Mary has demonstrated different degrees of narcism, which is distinguished by the most prevalent narcissistic personalities. Mrs. Bennett's P & P had similar flaws, and Mary was more sweat-show. Wentworth seemed to be a very nice person. For most of the story, I was just wondering how I was with Anne and why she loved Anne, of course, she would want a man who was a little bit more alive. Most, I'm not saying so much as people react to the characters I describe, how good or bad they are. The headman of Anthony was very good, but as I saw, I did not expect it to be as small as it was. Elizabeth Anne is not a full-grown mother, but a brother (I'm still 100%). The whole story of Anne / Wentworth was a bit flawed. They were together, but then they collapsed, and both of them are angry about it? How come? I was surprised at this for a while, and the explanation seemed to be thrown at him because someone agreed to do so? However, "by one" was not, it was almost empty, as though it were something inadequate. How could this be of little importance when laying the foundation of the story? There were many names, but there were no real ideas for who the characters were. For example, this Louisa man, who was he? Friend? Family? Yes? Who are different characters and their relationships? Lady Russell had a lot, but why? Ms. Croft and Wentworth were both brothers and sisters, Ms. Croft was quite unreal as she looked old enough to be her mother. <br /> <br /> The last kiss, yes, they kissed on the street a bit weird, but I really did not think about it, because I was very busy, "I AM WITH A YOU!" Anne's lips shuddered shaking and trembling, shaking in the fact that Wentworth felt like old enough to meet. <br /> <br /> Along with that, it's not a half-minute for a few seconds or a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Then there is a camera issue. As a regular movie watchmaker, we do not have angles and such an attention unless you decide to look at it for that. I did not decide to do it here, but it still saw them. For me, this is not a good thing for cinematographers. Many conversations were coming face to face with the incident. Only need to be used when needed. This adaptation has been used very often and therefore has no meaning. The feeling of handicapped handwriting has not really worked in a period of drama. The camera work in the last run has also been very up-to-date. (Not to mention Running itself). This was the only Austen compatibility that I kept at the ITV Austen season. Do I need to watch Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park or read books and leave them? I'm sorry to say, this is Jane Austen adaptation that I did not like. Maybe I'll follow the 1995 version. The Bbc is now well-known for its excellent adaptation to Austen.
