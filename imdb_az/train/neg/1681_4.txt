Freeway Killer has a Madman who draws people on the road while a bunch of mystic singing on a car phone. The police believe he is a casual killer, but Sunny finds an example of a blonde heroine that Darlenne Fluegel plays. Yagub Russo combines executions and bodyguards with the old police and their spouse who are playing. Also starring Richard Bezer, this movie has its own moments as car tracks, but really, you really are very bored and stay away from the Hitcher, Joy Ride or Breakdown.
