This film is about all the chefs who are damaging the stew. According to Shielah Graham's biography, it looks like power alone that can not pass well enough. It was not Graham's story or Fitzgerald's story, and he did not decide how much he had to have a legendary pedal. So, a film that can be a story about two interesting (Fitzgerald) and famous (Ms. Graham) personalities, tells us little about it, and turns into a terrible fertile soap opera. In addition, there is no other period since 1959. Let's just watch the scene, and I have no idea where it is or how long it has been in the story. But it saved me for the movie - Kerr never looked at the lovelier, and Peck was always a very nice person. They really come up with beautiful, mature couples, and I just wish they had better materials to work with. There is a scene in the workplace - Scott goes after the Shiite in a drunken state, and these two usual elegant stars are very worried to beat each other and think a little about what's going on with them. In addition, the film is a waste of time and is far from reaching its classic height near Wald's cold soaps (PETRON LAND, EVERYTHING IS THE BEST) of 1950.
