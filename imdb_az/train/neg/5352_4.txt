Honey, I had a great deal of Shrunk Kids franchise and not to mention the very popular. I liked the honey, when I was small, I was scared of children. It was an original story and it was such an interesting event! The coins were very nice and they liked each other's company. <br/> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> leave their husbands with their children on vacation. However, when Wayne's favorite item is threatened for rubbish, he wants to shrink and save it, but he and his brother go out. <br /> <br /> After returning home after spending time with his spouse, they forget to treat her son and go to the car. <br /> <br /> Cunning is meaningless, but as I said, it was just a family movie that someone could hit each other. Honey Honey, I Think Shrunk Best of Kids, everyone can be satisfied. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The third is not as bad as I would recommend it at least to Balaya, Kid's movie Blew, at least a little more entertaining. <br /> <br /> 4/10
