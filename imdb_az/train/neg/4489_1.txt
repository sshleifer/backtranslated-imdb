"The Matrix" is an exciting summer block that looks stunning, but is interested in the use of Twilight Zone. The general rule is applied here - it does not correspond to its predecessor. <br /> <br /> "Reloaded" comes out with the most unprofessional fashion. The first impression in a few seconds of the opening is generally good, as Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately after the nose-diving movie. After the first 45 minutes of disastrous entering the Matrix, the Agent Smith war broke out. However, when the 14-minute car rises, it loses all speed and eventually gets worse in the big noise twisting. It's the worst 'Zion Rave' scene. <br /> <br /> Bad and depressive is a bad pretext for dance music. <br /> <br /> The Matrix's bullet-time aspect is a good addition, but they try to look pretty bored in Reloaded. First, there were interesting plot queues, but here's a very straightforward line of interest. The film is basically a series of transparent provocations that prevent us from just realizing how bad it is. It works on the wrong principle that is better. Apparently, the "Matrix" franchise has been burnt again with special effects, as there is another franchise like Star Wars saga. <br /> <br /> The operating standard is weak for most parts. Of course, the best character goes to Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith - it's a little interesting. Keanu Reeves is definitely Neo, but there are very few places to have so much influence on all the special effects. Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with a weak dialogue. Carrie Ann Moss' part can be made better by any other actress like chick. <br /> <br /> A weak, thrown movie, 'The Matrix Reloaded' is a disappointment. Those who do not love the first will not flock to him. It's just for fans to die. Even the special impact bonuses on the movie's special sub-genre (Minority Report, Matrix, etc.) This is also pretty weak. IMDb my rating: 4.5 / 10.
