For a very wordy movie, it was a game that was heartwarming, delicately drawn and brazen and incredible. The plot has drawn more space than Swiss cheese, and is the worst clue she has ever seen in the film. If the start of the entire film was not very painful, the last scene tore my heart. I called! On the first stage - when he tried to reach a double for his sister's assistant, or just for the audience, and wondered if he was frightened by the worst-case scenario after two hours, he was seen so far. In the real sense of the word was a horror.
