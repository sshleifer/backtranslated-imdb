Peter Sellers (one of my favorite actors in 1970), this was gentle in Turkey in the 1970s, but the script is so bare and insulting, even Goldie Hawn's youth (after Oscar's winning) will not get out of this lavender. <br /> <br /> Best performance =? <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> HUSBANDS, JOE, WUSA, FIVE EASY PIECES and others). You can not win them all!
