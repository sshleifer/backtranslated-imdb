"John Hughes wrote a high school drama with his son!" <br /> <br /> As I watched the opening credits of the BBC2, I noticed late Saturday night that I checked the flickin information on IMDb. <br /> <br /> I simply understood it and sadly there. Perhaps you can not hide this poor film, but I'll leave the outsiders ... <br /> <br /> There are so many styles of very few articles: unfortunately, the style is very good for eight years after the release has a history. As for the article, the film tries to create an interesting view of the nature of control in society through the microcosm of school life; but under a glossy coating, a meaningful or relevant argument is not implemented. The writer's father falls into the kind of general stereotypes he wants to ask in the Breakfast Club, and colors from childhood are shot in large strokes. <br /> <br /> Director Kyle Cooper does a good job of keeping the speed up (probably a tedious device soon, but at least pushes the story) is not sufficiently limited to poor scripts and strange castings (with anyone using Maddox Blake Shields shines over the doors and the road, I can not understand) holes in the field (I'm a creative license, but when the "bad guys" know the identity of the "good guys" they make their lives miserable, but to stop them why not really move in any way <br /> <br /> I'm sure the young audience can use this movie (and all the power), but they're better than Hughes Sr's secondary school and What is the idea of ​​the rebellion in school? y applications, the 1968 classic "If ..." is more than a pleasure to investigate.
