I'm ashamed to take this movie in my collection. The most paying factor for having a DVD is a short movie in bonus functions. My voice for this movie is a great oil. Do not misunderstand, I'm a girl of fear. but I'm not saying that I do not want to postpone the story, to celebrate the evil that people do to deceive them to watch clips of animal souls forever. The actions of the horror do not stop the poor long silence and defective movements. If I had to compare with another movie, it would only come to mind that Cannibal was the Holocaust. A weak, boring, trivial and totally uncomfortable hour.
