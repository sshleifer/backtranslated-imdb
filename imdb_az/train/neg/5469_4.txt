The film may have poor production values, but it improves it. Special effects are common and well-implemented. My favorite part of the movie was Chrissy, starring Janelle Bred. It's also a very hot and good nuclear scene. The leader of the gang, Robert Prichard, is not funny as other members. This film really tries to give a point by saying that nuclear waste is bad. 4/10 Fair comedy, general movie.
