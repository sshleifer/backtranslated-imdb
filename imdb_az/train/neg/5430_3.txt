When you hear the name of Priyadar - the first thought will be "comedy". This man, more precisely, is known to be known. After giving great heroic comedies such as Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, her train slowly appeared with films that could not remember names like Chupke Chupke and several names. The horrifying movies like Dhol, the first word that hit his mind after hearing his name would be "torture." <br /> <br /> Dhol's bad, dirty toilet jokes, some drama, poor abortion and idiocracity. Only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the funny scenes, both of which were not rude, and secondly, except for Kunal Khemu and hysterical grandmother, the player was good. <br /> <br /> Rahpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi (if you compare them with others in the movie) were in the upper part, then Tusshar Kapoor, then Tanushree and finally the two beards mentioned above. Kunal Khemu's defect was loud in his jokes and even in his players. <br /> <br /> Granny, first of all, resembled a ghost, and she was not laughable, but too stupid. Four boys are behind the girl and need money, but several times. There is an extreme fool and a terrible 'bad guy'. Finally, he gets good at bad, and everything is fine. <br /> <br /> The worst thing in the film is the length. <br /> <br /> Dhol> An hour later, you run out and you want to leave the theater. But being critical is that I can not stand the whole two and a half hours of the film. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ align: justify; "> <br /> <br /> If the boomerang came to your home and started, you would have to do everything, then send it to this movie and have fun. From 10 to 3.
