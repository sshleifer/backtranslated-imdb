One week before I started this, I decided to watch this series after seeing the endless ads on the BBC. Although I did not like things similar to the indictment written by Alan Hollinghurst (I apologize to my fans, but I think that we are a part of the emperor's new dress). Imagine that the actor was beautiful, well-drawn, and I was entertained by him. However, I've seen that the story line is extremely subtle and I feel it's not too busy after watching all three episodes. The "open" gay sex in the press several times - several times - so I'm scared that it is very shocking. Generally I'm afraid of the full prices for production values, but those who are down for the story / content.
