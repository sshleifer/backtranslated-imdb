<br /> <br /> When entering a film of this movie, he did not say that the great deal of contravention is that the overdose of the brain's medicine will be used in a powerful way. <br /> <br /> Jeanette MacDonald plays Anna / Brigitta, an unprecedented woman since the beginning of Nelson Eddy, but she is also an angel sent to the world. <br /> <br /> When I saw this, the reaction was a silent jolt. "Hunh?" Where did I see this before? Apparently, I've seen it before, but it's too late in the movie. Founded in 1987, ANGEL is a forgotten spark, with no speeches, joined in the ethereal beauty of Emmanuelle Beart, wearing yellow sparkling clothes and making life hell to the soap actor Michael Knight. <br /> <br /> This is worse than the Turkish ultra-low 80s by the end of 1942. <br /> <br /> It's not something that is not a memorable movie and it's MacDonald and Eddy for the last time, because neither the very best actors nor the terrifying singers are "innocent" and "clean" romantic they were playing. You may then need a cold shower, where there are no steam scenes, but only to get rid of it.
