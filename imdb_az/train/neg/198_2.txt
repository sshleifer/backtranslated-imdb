Burt Kennedy was a very good director, but you never know this lumbering mess. This movie is inexpensive and inexpensive - most of the battle scenes have been raised from the last "Last Commander" since 1955, and 32 years ago, images look more modern than this one. In fact, some of the scenes shot for this film are crumbling, un-organized, mixed, and ineffective as the rest of the picture. It has a bad student film appearance and feeling (and the budget did not seem to be more in total). Raul Julia is better than the rest of the remains - it is generally a frustrating shepherd, although it acts as a molasses, historical inaccuracies. Moreover, there is a long way. If you take a drill film, run it for one hour or so and take it - do not extend it for more than three hours. If you want to see a good movie about Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960 version or the 1955 movie that has played the action scenes. Six producers believed that it was a bad film. Jump.
