When I was first released, I saw this movie. It was about forty years to remember how bad I was. When I saw it, I did not want to rely on my own ideas, so one day I applied to a film studio in a major metropolitan newspaper, confirming that the film was inaccurate, impartial and inviolable. A little research indicates that the producer was Leslie Caron's husband, so the nepotism's dignity is the beginning of this terrifying movie. Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame and James Sikking - have a few words. But the death of this movie belongs to his terrible scenario. The presented "mystery" appeared in such a crowded and very few films that the audience was surprised by the stage. The film looks torn between a detective mystery and spy tension, but there is no room for one another or another. No sense of stagnation. The main heroes play dry, emotionless types in fashion, which does not empathize with any empathy. Cinematography on foot. The result is that unhappy viewers lose their interest in the film, plan and eventually. Not surprisingly, there is no version of this sad movie to buy. Hopefully, if the TCM finds a pressure on this movie and feels it's forced to object it down to 4:00 safe.
