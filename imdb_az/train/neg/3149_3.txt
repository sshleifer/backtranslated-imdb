This documentary, an independent filmmaker and a great admirer of Edward D. Jr, eventually believed that talented and brilliant Ed Wood would actually set a record. <br /> <br /> What I did was a self-centered, confrontational, contradictory compilation of painful self-aggrandizing. <br /> <br /> People remember Ed Wood Jr's where is the second uncle boy with a duct tape capable of knowing someone who is actually Nine from Outer Space? <br /> <br /> As you can see, Ed Wood has a renewed interest, and these people come out of Wood! Nobody is like someone else who actually gives them a chance when nothing else happens. After 50 years, many of these people did not get $ 75! <br /> <br /> Ed Wood was a brilliant creative filmmaker capable of entertaining. In fact, it was ALL because it lived. When you see Ed movies, you giggle, but in a way you laugh with it and laugh with it. <br /> <br /> But I'm leaving ... Go back to the movie in hand. If you're looking for a movie about Edward D. Wood Jr, you will not find it here. If you want a movie about the old-fashioned old actors, this is the movie for you!
