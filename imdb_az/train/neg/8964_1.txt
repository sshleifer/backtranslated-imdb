Those two previous Cube movies know that they are expecting too much: a small group of people, trapped in a group of locked rooms, paranoia, and bad behavior ... Even though this is a bit different. <br /> <br /> Some of the movies are on the edge of the cube, where we watch people watching (or at least five) in the cube. <br /> <br /> Well, if you're dealing with Cube Zero Cubes, you really will not know much about what's covered in two films. Of course, there is a comment there, but it is more nude than the one offered in the first film. <br /> <br /> Cub Zero seems cheaper (like its predecessors) shows more than just a few empty rooms, only emphasizes that feeling. And I'm very convinced that the actors do not have the risk they can not win in the near future. <br /> <br /> Even though traps from the Cube are returned (which is almost the same thing, it is shame). <br /> <br /> I know that I appreciate the relationship with this film and the first one, but I feel that it is an absolutely unnecessary contribution to a small franchise that starts with it.
