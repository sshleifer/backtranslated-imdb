Richard Dreyfuss is really a fringe, but a very small part. He is not a "discreet" filmmaker - he is the group's business manager / accountant. Even the box film is wrong. There is no erotic scene with Sondra Locke, as it has been declared, unless you use the term "erotic" in a very concise way. Although Richard Dreyfuss is a great character in the film, I would not want to consider the film. But I realized that the 60th route had an artistic effect on Leonard Cohen's Suzanne. In addition to James Joyce's recent reading of the Ulysses lines and an interesting reference to the end of Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal," I found a poor attempt to perpetuate such films as "symbolic elements and moods" in "Marianbad last year" and "Un Chien Andalou". If you like the idea of ​​the eccentric artistic group, there are different films from "Bye, Bye, Brasil" to "Cecil B. Demented".
