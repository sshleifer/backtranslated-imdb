The number of people in this episode was higher than the first 9. The spirits of the body are not subject to their own rules regarding the souls that are being dissolved. It lost a second corpse. This corpse and Dean are about 20 feet from Sam, but then they are equal to Sam. The lights come out in a tired night, and we can still see everything. It runs through light windows, not at night. Calling a ghost cell phone that died in the 1960s? Come on! There was nothing that Sam could do to get a psychiatrist on the same day, and Sam did intervene as the doctor did on the first visit. Sam and Dean knew that there were other corpses in the shelter, and that they were still hiding innocent souls and did nothing to help them. These Winchester guys do not look like something. Oh and after a crockery around a dirty mattress and around a filthy shelter, the girls makeup and hair are perfect and her white shirt is a stain. <br /> <br /> The execution of this episode would be good in front of the problems and I did not smoke as I read Dean Elicots magazine several times. I knew that a very intense person would involve a person who violated his holiness. Elicot did not look. Perhaps it is a sin for such an important object or place (for example, in the office of Elicot), it is necessary to draw a soul when it comes to a live touch or when entering it. I want to scream when they leave ... 'How will this die! Stay Together and Look Alone! "but they did not listen to me: o The Elicot spirit and its special abilities were a very good touch. <br /> <br /> This is a show that's going to happen, but it's the horror of one of Elicot's victims and the desire to use torture to further shake. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have given it 4, especially because of lighting rides, and suddenly all the dark or all the scene lights shake like a lantern shake, all of which is terrible. I understand that the directors want us to see the scene, but just touching an electrical outlet of Elicot and establishing a lively or open connection with their lights.They are all at once responding to a shelter that has no energy at one room Blue-white lights, Elicotun finger power <br /> <br /> Seriously, MCG has done a lot better.
