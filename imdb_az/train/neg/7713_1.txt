I knew this movie would be as bad as it was funny, so I got this expectation. I just saw that it was so awesome I killed him. You will not understand that the soundtrack is only about 10 seconds laughable, except deliberately irritating quality. Things that end with tomatoes are about 30 seconds old. Apart from the film, there is nothing smart or funny. Perhaps a 3-4-minute comedy could protect the sketch, but it's not an art movie with any extension of your imagination.
