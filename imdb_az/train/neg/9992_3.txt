Ah yez, Sci Fi Channel, makes another mistake of Yeti. Especially after the accident, the scenes were taken immediately, while the survivors were looking for matches unexpectedly, at least half a dozen fires were burned. there is no reason? At different points of destruction. The fire seemed to be the main subject during the fire. They searched for corpses for lighters and matches, and at last they found a box of fire every day to find a box, as it seems, but no one gathered trees. When Vegan (hah) burned bodies, what did he use for an accelerator? I mean, are these children frozen? it can be good. Despite the low temperatures, everything was eaten and fed. Maybe not just me, even in a completely unbelievable fairy tale (no one, or a stupid snowman ever heard), if you pay attention to small things, bigger deals will be more acceptable. Oh, what prologue (1972) was involved with the rest of the film? And the revolver, which was hot enough to hold it, froze and did not fire. Give it a break. Yes, at least Carly Pope, there is another lovely lovely Canadian lass. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < / STRONG> If it were a snake (or rat) now, it would be a rodent, but it still looks like a chicken. One of the writers "tasted like this ..."
