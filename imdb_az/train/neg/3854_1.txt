Julia Stiles is a talented young actress with a great potential with a reputable agent. Undoubtedly, a person who directs him to this trafficking is not a person who cares for anything he cares about. I sat at the theater, which included young people who left a movie to find a movie that was wondering if this movie would appeal to anyone. It was poorly written, the casting director could only make the characters 1 or 2 minutes of effort, and the director obviously did not care about it.
