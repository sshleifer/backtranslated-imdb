What did the film do to show how a young girl struggles with poverty and how she grows up in adolescence? However, for most of us this subject has been sufficiently studied and, in many cases, more sophisticated than what has been implemented here. The films that I missed and lost interest were fixed on the tits. If it were on TV, I'd've been up to date on the Starr Report. I saw this movie as well.
