An absolute ridiculous version of the feature classic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ahab, who is in love with the priest's daughter Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is an opponent for Mrs. Bennett's effects. When Mr. Barrymore lost his leg in a whale crash, Bennett rejected him. <br /> <br /> In 1930 there were several scenes where the theater audience was excited; especially scenes that lost Barrymore's feet. But the movie is not old; There are numerous films dating back to the 1920s and talking about the 1930s. John Barrymore and Joan Bennett are not good at the two names. <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
