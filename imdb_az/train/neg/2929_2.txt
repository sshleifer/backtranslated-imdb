Not funny - how can anyone connect Monty to Python? It's totally funny - no laughs. It's not funny. Moreover, it was an ugly, strangely bizarre strangeness, and these people always had something to do with me. Unfortunately, it's not something funny. <br /> <br /> Any effort and so on. In fact there seems to be a laugh - or is it there? Hummm .... Since there is a loud smile that has a difficult question. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm doing this injustice - maybe some kind of workout. <br /> <br /> Some examples of art - in this case, something goes wrong, and never can. <br /> <br /> But these guys are playing loud voices, leaving nose noses. Come on! Not fun. <br /> <br /> Monty is an intellectual mind for Python and only a successor to Stephen Colbert and maybe John Stewart.
