Yes, there is another disappointment in my account. Two, in fact! First of all, I have never heard of Joseph Sarno, even though I did not think about knowing a little about the operation of more than 70 euros and his most successful participants. There is a man who works over seventy more treacherous and religious exploiters, and I have never seen anyone! How? Why? What happened here? Secondly, when you think that you have found a new source for even worse, just horrible movie movies, the director's most famous and supposed "masterpiece" comes out with a stupid and irritating film. Lesbone vampire movies, of course, create a sub-genre, but in a grueling atmosphere and magnificent sensitivity (like the "Girl of the Dark" in José Larraz "Vampyres" or Harry Kümmel's). Joseph Sarno's film is a bit dumped even slightly, with the exception of illegal nudity. The events take place five hundred years ago in a deep, hidden castle in the German mountains, where the baroness of evil and bloodthirsty (as if) were. His loyal disciples are thrown out naked dance parties at the catacombs at the castle, which is still burned with penis-shaped candles and approach the AUCH and want to revive the baroness quickly. Suddenly (even how to ask) the tower is full of young and sexy women, so there are more erotic rites. Tasty and funny sounds, but the "Devil's Toys" contain a large number of places where there is nothing, and the castle's ignorant facial expression simply does not drag! Sarno does not have the ability to create or build an atmosphere of Gothic (or maybe he did not worry) and the ability of actresses to stand in front of the camera and to lose a really sad one. Please give yourself a blessing: no matter how hopeless you are to see all the 70's old lesbian-vampire movies, this is not worth a penny! Even Jess Franco and Jean Rollin's repertoire are a cleaner art than this dude.
