I was excited for this movie after having full-fledged entertainment of Mr. Brosna's Panama Tailor (table 10/10: casting, acting, scripts, story, editing, speed, music, emotional impact, etc.). Excessive disappointment. "Panama Tiki≈üi" is a script that reads an unusual movie to bankrupt everything in a rich and satisfying way. Bid on the screen and the board. I'm waiting for the "good part" in the theater. never came. No laughed or cried, a line of dialogue smiled at me. $ 7? Very hard.
