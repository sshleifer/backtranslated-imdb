As an inspirational filmmaker, it was exciting to watch the movie taking into consideration the criticisms. Perhaps with a low end digital camera with a 35mm adapter for DOF. Corrective good-acting good sound effects are not higher than the top. Now I would give 7 for a movie, but the story is not that interesting. <br /> <strong> </ font> </ br> </ br> <br /> This film is a family with a dry field and this is.
