The story of the three girls who enter the desert of Connecticut and win a cluster of woods. It is a film that has been filmed for 30 years ago in the United States. In particular, the movie's budget is not something that works with mixed results. The film can be watched, but not all scary (which blurs some attack scenes). Probably the movie you forgot after finishing this job. Odds, I do not think to see this from the time you gave it to someone, and "look at me," I said, that's what's happening to me. Give it back when you give it a shot, but it is not worth the effort to see it even if the movie is being watched.
