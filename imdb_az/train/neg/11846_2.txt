After watching this movie, my local movie maker complained about the noise quality or the wrong sound of the movie sound system. At least for the first half of the movie, it's hard to understand what everyone is saying, because of the 20's music and noise scarcity. <br /> <br /> The subject of my complaint was an important part of the film's creation. The music and sound in the film have been distorted to create a very disturbing effect. These days, directors will go for a long time to make their own films unique. Unfortunately, the sound of the movie will be the same regardless of where and how it looks. <br /> <br /> So, the distortion of this movie's historical inaccuracies (you can find elsewhere for yourself) is a good reason to miss this movie. You will not only hear the soundtrack curve scenario and, of course, the cat's meowu.
