See the movie's website, more time has been spent on writing a movie. It could not have been more proud. Original story? Original? They need to find a compressed scenario between an old testament or a legitimate reflection of the beating. High-end special effects? Come on, with an Atari 7600 you can do a good thing and with a ear ear. Stylish cinematography? Yes, the funniest home video view of America is still classic. I'm sure that there was little money for this title, of course, sf is really good or a bit worse, now and then, or simply sad, but it's a story and money that spends time on this movie. 4 stories are similar to one another and are similar to each other and already finished.
