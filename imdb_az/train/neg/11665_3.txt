I liked the film very emotionally, intellectually and visually. <br /> <br /> Along with this, there is no violence, gender, or drug or special effects, and they do not need a bit of it, keep my eyes focused on words, stories and wisdom all the time. 1] It was difficult to hear and understand the dialogue of some foreign language emphases; [2] There is a great deal of unnecessary benefit to blaspheme (especially F-word, this is the only reason R is evaluated). [3] The film is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the sense of feeling you hold on to the last few minutes of the last film is unpleasant as a result of a long-lasting functional reaction to the loss of many characters and is a long time living in pain and depression. [4] I will not recommend this movie for a 5-second background, I did not add a little bit to the side that was applied to it, or the film just filmed me and filmed the whole movie, and after the film, watching the old WWII films, the mother of the descendants, "the hidden roots of the Germans." When it won the Nazi War, there would be no "local color" or art. Today, I do not know any other German, except radical skinheads who are thinking that the world would be a better place after the Second World War.
