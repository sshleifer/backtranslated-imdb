A very unwanted movie, so unimpressately, did not really care who's the best (or the purpose of the film, to talk to a few people in the cold-blooded New York City)? Not a comedy. The actor is a very flat and very predictable plot. It was a constant joke with quotes from these classic movies that I hate the most. Man, you can not see more quotes, how important is your movie? Try to be yourself original! A small budget is not an excuse, but the director for the first time. Crazy, unhappy, unhappy. Not surprisingly, it costs me a penny ...
