Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd could not save this film from putting an emu-sized egg. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Based on the classic Phil Silvers TV series caused a bomb: A) was updated in the 1990s and B) The simple structure of the array turned into a mixed, weak and stupid scenario. The original TV series uses a small cast of talented actors to describe your favorite characters that are simple but exciting hilarious ones. The film of the 1990s was anxious to extend this premise and shows it. No one would have been able to pay me enough to sit for the second time through this stinker.
