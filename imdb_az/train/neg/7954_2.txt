Okay, this movie is really "unique". Carrie Fisher was the most talented in the film despite having a coke problem in the film. but he said he could not remember most of them. well, but everyone has what? All this was a coke problem. I do not think that everything is bad, the apartment was good and there were some pretty funny moments. The part of the guy pushing his head was very fierce for my taste. oh well, I was disappointed to see Carrie Fisher so awesome and that this movie caused nothing for her.
