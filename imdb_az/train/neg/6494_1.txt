I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor and was very interested to see him as a writer / director. I can not be more disappointed than this. The film was very different and the cinematography was over to the point where it wanted to draw the wall. The actors were very good, but it was a loss of talent. All actors are not cut off as writers or directors, and frankly, Mr. Hopkins falls into this category. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my 50's. Please give Mrs. Hopkin's every blessing and remain committed to the perfect work and leave the writing and guidance to talented people in those areas. I can give this movie a rating less than once.
