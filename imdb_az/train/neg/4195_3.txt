Given the people involved, it's hard to see why this film is so shocked and bored. Writer, David Ward, wrote the movie The Sting two years later, and Jane Fonda just won the Oscar for Clute and Donald Sutherland had done a great job in films like "Clute" and "Kelly's Heroes". Indeed, the film is not a fairy tale with a small group talking about planning a great heist. At the same time, the movie wants to be a hip satire, NBC television is a series of comedy sketches of the kind that Saturday night "Saturday Night" will do well after two years. As a result, the composition is inadequate and compelling of the comedy bits, and the missing comedy bits destroy any loss that heist may have. <br /> <br /> For me, only real interest was watching Jane Fonda. His "Iris Caine" should be a light hearted version of his dramatic Bree Daniels prostitute in "Klute", but I do not believe him for a moment. Every time Jane Fonda treats us as a prostitute. His performance at Klute was terrible. It would be a good lesson for actors to bring together two films to show how great or tolerant the same actress might be in the same role. This shows that actors are just as good as a writer and a director.
