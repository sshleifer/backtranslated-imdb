Only Dolph Lundgren's film is in bad condition. I do not know if this story is a bad hole or a bad actor like Dolph. There are no spoiler here, it seems to be frustrating and arrogant in this film, and delaying touching and touching things. In my opinion, some of these projects find the collateral capital for life and theater.
