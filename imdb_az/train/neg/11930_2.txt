Because Angel Town wants a gang of street gangs involved in an iron fist and often for unknown reasons (mostly shameful writing), Martine wants to join her gang, so it's hard for her to beat her every day. But there is hope on the way because of being an Olympic kick-boxer (Jacques Olivier "The World's Lamest Actor" Gruner). Angel Town has become one of the most serious induction film ever filmed (I have seen my share), all of which have the necessary figure for the neighboring regions, and French kick-boxers can not move. The worst of all these are very unfounded moments, which is not really fun. The best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon, and it shows how funny it is. For Wit: "Do you love fighting? (Can Olivier take Asia's best friend) kill him? When I want his death, he dies! I fear that because I kill him, his son and his wife will kill me, <br /> <br /> Certainly, it is wrong to kill someone, of course, your best friend is no longer lazy. Odd. <br /> <br /> But do not allow me to dislike this movie that you hate, it's too far, and it's very valuable. The biggest laughs end in a catastrophic finale that Grunner (the biggest logical space in the film) sees the pockets come in with gang members. A Vietnamese veteran with a disability also helps Gruner hit the machine gun in the gang. <br /> <br /> All this is a memorable "Mexican" accent and surrealistic sound, such as cinematic trash, for fans. <br /> <br /> Another film is related to Olivier Gruner, who, despite the main reasons in these countries, can not attend the college, and does not love France with his girlfriend (in a difficult cemetery at the start of the film). Angel Town is undoubtedly a failure in all reasonable levels, but if you are laughing at the movies in moronic martial arts, which has no motion-free levels, which makes no sense at all levels, this is a perfect movie for you. On the other hand, make sure that you do not have "Mercy in the City of Angels", as details of the ridiculous opening song. <br /> <br /> 4- (Bad)
