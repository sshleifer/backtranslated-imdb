Generally a very disappointing picture. Very, very slow basic set up storyline. Maria Shreder's role in family's secret history. There is no rhythm in the film. *** APPEALS *** His mother, Ruth, rescued the Nazis by a German woman playing by Katya Riemann. The entire character of the shelf is such a sizeable, so stereotypical. *** CLAIMING *** The film is back and forth between today's 40s in New York, Berlin and Berlin. Please let viewers know exactly when the story will be done. Have you ever had an accurate indicator of time? very annoying. The worst part is the sound. *** APPEARS *** It is about Jews that a terrible punishment is waiting for a bureaucratic accident! Give me some time. Did the Jews leave Rosenstrasse? The one who freed the Jews never responded. Is Goebels Who Releases them? Lying with Goebels lay in Fischer? In Venice, the film won an award for K. Riemann, why? ?? I have no idea. Is it Jewish subject?
