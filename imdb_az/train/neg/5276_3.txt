No, this pumpkin coach, fairy cream and glass slippers are not about this tale, but if I had to prepare, I would not give you that I would not. But do not let this movie get better because it's not fantastic. This is one of the cheapest films ever to start with a cheerful tactic and an incredible story before cheating on the audience. <br /> <br /> Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mom and daughter. One is a successful plastic surgeon, and the second is your good, obedient and beautiful teenage girl. Their gloves are in their hands, so consider them as more siblings than parents. <br /> <br /> Hyun-So's colleagues, who worked with Yoon-hee, have begun blasting. <br /> <br /> Probably, this is a warning to the audience and Korean women who do not know when entering a knife are aware of the news. <br /> <br /> <strong> I thought that Kim Ki-duk's time really meant more when describing and describing what was happening during the operation itself. I admit that in the attempt to shock the audience with the tactics of standard fright, about two half, I admit that now and then came to me. However, the second half of the film led to an unfounded mumbo-jumbo melodramatics and dropped its thoughts down the throat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some things can not be logical, <br /> <br /> Along with the role of poor police, the existence of men has a disadvantage. But the story is not complaining about me, though the story has improved dramatically. I'm coming to watch it, but if you are a fan of a horrible Korean horror at VCD alone. Wait for these moments face to face!
