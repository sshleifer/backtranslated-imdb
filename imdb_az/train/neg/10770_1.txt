It's possible to contain spoilers (nothing in this movie is new or even surprises you) <br /> Why does Disney need to give up everything he has not missed? Of course, it is cheaper for them, but after a while it was not considered as general quality and people's thinking. House Of Villains is a cunning figure of cartoon transitions, which makes no sense in any sense. Here are some of the common metrics for previous films: Sounds are not even remotely matched and still bad (Since?!) I know that these films are directly directed to children, but all that is to enjoy Disney movies. Even the music numbers of the movie (Disney specialty has been for years) stunk. I do not even recommend this movie to many young people. All I can do is that if some of the same quality movies are released, some small animation studios are just a matter of time prior to Disney's overall quality.
