If this movie has a budget of 20 million, I would like to know where the money is. A monkey has created better CGI effects, and then spent 3 hours on this horrible trash, though I have to accept the machines and the Martians really were cool in the original play-station 1, and in early PC games no games ever since the mid 90's. What does it cost me? Pendragon films could have drawn a great movie in 1975-83 with good old fashion models and computer surveillance cameras, and in fact, what they did for the same things (or in the case of their destruction) was 20 million. This was probably the worst movie ever EVER! I'm expecting Istar to be re-elected 24 hours a day to watch this movie more. Completely hated! I'm going back. Unlike those who are planning on Plan 9 or Killer Tomatoes or other condemnation of Santa Claus, these are the worst movies you have in your heart, and you love them. There is no love for this movie, and there is no place in my DVD library. I sold a full boy. I'm betting on filming and other costs for shooting and crew. Regret about Pendragon movies! I want my money back!
