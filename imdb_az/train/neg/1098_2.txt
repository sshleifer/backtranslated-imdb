I bought this movie on $ 5,000 walmart. I do not advise you to take this action. <br /> <br /> So I do not want to talk about it. <br /> <br /> So if I knew how awesome it would be before this movie left it. It was a mistake to think that something would happen in this movie. There is a group of people going from one camp to another. <br /> <br /> My prowess about this movie: This film is slow and difficult, but for me it was very difficult, and the main character is trying to help people get out of Vietnam. Look at it. It was just one of the movies you put in and we wanted to turn it off, but just because you're dealing with a rope of hope that you can get to the end. It does not do that. After the movie ended up behind my T., I was angry about spending about two hours of my life and writing about it for 10 minutes.
