Wow, what can I say about this movie? This is a bad part of trouble. I'm so surprised that it was so high. What's in this movie? Here's a better question: What's wrong with this movie? <br /> <br /> The story itself is just one thing and is a clich√©. There are so many things to do ... Some nerdy children who do not have friends are chosen, killed, and come as a threat to revenge. All this is full of 86 minutes worthless movie. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste time watching it. Also, the latter is not the best, so it's not hard to watch ... I've dubbed this movie three times because I love the terrible clothes, not because it's a good thing. I think you take a picture.
