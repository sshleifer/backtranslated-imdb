In a film watching the actor, of course, it is played by an actor who fights, it does not have any benefit for Chris Klein. He struggles to bring something memorable to the role and meanders through a neat script that can be described as a moderate leading man. There is a story, but it's all about showing the start, middle, and last, and it does not seem to feel like the past, or even a third, of the viewer's shoulders. <br /> <br /> A bright light behind it, Fred Durst stands above mid-level stars with his appearance and sees Legde's reversing character as a worthy part of life. Will Fred be able to rebuild it when working with higher caliber processes, and I will not wait for him in the future.
