First, though I am not a specialist, you will be insulting your desires, even though the trial is being investigated. First, the prosecutor's office never actually proved that it "made learning easier". The prosecutor's office is also irresponsible (because they are entitled to appeal) and advocate not to act on it. According to another commentator, learning became easier. Secondly, Terry has used his personal interests as an interpreter and will even testify in a foolish test. If the court permitted him to give testimony in this way, they would bring neutral to another, on the contrary, they had filed an appeal. Thirdly, this child did not give specific questions about the suspect about the prosecution (birth date, details of the incident, etc.) and at the beginning did not answer when asked specific questions like defense. <br /> <br /> One of the events that took place at the start of the voting was noted that autism, but the trial is totally unbelievable.
