I love the low-budget independent films and have found great hopes for it. But this movie is static. Never forget the value of the production which is very generous for the budget, but the pacing is fatal. Of course, these people get very little, but the film does not reach the most basic level. This is boring. Editing is glacier and pacing stalls. It should be 65 minutes. The best thing about Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde, who is almost unrecognizable. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead, through endless and exhausting exposure, we must suffer through dithering in the Baltimore-Brits lizard. <br /> <br /> The noble efforts of everyone in the production, but in an obscure pants and a terrible new low-budget technology, an event that needs a hit would have to give it fresh. sound Instead, there is only a bare retread.
