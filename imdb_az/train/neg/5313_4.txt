The intergalactic criminal Kol (Ross Hagen) was sentenced to death and waiting for a spaceship for such a purpose. But tonight it will be a jailbreak, and the lever runs smoothly on the runaway runway and flies to the Earth (visible, close). There he met a group of "teenagers" (thirty-three) and a game player (John Phillip Law), helping him protect him from the worst nightmare ... ghost hunter and hangman android (or better "gynoid") Alienator. <br /> <br /> From the cap of the box I believed it would be a terrible movie. However, as it was terrible as it was, it was also a ton of fun (probably at least partly because I watched it with someone who is so awesome). Fred Olen Ray, who specializes in producing more than 100 low-level movies (especially the Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers), makes the best of it and only half makes an unreasonable impression and special effects on us. Bonus: P.J. Soles (looks like "Tara"), of course, at the bottom of his career. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there are field holes. Why California has hillbilly rednecks (allegedly if I understand the fraud properly, I'm Los Angeles County). What is the cosmic woman's sticky blouse? Why is there a subplode in which this story tries to strengthen the captain's captain without entering anywhere? What is "Quadrant 5"? Chicken wire creates a short term electromagnetic field for an Android, but does the ground mines actually do nothing? Why Charming Kolkhoz, Emphysized Local American Footballer? And the Lund boy (Robert Clarke) ... is there a point in his character? Is there a point in the game where the captain plays? Is this movie a point? But the biggest mystery is the android (or gynoid) stranger played by Teagan Clive. What is "flammable"? Why does Blade Runner look like Daryl Hannah, just bigger? Because if something is a cyborg, it is part of the human. But if you have an Android, all the machines. It was an Android, so there was no reason to look at people. It looked like something. Nevertheless, the designer made the measure of a linear hammer with a leotard showing David Bowie's hair and a little more to me. If you want to make a woman android, is it not for her to be attractive and punish her enemies? The mission was not fulfilled. They say that beauty is in all kinds and sizes, but I think it is a very big exception. <br /> <br /> If Mystery Science Theater 3000 is around today, this movie will be a very short movie list <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> Maybe a story is not much and maybe the characters are really not very interesting. And perhaps the scene with the deer is an incredible favorite for no particular reason - what is a killer robot with a deer? But generally I liked the movie. I will not go to my friends or will not miss my local video store to get the latest DVD (I'm sure it's packed with incredible features). But I think that this film has spent a lot of time and that in the future similar exhibitions are waiting.
