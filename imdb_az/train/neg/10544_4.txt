When this scary movie comes to you in childhood memory; Touch and repeat it. <br /> <br /> "First Power" I say is not a very good movie. This is a very bad script with holes in which a cop full of cop clich√©s and a truck (along with a number of favorable "twists" that help throughout the story). Lou Diamond Phillips is found to have the power to have a bad guy serial killer Kober go to the gas chamber, who knows only the devil himself, and now has the power to think of anyone who has the power of resurrection. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Garabagh" However, She was afraid of me as a child and the homeless man is still very good. As for any logic here; Remember, just about every screenplay is thrown out for a good measure and ends with a cross between a Steven Segal moving flick and 70's devil flick. Anyone on the ground here is a good idea to quit Lou Diamond Phillips? Of course, she is not convincing, but she does everything she can and I have not seen any problems here. When it came to mentality with Tracy Griffith, it was not better. But Kober is pretty good as a killer; <br /> <br /> The First Power may be a doctor's order and a "brain-down" after a difficult day's work. Beer is likely to increase the viewing experience and I will have loads next time to spin this movie. All this; not a good flick, but a bit of guilty pleasure for nostalgia fans, as easily as children are afraid. "Look around, friendly boy"!
