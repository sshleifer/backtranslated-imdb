This movie is an example of the curse of the East Asian cinema: two or more separate stories for a movie. Other reviewers also have a few notes about the "first part" and "second part." How can you have a character development or a deeper field when the hero and story are displayed in such a short time? The first part was lost until it stopped (as it turned out to be only the middle of the story) until it stops, and was replaced by a legend with a completely unbelievable second part, a girl who wipes and cleanses a child's apartment (woe!) I look forward to being given a decent script to work with Wong Kar Wai!
