This is typical "perfect crime" thriller. A perfect crime is executed and a police investigator immediately knows who is guilty without seeing all the tips. The audience should wait for the whole film to avoid being held guilty. The result is like an episode like "Columbo" or "murder". The author himself is referring to a hackney story, showing a police officer watching the Matlock episode! This story only fills up to 90 minutes, but the director insists on using all 120 minutes to fill each book with the book. Skip one, do not lose anything.
