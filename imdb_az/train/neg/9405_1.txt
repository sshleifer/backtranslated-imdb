I watched it on television and I can say but this is the worst movie I have ever seen! I am ashamed to be ashamed of Melbourne, where the film is being prepared. Diabolical action, amateur makeup effects and a really bad soundtrack. When it comes to the field, it's better to be fooled! Some of the scenes surprised me about how bad it was. There is one reason why they have been filming this type of night-time television - they're completely trash! Avoid all costs.
