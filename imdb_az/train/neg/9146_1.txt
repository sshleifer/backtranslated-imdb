Sam Mrovovich should not be allowed to touch a camera again. When he does, he should be imprisoned for at least a small theft. Anyone who grants any of the trash for a lease must report and be compensated. This is my "job" was my first neglect ... and it will be my last. Ed Wood may now look very nice to me. <br /> <br /> I ask you to remove this piece of paper from the shelf when returning it to the video store. She is an active supporter of gay movies, an interesting expression on the back side used by my angered, extremely insignificant person to allow a child to spread and pack that kind of thing and to burn a frustrated guy (Jamie Brett Gabel IMDb) and then "movie" rental. Trust me, there is nowhere in the place; in a sense, is not just a movie. Such a sensitive, irresponsible junk may harm the efforts made to encourage and support only gay movies (hell, gays often!). You will be disappointed by those who lease it on the cover. Gabel does not respect the cover on the cover and appears without a shirt once or twice. Instead, the ugly Mroavic gives us the nastyness of her disgusting, blurry dough guy. <br /> <br /> He "gathered" this "thing" is a reversal project for Mroovich. Both Michael himself and his wife Michael Habousch (I understand that a similar sleazy throws garbage) is terrible in this case. Mravovich identifies any "damaged" as a hopeless complete talent (in every field) for himself. He is miserable.
