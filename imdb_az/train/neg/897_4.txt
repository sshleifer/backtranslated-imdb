Steve Gordon, Henry Winkler, two years before writing and directing "Arthur", made a small hit for the Scenario for a comedy car for the TV's "The Fonz". The college (and all others), who studied in the 1950s, works together on the horizon without any jobs; to become the end of the world, becomes a ridiculous world, and eventually becomes a "gorgeous George". Perhaps it was then an interesting idea to turn the unique Winkler into immorality (and it's a sure way to separate her from the television alter), but the jokes and situations are often wrong, and almost instantly directed by Carl By Reiner. Particularly, it is a signal related to Herv√© Villechaize ("Fantasy Island"), which acts on Polly Holliday ("Alice" from Flo). As Henry likes, Kim Darby looks a bit out of his element - especially when it is covered with all these television sheets - to show the romantic aspect of the novel unreasonably. * From 1/2
