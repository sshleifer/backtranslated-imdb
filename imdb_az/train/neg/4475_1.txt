terrible, just terrible! my old room used to watch these garbage and made me mad. the book is a shame that I do not really know what to do in order to draw my first impressions of my favorites and some of them. they are very difficult to recognize that has changed much. It baffles me because the book reads as a soap opera, which provides enough food for a modern day's entertainment. it's based on a "real story", but it's like a completely fictional life movie. The book does not have emotion and depth, just a foolish melodrama. If you are a middle school student looking for a way to get out, I suggest trying out another version.
