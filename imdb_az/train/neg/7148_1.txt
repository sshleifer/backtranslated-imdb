Before watching this movie, there were very few expectations and just went to see the cars. Ultimately, I regretted for such a reason. The soil is almost non-existent. Character development is void. There was only a few clich√©s in the film and many jaws leaked cheesiness that just wondered how to look at me and even free. For Exotics, I did not rate this movie for 1 degree. The attempt on a continuous story line was destroyed by the complete absurdity of the ridiculous symbols of this elite race culture and members. In fact, the film is a very long and simple idea that an average child can tell the majority of stories. <br /> <br /> Do not see him. Instead of playing Gran Turismo HD, you can endure thirst for a fast sexual car without leaving a bad meal.
