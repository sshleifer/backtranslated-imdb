Cowgirl girls were blues surprised if this was a movie to go. I was expecting something better than Uma Thurman. This, in the first place, has fallen into my head because of this experience. Just like the quality of evolution, it's a terrifying movie. These assessments are a shame that we can not give from 10 to 0. This movie is worth it.
