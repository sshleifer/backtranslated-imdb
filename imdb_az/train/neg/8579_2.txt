I'm afraid it's pretty scary, despite some good performance and overall camera performance for an authorized actor. Writer is the first and last attempt by Soo Lew. "Rub and Tug" (2002) is one of the unsuccessful products of the Canadian home-made filmmaking program. While promoting valuable efforts like the New Waterford Girl, the program opens the door to the colonists, like Lew, who does not have to embody this project, but does not properly inspect its script or credentials. <br /> <br /> You do not care about the low budget, because obsolete production design, bad lighting, poor audio and terrifying texture selection are appropriate; Canadian massage parlors. But dialogue and planning do nothing to work with actors; on the contrary, it is a challenge to any psychologist, except for ceasing to blame many editors or an audience. When your story is simple, the last thing you need is a mix of storytelling; If it's nothing, watching the movie is difficult and impossible to review. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The performance of Don McKel, Lindy Booth's Lea is her standard quirky weatherhead; As always, it is unpleasant, but it is a bit different. Kira Clavell's Cindy is an unpleasant surprise, some sort of Asian Shelley Duval. Tara Spencer-Nairn's street teacher Betty, the other role of any outcome, is more than just canceling her excellent performance at New Waterford Girl. His shallow performance in his "RUB and Tug" should reduce any tendency to look for other films he has emerged; When Waterford director Alan Moyle needs no further confirmation of his ability to work with young actors. <br /> <br /> You quickly realize that Lyu's reptile brain does not understand concepts like plot complexity, so it's hard to add lazy and bare deus ex machina to the end. It may still be worse, the needless story has so little internal logic, so it's probably not a painful end, as it is normal. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a kid.
