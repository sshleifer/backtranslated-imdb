Just enough for Judy Garland lovers. There really are two (2) pieces - it's one place with an old cleaner lady (it's all pics you've seen) and ultimately a very good number. There are several scenes where the difficulties are funny. But, basically, the script is too bad, and it's hardly a movie to be afraid of such a long time. But the rent of the movie is worth 2.50 - just get ready for the fast moving.
