This was WORST movie I've ever seen! Molly (Molly Hall) ALL can not move! She had no feeling she was blah blah blah as she read an angry book. A smart child and a child who likes to eat (it was not worth remembering names) was so boring that I was crazy. When it was talked about, it was about some science or food. Mollys did not feel enough about Dad's daughter. Police officer and Mollys father said the same thing four times. it was just terrible. Everything has been repeated for many things. Beatrice was so important that something should be bad for her. When I watched this movie, I just wasted my life!
