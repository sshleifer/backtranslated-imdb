I do not understand your whole movie about this movie. Okay, if you want a cheap splatter, you'll like this movie, but if you love good stories and good actors - watch it. Personally, I really do not like actors in this movie, they seem to have been rented out of the street. Dialogs are completely straightforward, and you always know what's going on in the future. The overall quality of this movie is the lack of a very low budget. When we saw this movie (with me and 3 people), the film was designed with the least effort - some people who needed to do it just to read at the movie school. Another problem that actually reduces all experience is a bad camera (very shaky) and bad sound, and the entire film is restored with a microphone.
