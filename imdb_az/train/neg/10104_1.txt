I just watched the first 30 minutes of it and it was a common part of what I saw. The scenes I saw were as bad as the Ed Wood movie. No, it was a hundred times WORSE. Ed Wood has the reputation of becoming the worst director, but that's not true; <br /> <br /> American police have German accents! The hanging on the wall of the "Police Station" was a desk with a "Police Station" sign. <br /> <br /> Women are attracted to this police, cuffed them and take them to a warehouse. He tells the police officer waiting in the car. Then the duffel comes out of the warehouse carrying bags. The police partner maybe think something is wrong, he thinks his partner may be a bad cop that kills these women, but he is not sure if he is - because he's a moron! The dialogue is totally stupid, the player is strange, and the characters are the most stupid of what I see on the screen. He told the police officer that he had illegally kidnapped these women and slapped them into a barn, and that there was a body full of duffel bags inside, but the partner there did not know what was happening! <br /> <br /> The director of this movie is a total hack. I stopped the movie for 30 minutes because it could not get it anymore. It should be one of the WORST movies I've ever started and I will not waste time writing this review. <br /> <br /> Absolutely WORTHLESS.
