Sorry, this movie has great hopes. Unfortunately, it was too long, too gentle and too weak to draw my attention. The whole film felt I was deceived when I really understood an old man who was asleep. <br /> <br /> So you do not buy a big drink or go to the rest room. My children could not do that. Oh good.
