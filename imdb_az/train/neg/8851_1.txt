I have always been a bit upset to Joe Dante's original The HOWLING (1981) work. so I'm not interested in checking the durability of any one; had HOWLING III: MARSUPIALS (1987) some time ago? is this one by the same director? <br /> <br /> In some cases, a few days ago, a few days before Christopher Lee, a dear, but terribly horrific, horrified horror, in the midst of all this (a charming old star, claiming several times in dispute did not appear in his frightened tariff on the latest picture for Hammer Films in 1976!). Anyway, should this movie have taken the subheading "Your movie Turd"? In all departments (starting with all the important werewolf makeup), incredibly complicated! <br /> <br /> The back (and dialogue) is not only terrible, but has a closest connection with Dante's film? It is strange that the author of the original novel Gary Brandner wrote this article! One of the main moments of the film is the elliptical editorial? tries to give a look of the entire style, but it is a shameful factor to emphasize! Hockey crossings between the phonetic (and entertaining) scenes in the same way, the punk-rock theme songs that believe and cheap jack special effects on low Tuesday! <br /> <br /> So, what does he say about the characters ?: Lee, of course, is a wizard expert who thinks everyone is a crackpot? that is, until you contact the monsters; at least, though, the inventors (or goats) of the developers should be amazed at making a foolish subtitle with a double meaning! By the way, Sybil Danning (Stirba, Werewolf Bitch, this UK subtitles) produces a vast range of ugly S & M outfits ... but his character almost does not give anything (surprising and occasionally hilarious, three-way attracts to the lanistrop genus!); <br /> <strong> <strong> Help Lie Lee's good, is the two yuppie heroes (Dee Wallace's first brother's brother) and his colleagues) and A transplant guerilla-type group of Transilvids (still very poorly denied by many Danish shadows!). Among them is a knife-shooter rally, which is particularly bad (but also, side-by-side) death; and then under Stirba's control, Lee became a trap (drawing insults on the child in the streets) to make him attractive. The last scene should be a rare career for a prominent and respected actor? good or in this or the early sequence, Lee's look-out among the party's youth at a disco where he prepares to prepare a pair of ultra-cool sun glasses! <br /> <br /> In the end, it is likely that the ossuary set (the hero's sacrifice) is known to remind those elements which are absolutely unpleasant, or to hate the hybrid worms / body (Danning's "survivors" body) very strange ...
