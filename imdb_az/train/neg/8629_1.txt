Dear Richard, I know that we all love Tim Allen's love for home improvement. But seriously, there is nothing but fraudulent continuity with Air Bud? I would have thought Tim could really be a little role now or even become his personal assistant. <br /> <br /> Everyone sees you around Tim and immediately thinks of "Tool Time". Even more often you will play Bob Vila. Instead, it looks 10 minutes by smiling with the Golden Retriever. I do not know if there were many scripts, but you can add them. So come. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> The original was better. <br /> <br /> And you, Mr. Richard Carn, know that more than anyone else. <br /> <br /> This is the "F" movie.
