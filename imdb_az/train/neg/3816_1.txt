Very bad behavior. Incorrect event lines. Wrong characters. You should not see this show. SUBMITTED. Otherwise, you lie for the next 30 minutes. Never had to be broadcast. This is not good. You have never seen this. Never ever. Now, if you want to watch this show, please. Return to CW for Smallville. Disney Channel for Hannah Montana, Nick for Waverly Place Wizards or Drake & Josh, Better family shows. Believe me, I've watched it before. And, honestly, I say honestly, I've seen the worst show I've seen and many television. Give me a blessing and never see this show.
