Despite the seriousness of the book, the book was still delivered to Japan. It is difficult to believe that everyone involved in filming has gone to Japan because he does not feel Japan. Almost everything was terrible about this. I admit that the actors were generally very good, but they did not have a chance to rescue him. Before starting the film, I was surprised that there were only ten people on Friday night, just before the movie was opened in Japan. I was amazed when they stayed for 30 minutes. I will be entitled to criticize it. The whole movie broke my adhesion and the Japanese girl laughed at my wife. Everyone who came out of the movie appeared confused and disappointed. <br /> <br /> For the creators of this movie, you owe me two hours.
