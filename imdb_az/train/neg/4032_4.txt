I did not hear about it before leaving for cable television. The tense 50's has a lot of science-fiction features: it's sober, smashing, and a little paranoid! Although typically viewed as a couple of romantic couples, the film is presented in many documentary styles - perhaps a cheap way of surprise for many exposures, and possibly in the form of human beings. Yes, what is an extremely low-budget enterprise? [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964]), and in short, he is not interested in a single-minded approach of the movie (later used apocalypse-through-renegade-missile angle, with a larger aplomb, and DR STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL-SAFE [1964], leads to a good laughter with a delicate laugh - especially in scenes covering a bunch of conspirators who are close to birth and negligent adulthood!
