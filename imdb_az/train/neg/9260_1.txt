This is the only thing that horrified the film, which was not scared. I put it on my finger with a glittering nail rather than sitting again. Even for a television movie. The cast is boring. The scenario is as exciting as a sandbox. How the combination of two directors to create such a film will remain one of the great secrets of the 20th century. Although it deserves to be included in omen franchise, there is only one scene and slo-mo and shortened during the expected maturity. If you have to see it, turn it on, set your alarm clock 90 minutes and be comfortable. We will instantly salvage with any failure and worry after awakening. That is, this movie.
