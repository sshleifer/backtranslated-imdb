Sorry, this is just a cheap TV product. I saw a lot of promotional material and waited for a job movie like Stormriders - what I was offering was a low-budget movie like "XENA" or "Hercules" on television. No Atmosphere, Very Difficult, More Fight-Scenes. Some good ideas - not much more. <br /> <br /> My ASIAN tips: "MUSA - THE WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS", "INTERVIEW" "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS" <br /> <br /> I apologize for my bad English language!
