This is the "House of Exorcism", but most people explain this movie with the "Mario and Lisa and the Devil," a ridiculously high rating for this, by Exorcism House. It was a very important achievement when it was shown at the Lisa and Satan movie festivals in the early 70's. The audience responded well to this wonderful, gothic horror movie. Unfortunately, it was a bit pre-populated and not considered commercial enough for mass consumption, it was considered unusual. No distributor could buy it. Thus, producer Alfredo Leone, about half of the original film, decided to make a chained "Lisa" by adding new scenes that he took two years after the original product! It is important to note that Bava has little to do with these new, ugly additions, so it is technically not the "Exorcism House" movie. The original product is a slow, sleepless, classic production. Just a few minutes before the movie, the viewer escapes from the world of sleep because suddenly Lisa begins to write down, noisy sounds and touches on some epithels like "my co @ water" and so on. To the water, huh? The film resembles a backdrop of progression, spinning through a beautiful, visual film and a class of "Z-exorist". Leone tried to combine these shocking scenes, and a story kept an unprecedented look. He failed in a difficult way. When choosing mainly to destroy "Lisa and Satan," Bawa refused, saying that she was very good to cut her movie. He was right, and it was very sad that he had destroyed all the work of the artist and washed his toilet. Many years ago, the original "Lisa and the Devil" appeared again on the nightly night television again. I've seen Lisa long ago before seeing this new version and worried about one of my favorite films being "vandalized" in this way. We should only see it with interest. Otherwise, avoid this wild disaster.
