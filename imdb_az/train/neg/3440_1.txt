I can never watch this movie ... it's the biggest mass that I've ever encountered in my life. and something that says something. actors, stories and shooting movies were totally strange, this is THE BEST MOVIE OF THE WORLD! In spite of the serious sources, my 99p is spent on sainsburys and only in 2005? hahaha this movie is a cheap college movie, even if you can see the camera in the corner of the screen .... though u really need to watch watch "fear shade scene" ... Probably the best player I've ever seen in my life ... ha ha. I say seriously this is 2 1/2 hours of greatest damage!
