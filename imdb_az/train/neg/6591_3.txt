Caucasian Caucasian Caucasian For over thirty years, small things, despite the death of the stars, "all the new adventures of Laurel and Hardy" . Small things like this. <br /> <br /> It was said that a few days ago, probably, it could have worked. Try to capture two players for double-employer employers, for a really bad idea. <br /> <br /> Brendon Pinchot can be funny. All right, forget your nickname "Cousin Larry" from the Stupid Foreigner, see him at True Romance. Although it is wrong. Probably not all sin, and as director and support - better than all materials - probably desperate for money. There are those who argue that Americans have difficulty driving influential English accents. That's why Pinchot does not help here. What is Stan? Welsh? Iranians? Pakistanis? Yelp is just Stan's trademark, though, he is approaching, though, yelp is nothing to write home about, overdone in tedium terms. Gailard Sartain is a bit better in the United States, though it's as bad as it is in a hogworm or groom's arrogance? <br /> <br /> Remember the originals with split-second time, intuitive teamwork and childbirth? Well, not entirely, it was replaced by two stupid men and legends that you can park a bus in the hollows. There are some schemes that can be summarized in several panels, but it's some long-lasting Mummy Hockey (and what a bad hood!) That is involved with the boys' fraternity scenario. <br /> <br /> <strong> I will not be able to claim that we are looking at 108 movies of Laurel and Hardy, but I think it's a dangerous price. the original ones were playing or at least using their vectors. At least the nature and violence are felt on the contrary, unlike the Pinchot and Sartain cartoons. And when did Stan have malapropisms and how much? "I will give you a permanent cremation"; "I would like to close my wife." Stop! <br /> <br /> The only remarkable moment is the cartoon character Bozy Clown sharing Larry Harmon's L & H comics. Harmon, of course, received the copyright of his name (the dissatisfaction with a Â® after Laurel and Hardy) and the co-producer and producer of that transit. <br /> <br /> There are many questions. Stan and US will be fart gags if they are alive today? Did they break their bottles with glasses? Stan is swollen in sex organs with a spear and has a great CGI-finale end? <br /> <br /> Once I laughed, but I think it does not believe how terrible it is. Why did this film be made in the first place? Do the manufacturers think who wants it? The worst movie I've ever seen is, maybe the absolute hate that I've been forced to wait for the first five minutes. Red-hot poker and mosquito trees are very entertaining when you are forced into your back passage.
