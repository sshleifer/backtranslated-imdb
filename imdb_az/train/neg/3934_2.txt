It looked at the film and saw the performance of these great actors. But I was sorry for the whole story and the whole story. David Duchovny (Dr Eugene Sands), Connie & Carla, 04, became a story doctor using a drug and drug license. Dr. Sands visited a nightclub and could benefit from a medical experience to help a wounded customer and Angelina Jolie (Claire), "Get Life", 04, He was a helper to David Sands. Timothy Hutton (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", 04, Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hutton expects to act in the majority of scenes and completely breaks his thinking to kill his network members. Gary Dourdan (Yates), CSI-Vegas TV Series, plays a great supporting role and describes the real COOL DUDE, the so-called bodyguard for Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with ruby ​​red lips, which draws more attention from all men. This movie is not the biggest, but it's fun.
