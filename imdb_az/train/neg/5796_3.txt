I saw these features as part of the New York Film Festival and I was afraid of graphics, sado-masochistic, and child pornography. The story line is hidden behind many graphic sex scenes - and is a little less erotic - a feeling more of the patient. The director was shocking when he examined why these characters were so different. Look at your stomach - there are still flashbacks.
