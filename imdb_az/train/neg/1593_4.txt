Hidayat Gosha's 1969 Hitocrine film (manslayer, aka Tenchu ​​- paradise) is a true historical figure (in the "Western" names): Ryoma Sakamoto, Hampeita Takechi, Shimbei Tanaka, Izo Okada, ____ Anenococci. A historic period, Hitokiri, is a group consisting of four swords, who carried out numerous murders in the Tokugawa Shogunate, in the mid-1800's, by the command of "Loyal" leader Takechi. (ie the ultra-nationalist emperor-emperor) is the fringe of the tribe of Tosa. What was this fight? Just say, you will not find it in this movie. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Gosha is more interested in showing you the inner suffering of Izo Okada than bloody diligence and immersion and (very far away) the most profitable murderer. More than just the emergence of true history. Sakamoto, for example, had the historical significance of being considered the father of the Emperor Japanese Fleet. The closest Gosha, the historian, came to teach, and Sakyatoto, who betrayed Takechi for a good cause, came to Takechy's home to try to get him to the ideology. It begins with talking about an international political situation, a Japanese warship, and a warlike Japanese to protect foreign fight ships. Want more info? Sorry. Gosha is an intermediate level sentence (!) That is potentially frustrating. Almost to inform viewers about a turning point in Japanese history. <br /> <br /> The film has confused me about the goals of both parties in this fight. The Shogunat was an organization that protected the feudal relationships of society in order to prevent social change for two and a half centuries in central Japan. He was afraid of ideological and technological contamination. In keeping with this spirit, he warned that firearms, "correctional" tools in Europe and America, could reach a peasant from a samurai. In this period, the Emperor is nothing but a moral candidate. <br /> <br /> The French name in Europe, the class known as the bourgeoisie, was developing the class of new merchants, homeowners and artisans in feudal fiefdoms. Of course, as this new class gained strength, it resisted many restrictions on the feudal society. As in Europe, the king (Emperor) is central to the bourgeoisie's struggle against the feudal aristocracy. But political leadership does not fully understand the interests of the class that it serves. When the foreign world came under attack in the form of US Admiral Perry's "Black Ships" in 1853, the ruling elite of Japan was crushed. Their armies have not been adapted for these aliens. They also heard reports of Chinese and British imperialists treachery in China. What to do to get rid of the fate of Japan's poor neighbor? Surprisingly, usually some of the isolated Shogunat elements are forced to engage with foreigners to gain advanced technology. This is the point expressed by Sakamoto in the movie (only with difficulty). On the other hand, emperor-loyal ultra-nationalists, by Takechi, could force the foreigners to abandon the other factions "to sell the country." <br /> <br /> For me, Teyy's motivation was the biggest puzzle for me. Gosha basically struggles for personal progress, not because of loyalty. Can we get the tenor of those who are loyal to this union? (Are you paying attention?) <br /> <br /> Several reviewers compared this movie to Goyokin in the same year. However, "Goyokin" is confusing, sturdy, adventurous yarn, Hitokiri, a hero of happiness, is not attractive anywhere, and there is no such hero. Sakamoto could be the hero of this film, but we are not allowed to recognize him - or why he is just enough to achieve this. <br /> <br /> Taking into account his beautiful scores for the previous five Kurosawa films, Masaru Sato's account has been very disappointing, as it has been denied by the "Bonanza" episode. <br /> <br /> Barry Freed
