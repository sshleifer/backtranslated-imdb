The original show was very good. They should leave a good note. This movie killed all ideas. It was boring, too-dramatic, and the funny parts were too far away to split. It was like trying hard to get really serious, and it was not necessarily what I did not want later in the future. For a long time, it's not something about a recurring thing. I'm sorry, Tyler Perry, but try to do more next time. This movie is not just boring, and it's not funny. Sorry. <br /> <br /> <strong>
