This movie has never been. Out of the weak animation, bad behavior. The people behind this movie are "Ok, it looks good!" They say. I was scared how real this movie would be. At one point where it might be the best point, a computer that creates a golden Saber Dent falls from the roof that stabs the creator of the cats in his mouth ... uh, ooookkkk. The murder of a film was a sabbatical killed several minutes after his first appearance. The other two are trying to kill several people before being killed and burned. Then there is something random, waiting for the sacrifices in the forest, for fear of a single reason. Is there a second one? <br /> <br /> This film was a clean garbage. From energy point to end slide shows come from.
