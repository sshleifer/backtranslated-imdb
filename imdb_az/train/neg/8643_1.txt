Blair Witch-War Movie as Bwitch is a disaster! The title tells you all this, get rid of your money and time, and spend a good movie like "Once upon a time in the United States", "Shovqus Abduction" or "The enemy on the doors" film "War"). <br /> <br /> If this film was a baseball team and major leagues, it was the summit and the Substitute A, then this was Lisey's ball. It was a secondary school drama club with their father's old camera. Of course, they went on an enemy territory (to make a movie), but I'm not brave enough to say that this is obviously a fool! This is all the way! Now look and then tell me what you think.
