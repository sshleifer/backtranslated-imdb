I do not know who came to the idea of ​​killing and destroying people for the killing or revenge of Orcas, but my God is absurd. Orcas is most definitely a cold-blooded killer, but this film brings them out ... it's ridiculous. Orcas is extremely clever, do not mislead me, but I doubt you know and understand an understanding like revenge. That is, I have to say that it's a fun thing to do with everything I've come up with. So I enjoyed at least a bit. Personally, if you are interested in seeing the type of human film that killed an animal, Jaws recommends going and seeing. But if you are my chemist and laugh at something so realistic, then go ahead. : D
