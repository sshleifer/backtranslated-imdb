What has Ireland done to distributors for trying to represent the country in such a hard way? This film begins as a primer for filmmakers in the Irish filmmaker: untold priests, spitting before the city, city square catfish, bicycle in the background of national anodyne folk music. It soon becomes clear that the main theme of the film is the great Daddy-O-religious catastrophe of Irish Klichesin. It links with a protesting woman who wants to decide where a Catholic father is studying. It may seem just a little foolish, though it is not for the Wexford villagers where he lived. Instead of sending them to a Catholic school, he decides to return to Belfast, then to Scotland, where a few more clicks have been made. If he is there, his father (like Ericly George Lucas) and the boy's boycott of the family's home are very bad. People should see this movie, because this will not be the last, but not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is central: we welcome it, but we urge you to find a way to life. Villagers are presented as the ones to stop prejudices, but traumatization of your children is a way to go about it. Additionally, it draws on the burden of falling slightly when the current Northern Ireland peace process is trying to draw: the woman has to "set preconditions" for her return by her lawyer. It is claimed that the film is based on a real story, but in the past, the topics were more imaginative and less appealing to hackneyed clicks.
