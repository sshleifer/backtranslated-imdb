To see empathy with the painful and completely battling characters. Two of the main characters, Mother Cynthia and her well-known daughter, Monika, have been dragging the big part of the movie in a drunken way. Their heroes are firmly established that it is unbelievable that sooner or later they will be put on the unbearable personality. It was not worth the wait. I wish a decent tendency for honesty among the families, less than headaches.
