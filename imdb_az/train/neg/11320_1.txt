someone who needed a car to pay ... this is really horrible ... jean Claude's kiborg looks windy ... it's an hour that I can claim to be back ... fortunately severe somnolence ... I fell asleep. How can these caliber actors create this dog? I would spend more time watching plant moss on the edge of the fish tank than this totally horrible mix of several species. Now I use the DVD as a coaster on my desk. Walmart's $ 5.99 is a lot to spend on this movie ... If you really have it, you'll wait and sell them for a few years after inventing them. <br /> <br /> For the love of God let this movie die from darkness.
