I'm looking forward to a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow. However, this dud seemed to last forever. Not suitable for children using the PG-13 sad placement. These jokes are not just low eyebrows or f-jokes, but the boundaries of raw, dignity, and boundaries are beyond just bad taste, but go beyond legal and moral morals. It seems that many scenes appear to get PG-13 rating ... very bad ... when it's funny, R-rated could have created a bigger splash. (Tension? Do not recommend this movie, it's a complete loss ... and I'm ready to give you a movie from my darling and a shot, and in 45 minutes she liked to release the movie ... and the guy was so ready. it will not save the rest of the tenant / tourist traps 1/2 stars (my darling my beloved boy ... he was ill to pay heavy dolphins for this trip)
