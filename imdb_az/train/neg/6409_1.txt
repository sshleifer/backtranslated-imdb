I saw this movie yesterday ... I do not believe in the analysis on this site. Those who give over a star should be Buffy fanatics. Yes, I'm a buffy fan first, but when I see it, I know the trouble. At each level this movie is scary. Technically, wherever you are in a movie, even when you do not know where you are in a scene, it sounds like crazy for no reason. There is no logic in terms of kinematics. Emotionally, attempts to make a terrible and psychological tension for heartache are confusing. Shooting your bad-looking red necks in your movie is an inexpensive tool to deliver the "atmosphere". Before the last move, I ran for a long time, but I was very happy to make MST3K riffs with my friends. After departing from Buffy, SMG passed two successful films if she had included the Scooby Doo in your resume. Gellar is a beautiful actress, but she (or agent) will not find a car for her. And Mr. Shepard, if you have a problem with paying a mortgage, you promise that you will not appear in such a movie again, and I'll send you some dollars! (Also, Patsy Cline's property must file a lawsuit for defamation!)
