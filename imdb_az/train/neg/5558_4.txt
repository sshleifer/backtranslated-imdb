I did not spend much time here, but I just wanted to say that Darkman 3 is awesome. There are 3 DVDs on DVD, added them to the collection of DVD movie collections. Darkman, Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die Hard, with the best of them. There is no great fear or tension there. Many thanks to all the crew and set us to give the Darkman trilogy. By the way, you're wondering how I came across the DVD. I bought the Internet, but you know 4 of the region, most US DVD players are region 1. If you own a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player ever since the whole region player. Just select the witch area you want to go to set up (1-9).
