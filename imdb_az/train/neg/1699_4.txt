I became an admirer of Lynche's work, so I was thrilled when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very down. This is a series of animated films trying to show some kind of disgusting and disgusting humor. The animation is very simple, using Macromedia is undeniable. Each cartoon has a big fat boy who beat his family and acts as a madman to everyone he knows. <br /> <br /> Animation is likely to be a little regrettable for people who are not familiar with this vessel. However, if you spend a lot of time at Newgrounds.com, these cartoons will not be anything different from what you've seen before. Many Newgrounds have a lot of famous amateur artists doing better than this DVD. If Lynch presented this job to his website, he improved some of the Newgrounds artists. But as I see on this DVD, instead of Newgrounds, instead of 7/10, it's 4/10. These cartoons fit the internet, but I expected a better quality with a name, story, and animation such as David Lynch.
