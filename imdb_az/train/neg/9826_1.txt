I think it would be a great movie for an organized Christian, but it is a foolishness for everyone who believes in free will, rational thinking, and the division of the Church and State and the UNESCO Scientific Word! <br /> <br /> There are some well-known actors, or those who need work or who have their personal thoughts to share with others. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it the same way the movie was enjoyed by Reefer Madness. This film has attempted to teach medicine education with fear tactics, and in the same way the film tries to teach hell and danger to good people who do not share the "Christian" principles of our world. <br /> <br /> I was laughing at laughter and at the same time how could how many of us should return to the good old days of the 19th century?
