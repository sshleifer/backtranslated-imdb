<br /> <br /> Some things have agreed with me. This film gave me a full load of horrors - shouting laughs. <br /> <br /> Everything started very well - the news of the "young couple exposed to the nuclear explosion" and the first person was completely wound up until the firing took place ... <br /> <br /> Since then, the film has been silent and Sometimes I'm embarrassed to watch. When it turned out to be in the same situation as the main character of the hero (the ability to alleviate his farts without the help of a game), someone seemed to have thrown this idea at the last moment. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of the film and almost the psychological connection between the nuclear power plant ... good taste - you pay more than $ 1.50 for this.
