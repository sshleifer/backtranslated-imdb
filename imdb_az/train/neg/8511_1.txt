It did not work for me to follow, understand, understand, or understand the story. As the site is progressing, this is also incomprehensible. I guess there is a preproduction story / assassination problem that has never been prepared. The producers did not separate from the details of the time and place to create a film about a novel or a novel, a serial killer, and a film about the killer's film. They ended up with a lot of things happening during many movie shootings. Very bad, indeed, they were a director who knew how to make the surrounding movements and know how to get excellent cinematography because they were forced to do so. In fact, a good movie that can take a few hours to enjoy.
