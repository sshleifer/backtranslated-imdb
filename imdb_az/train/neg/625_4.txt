This film could have been NC-17 with extreme violence. But it could have been pg-13 and it was a strange thing when her mother was a really shy boyfriend. There were many character development that allowed the film to look better, and then the child was a terrible hour and ten minutes after he had come to life as a terrible person. Violence was too extreme and I think that the body schedule is more than 12 for such films. Everyone in the film is stabbed or cut off, but he is called a "white trash" and "hoodlum" (although it is nothing more than a characteristic lester hoodlum, hoodlum hood, they do not class, sit there and throw teacher things). The teacher deserved a more horrible death than every character, but he was stabbed in the back. The film had two suspenseful scenes, but it did not last long enough to be fearful. As I said, the offenses were extreme, and sometimes people who had nothing to do with the storyline were kidnapped after cutting their heads. If Gore really was entertaining then it would be nc-17. Two kids describe what they find in cornfields that describe this as something strange, and there are rebels in the small intestine of the police. He had not even cut off his stomach, although there was no way in the stomach, though I liked to see it. The act was miserable, the characters were damaged and the terrible gymnastix could do a lot of stunts. I propose to rent this movie for scenes of death, but soon I will not see it again, but I am very pleased with the violence. Additionally, do not worry about the continuation, I looked for five minutes and was bored to die, it sounds good, but not. The real fear was really interested in me.
