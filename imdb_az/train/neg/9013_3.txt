It's hard to praise this movie. CGI was good for the Dragon, but there was no proper modeling for light and shadow. Also, the same footage is used by dragons that move through the corridors that are a bit tired. <br /> <br /> What is the former emperor of Rome, and Marcus Aurelius Empire, who was interested in the credits, was acting in this movie! <br /> <br /> Like Whoopie Goldberg, this should be a nickname and if it appears on the stinker, it might be a guilty party. <br /> <br /> This story might be interesting, but the move is straightforward and weak. If you need to watch this movie, go to your friend's home and get drunk when you do - then it will be nice.
