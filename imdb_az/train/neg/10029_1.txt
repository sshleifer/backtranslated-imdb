I had no idea since the movie was seen before, because when Tashan was encouraged, there were teaser trailers. If they knew something about it, I asked my friends and they said, "This is the debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya's debut album for Dhoom 1 & 2 and the debut of Ibrahim, the son of Saif Ali Khan. <br /> <br /> After watching, I understood why there was nothing to be seen in the movie because they were not a good trader, and the story was extremely foolish, and even a 10 year old child could perform a better storyline. It was hard to figure out who was dead, and the move was daft and unreal, for example. <br /> <br /> The film, which reminded of three films, was: Sin City: Opening Loans <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: <br /> <I also heard that the budget of the same amount as Dhoom 2 was 40 crores, and I did not know where all the money was. If you do not like Dhoom 2 anyway, there is no chance you will like the TASAN. <br /> <br /> Only two good songs, Dil Haara and Challiya, and both songs are shot in good places in Greece, but what is the use of this? exit film? Even Anil Kapoor's terrible English could not save this anxiety.
