First, I have to emphasize how rare it is for me to comment on a movie I have seen, and it requires a very special situation to write down how I spend time and how I feel about a movie. Here are some of the most striking, most fierce, most terrible, blackest women in the movie, the most funny, Shark Attack III: Megaladon and now the worst: Vampires and Zombies. <br /> <br /> Well, the first thing to say is that this movie is not funny! Look elsewhere for those looking for a bad heart because it's funny or at least funny. Indeed, such a movie does not want to be subtle and bright, you need to know what you're in with a headline. That is, there is no excuse for the film to abandon any rule that dominates the world. This is not just an argument with newer and more "cultural" techniques to create a movie with a traditional cinematography process, which is an argument that is responsible for preparing horrible movies for bad film directors and companies. <br /> <br /> He is suffering from saying, "I do not know where to begin." Indeed, everything about this movie is broken. There is no reason why actors and editors do not surrender a series of events like Vampires and Zombies. Some of the following problems; 1. Scene error - It is clear that the director, camera staff and actors are not on the same page. Especially the scene starts with a camera standing in a field facing the car's passenger side door. You wait for the person to come out, but there is one, and this is not an exaggeration, but at least a delay between the camera, and the director says "move" where everything is on the screen. The spectator looks at the door of a car all the time without any stereotypical "dead air", no sound, no-charge, radio or television inspectors afraid. Where was the editing? 2. Operation - In many cases you are guilty of guilty, do not expect such a movie to have Oscars, but Vampires and Zombies behave badly at another level. These "actors" began to read their articles clearly because everyone who was able to read and speak was able to say better lines than these lines. For me, just a toy comparison should be a scene from the "Resident Evil" at PlayStation. <br /> <br /> Part 3 - What to Expect, What? Story? Do not expect it to be the biggest story yet, but is it a lot of asking if it's a story of a story? Why Vampires? Who are the characters? Who are the bad guys? Do good guys? Why all lesbians? But most importantly, what is the deal with zombies? When you see this movie you will understand what I mean, but I will be straight that there is no five-minute free zombie in this movie. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Generally, when the director forgot the name of the movie and finally commented on the zombie had to. <br /> <br /> There's more to it, but I hope someone does not see this movie.
