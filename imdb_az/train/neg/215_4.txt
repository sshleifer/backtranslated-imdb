As my darling, I'm not as big as my picture. In the end, Alex, Kick, and Sandu were sexually explicit, the love of the triangle was filled with intensity, frustration and jealousy, and finally Alex realized that he would not have the consequence and the future. <br /> The director Tudor Giurgiu watched the film together at AMC Theater on Sunday, 08/10/06, at 12.00 pm. After the film, he said he intended to create a film designed to express Romania's sexual relationships. <br /> <br /> In my opinion sexual life is always complicated everywhere, and you do not feel any special impression and impact on the film. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" > Previous: Alex and Kiki and Kiki and his brother Sandu love story was the next door neighborhood story. <br /> <br /> I explained two main reasons why I do not like this movie: how did love begin? When Alex moved to Kiki's building, then two girls fell in love. It does not make any sense. How a girl is in love with another girl instead of a man. You must combine multiple fragments, format them, and associate these stories wisely. Second, Alex and Kick did not have sex with the entire film, and I was expecting it. However, some parts still have the right to recommend. Part of the ear piercing was interesting. Alex was ready to suffer piercing pain in order to appreciate kikin's love. It was a touching scene that gave a little insight into his love. The event in the football field also appeared on the stage, expressing their love and affection.
