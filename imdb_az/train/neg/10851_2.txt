This film is for fans of Dani (and Cradle of Filth). I'm not one of them. In my opinion, he is an imitator who is riding a black metal band (yet, I'm not a black metal fan). But when I was moving to complain about this DVD, I was convinced that less original is trying to be more convincing. So I'm supposed to ride the rubber gore roller coaster and bounce it with do-it-yourself with a negative background. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ em> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; AWFUL camera work and DISGUSTING quality. , it looked like it was shot using a Hi8 camera.I left it on the shelf, maybe a beautiful evening with beer and Bmovies creates a beautiful situation for this picture ... <br /> <br /> After a few months (in the surrounding area) I came back and saw half, and then I was disturbed by what I was talking about, and I liked it, and I was seeing Dani (1.65m; 5'5 "height) inviting her to look at the platform shoes she shaved off a shoe (yes, there was no skull). <br /> <br /> Several months later, after a few months, I finished these flickers - I drove back a few months ... (Yes, I was 5.5 years old.) So Satan / Manson / super- The bad guy's HELPER and the film did not make sense that Dani was actually laughable. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> said that it was one of such accidents: <br /> <br /> And boy, Stinger's CGI baaaaad). The story does not make sense. And the quality ... Let's say it is not agreeable. The only thing you can watch is violence and fear that has not been raped. Blood and guts are very well prepared. Why you really can see the movie from there and then transfer it. (For example, Dani 'The Man' Filth gets a stuffed cat - it might be a fake - and it's gonna break it ... and then eats the devours Why we never know. <br /> <br /> This film is too bad This is good after thinking, but it's just bad, and the filate curtain can add the cradle.
