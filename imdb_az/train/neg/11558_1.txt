I can say with a very difficult word that I do not mention my words. The best part of the film, when it comes to the end of one of the murder victims, is alive and good, it will only be killed again. There is a chance I've missed some important plot elements, if I were a little coma as long as that baby was. The box in which the movie comes shows shows scenes that are never seen in the movie. Affected torture has been lured with raw images and promises of "Euro-trash, sexy horror flicker". It was a budget version and left about a quarter of the movie. There are many good things to do. Like the end of the new "Planet of the Apes", I received the PG-13 appendix, which is very significant. See this one with a bottle of friendly and challenging things. You need it.
