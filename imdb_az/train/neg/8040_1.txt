A boy in a college dump is killed by one man. Her girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) knows her and tries to commit suicide. He is institutionalized. A year later, he has a new lover named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and wants to spend Spring Festival in BIG, a beautiful B & B in Florida with Hank and four other stupid friends. Of course, the killer opens (for no reason) and begins to kill again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lousy slasher thiller - a sample of the manual to avoid a horror movie downstairs. For starters, most of this film is the latest fillers of these six delusions, "entertaining" (more entertaining in the audience), drunken, stupid, and so on. There is. There is also no nudity here. I tell you that horror movie does not need nudity, but it would be any help to revive so much. None of the deaths are really shown (you will hear them), only a few bloody and no bodies. <br /> <br /> There are some exceptions, with a few exceptions. Dorie Barton is afraid of the mother and Tom Jay Jones is as bad as her. Chad Allen turns out to be Brad and he is TERRIBLE. Lawrence is really good - beautiful and delicious, and this shit gives you a whole lot. And Jeff Conaway plays a small role in doing pretty well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Logic lapses plenty - two girls accidentally talk about sex after a friend was killed; Baston is not a comrade of reaction to seeing a murdered friend, and what is Lawrence? His character disappears without a trace! <br /> <br /> R. was evaluated for graphic violence and some lizards.
