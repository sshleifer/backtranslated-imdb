When I was in production, I was hoping to see it. But it turned out to be the biggest fall. Far away from Dr. Seuss's whimsical world. I do not think Dr. Seuss will approve it. I do not think Gara√ß did better than the Christmas table. I understood that there were some delicate jokes about it, but my children still did not want to catch up. The cat was shouting at the cat, and they loved me very much. As Dr. Seuss grew up, I was disturbed to see how this classic was thrown out on the big screen .You see what they do with Porton. No one hopes this Dr. Seuss will do justice.
