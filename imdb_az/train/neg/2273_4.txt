It was not a big disaster I expected, but it was as positive as I imagined. I'm not sure why it's funny about this movie, but it's all about Father. Personally, I'm not laughing to see those who live in their ignorant lives or watch television on their own, but still I'm not an admirer of Jerry Springer's show-day program. I did not have much trouble watching it, but I never liked it. This is a good choice if you are in a state of mood to see a bad movie, but it is not very painful to sit.
