I still do not believe how bad this film is. If I were a non-public person, I do not know how to explain. Apparently, it did not cost about $ 1000, but it dropped them down. The player was strange - not just bad, 3rd grade students were reading good lines. Secondly, there is another reason to watch such a film and there is nothing frustrating in this confusion. Even in the buff we do not see more attractive flowers. <br /> Ahh good, good luck next time eh?
