I watched these movies for a while, perhaps not a little overlooked. Both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer think it is better than what they can do, and it is interesting to see what Dan Reed can do, but unfortunately he did not work for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why, <br /> <br /> The Caucasus has experienced years of experience. In this case, Dan Reed, in an extraordinary way, "It would be great to have one of the deeper revenge films, showing all the characters more and giving details to their mental state ..." "Wrong! There are several key elements in this kind of film that usually have some kind of warning. A may or may not be the element that adds to this tension, but there is nothing here. <br /> <br /> It's a very serious competition in this genre and a hat for Dan Reed, when I have something, then something happens for an hour, then something interesting and then ending. I do not think there is any issue with his writing skills, not his leadership skills ... I know that he should stay in shape for the type of movie and he hands instead of trying to be smart enough next time.
