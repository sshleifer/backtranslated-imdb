In fact, he wanted to see this movie in the theater. It was actually sold. I went to see Solaris, the worst movie ever to be released in 2002. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Corrupt, streetwise 'street pharmacist' Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo) has decided to hit the child, so be clean and spend all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem pretty good until Jack Skips up with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). It was too late in the film, so it could have been an interesting twist if it did not appear in the front view. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is nothing interesting about this movie; Everything is previewed. Even when you looked at a preview, you saw the whole movie, so you just want to think really hard to fill the gaps. Go to webpage, preview, save yourself $ 3.99. <br /> <br /> I hope everyone who is responsible for writing a voice has been fired. Twice. Most of them know what music will be like if Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan were allowed to release their duo (and I can break into a concept like this) with less talent and musical talent. <br /> <br /> Acting is the weakest, the script is the best crime against humanity and Denise Richards is the best 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc bag. John Leguizamo (It Was Pest!) When things are bad you know, the rest of the cast with the skills of players rises.
