No taste or class "friend" offered to look at Ron Atkins's work. If it were a representative of this craft, I would not want to see anything else. It is an amateur, self-affirming, committing a crime and making itself a seductive litter. The title of "brothels" is an angry low-budget director who killed a group of brothels. There is some nudity and some erections, but no element may be saved from the bone's bone. Lighting is awful, dialogue is brave and largely shouting and directional. In the last Fangoria Convention, I saw a doco of American exploit filmmakers. Atkins is especially recognized. He said it was as important as his job, but I do not see any imports if it is considered. There is no style, and terrific video effects (such as solarization) only enhance amateurism. Even worse, not fun. Avoid it.
