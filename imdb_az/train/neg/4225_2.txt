This is another Christian propaganda film on the line of Omega Code. This is not necessarily bad, but rather for the sake of sincerity and realism for the message they want to present most propaganda films. Perhaps you can use this movie if you know that life on the streets can change the strophoam image and the life of the Bible. I say that you can save your money and rent a cross and fortress block or mission. Do Christian teachers sometimes learn that people say bad things? It was a disappointment to see the criminals who describe the plain symbols of the Jews (they say the criminals are bad words) and that they can not really link me. It would have been great if the movie had shown some T & A. It would be something I would have to pay now to see. Who was the blockhead who compared this angle deer-thin story to a movie with The Boondock Saints and The Sting?
