My dear. This film could have been under the subheading "Writers were on vacation!" What a stinker. There were so many great hopes for this, after reading IMDbs, I was surprised by the IMDb rating system, but this is a separate issue. I liked Anchorman, Bruce High, Office, and others so I liked Steve Carrell great things. To say I am disappointed is the clarification of the year. In this movie, a lot of things are wrong, but I'm sure (a) everyone is acting like these people (mass aerobic exercises, which planet is real life?), Clunky script (please ask a killer of love) and Dana's character is not so difficult Are you interested in seeing her so that she is in love with her? This film was packed with luxurious dialogue, sliding direction, ridiculous set-ups, and slow, slow, slow. If we were not with our parents, we would not want to earn a lot of money and we would have pulled out after half an hour when we did not want to spend. Unlike the creators of this film, it would be great to have all the money spent on making this movie a fire - it would have been more fun. If you love movies, avoid it as a puzzle.
