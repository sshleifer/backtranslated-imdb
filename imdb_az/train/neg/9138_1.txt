The worst movie, in IMDb, is a statement that people often come around here. In the movie world, where people often broadcast directly, whether it's bad classics, like a Uwe Boll, Manos Hands of Fate, or any brain brainstorming festival last May. <br /> <br /> I envy these people, because they are aware of the depth of the rabbit hole in a beautiful ignorant and irritable film. There are films that are so dreadful and terrible that they are indifferent and very ridiculous that cults are born to celebrate their fears, and discussion boards are the best places on the internet for everyone to unanimously recognize that the movie is really bad. <br /> <br /> Ladies and gentlemen, I present you a 85-minute gay epic of Ben and Arthur, and you know that this is a very bad car accident. I look. He has declared himself a "Hollywood actor, director" and can stab the whale Sam Mroovich, this film legendarily scares. Let me give you a look at how this project works. Mr. Mroovic did not just shoot this movie, he wrote, produced, managed, dropped it, edited it and eventually played with it. <br /> <br /> This is a man who protects his ego and believes in his incomparable horror, as an ugly child, he does not know how disastrous the creation of whispering really is. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie fails epic, the player is the worst, most laughable, the most corrupt, the correction and cinematography you can witness, the most amateur and even the music is like a nail on a piece of paper. I know that I'm a little acquainted here, but I believe that this movie is really bad, as I have described it, and I can say that this film is rolled horizontally for a film, but the truth was not even filmed, and now it's a better digital camera than a dustpacker was shot. Do not misunderstand me, donate low bills for movies, I'm interested in the concept, for example, as I did not like, Blair's Witch Project proved that low budgets still could lead to an intriguing film. Although I and Arthur have shot this movie with a budget of 20 million, it's not a good concept to go back, but with the Hollywood's best actors, the plot is flawless and the characters are even worse. One of Arthur's main characters, unlike Sam Mraovic, is one of the fewest roots to be filmed. You will not love it for 5 minutes at the start of the movie, and the hatred at the end of the movie will be clearly hated. As you can see, Mr. Mroovych forgot that we root for the hero. <br /> <br /> I do not want to burn all the intestines that I watch on this film (I ask you not to pay) for me, I'll give you double samples of how stupid this film is, and it's as soft and soft as it is in the movie. When one of the main characters in one section finds that they know they are "a good lawyer and will call HYAA", the shooting goes back after fades, and this HIM, which was previously mentioned, is really a great mistake. post production. Secondly, after seeing this transsexual lawyer, it is simple that the characters are told to fly to Vermont, and then an airplane crashed between the palm trees in a sunny area. I have never come to Vermont myself, but I'm sure you will not find palm trees there. <br /> <br /> Such foolish amateur disrespect united with about half an hour of ridiculous dialogue. and provocation and then multiply 10 and still do not prepare for Ben and Arthur. Imagine the worst movie you are seeing in your life, and imagine that it is getting worse and you will not be the same as Ben and Arthur, and this is really bad. <br /> <br /> We're glad that some of the movies are so rare. One day we can hope that we can become a movie master or a screenwriter. <br /> <br /> Indeed, we will get a new sense of confidence. We will know something we produce regardless of the amateur amateur amateur. <br /> <br /> Real The worst movie of all time has finally been discovered, and it was not Ben and Arthur.
