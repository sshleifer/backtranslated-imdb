my friend bought 5 movies? (not even 1 cents) because they were American cakes as they wrote. but we soon know that there is a long way from American pie to shit. it is not even a comedy, its really really a really bad documentary. not only the story, but also the picture and sound. some alcohol, mercury, dwarfs and drunken youngsters. and the result is a disaster. If you see this movie not buying, spend your money on something else and a better way. If you torture yourself, then do not invite a friend, if you do not hate it and you want to get rid of them.
