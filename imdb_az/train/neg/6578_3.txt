It's an unpleasant, hijacked hybrid of "Deceit Intentions" and "Wild Things", but it was not good at all of those rubbish classics. This transparent sheriff, Artie (Taye Diggs), is called to investigate a deadly drug overdose at a luxury top-level Univesity, but to keep him down. When he gets deeper, he thinks he is more than a first-person. We look forward to Alicia. In a 90-minute film, it would have been worn out by the start of this movie. This movie brings something new to the table. <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Happy Kempers "error); another girl does not <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
