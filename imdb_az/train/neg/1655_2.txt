This movie really shows its age. The summer I was seeing was terrible for the age, but there is a lot of pressure. But this is not the biggest problem with the film. Although the problem was discussed in 1933, the main factor was a large number of silent films, only scattered in the amateur fashion (only a few sentences). Sometimes the heroes turned back or talked with their faces - all hiding their lips and hiding the "clean" (?) Movie. Yes, this Czech film should be dubbed in many languages, but in this way it was really stupid and clear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> There was a good story because it really is ashamed - with a wearer and / a young woman who marries an old woman who is not interested. But in the 21st century, a few people would be really ready to sit down with this archaic confusion. With naked (and slightly clever) Hedy Lamarr a few glimpses, this debut is not worth the whole fuss accompanied by the movie. Even before 1933, this film was a poor dream. <br /> <br /> The only interesting aspect of the film is to see how Lamarr appears in contrast to the glamorous appearance he created when he came to America in 1944. It seems to be completely different people. <br /> <br /> Incomplete and technically low film, I do not see how it has earned such rave views. For technical problems, the movie can not measure anything in 10 or near.
