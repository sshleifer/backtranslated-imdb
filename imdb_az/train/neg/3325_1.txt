Hated it. If you believe that everyone in the South is dumb, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, religious, or a child molester, this movie may be for you. Everyone is ignorant and ignorant. At one scene, a two-year-old man is talking to a general store and reminds one of his siblings that he can not close his shoes. It became apparent that man was proud of his actions and that the other was a normal part of life. Very nice. A teenage girl travels through her backpacks and nobody offers her help - obviously defective and despite the lack of food or water (backpack, etc.). The character of Strathairn is not only disgusting and bogus, but also as a religious believer (Hollywood typical) that reflects the betrayal of Christians. A scene in the movie is highly reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear (one with DeNiro) - Holy verses are spouted by the wicked man. I'm from Greater Northeastern, but this film is NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN and so on
