The script is beautiful. Casting can not be completely ignored. The dresses do not resemble some of the High Highbury community. Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow to Kate Beckinsale, Mrs. Paltrow's speeches by Emma Woodhouse, in her speech, Mrs Paltrow, Mrs. Beckinsale, speaks well of English as English. Mr. Northam, of course, is the best Mr. Knightley of all versions, he's romantic and is not as intense and unassuming as Mr Knightley in a television version. P.S. The audience does not see Mr Elton Ms. Smith's understanding of the relationship did not understand why Emma's Elton-Smith match (apart from the portrait) fled.
