It was one of the nights nights "I got there" I saw it. Sometimes they are great. <br /> <br /> How can you be unsure when you're in Charlsten Heston and Jack Pallance? We speak about Oscar winnings here. It had a good effect. There were even some really good tits! And I mean full breast with full nipples, and even a beaver at one point, well illustrated. But he did not compensate for missing part - a story! The area was ridiculous. I do not mean "sun crisis" to illuminate the sun, but it was bad enough. The rest of this stuff - the products of the worst and foolish corporation, which is so foolish and completely predictable. Just STAN! <br /> <br /> I have seen that the same players are incredibly good. I've seen beautiful fantasy films with tiny moments and budgets. All the difference is in the text.
