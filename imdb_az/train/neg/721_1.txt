There are a few major flaws in this movie. First, and most importantly, a good plot is missing! It is not difficult to watch this sad movie, but also sends the viewer a sense of hopelessness, for example, wastes valuable time of their short life. This means it will not be able to capture the audience, but instead encourage the public to respect everything in the film and everything else in it! In short, really too much too much too much too much too bad! Give yourself a blessing and chew on a great rubber boot, you can find more exciting and enjoyable than watching Terminator Woman.
