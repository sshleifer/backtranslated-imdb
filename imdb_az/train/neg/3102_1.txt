<br /> <br /> If you look at this movie, it's just scary. <br /> If you see it as a fright, monsters are an unusual movie with hand-made puppets. <br /> <br /> If you look like a comedy, then it turns out that the most humor is straightened and just bare. <br /> <br /> If it's romantic, it's like a boy's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <strong> far from entertaining. The monsters were talking about open puppets, and this film was an attempt at a film called Gremlins. However, this genre has the worst visible monster. Critters looked pretty good, so were the Ghoulies, the puppets even from the Munchies looked heck better. The characters in this movie are not so difficult. Hero is a watchdog security force, her lover always complains, she has a tramp-friendly, a friend who has been kidnapped by a military friend and a spy. Fighting with the hero and the military at one point in the movie ... This movie is totally stupid. When the hero is on the scene of a treacherous club club (not a club, more likely), I love the scene and the hero tells the waiters that there is no one. Give me a break, I am 25 years younger than any of them.
