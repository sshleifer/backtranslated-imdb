C class movie, cute, compelling, terribly (and not fun). Everything is "disappointing" (strange facilities, limited coherence and predictable endings, simple lighting, sound and handmade camera angles, coy and passes sexual references and references, rich and incredible dialgoue for "Z" and "z") <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I saw it on DVD and I was hoping Edward Wood would be opened. All was forgiven - The worst Movies are artwork and more so than fitting. <br /> Warbling 'I hear every night in my dreams' - Are you sure that the Titanic team did not participate in this?
