It took 9 years to complete this movie. I thought that for 9 years, someone would say that this movie is terrible. I've seen better porn movies. The story is tired and playable. The defective child turns into a serial killer. About something new for a change. Protected child turns into a florist? At least this would be a new twist. Why is anyone with the idea of ​​camera and movie (especially unusual movie ideas) as a director? For 9 years, I believe they have been competing with this movie to finish this movie. It shows the power and the spirit. With this kind of driver, I hope they can move to a better scenario next time. Now if you want to experience a movie that is unsuccessful in making a filmmaker / director, see A Minute hate. If you want a good movie from a Michigan writer / director, stick with Evil Dead.
