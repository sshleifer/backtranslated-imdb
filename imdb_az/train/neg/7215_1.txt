This movie was a foolish thing. Everything is bad. For those who like western movies, why do we take the nineteenth nineteenths when renting from the west? As you can see, if you do not see names on the cover like Robert Duval, Kevin Costner, or Tom Selleck, you can not agree with it. The main moves of the Shiloh Falls occurred in 1892, but the revolvers used were models of the 1860s. Even the shooting was bad - the Marshal touched six times the shooter nine times at one stage and could not reach out to any of the three great men only twenty meters away. After about 15 minutes of this loyalty, I have to stop it. Perhaps the participants could have taken some lessons at Sunset Carson Acting School.
