I think this is the weakest of Kenneth Branak's Shakespeare's works. After such great efforts about Much Ado and so on. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> My biggest illness they are Bard She was confused with her work and cut some games to put on the music / dance sequence. <br /> <br /> You just do not mess with Shakespeare and then play. We're sorry, but that's wrong. I love Cole Porter as some people, but do not worry about JEES, Shakespeare. If you want to see the Tempest's shiny Shakespeare adaptation, skip it and watch the "Prospero's Books".
