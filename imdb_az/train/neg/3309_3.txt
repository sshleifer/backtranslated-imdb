In this film plot, character development and gags are all very weak. Often time loss. The result of Saving Grace is that the heroes feel as if they were growing up and struggling with their struggles. There was no such development to make such feverish feelings. Drug sticks are touched, and most of the film is not right for life. The plot builds things that need to be tense, but the characters do not develop properly. Then, for a minute, the screen runs to the solution of all outstanding problems, leaving viewers feeling like their time.
