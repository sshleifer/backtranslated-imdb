In short: Spike Lee has a lot to do. He deals with racism, color, press and hegemony, consumerism and capitalism, religion, sexism, "hetero-sexism", drug war policies, Thinks about ... <br /> <br /> The level of this consciousness is great. I think it is a blessing that chooses to critically analyze the basic aspects of our everyday lives; silent and invisible forces that govern our societies. <br /> <br /> What happens in Jungle Fever is a superficial understanding of these socio-political forces. This is largely the result of two major failures: <br /> <br /> First of all, Lee just works hard. He tries to make every effort for every political / social statement he / she can think of for a total of 90 minutes. And thus, it seems mixed and unfounded because it does not allow the development of the characters that fully reflect the ideas they think will not result in a final result. Thus, he stereotypes exhausted and we stayed with expressions we fled and very loaded dialogues. The last result is very scenic and unreal. <br /> Second, there is no concrete and original interpretation of the public / political issues presented by making statements of such broad public functions. What is happening? <br /> <br /> This is a very serious problem, because film art is sacrificed and transformed into an instrument for the work voice. sound of the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> This is neither a work of art nor a healthy political argument. <br /> <br /> Certainly, we appreciate Lee for the solution of these issues. <br /> <br /> Two finger down.
