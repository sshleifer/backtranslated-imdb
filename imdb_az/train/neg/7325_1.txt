Hollyoaks actors appear to be the Royal Shakespeare Company. This film is horrifying how confusing. Turning off the DVD player did not move enough. I want to find people who are responsible for this disaster. I'll never go back. Never. How is it possible to create such a banal, bored and lifeless film? I did not think of an action plan that would release the tedium. Writing the ten lines you need is pretty hard for such a shameless movie piece. What more can you say about what kind of action is really terrible? Please escape.
