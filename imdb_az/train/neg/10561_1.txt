I have seen this movie in its own time that when it comes to being a non-married baby, it does not just destroy her life, but she seals her child as a whistle. These days, 'single mothers' might seem too far away, but they were very accurate. And I am not crazy about laughing at one surprising person. It was difficult for me to find this movie between these two problems. I do not know who led that period, or how much he enjoyed. I knew who Betty Hutton was and that he was angry because he hurt me. I like to bring "baby", but I find this film embarrassing. I am convinced that some of the churches' work was probably open, but I still needed drink after watching it. The idea of ​​"getting married" and being drunk to get happiness just added to the famine. The whole city can cling to you under these circumstances, so the result of this movie is really a funny part. Of course, shoot me, and I do not like "This wonderful life".
