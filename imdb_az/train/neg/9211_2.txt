This movie reminds me of some of the anti-narcotic films covering the 50s and 60s, as it has been prepared by people who have never been explicitly aware of the social shock we warned. Tom Hanks and his friends "play a role", but the dice have many candles, and then just disassembled in a bad assemblage showing Hanks falling for the woman in the group. it's pretty funny but wrong. I do not know how many poor children were the way to destroy D & D products and destroy their imagination. As a filmmaker, he has mainly talked about school-specific and bad-natured (although Hanks has some talents), and has no discussion of his relationships with anyone. As you can see, these films give psychological attention to adolescents who start adulthood, and this is more serious, probably concealed and requires everyone to do their job. Despite my 2 votes, it's worth looking for because of my own genre and fear movies because I'm so laughable.
