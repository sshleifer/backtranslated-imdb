This film does not offer anything new to a genre that reflects the cross cultural tradition that laid the foundation of politics in the middle of the 20th century, in the middle of the 20th century / British and their modern ways, with bad and primitive, honest and true Indian. good Of course, the cliched images of the British are now pass√©. <br /> <br /> The second part of the film, along with burning drama, is a predictable, actor pedestrian and two-dimensional and directive <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, it's completely simple. Oh and Linus Roache can not just do the tragedy - it's going to face emotional pain, it just does not work for me!
