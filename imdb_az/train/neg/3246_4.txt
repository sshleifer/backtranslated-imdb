The plot of the "Game House" is the most powerful thing about this: a successful writer and psychologist are called by a bunch of gangs, but when they get the excitement of what they see, they finally get revenge. It concerns this area: but someone should be responsible for acting by the puppets. Director Mamet: Lindsay Crouse has a diverse and extremely durable television and movie career, so he can not always do that bad thing.
