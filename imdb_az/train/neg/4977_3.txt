This is a television and more unnecessary Sci-fi Channel for Beowulf's story, especially after the 2005 Beowulf and Grendel movie. This movie is not really part of Beowulf's story but when Beowulf, a powerful Viking fighter, was called to rescue them, he took us with a fight against the rogue animal known as Grendel when he was in a state of absolute fear and confusion. monster's surprise If successful, the king will no longer sacrifice children to keep him alive. After a few unsuccessful attempts, the vigor was slaughtered, but the angry and rebellious mother soon attacked Beowulf, lending to the mighty and powerful moves to defeat her. "Grendel" hit a small budget and CG effects appear horrible. As I said, this movie is absolutely unnecessary.
