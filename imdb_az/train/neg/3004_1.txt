What a terrific movie. The player was bad, the pacing was bad, the cinematography was bad, the management was bad, the "special" effects were bad. <br /> <br /> In the first place, the past event that led to the slaughter lasted 15-20 minutes. I thought I would never end. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> Caucasus <br / > <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;">> There is no reason to watch this movie, so some adults you do not want to see and perfect your pillow. This film does not really distinguish Showgirls from the Civil Code.
