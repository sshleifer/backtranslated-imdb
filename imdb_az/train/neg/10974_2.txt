I'm from Ireland, and for a while I lived in Denmark, but last year I was hoping to go home, as I saw Intermission. <br /> <br /> THIS MOVIE IS DOWN. <br /> <br /> "It's not like Ireland's most productive person, but it's definitely. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film, Colm Meaneys are quite funny in the American style garage. But the film itself is completely wrong. The zoom-around, zoom-out movie that splashes around the camera tries to make a look like a strange drama. But it is not. It's an Irish Lock, Stock, and Two Cigarette Barrels, and that should be avoided. There should be a smooth motion until after a shot. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film is just like one another and thrown in one place. A friend told me as well as Colin Farrell in Dublin for a week. He gives Dublin a decent look like Dirtbag, but in no way can it be compared with the Azg Report, Tigerland or Phone Booth. The best performance was for Dierdre O'Kane, the only female banker manager, who played a middle-aged female sedate who was thrown out of his wife. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he is afraid of his gods and should pay more attention to his activities. <br /> <br /> Generally, the Irish press does not have any grounds or expectations. even one of the best Irish films. <br /> <br /> I'm expecting a retreat from these comments because most people I talk to are good at it. But before answering, ask yourself: If this film is set up in England or America, how can I think so highly?
