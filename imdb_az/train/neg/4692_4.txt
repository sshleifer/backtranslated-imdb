When I first saw this movie, it was under a TRAIN TERROR head and it was the back of the dual feature. Glenn Ford, an armaments expert, calls for a clash of a secret bomb attack on a train loaded with high explosives. Tension is slow and stable; and this black-and-white film only runs for an hour and twelve minutes. All these years on television; tension and dramatic effect. <br /> <br /> Besides Ford, there are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. This villain / saboteur played Viktor Maddern.
