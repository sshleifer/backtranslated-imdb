How did this happen? I usually like F / Bigfoot and so on. . but I still expect it to be written without so much cheese. The effects were sad, there were plenty of lines. Avoid all costs. I just hired him for the wrong job (I was looking for a Sasquatch movie with Lans Henrikson - I have not seen it yet). The idea of ​​the movie is really good. There was a lot of potential to shoot a great little movie here. I do not understand how it feels like this. Talk to students interested in film / art / English at any high school and find people who can write a better post.
