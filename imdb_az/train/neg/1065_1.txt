Based on a friend's recommendation, my wife and I have invited another couple to this movie. I really apologized for it - we spent all the time we hated and watched the hours waiting for the film to end. Half of the vignettes are strange and have little entertainment value. There were several scenarios in Paris - for example, I waited for some pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I did not know anything. Most of the scene was at the bar. No one in the theater laughed at anything or reacted in any way. If you like it, do not miss it, strange, ambitious, pseudo-intellectual films. If you fall down like me, you're upset because you saw it.
