That's enough for the movies to go. Entertaining characters, good dialogue, interesting story. <br /> <br /> I really liked it if I did not get very annoyed when explaining the disrespect to the city in Glasgow. In Scotland. But every character is English (Sean's girl friend, except for the Dutch). Scottish sheets are heard only occasionally in female jobs and roles. I do not think that as a Scottish woman (and like a viewer who likes her "real life" movies to look a little more real), it would hurt you to use any of the many talented Scottish players ... or at least a good accent There are some Englishmen who can jump together! He has done nothing more than insulting an inadequate attempt to use the word "breakthrough" several times.
