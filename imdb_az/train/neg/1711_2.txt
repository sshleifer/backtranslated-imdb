Yes, I bought the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, so ghostly gambling would be fun. What is fun without this. This movie is really foolish, there is no plot or character development, or any storyline. The main problem with this movie kills and is. Basically, every crime seems completely identical. ZOmbies split each other. Yes, that's good, but some original killings are needed. I mean, it's really bare, every murder is exactly the same, it's done in the same way. Things that killed me. I love it, there is nothing for me in this movie. It was just boring. No story, again and again on stage with another person again. I also wanted this movie. Like a red zombie ... But I could not keep up with myself. This movie has good points, but there's no one in the movie. I understand that most of the "zombies" have helped with flood and have more than 100 zombies who have attracted many people and helped the world. But in general, this is a terrible film.
