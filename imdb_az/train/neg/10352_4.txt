I just learned that recently Madeleine L'Engle's novel was turned into a television movie by Disney and ordered the DVD. <br /> <br /> Several times I read that the book was my favorite one. Despite some child actors that do not resemble the characters depicted in the novel, Murry's family sounds good, with a very unpleasant (very nice) Meg in the center, and with a convincing Charles Wallace without an irritation as a child prodigy. <br /> <br /> The first half hour is enough for a good time, doing a good job of identifying the relationships and scenes among the leading characters. Unfortunately, when the non-human characters appear, the adaptation begins to fail, and everything is separated after the children leave the earth. Alfre Woodward is a very talented and very spectacular lady Whatsit (instead of Miriam Margolis or Joan Plowright) and Kate Nelligan's face is not as spectacular and surprising as she should visit Faye Dunaway's plastic surgeon in recent years. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, she seems to be like Glinda from her Wizard of Oz when the West resembles a good Wicked Witch. <br /> <br /> Finally, the effect and direction of art. I understand it's a television movie, but CGI looked at something that could be done 15 years ago. Mrs. Whatsits's 'centaur incarnation' is a disaster like Chewbacca, a suit for Teyze Beast, a velvety and elegant creature in the novel instead of a plate-like Big Foot. It is worth noting that almost every artistic choice is a disaster, probably not a big enough budget for justice, and there is no imagination and good judgment in design. No doubt, this was the miracle that Spilberger brought to his early films. In today's popularity, adapting the series of children's literary fantasies, no-one thinks that he does not think about adapting A Wrinkle in time, and for the big screen he later gives the space he deserves.
