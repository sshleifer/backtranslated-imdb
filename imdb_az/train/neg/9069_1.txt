(David H. Steinberg) script had some realistic intelligent paragraphs in the first place that could build a good romantic comedy, but oh dear! What can happen yet? !!!! <br /> What happened? Initially (Animal House - 1978) and (Porky's - 1982). It's been a long time ago, but first of all, this is the new genre lady: a teenage comedy. Then came the 1990s. (Problem Child - 1990), (Smoke and Dumber - 1994), (The Nutty Professor - 1996), and (as there is something about My Mary - 1998), undoubtedly, the symbol of a genre is undoubtedly a relative and modest the era of the era and the Prophet of the next era, one and only (American Pie - 1999). After that, any comedy will be imitated by young people, but it can be so bad and confusing that it will not be fashionable! I believe (Slackers) After having a clever structure as a script, its manufacturers should add some real bigger quantity: roughness, dirt, strange shamelessness - in those days - just as cake! Each scene has to be freely filled in as follows: masturbation, oral sex, urine ... etc. They want absolutely unnecessary elements in the story, but surely they are necessary to earn income and to catch the latest fashion in the preparation of teenage comedies. <br /> <br /> Some moments were terrible, and that's where you look. All this (Jason Schwartzman) appearance and performance; It's a memorable and disgusting thing. Thus, this passion was transformed into something unprecedented from the appearance of a romantic comedy. Always be like a horror that you are asking; What will happen to nastier? (vomiting, farting, etc ..); <br /> <br /> Today is one of the easiest combinations to create a comedy. <br /> <br /> If you hate it, you have to love something (mainly for courage), only for me was the scene of Gina Gershon Jameo. In any case, a young person has drawn up the whole thing to be heartfelt in the face of frustrations like a nagging dream. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> <strong>. Remember the details of the theft (the first 2 minutes), so the main area of ​​the movie (the girl is blackmailing the girl by trying to reach the girl) is a girl (a girl loves a girl and a girl loves another boy), as if it was nothing more than a calmness. Dirty college guys dealing with his material acted naked, who did nothing, but did not want to miss it. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's something like time and place (you think!) He said. it's like the comedy itself, to be a prosecutor or a winner. For a completely better movie, it will not end well; it can give my opinion on this subject. Once! And there is no need to understand that the creator of this movie is the true slackers! Perhaps stupidity is a way to be smart in Hollywood, but even if .. The final result is no sense here, in any sense. <br /> <br /> PS: The scenario writer of his (American Pie 2) story (David H. Steinberg) "Additional Events" on IMDb Sex / Vulgarity / Humus Humor / his usual "Plot Keywords" ... They 70-year-old women forget to burn urine when showering or baring!
