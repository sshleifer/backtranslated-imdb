The writer from Poland should be a feminist because he finds Young Cinema to be historically accurate. There could be nothing but truth. As many Russian historians, I have made exceptionally exhaustive conclusions with YC for many years, especially as a politically accurate description of the cartoonist as a single individual has led Russia to dominate. The truth? They just came to St. Petersburg to become a wife and mother and found only "garden" to live with dvoriane, dyes and army. As long as he did not protest against them, he was able to fill his cultural desires (fill with Armenian art treasures, etc.). There are many evidences that he is not "great", but the proof of post-modern revisionism is not so popular in this area. YC is just a costume drama, a little bump like Ted Turner's "Peter Great" in 1986 is an example of how badly Russia is depicted in the West.
