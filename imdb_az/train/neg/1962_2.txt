<br /> <br /> This is just a scary thing about the movie, which can be a continuation of everyone who does it. <br /> <br /> From the start, "Gear Peri" was just terrible. <br /> <br /> Half of the knitting did not look unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Some of the bad effects and the heroic ending, Wizard of Oz, seemed to be a childlike movie that was mixed with witchcraft and happy daughters. except for being there for some fashion killing in a relaxed way. Ariura's sister, two siblings, and Mrs. McDonald did not come to the point in the film - they could enter the main pitch for interesting side events but could not worry about it.

Generally speaking, the story is weak by unusual behavior from the characters that each of you eats by the magician. <br /> <br /> The weak structure and weaknesses (children, especially wooden), and the film are a complete failure. Only MST3K could have been a walk ...
