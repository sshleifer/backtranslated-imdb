When I become one of the "stars" of this film, I do not give it a deep sage, and I know some of the first ones there ... and what's going on on the screen. I remember the original part of the "first class" and I'm very glad. all the basic requirements of this entertaining film were funny, sexy, and surprising. it should be remembered that it was pulled out and was released before all other parts ... animal house, pork, and so on, which, in turn, was really premature. For some reason, the movie was given to key distributors who made half of the original movie, and then edited (I said 'I mix') is the most casual scenes. greasy man, people with goat hair .... what is heck? I'm sure it was set aside for T & A, but it was slowly paced, causing something to stop and shut down beforehand and scratch. but all this, a fun memory for me ... especially when I saw the worst movie I've ever seen ... inside!
