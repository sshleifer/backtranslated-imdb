Saving Grace, of course, is one of the leading ambitions on how to "break an interview film at least." Of course, if you mix a strange Cornish village, in most cases, retired sensitive ladies are settled - with a dose of marijuana in a liberal dose a certain amount of calm will emerge. However, the last seven minutes of the movie are absolutely funny, and they are not particularly ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This comedy has the potential to be as beautiful as Waking Ned Devine in 1998. It also describes a beautiful small village and its oddball dwellers who want to get out of a difficult situation. <br /> <br /> Grace's Hero, a middle-aged, recently-widowed Grace Trevethyn, heritage of her husband's gratuitous debts, forced her to earn money in an unconventional way. When her gardeners are helped by Matthew, she turns the gardening experience into a profitable cultivation of mystery. Unfortunately, this is a conflict with local police, husband's lenders, and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . All these are at the same time greenhouse. <br /> <br /> Relationships between Grace and Matthew are well-understood and Brenda Blethyn links the viewer with a favorite character - you can really feel what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Smaller roles are good, though some of them are somewhat surprisingly ezantric. However, the transformation of the Jacques drug lord into Grace's romantic interests is incredible and does not fit the tone of the film. Undoubtedly, hydroponics are not such a revolution in a growing world of mystery. Unfortunately, the film transforms delicate humor to the slapstick and ends up fake as cannabis plants.
