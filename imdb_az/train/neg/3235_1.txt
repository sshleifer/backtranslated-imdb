I'm an admirer of violent exploits, and I'm not going to attack the film to avoid any violence or anxiety. I think the name "Cannibal Holocaust" is a masterpiece and we will always defend controversial films like "Shadow Day" or "The Last House on the Left" as true classics. Anyone who reviews my other user comments will see that I'm really very vigilant when it comes to the movie. But I think that violence must have at least one point. This part of hell has no point. The first film in the series "The Devil's Experiment" (1985), the first film in the series "Guinea Pig", is widely discussed, but unlike many other controversial films, this stinker has no suggestion. I say that before I see one of the Gunie Pig films, I felt I would hate to know what it was all about. But according to the status of one of the most controversial films around, I had to see it. <br /> <br /> The story of this thing (even I do not want). <br /> <br /> <strong> can be called a "movie"): None. Three terrible women tortured a woman for 40 minutes. This is so. There is no artistic value, no 'shock' story, no tension; nothing. Only a woman who has been exposed to torture for no reason, has a great deal of disbelief in a movie that does not show anything. This is a negative situation, I give it. Of course it's 40 minutes to watch a video of torture. However, the more disturbing it is that many people see this waste of garbage as a kind of masterpiece. I really can not say why. Gore's effects can not be a real cause. The girl playing the victim is not a very good actor and very calmly reacts to all the tortures. This is a more realistic film, and this is a good thing in a single situation. This is an exciting movie; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> But I do not think there is a reason why nobody wants it except those who want to watch the suffering and torture. The continuation of this film "Flesh and Blood Flower", actor Charlie Sheen made this movie a real scene and informed the FBI. Fortuneately, the film appeared to be fake. Generally speaking, "The Devil's Experience" is a fake torture film that seems to be the only purpose of looking at a possible real movie. <br /> <br /> "The Devil's Experience" I had the pleasure of not sitting in the worst films ever. Do not torture yourself to try this case with its controversial status. Give yourself a blessing and take it away. 10 stars, I would like to have a negative scale to estimate the similar rate of bending.
