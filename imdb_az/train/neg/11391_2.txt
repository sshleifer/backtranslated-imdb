When I started watching this movie for the first time, I was looking at a subtle metaphor, but soon I thought that this movie was about people on a train. Dialogue is stylted and boring, when people are interacting with each other on the street every day and sometimes even more interesting. I do not know how this film works to describe people's relationships with people, but it is very boring in this film. If you want to see and analyze such relationships, it would be best to go out and get a train ticket and look at people on the train. This is true, but you will not go to a movie to watch a movie watching the movie.
