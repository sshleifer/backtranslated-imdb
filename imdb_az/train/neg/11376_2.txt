Bronson Green, whose main character discrepancies, despite its good intentions to make a movie that focuses on the theme's weight and the white-rule of the filmmakers, Bronson Green, who is prone to fraud, is forced to take the story seriously. Green, which has been obsolete by Los Angeles Casting Agents (that is, in the 1980s, when looking for big, blond and mute), Green is easily accessed when it succeeds in falsifying its appearance. Unfortunately, a new hairstyle and a neat "surfer" attitude give him an opportunity to Jericho Church, which subscribes to the white supremacist teaching of the Aryan people. Green wanted a young black friend back to the past ten years to forget his past, and especially to become a new spokesman for the Church. First of all, it does not understand how our character is going to be fundamental. It looks like an empty change suddenly and character, uniting with the sharp recycling of the unhappy DeNiro-obsessed (its taxi driver character), and can fight these oppressors. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> It is a noble attempt to film artists, but eventually puts itself seriously as something <br /> <br /> Other symbols are also inconvenient, the church's leader is a paranoid of psychosis, For the most part, it's just a picnic space, because the actress's girlfriend, who is interested in her first bride, is in Bronson's LA and is characterized by a new blonde girl friend. We just understand that something randomly forces us to make assumptions about symbols. But there is really little progress. <br /> <br /> The other issue of the film is an unusual time when characters are taking a less significant action. Most of the start ups are symbols, and it is clear that Bronson's L.A. entering the stage of the actor, we see the difficulties and the difficulties of permanent rejection. But there is a good thing to have a movie that has been wasted for at least twenty minutes and thirty minutes after it has changed its appearance and identity. <br /> <br /> For desirable films, he did not have enough credibility to pay attention to the complex fears behind racism.
