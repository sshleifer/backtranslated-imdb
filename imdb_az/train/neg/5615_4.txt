I just watched DVD 1. The program can be up to 10 minutes of good information; on the contrary, the artificial creation of religious people. Brian Flemming had recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and that he could easily push himself into the opposition. <br /> <br /> Flemming is also widening his personal affairs, film. <br /> <br /> Religious rallies are prone to reducing skepticism when abusive education is deeply rooted. The arguments of such victims are ineffective and therefore unconvincing. <br /> <br /> Anti-religious people want more information. <br /> <br /> On the best stage, under the leadership of Fleming, it is not necessary to say that believers are defective. During the childhood Christian school director faces with motivations. It looks like the most honest part of the film, and it's too short. <br /> <br /> If Fleming knows a little more, he can be a good story about himself (past and present) <br /> Christianity and insulting organizations that insult him in youth. <br /> <br /> And maybe, the article "Christ has not gone anywhere" could give a more serious documentary. <br /> <br /> <strong> Negotiations with Saudi Arabia continue. </ P> <p> does not improve Fleming's thesis very well. Sam Harris is a good spokesman for anti-religious POV and does not give light to other non-Christian religions. Harris also has some good (and easily Google) conversations on Salon.com, Amazon.com, and Samharris.org.
