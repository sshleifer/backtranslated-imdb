Although the film was a "true" of Lewis's book (although the script was actually word-by-word), he could not have any surprise that would have been associated with such an epic story. Created * mythical creatures (unicorns, centaurs, griffins, ghouls, ghosts) * and as it was at the previous glance, green screen was very difficult to absorb flying sequences. When I saw human ghosts with giant tight suits and teeth teeth, I laughed at death immediately; <br /> <br /> Behold, I heard a wolf wailing in a silent suit, as if silent and screaming. little Lucy Penvensie ... Only fourteen hours after watching the movie (just like what it is) can get rage, desperation, and buck teeth. The actress, playing the white witch, appears to be more at home on the stage, in his whole story, on the stage where the sound, the wounded gun, and Shakespeare's hard work against something. <br /> <br /> Groups feel claustrophobic that the scenes go at home or outdoors. Inside, the BBC can spend only $ 100 to set up a set, so it's too small and all the characters are constantly huddled into one another. It is an English castle of a fugitive village filled with white Caddyk castle, Styrofoam sculptures and bad lights. When penvensis walk around the woods - in fact, in any tree in the woods - they just feel as if they are walking around. <br /> <br /> The only thing that's worth seeing is that the BBC might burn the whole budget of a movie to build a cat. It looks good before you stop and begin talking, but you can not help the poor man who goes back in his lion suit after starting to move. Yes, if you're a fan of Narnia, you can see this version because Lewis has written every word, but Lewis is, of course, not a screenwriter and Dialogue does not feel the sense of dialogue when it comes to the screen. When the children are in Beavers and are preparing to escape wolves, Beaver is constantly stressed, "Oh, only ONE more, beloved, and then we will be ready", emphasized by children. concurrently crying and "No, Mrs. Beaver, PLEASE!" - a scene of funny relief, so incongruous (they are supposed to be packing or not wondering the sewing machine, it is supposed to be close to danger), drama sensitive that may be different from the scene. In fact, the whole film is peppered with the help of such artists. <br /> <br /> I recommend seeing New Narnia (Disney 2005). The New Nights of Narnia and the Narnia World, separated from the original portrait of Lewis (I think), with the new movie, refreshed effects, spectacular computer animation, great time and bright and scenic stealing, White Witch (playing with all sophistication of an experienced politician, unlike one banshee) fame Lucy has nothing to do with the many cuter (NO buck teeth, YAY!), Unique (and realist-sized) and Brittany BBC Edmund divine, the Edmund-Development Complex, which is at the forefront of the new Disney version with Hopeless-Hunger-acceptable and Angsting. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to everyone if you're a fun guy for the past movies.
