This difficult adaptation, one of the weakest novels by Martin Amis, is comparable to other narcotic substances such as "Requiem for A Dream" or something written by Irvine Walsh, as he struggles to decide if he is a fictional or hyper-realist does not begin to do so. <br /> <br /> A group of public schools directed by Mr. William Marsh, who are very saturated with colors, unite in a palace waiting for the appearance of three American friends to accept rotten medicines at the weekend. And that's it. Short-time-to-be-the-main-plot nonsense, an extremist religious group that expresses itself with a brutal murder of elite figures in the world, whether political or pampered, except for the ridiculous sub-plot. <br /> <br /> The Caucasian> was built before glory and before Jennifer Connelly, who said that this rubbish immediately changed agents when offered! Avoid it.
