<br /> <br /> The Pagemaster cheese has a really good film, hidden beneath the surface only. <br /> <br /> I've seen it this morning after waiting for a few years, for many years. When I first go out, I hate it with passionate hatred, but this time I saw that the special effects were good. The field is just a "The Neverending Story" with a creativity endectomy, but just a little flicker for anyone who really wants a really awesome eye sweater. The animation is beautiful, and I am glad that animators have been featured in a surrealistic way than norms. If I decided to wait for the movie to appear in a wise way, I would give it three degrees.
