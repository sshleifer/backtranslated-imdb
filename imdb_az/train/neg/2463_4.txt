I do not know how to describe this movie. Definitely one of the strangest films I have ever seen. In some cases, it is very uncomfortable, but it also works in other places. Dentist torture scenes are very complicated and can involve anyone in the stomach and spin. I found my teeth in one of the above-mentioned scenes. A clever thing about the movie is playing with our fears, and the Dentist is extremely uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> The humor of the film is hidden and can not be accepted by anyone. But when you are an admirer of strange and bizarre fun and clean drilled teeth is the movie you are looking for <br /> <br /> If you're reading a comment and feel the appeal of this kind of fun <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a bit strange for my tastes)
