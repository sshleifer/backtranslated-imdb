I found it to be a waste of time, effort, and money. I know that Disney has always had no creativity when preparing "straight-to-movies" - but with the "new perspective" the original film's scheme is at a low level ... soon, leaving the original movies with new animations and new songs, version ". Nathan Lane once returned to Timon's role as surprising. Timon and Pumbaa started a story journey from the original "Lion King" world of animated animals. We explain to us the original story as it really happened. <br /> <br /> Of course, Timon is now the hero of the story, memorable memory, blah blah ... <br /> <br /> Music followers are bare and the animation bends. Vocal talents are effective for a video feature, but still remember when you last saw Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane something of a genuine commercial item? Generally you will hate it if you like the original. This is an insult, because it is unfair to children and adults. And it summarized it.
