This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought it would be good for being a few of my favorite actors. Now I want to hit Jason Schwartzman because he takes this role. It was physically bad after watching this movie. Indeed, sometimes I do not understand Hollywood. A large number of people are trying to break, but I'm sure you can get off the top and get the best. In this way, the worst movie is Ferris Beullar instead of this sludge. It resembles pink puppets and removes jeans ads added to the movie's humor. I'm happy that I was away from this movie and watched it on TV. It is aware of your release from all the January prices.
