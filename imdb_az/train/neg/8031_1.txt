Nearly 60 years ago, "Animal Loss ..." (AHA-registered trademark) horse began to monitor the use of animals in movie production, jumping from the top of a cliff to hit Jesse James (1939). Of course, this treacherous act kills all the fun aspects of this movie for me. I suppose, at least, that the horse will not die in the loose, because the beginning of the community is that the film, starting with a whimsical and terrible pain, has caused the fame of the animals, but if it were the choice of a poor animal, that was certainly a way to take!
