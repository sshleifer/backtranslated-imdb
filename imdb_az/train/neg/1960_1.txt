I tried to finish this movie three times, but that's a terrible thing. The sting claim: The mother and daughter try to harass the strangers to the old-fashioned gas station where they have been kidnapped by the bed and breakfast, the gas stops, the B & B. He runs, leads the B & B, and wants to resort to the ballistic ballistics instead of the police, and the story continues with warm behavior on their parts. Wow. <br /> <br /> Another movement is more than logical deficiency. Operation is also warm and the next door neighbor's alert is really given in a very harsh and bad time. <br /> <br /> Powerful darkness / death moments are interwoven with warm, warm summers between heroes. more attention should be paid to less attention, mood and story.
