The guys who have never thought of watching this movie still have some trouble with their head. This movie has nothing to do with another Jackie's Ripper, which means a set of E-Grade movies, which means little in some sex scenes young people are traced before the waves of a tree near a nearby tree. It's not scary, funny, and fun. Indeed, if you feel like you are facing a single plot, watch Cabin Fever, at least the director did not fall asleep while driving that jack. In fact, there is nothing in your life, and Oprah Winfrey is crying on the television alone.
