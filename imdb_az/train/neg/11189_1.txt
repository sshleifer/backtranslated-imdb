Always use great movies that deal with the supernatural and deeper thoughts of the Spiritual world. But this film has just turned me in production and direction. There is nothing to discuss deeply what this story is about; it was a great deal of time and effort to put it on the big screen. Actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, had a remarkable performance in the UK on their native lands and we saw him in a "Still Standing" TV series. Heath Ledger played with a real bad guy and we saw him at Brokeback Mountain, '05, giving a great supportive role. Shannyn Sossaman (Mara Sinclair) did a good job of deceiving a priest from a church that was not known by any faith. Do not waste your time, you're upset!
