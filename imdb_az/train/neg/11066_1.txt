Before I watched "Dahmer," I thought it would not be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered". I was wrong. As for the amount of "Dahmer," there is a story about a homosexual killer who has almost no assassination, and it is almost entirely encumbered with homosexuals before Dahmer's assassination. There is no structure found and we have no intention of telling us anything about "Dahmer." She likes to have sexual relations with all the men you can get on Dahmer without watching this movie. Horrible moves, terrible management, terrible writing, terrible everything ... If you choose between "Dahmer" and intricate vomiting for three hours, go with vomiting ... do less pain .....
