I gave this loooooooooooong movie "2" for charming actors and semi-sexy lovers. Otherwise, if you can not read as fast reader, you'll never have subtitles that do not try to speak Spanish speed! And if you can not read subtitles, what happens on the front? Infinite eyes and curly eyes and persistent rejection. Do not drill just after an hour. Some good cinematography as well as some DARK screens are burning. This won something I would not understand. It's difficult to talk about "ACTING" because startup actors seem to be just looking at each other and showing love to one another when they do not push each other. The character Geraldo is very attractive, and it is difficult to believe that everyone will push him. What's next to her mother? I have three boys who seem to have a history with many, but I never knew who the "EX" was.
