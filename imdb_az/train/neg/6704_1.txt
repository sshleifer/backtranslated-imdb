It's just a terrible 'comedy' - a really bad movie. there is no funny element. No funny jokes. I do not know if some sad movie can be "smart" or "quality". perhaps the only film that a man can see is that of a brother. but I've seen thousands of good movies: that is leonard part six (now it's funny)! <br /> Do not know how our brothers are allowed to participate in the internet movie base? This is a cliche-ridden unfunny material that is more enjoyable than a root canal.
