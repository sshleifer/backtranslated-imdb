Before watching this movie, I read and I did not believe them. I love the talk movies and I've been waiting for them on average. It was not. This film looks like Camp Blood 1 and 2 adults. There is a bad film, poor sound, bad story, bad make-up, and I missed it so much that I let it go. Even nakedness was rubbish! Is there even a budget for this movie? I do not think they do it. In the first 5 minutes, you can tell whether you want this movie or not. If you want a good cheesy hero movie, look at the toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood. Prevent the Garbage - I was watching on television and feeling twisted, so do not waste anything. The best part is probably the end.
