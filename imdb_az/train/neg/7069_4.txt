The movie was the biggest hit when released and soon became the Blockbuster. But honestly, the film is a laughable hour with a plot that glorifies a loser. The film has an Tag-line - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara", Love Shows, but the sacrifice is Immortal. The protagonist of the film (Ganes), although loving one another, sacrifices his love for the leading lady (Pooja Gandhi)! Its justification means the tagline. This film has affected many young, broken hearts that have found this "dignified offer" very thoughtful and therefore turned into a cult film that can move on to their lives. Gangsters move in the movie, Amateur, Cranberries and Childishly are stupid. When it's time to look all sleek and cool, a song, (Onde Ondu Sari ...) looks a funny one. His appearance does not help the lead role. Most of the film's hairstyle is bad. POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT. His suits are terribly and very incompatible in the film. <br /> <br /> A good thing about the film is the perfect cinematography and brilliant music by Mano Murthy, the beauty of the film's true savings. Jayant Kaikini's words are well written. Director Yoqraj Bhat is forced to portray his songs with pleasure. <br /> <br /> In any case, except for songs, all the stories, the movie is a very common thing !!!!!!
