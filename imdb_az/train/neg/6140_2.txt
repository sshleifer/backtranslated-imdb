This movie is cheerful. The problem is not a comedy. A classic scene takes place in the center of a village square of Kurt Thomas to find a pommel horse (he uses to shut down bad guys). Includes another "Crazies Village". Too bad this movie has not been made to be a farce or may have earned better degrees.
