The film is a long story of a classic novel that does not miss the spirit of the original adventure. <br /> <br /> English hero Allan Quatermain plays the role of a fearsome American Patrick Swayze, despite the nation's openness. <br /> <br /> The film sits more comfortably on Hollywood than the mold. The film is predictable to those who are not familiar with the story and are filled with a series of extremely ill-intentioned and extremely ill-fated followers. <br /> <br /> Generally, a terrific addition to the legend of King Solomon Mines and Allan Quatermain's pretty bad collection of films.
