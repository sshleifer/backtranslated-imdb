It is intended only to expose (or to entertain) the intelligent person who respects himself. The director's layout did not like the headline character, but it would be good, but I know that there is nothing like Hollywood director who criticized the American Marxist 60s, but I know that he did not shoot a movie about 70s. There is a very strange dialogue here, and sometimes I thought I was watching a comedy. Would not you be guilty of thinking that this is a satire? How naive the movie is. Spacek has become a part of the soloist film, which brings me a clear and inevitable consequence of being a Hollywood liberal moron of red hick. But it is almost not all of them? Beautiful fungi, but for brains.
