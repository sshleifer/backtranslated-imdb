Elephants Dream is a leading project of open source community. Though it was a very interesting idea in understanding, in fact it did not succeed badly. <br /> <br /> The film can be shown in a beautiful way, it's probably just evolving. However, a big problem is the great bloom of light. There is a terrible thing, though, that helps bring this movie to a sleepless quality. <br /> <br /> One thing to note is that it is a terrible sound. Although the progoud voice actor is at least half adult, Emo is a voice actor HORRIBLE. When you know that you have a zero-equal budget, you will not be able to hire real voice actors. <br /> <br /> Generally, the movie really does not go anywhere. It seems to me that this is a movie instead of a real movie. There is still no place and you have failed to show a really interesting point. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTOSESSION </ font> </ font> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
