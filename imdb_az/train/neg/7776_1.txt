What a garbage burden .. I can not describe how awful this movie is. The rating here is hard to believe. <br /> <br /> Do not escape ... especially if you enjoy the first ginger. The first one was well-written, well-directed, well-executed. A brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere. Secondly, it was a 'alit' and was worthy of a self-extracting film, but it is not clear to the first level ... Thirdly, the series is an insult to the period. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the incomplete indigenous Americans mythology. Sisters have no real story, no progress or even a clear link ... They try to survive and try to be "together forever." <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> The movement was terrible - as girls turned around, they did not regularly there is a candlelight arrangement made by a mysterious native American woman sitting there to see people who are invisible from the ground and to go to a conversation. The sets were terrible, actually, based on a clear group of people, it did not really help. Also, there was consistent snow outside the camp, but it was not a trail (not). <br /> <br /> Arrghh,, so bad! I really hope they will be as good as at least the second.
