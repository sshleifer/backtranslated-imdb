With all the 88-year-old slashers it's over, so it's time to disassociate these old-fashioned movies. Brain was well-designed, the script reminded me of Videodrom, but it's more cheesy as before. The player can go with him. But this is a laughing effect, a Brain called a turkey and blood is never shown. The sequence of opening is what is capable of watching this movie, the hallucinations are really beautiful and reminded of the Nightmare on Elm Street, remember that the phone will be alive .... Someone will wait for the next, and you will remember how to watch this flick. It may seem to all the strangers that there is nothing there, and that there is no blood, or that there is nudity for the devils. I've seen films worse than this movie, but he just wanted to make it bloody ...
