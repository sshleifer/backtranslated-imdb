The first clue you are in this joyful movie is that it is filmed rather than a movie. The story is complicated, and production is strange. It should be noted that the principal couples are shown in Vermont, when they are on an airplane to celebrate their relationship in a civilian union, when the plane entered the airport surrounded by palm trees. The ceremony - Vermont - in the garden of tropical plants, as well as the palm, will not last for five minutes in the New England climate. Strikes on another plane trip illustrate the removal of a FedEx cargo plane. Surely they will be able to travel only on the road. As for the site, this movie is waiting for you to believe that Arthur's brother, a Christian brother of Arthur, was abducted when he learned that his brother was gay. Not only that, but at the end of the pastor, Victor builds with Ben and Arthur a crushing man who killed "the souls of sin". Apparently, no one in this church has heard the Ten Commandments. If it were not for Jamie Brett Gabel, who was surprisingly effective as Arthur, it would not have any indisputable quality.
