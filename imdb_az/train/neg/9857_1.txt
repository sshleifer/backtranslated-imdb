<br /> <br /> I watched this movie and found that it was not just funny. <br /> <br /> I'm not the RPG Gamer (not the type of computer, the DnD desktop item), but I've never found any jokes. <br /> <br /> It seemed to drag some of the scenes (tilt and more than a minute Could be downloaded for 5 seconds) and the director <br /> <br /> I think he laughed in the whole movie for only 2-3 times. <br /> <br /> The game itself was not bad, it was around. <br /> <br /> <strong> It is a standard that should be at the "B" level. <br /> <br /> You're a big fan of DND and do not worry about this movie since it's getting better today.
