I'm honest, that's the first 5 of the worst films I've ever seen. Partly because of seriousness, it's not about regular heartbreaking garbage, it wants to emotionally participate in filming, feeling characters, and caring about alleged conspiracy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2.) MTV revealed in the style of the camerawork. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> church conspiracy, stigmata or a movie about ownership. So what do you think? They were united! Aetheist is the owner of a dead person and then shows him a stigma to expose a church conspiracy. It will never be explained, even spoken, by how much a person can pass through his death and that he possesses another man through imagination. Instead of just saying what he wants to say, he gives him a Stigmata. WHY? Why not just shed it? Instead, we interfere with scenes that start screaming in noisy voices, encrypted messages in cars, and write messages on the walls. Apparently, this priest was also a violent man, because the young lady who had been awakened on several occasions was talking about this cliched, harsh, "possessed" voice that we all heard. This also begins to bother my second complaint, because when a young woman comes to stigmata, she also violates the rules of gravitation and puts everything and all the surrounding people in a quake. Why does this happen? Who knows!?! I guess the director thought he was "cool". These films, of course, do not show anywhere and, of course, the shooting of flying birds in slow motion, and in the most boring way, drops of water. This woman's apartment is always a drop of water! CONTACTS! Logically, the place would likely be split into many holes. To finish the complaint, to the end and for no reason, the camera slows down, but on the contrary, the water drops! WHY ?! I have no idea! <br /> <br /> 3) One of the main heroes says he has been a priest to explain because he has nothing to do with anything and I'm talking about it again. holes in science. This is not logical for me. It is enough to go to church, but it must pass through all the rigorousness of being spiritual. I just do not take it. Second, we will work on the polling stations in many polling stations. For beginners, when you get the stigma for the first time, the scene ends unconscious, bleeding. After that he was in the hospital. Who called the ambulance? To the other, the character of the "scientific priest" mentioned in the preceding verse speaks to the end of the conversation with the soul that has the girl. He said, "Take me as a prophet!" It is not a word to quote but you get ideas. His answer? "There is no faith, only doubts!" So he owns the aetheist! An aetist has little faith in any scientific priest! And then, the purpose of this film's conspiracy is to have local bookstores that believe in the Lost Gospel (Holy Tomas). The heroes are ready to kill you to stop these documents, but you can go to the bookstore and buy it. <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ font> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; br /> In the end, this movie is a magnificent This is a dream that I feel I should insult every chance I have been cursing Final Level: F.
