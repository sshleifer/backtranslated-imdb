Assassin Hauser's (John Cusak) task is to split the Middle East oil minister in the name of Omar Sharif (Neikov) in the country of Turks, controlled by America's interests.

There is not much here: government, politics, music, war, people who are not accepted by the society, and I remembered it as a "war." And we are here - a very boring film is brought to life with a very bad nightmare. I'm still asking myself to continue on the DVD. Besides, there are many members of the Cusak family, John Cusak is ashamed of the family, or is it me? <br /> <br /> This was a John Cusak movie, a bit ruthless and eventually pretty good. Not here.

Maybe. It's been a long time since the last 15 minutes to hit the forgotten shot. Meanwhile, there is a sense of humor among all the people in the iron. And between chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I do not think so, but you know: boy? it was a girl's job and they needed something to spend more time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Duff and Kingsley's performances were good.

But I am sure some will praise these efforts, but if a flower is still a flower from another name, it is a mixture <br /> <br /> Remind me that I continued on the DVD. The story was hoping to save themselves and save themselves. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: Nudity: No. Language: Yes.
