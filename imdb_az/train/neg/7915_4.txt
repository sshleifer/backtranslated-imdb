All of the X-Men films were great. I want to say, from all, including long-lasting X-Men 3. They had solid heroes (Magneto and Xavier were the best in my opinion) and a good story arch. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled when I heard that this movie was in production, and my expectations were bigger and bigger than ever before. <br /> <br /> Hug Jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie is Fountain, but you do not hear about this movie while talking about an actress) and his actor <br /> <br /> How much fun do the film shoots? <br /> <br /> All the films are packed with lots of meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot (Blob or Gambit) to think there is nothing in the film creators. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of XMe, I have read many, read many of their stories, and this film did not respect any of them. There is no. Not even durability. The gun X project or the connection of Wolverine and Sabretooth or Emma Frost, motivation for wolverine is a straight betrayal and is seen in millions of films: revenge for the death of one loved one. <br /> <br /> Oh. For all the darn film, I was expecting Berseker for Wolverine, Styker, when she arrived at the school, as she did at X2 in school, she also silenced the enemy forces, but hey, this Fox, this family flicker and you will not see open violence from the most violent and terrible Marvel hero. <br /> <br /> Along with this, I have had a constant dej√° feeling with this movie because Wolverine's roots are already explained in X2 <br /> <br /> I personally need wolverine a solid back story one of the few characters that I do not hear, I believe that there is a humanoid skeleton. Because of the character of the mystery. Do you really want to know how the joker gets traces?
