This film depicts a bold and ready-made "ladie's man" bachelor, ready to be ready for everything once and for all. However, as I did not care about his character, I did not expect a fall from my mission. I do not understand what these beautiful women do. He was absolutely no class or crisp. He had to have a path to himself, who at least had a weakening of women apart from his knee-knit voice. She is a musician and does not have sex with her. Undoubtedly, her work was intense and ridiculous to get the attention of a loved one in her five minutes she knew. How shame does this man have? <br /> <br /> Gina Gershon's character was an unusual Englishman. He was weakened and stopped, and by saying stupid things would be more attractive as a character, but, unfortunately, his character was soft and boring. <br /> <br /> Sometimes he was out of the noisy place of normal conversation, rather than a poor English password that he could not get out of the movie. <br /> <br /> He was a fish and a frog. Now it was the two chemistry! Academy nomination for both! STAT! Artistic holes, lack of character development, horrible movements, unnecessary drama, clich√© moments ... The worse the film.
