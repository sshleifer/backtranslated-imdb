this show is awful. no comedy, no good characters. America gives you awards for real shows. I hate this show along with 30 rock. I'm glad you honestly canceled this show. Thank you CBS. holding two and a half men, keeping Kristini, following the engagement rules, is not really funny but just keeps getting to know your mom who is so entertaining. this show is the way friends go astray. It's good with the same director. but this show has gone and never come back. has never been. I did not give it 1 rating so I could keep my awakening, not sleep. I'm a movie or television show featuring a movie. The only reason I was still awakening was because of the laughter of the audience and I was waiting for the next show. I am very happy that this show was a funny apology, but my idea was foolish. very stupid I do not see anyone loving him. I think again. but I can find the big bang theory at the cinema. my evil is clever. Bye bye of the class now I have a smile and not watch your show.
