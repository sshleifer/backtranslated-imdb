It was a really bad movie. The character Cole, played by Michael Moriarty, is the biggest cause of this floppy, and the actor feels that this character will be worse by gathering an incredibly difficult southern square. I asked for a 20-minute conversation therapist. <br /> <br /> - 1) has acted badly; 2) non-sympathetic characters; 3) razor's gentle line line <br /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
