I really really disappointed with this movie. it really started well and made some nice atmosphere and endurance, but when it finally came round to detect the "monster" ... appeared in psychological terms with recurring problems .... Who is it? <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> It's pretty creepy, but the movie is a hire, but it is that the wolf is human, bent, demented, freakish. <br /> <br /> Because, a few days before today, there are some things in this movie that make no sense. (Spoilers) <br /> <br /> Why does hell kill the freedom of safety? Indeed, "I am not a PSYCHO, and I live here!" Is there any other point of dignity than a great respectable registration? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> the unexpected opening in the tunnel left him frustrated ... he was munching all the rats and then why they hang around him? Why is it so cursed to kill? <br /> <br /> The DVD's commentary says that it violates non-psychological characters in the film. Designed to empathize with Creep, but it only curses me. He has a fairly effective film, but it makes me sick so he has spent a lot of time.
