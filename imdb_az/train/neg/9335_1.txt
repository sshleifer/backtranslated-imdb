The reason for this is a bad film is very bad, and this is entirely the fault of the Hack novelist Robert James Waller, the author of the Madison District Bridges. The writing is elegant, because the plot is perfectly elegant and dialogue is wooden and incredible. An unsuccessful couple, a banned American writer and a beautiful Mexican woman with her embarrassing date, is swamped by a powerful, self-directed criminal and, after a few exhibits (rather horrible violence) show the hot side of a conspirator, she is a bad person he leaves his strong partner for the murderer who is more clearly seen than anyone else. Nothing can help the success of this movie, not even the murderer of Scott Glenn, but Giovanna Zuzaria as Luz, not as an attractive Latin, but Harvey Keitel's short-term performance as a CIA expert. Serious loss of time.
