This film would be better, especially given the talent. Laren Tate's Frankie Lymon images were not particularly good in music performances. He does not synchronize well and his scenes Larenz Tate should be Frankie Lymon. Written on Hollywood, described by a group of women as a gold digger. The undoubtedly pushed powers, however, have made the characters more real. The positives of the movie were the portraits of Miguel Nunez's Little Richard and Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon, even in a conservative role, is usually an eye-opener. Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox's talent is very bad. All Frankie Lymon Saga was interested in real life. This film was a very profitable opportunity.
