If you like infinite dialogue, like the story and entertaining camera effects, you will be delighted with the movie, like scenic passages at the Angelo television show. To me? Everything I wanted was a beautiful, intense small story, and it was not there. The change was practically backward, the point points were buried in an unnecessary sea, and there was no feeling of fear or tension. <br /> Is this Wendigo? No, it's a fast operator. This is not intimidating. It does not create a tension or atmosphere when you're scared by MTV. Before me, like these reviewers, I ended up that the film was deeply laughing at the audience. <br /> Terrible movie.
