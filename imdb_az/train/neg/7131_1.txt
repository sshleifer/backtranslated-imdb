I love bad movies. I want to shoot bad movies with my friends and want to break them down for their duration. So, there are such treacherous films. <br /> <br /> Redline is not just a bad movie, but the American film industry is a sign that the viewer must ask for at least scriptwriting before finishing a movie. <br /> <br /> A stereotype of Hell, this movie would come from that. The story is unbearable and everyone around is laughable. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin may have the worst screen chemistry I've ever seen in a good time, and they must be separated from human beings separately and be beaten with a bag they carry, they may be legitimate). Moreover, Angus Macfadyen was pleased to do this movie, even though I do not even think of a similarity. <br /> <br /> Therefore, despite this issue, many people want to take revenge for different reasons (and if you have enough care to know how much you care about me, you are a bigger person) is converted. The film, like Ouroboros, is like a snake that squeezes its tail, an infinite period of confusion and dialogue that is inappropriate for human ears. This film is a big car trade for the first half and a fuzzy motion movie for the rest, should not be spent in any way and in any way. <br /> <br /> I want to find a positive side <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I hope Nadia Bjorlin, if you play these two songs in this movie then you hack and I hope that old age breaks you. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. Listen to lyrics for Nadia Bjorlin's author's songs, if you're looking for a movie laughable experience.
