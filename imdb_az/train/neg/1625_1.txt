When I was in school, I filmed about a few people around and around the trees, not just an unfinished aesthetic strategy, but the clich√© of Canadian cinema: adjustable simple liras, empty, stabs loaded in public statement. But I feel better than I've ever seen since my own movie failure ... this is ... something. In short, the mine missed 85 minutes, not 20 minutes, and had more content: every point here is filled with four, five or six unstable minutes. The male ability is incredible, and the philosophical concepts derived from the T-pub include a brown-beating, loudmouthed in the drama class, and it's a lot of space to hate us. Of course, if he did not have such a pit, the third would be less logical. Because a few bizarre dudes 'exploits' have shown to provide remote and completely useless approaches; but watching the reptiles in the cafe is not easy, say "please" until the magazine ends. I'm returning what I say about AUTUMN BORN, which, at least, is my misbegotten lechery courage: this kinematic crater is the worst Canadian movie of all time and will remain. At least I really hope.
