When I was first in secondary school in 1978, I saw this movie. I got a date to see this. It was not going to me because it was too bad. Joan Rivers' career was not as bad as it deserved after this terrible, unfunny one was mentioned. In fact, unfunny is not a hard time enough: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! It has been beaten before you begin to feel like any laugh that might happen. This interest is not worth watching, or in any sense it is "bad-it-good". Even the bunch of MST3K would not be able to watch these values! Protecting Billy Crystal from this early suicide attempt is a miracle.
