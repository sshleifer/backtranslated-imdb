Includes some non-realistic movie spoilers. <br /> <br /> From the real-life experiences, this movie has since been thrilled. Right now I have been living in Iraq as a pedestrian in my second tour. This movie is close to events that will take place in real life. A few names since the beginning: Bomber car, EOD elements rolled solo with no escorts, sergeant of EOD squad shook VBC, rolled in ACUs with his arms all over the clock, $ 2,000 pilgrimage, sniper scene. The list will continue, but there is no need to mention things that are wrong for 2 minutes before the more things are wrong; <br /> <br /> This film is to watch for people and critics that they have no understanding or experience with locals or military units. <br /> <br /> Will be disappointed with military roots or military defiance.
