Okay, when I sold the EVP, I was struggling to deny that the movie would lie to me mostly from get-go. <br /> <br /> However, this is not a good idea, even with the admitted film. It has been developed and functioned efficiently, but it does not really capture you. <br /> <br /> There are moments of jumping, and I looked at them and did not say, "Yes, I did not expect it." <br /> <br /> Also, the resolution is not logical. If he is able to do things that are behind it, then why hell should use a proxy? Moreover, the last chapter was absurd. Certainly, they put it as part of the film, claiming there is "the whole thing", but it really needs to be in the beginning. But they can not put it down at the outset because they give it the idea ... at the end they stick it, they just stay in the wound.
