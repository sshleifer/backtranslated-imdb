There was so much hope for this movie because I was very pleased with the book. But I do not think I will understand the fundamentals of the film if I do not read books. The film is a noble attempt to show the desperation of people trying to break ties with the government, but the book reflects the sufferings better. Corrupt government officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, but common people are trying to get their naked needs to survive. Perhaps, most people think this way against leaders and leaders, whether they are really oppressed or repressed. Orwell dystopia may exist in many of our modern worlds. She has been reading for a few years since I've read the book, but it's referring to Big Brother, Thought Police and Newspeak in the press and casual conversation. Perhaps many people who use these conditions do not know where the terms come from. I strongly recommend you read the book.
