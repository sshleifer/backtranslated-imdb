Like Freddy's Revenge, this is a pretty strange idea later, and does not take a long time to squeeze a story. Basically, Alice is pregnant 4 and is staged by her baby Freddi and gives her a speech to follow her friends. This leads to the least death of the entire series, and wise cracks are very poor, because no fan of fun, or comedy, is happy. <br /> <br /> We're not saying a lot about that. Seeing Alice and Dane's four characters, but not worth watching a movie. Uninspiring and unenjoyable, maybe only the competitive edge protects the worst of the array.
