<br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> br /> Total score for this movie. 4/10. Do not waste your time with this movie, do not waste it. I gave 4 films for this movie and it could be a lot. The characters are really exaggerated in what they can be in real life, and some pretty unexplained things happen "in a staggering way", not in a good way. After 30 minutes (very special effects: slow movements and camera shaking and fast forward), this film was shot. It's always good to use music to correct the story, but it's a lot of music. In the first hour there are almost 50/50 dialogues and music
