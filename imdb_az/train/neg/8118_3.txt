Yes, EYEBAY, I have to say that if someone follows me individually and tries to force me, it's especially a person who looks smart. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, there is a place I love most. I love the opera- tion films, especially if they do good, and I love films that do not have many movements. Sorry, but Secret and Lies are not in this category and are just a very bad movie. I really do not see many non-American films, maybe they've kept me and did not realize what really was bad foreign movies when I saw the Secrets and Lies. Probably, if I judge foreign movies with a different standard, then I can see Secrets and Lies as one of the highest rated films in the IMDB. Hmm ... True, this is very scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new e-mail)
