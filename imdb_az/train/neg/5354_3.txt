Lack of a good plot, lack of decent action, lack of good cinematography, lack of decent SPECIAL EFFECTS ... Should I continue? Review can be SPOILERS. Actors seem to read their lines and are not very good. The majority of "actors" acted as SECOND GRADE. It turned out that the story was written by one of the aforementioned second-grade pupils ... this is not necessarily a thing of the past ... it is just something that is thought to be missing, because it thinks it believes something is missing. On the contrary, this is completely unhappy as you think. I do not understand the "movie", and I know it's STUNK! Most people in the movie were sitting around conversations (read their lines), TRYING to appear bad. The announcer was ANNOYING. "Special effects" were LAUGHABLE. I love low budget movies. I like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry, and Michael Berrymore ... THIS is not in the film ... they can say that they did not pay, or do not pay too much, because their hearts are what? There were talents. I love Tony Todd ... but, he just had enough in this movie. In fact, Tony Todd's performance gave it to 1 instead of 1 to 1 ... and Tony was only in a TWO MINUTES (seriously)! I would recommend the DVD to move quickly to the Tony Todd segment for two minutes. When I went to the theater and had paid more than the DOLLARs to see this "movie", I would have been P.O. and I had requested my money back. Hopefully, the people who do it will work better next time.
