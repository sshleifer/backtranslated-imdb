This is definitely the worst movie ever seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was there, he thought he would not be a very bad movie because he was in a very decent film, and he was a pretty fair actor. Lying! No one should spend time in this movie. I reached a speed of 80 percent and I do not think I left anything.
