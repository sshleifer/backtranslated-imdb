Even anyone who remotely can tell me that he likes movies that I love for big movies and I can finally say one of the legendary bad movies of all time: MYRA BRECKINRIDGE. Star studded MYRA BRECKINRIDGE, a adaptation of Gore Vidal's best-selling book (later denied this version of the movie), is really a movie that stays amusing from start to finish. Sex change operations and Hollywood-related X-rated movies were an absolute disaster and were almost smashed by screenwriters as well as the audience when they were released. Not surprisingly, the film began to earn a legendary religious status near the movie lovers and I was really excited to see it for the first time ever <br /> <br /> Director Michael Sarne (who just gave the previous two previous loans) he took a lot of sliding and in honesty, he does not seem to be a clue about what he wants to achieve. The film is often unequivocal, and in a sequence all sorts of scenes come together in a half-mysterious way that it will not fall into an incomprehensible situation. It's also an illusion to use the Fox movie vaults to archive images and add them to your pictures on a regular basis. There are archival pictures of old movie stars, such as Judy Garland and Shirley Temple, which means that frequently inserted sexual acts enter the new movie scenes and the process does not work just as it is intended (for example, Temple and Loretta Young sued the studio). <br /> <br /> Perhaps, Sarni is not the only person accused of shocking many audiences with the film's scenario and shooting. The leaders of disbelief. For example, this film will ask you to believe that screenwriter film critic Rex Reed (the first and last film role) can be a sex-change operation and will appear as a beautiful sex goddess Raquel Welch? The film tries to capture Myra's film school as a film school, by legendary director John Huston, to deceive a nubile female filmmaker (Farrah Fawcett) and teach a bad boy living at school. (Roger Herren) a lesson by raping a belt-dildo. Did anyone pursue this? <br /> <br /> And it gets better (or worse, depending on your perspective)! I have not yet celebrated the most acclaimed star in the film: the thirteenth legendary screen symbol, Mae West! In this film (he retired for 26 years), as he has seen, he still plays as a motivating talent agent for tall men (including young men). Tom Selleck). It's not as bad as the sound-snow-right movie really plays the newest songs about half of the movie, and I've been suffering from permanent brain damage to them! <br /> <br /> Naturally, none of these tastes are like anything that a human being would describe as "good", but I'll give MYRA BRECKINRIDGE 10 to 4 because I'm always sick when I'm in Hell I did not think what would happen. Also, most of the casting really works. Especially, Raquel resembles a kind of hell to draw something out of the bad writing. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; Dear John Huston there are some funny moments, Rex Reed is not bad for the non-actor, and Farrah Fawcett is pleasantly fresh and pleasing, but Roger Herren is also good, but still in another movie (he did not succeed in racing by Raquel Welch) Everyone would have mentioned above, that when Mae West agreed to accept the film, he had completely gone out of his mouth - but that was fun for those who love bad movies.
