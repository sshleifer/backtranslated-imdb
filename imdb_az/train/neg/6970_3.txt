Now if I started a little about my title, it would be some sort of clich√©, so I'm not expecting it. First, this film surprised the children why they did the stupid things like walking around the lab and breaking the glass. Then I understood that this is a message with a message that the children eats the message, and such things will not happen. What are you asking? Things like a giant insect monster are growing and typically lead to a slight mood before it dies from the "killing the monster". Now, as time is ... In Blue Monkey ... There is nothing blue in it, there are all kinds of Simian. Now I snot like something deceived or something. The picture on the cover was a huge bug / crab / idiot / thing that followed the shouting nurses. It was a ridiculous thing, but I wanted the monkeys! only a few days ago (most of the Cask and Creame's semi-drunk in the effort of brandy) were more moody in the style of more than 80 monkeys hijacks. Not much. If you want snowy monkeys or blue things, this movie is not for you. If you have good reasons to shoot bugs and guys, rent it.
