The faces are collapsed, the throats are cut, the blood flows, and the three main characters are pressed or dying. Even Kevin Costner exploded the dog with a shotgun. Why would you like to see such a movie? Violence is only valid when good guys kill bad guys, but not on the other hand. Take an example of Underworld and Underworld Evolution where demons are killed when you can enjoy justice. In this movie good guys are cut. See the difference? Why does everyone want to shoot a heavy film on the audience? A good photography and a similar film is a talented edit loss of talent. Put them in the category of subtle body.
