Oh, the spirit of '68. The streets of Paris fled rebelliously, the hippies were on the spirit of love. How did Britain declare this age of radicalism and revolution? Erm, with his appearance, dear old Blighty, focused on filming boys about boarding schools. If ... bad structure. It is the revolt of the oppressed. <br /> <br /> With Lindsay Anderson's performance, you will never feel excited at all times, never, never, at all times. Malcolm McDowell, Lenin and other left-wing radicals, as one of the special school pupils decorating the country. This is an anti-organizational film in the description of the Upper Class Oxides that manages the radical and anti-autocratic practice of a clear public school standard. Whatever he does ... unusual, despite all his radical sympathies, it does not have a great sense of tension between the human dignity and the despotic school system, instead of just doing it: <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> Surrealist bits are sometimes wasted and missed, and the film is re-painted in black and white (budget budgets or arty expression?). All the young rebels we get are a terrible crime they have reached for the rifles and hit the shady overlap of the structure. Hooray! A revolution! <br /> <br /> If ... if it were a strong political statement, it would accelerate and collect just about anything. In the end, a direct sense of interest. Instead of proving the dissident zeitgeist of the 60s of the past years, he is a document that deals only with top-level English education. Anarchy? Apatiya is more likely to be followed by just a few people watching the audience ... Lindsay Anderson will be.
