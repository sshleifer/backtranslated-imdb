Completely forgotten. Especially poorly functioning. The first film I've ever seen with Dax Shepard. My surprise was around the end of the 1990s. Her player was so soft that I thought he was a new player. I can also say about Liv Tyler. Despite being well-versed in other films, Clare Cooper gave a strange personality. Liv was a flamboyant actor like Diane Keaton, but not an actress with a sense of personality, it was pretty strange to say his lines in the whisper mode. As it turned out, there was not a very good chemistry amongst actors, and I think Diane Keaton felt it. He was a fantastic actress, but it appeared a bit above the film. He just wanted to get this movie as soon as possible. I do not blame him.
