I can not vote on this subject because I will not watch these people's trash. I took my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and drank that I would not do it again. It is my civil duty to help people move away from this pit. Go to the forums in this movie, and read the places where cast members are trying to make the movie for the first time. A man even responds to himself ... using the same name! There are some people who say that the forum is as good as Shawshank Redemption and Citizen Kane ... Even in no way. If this company has a 2nd movie, it should be better than the first one. That is, the 3rd movie should be better. No, I saw it. I do not want to know how to spread this waste using the same names all the time. It's nice to have fun with friends for a weekend and shoot a movie ... but do not try to sell this garbage!
