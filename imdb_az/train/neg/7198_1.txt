There was great hope for this flick after the jungle's live-action George, the witch's witch. A great disappointment. The theme is naked, badly-acting, poor visual effects. This film was based on a lying liner, an ironic (and meaningless) product, and the gadget was the most delicious, most annoying side-shot in the car's way. I took two young children to see him and enjoyed their minds. The only laugh from this film was a bad wait when someone in need of a smile in brown!
