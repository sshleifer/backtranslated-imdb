One of the movies I see is almost at the bottom (the Haunted Mansion is not surprising, but some others continue to dive). In this hurry, the story is weak and the events described are weak. Of course, we should put some of them on the doorstep of the book writer. The film was filmed after the film, it was very offensive and unreasonable. Oprah gives a beautiful look like Bigger's mother, but not her potential. Other famous performers are in the worst case. The area around an African American who decides to start working as a driver. The family's daughter gets acquainted with a communist dinner. Something leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family working is not against brothers, but she thinks. So when he came home he slept in bed, but caterwauling begins. Kor's mother (yes) listens to this, so Bigger tries to silence her, but instead shouts her. Now, fearing the killing of her white daughter, she does what she can to reasonably think - she shades the coal stove. Thus, the investigators carry out the work of a missing person and check the firewood (if there is no chance of getting rid of the sting, then they are arrested, if the last hour or so, there are seamless segments of the courtroom). Desperate for a bad movie, you can do this job, but there are better options if you want to learn about cultural issues in the 40s and 50s or learn a good drama.
