Robert DeNiro plays the most incredibly clever uneducated of all time. This movie is very talented, it's really disgusting. The scenario is incredible. The dialogue is incredible. The nature of Jane Fonda is funny, not cartoon. The film moves rapidly, snorts, and imperfits. The book also includes every click. Swoozie Kurtz is an excellent supportive role, but what is it? <br /> <br /> The scales are frustrating, and this is the new IMDB rule, which requires 10 lines per review. When a movie is not worth it, it does not require 10 liters of text to know that other readers have time and loss of cassette. Avoid this movie.
