The individual's vision of hell is locked in a room where I can shut my eyes and close my ears and do not have the opportunity to play that film for eternity on every surface existing in that room. The whole concept of Streisand a guy / man begins with the scratching of the surface of this movie, which is so funny. The most important thing to watch any movie is the term "stopping those who are kufr". . . it's impossible to do this in this movie.
