Dark Rising is your typical filthy, obviously often produced fright / fantasy / fantasy movie. There is a strange, unobserved area with a large gap that you can fit into one nest. I did not know what hell was, but when it was really insignificant, it was often a sudden savage hunter who returned from the dimension of the hell to save the story of courage and a bad book with a bad book, in the sense that the elements and symbols that were meaningless or totally disappeared. The player is bad, but I do not know what to do with this script right now. Perhaps there are several top-notch scenes that are the only cause of this bad movie (like many other bad movies). Give this one if nothing else in T.V.
