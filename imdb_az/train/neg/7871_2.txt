In 1993, "visitors" were a great trick in France. Thus, consistency was inevitable, and, unfortunately, this sequence is one of the worst things that have been prepared. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not keep its promise. Indeed, one story should be explained. Jan Reno should go in the 20th century and take back the Christian Claudius in the Middle Ages because the time may normally correspond to his course. The problem is Clavier's sense of comfort in the world in the twentieth century and makes it difficult for him to return in the Middles era ... Instead, the film continues with a few other stories without fulfilling its main points. area. As a result, the film is sometimes confusing, sometimes a mixture. <br /> <br /> But the film is suffering from nearly all actors. Reno and Clavier are trapped, but they will be able to escape in the first movie: they go from above and become annoying. Why did the film maker Jean-Marie Poire deal with Muriel Robin in the main role of a woman? He was wrong because he was in bad condition and completely miserable. Other actors are no better: Marie-Anne Chazel is non-existent and Christian Bujeau is unbearable. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are a few good moments with film-enabled gags, but often fall into vulgarity and ease. Certain sequences and dialogues are affected. Poir√© takes the idle time as he recovers the elements that succeeded in the first film. So a young girl gets Reno for her family's close relative and asks her to attend her wedding. <br /> <br /> An honest and ghostly follow-up. In any case, what are the other commercial interests of this movie? <br /> <br />
