To be terribly honest ... I liked watching Severed. That's why <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> This movie was a ROTO to watch. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> is not really important, <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> there is a supernatural twist ... no one sees it. <br /> <br /> Even on many memorable scenes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No one sees,. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < and had the compositional knowledge. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < br /> Go to this movie and rent it. Support such movies - they are hoot and <br /> a case!
