I thought this movie was not morally wrong. So how do you feel when your fiancee leaves you for your brother on your wedding day? I was in the heart! It is classified as a comedy, but I could not find any comic. In my opinion, it has basically found cheap laughs and has taken them. I usually love Julie Stiles, but this is no exception. Jason Lee, once again proves that in another shameful show, class and decent morals are not essential in today's society. I do not like taste and I hate similar movies. People realize that they are going to defend this movie, and this is morally just because it is 'One Movie', but I still think that this bad behavior should not be shown on the screen. If you like this movie, everyone likes this movie, and you like some of this movie, I say that the characters in this movie are ashamed of acting in the real world.
