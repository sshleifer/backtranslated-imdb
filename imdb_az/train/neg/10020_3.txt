Vijay Krishna Acharya's 'Tashan' is a extreme, stylized product. You are sure of one of his most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this opinion. Why? The script is like a 2 year old baby. The comedy is king, it can not do anything, even the greatest director of all time without a good script. Ta≈üan is produced by the most successful production flag seen in 'Yash Raj Films' and 'Mega Stars'. If the script is moderate, nothing on earth can save you. Leave it! <br /> <br /> Performance: Anil Kapoor, a veteran player. But how could one make a good job? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact he is the only savior of saving. Kareena Kapoor never looked so warm. It looks stunning and leaves you, all of them are standing up. Saif Ali Khan does not take up his position here. <br /> <br /> The film "Tasan" is a boring movie. Stay away from the lack of movies in the box office.
