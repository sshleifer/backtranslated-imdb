This was the worst movie I ever saw. I watched him with a large group of comrades and did not understand the plot after one of us. Apart from the lack of entrepreneurship, the player was embarrassed, the "special effects" were not so special, and the writing was terrible. The only factor of the film's recycling is quite laughably incredibly bad. Players can not help to escape on a zombie while playing a malicious dialogue. I do not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie, but it is something that a group of friends can come together to get a good smile. Now I ran away from my 10 friends and 1 out of 1.
