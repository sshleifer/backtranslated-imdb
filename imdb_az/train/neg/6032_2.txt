I believe in the abandoned theology. <br /> <br /> I think it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After falling behind, this situation fell short. The first is radically separated from the book. Sometimes it is made to mix a 400-page novel for a two-hour movie, but in this movie I've seen no changes. <br /> <br /> Another thing is that there is zero character development. Whenever the characters in the story are mentioned (who will not talk), the book clearly shows that the process of searching for a soul is long. The film is fast and artificial. The book, like Rayford Steele, Buck Williams, and Hattie Durham, is written fairly accurately, but in the film scenarios, it is consistently treated without any need. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I understand as a Christian who did not say that I did not love this movie. , but with a good conscience I can not say that he has done a great deal of film. Perhaps it would be better to turn your first book into 2-3 films. In both cases, Christians should realize that they should be seriously involved as filmmakers, so you need to start combining the film with quality. I understand that I am very busy, but I see it.
