Amazing! Wow. I do not think I've seen a movie with so many great actors playing such an important role. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the only worst actor ever to play a big role in a movie star with energy and money behind Edison. <br /> <br /> His player is open to observe. The story was okay and all other characters were played by professional actors, and even LL Cool J was good, because there were so many small pieces to cut her teeth. There is no way to figure out how Timberlakein, director and filmmaker, understands how he is ready to play this role. <br /> <br /> His character destroys all experiments, because every time on the screen is actually rooted in police officers who have been corrupted to cover his sad donkey and he should be a hero ... I will not spend it on the theater or video. <br /> <br /> If you have HBO and nothing else, drunken and stoned from the 2nd day of Saturday night. <br /> <br /> Watch the role of Timberlake in a human 'Kermit' Frog 'Hollywood Blockbuster, just because he did not work.
