I'm scared that I do not agree. I found a dull bit of Spike Lee's last! <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <br /> Leguizamo and Dionna (Mira Sorvino), Ritchie (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then local mafia. The story is good, but in the end, it's all - 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer, Mr Lee did not give more of this side of the film? <br /> <br /> There are some good points. <br /> <br /> In general, different stories worked so well that I felt that all the scenes with David Berkowitz, "Sam of the Son", were very nice (color saturation, etc.) without killing themselves or others. <br /> <br /> <strong>
