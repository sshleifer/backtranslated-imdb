Silent, it's like dumb, in a totally uninterested, supposed black comedy. In fact, Chris Klein, starting with trying to keep a low profile, eventually turns it into a version of the "Three Amigos" without any laugh. To get the black comedy to work, it should be ugly not to say "Kill the Dead." For the operation of the black comedy, there can not be a negative word about the word "Kill the Dead." Dead Dead is actually a city full of walnuts. Fred Dunst, Jake Busey, is a pretty just imitation of Jake Busey, making Billy Bob Thornton's "A Simple Plan" characteristic of a fair imitation. - MERK
