Really? Really ???? You know, you will distinguish a political war movie, but it's just a trash. Every sense is terrible. Very inaccurate. I believe the President of the United States flies to a jet fighter and believes in aliens' shooting. It's easier to mark a few things that are right. I've seen a bit that this movie was the best in the last 25 years, and my jaw dropped. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, ACUPAT utility services? Who in 2004 did not check these things? You do not have to do extensive research, this film just came out five years ago. If I spend a day with an Iraqi war veteran, a infantry crew or EOD team, BS. this is a film. It's ridiculous to keep Plato or Private Ryan to compare them. Why do not you just shoot the Commando and the Red Dawn? I think they can be more accurate. <br /> <br /> If you see some incredible plot, historical and actual discrepancies, this movie may be only. Nothing more. If you continue to work on Oscar Buzz, you should look at yourself stunningly. I'm writing a director to see if I can get it back for 131 minutes.
