This is really a goddess of Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version with Guinneth Paltrow, the book looks as real as possible. But the player was strange. Along with Kate Beckinsale, I think that Emma's book was the same as all other actors were very tough. Mark Strong was not a "gentleman" to be. He was often rude and insulting, there was no sense and you did not see "growing up" love for Emma throughout the film. It was like Kate Beckinsale, her leading role and her partner's "rectification". Besides, there was no chemistry among all the cast. Mrs. Eltona, played by Samantha Morton, Hariett Smith, Dominic Rowan, has no basis. Therefore, as it is illustrated in the book, he did not appear to be like a heart. The settings of the movie are also very poor. Costumes are even more. I would imagine that Emma Woodhouse would dress here in a more fashionable and elegant way. The latter too is too long. It looks like it's all about the end of the book, but it's a murderer that ends up for a movie. Again, I do not see any happiness in front of Mr. Knightley. To reach this conclusion, I believed that this adaptive book was loyal, but with poorer actors. The film did not seem like a whole budget. I would like to see the "lighter" version with Paltrow and Northam, but it's clear that the whole script, although it is clear that these players (better than Olivia Williams and good Kate Beckinsale) are a better blockbuster than watching.
