First of all, the bigger players need money ... Surgery scenes were funny ... and they should know that people with little or no drug will find so absurd ...... Anesthetic do not go out of the room during a heart transplant .... nor instruments, heart lungs, and sterile technique do not have surgery in a small room ... just a joke ... could not concentrate on the line of the story because of all the stupid surgery scenes ... no blood, no staff and then a hero doc and capture ... adult is not a movie to think .... Also the budget should be limited ... street scenes were OK, but who was a technical consultant ... It looks like it's run by a family ... Save your money and get out of DVD Do not wait until you rent.
