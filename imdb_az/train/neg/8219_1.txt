When choosing my movie, I always have the kind of person who goes to horror from 2, so I chose five eyes, I regretted this movie and thought that there was no story line, I thought my dreams were to watch films that encourage people to commit hell, with very little budget and too much rubbish was! I think I have done a lot better. I think it's the worst movie I've ever seen and I do not need to worry about watching the dump of actors. The camera was bad and the sound was bad, and I did not think it was a little bit out of the way. It was not as bad as it was to throw off the ballerina in the project.
