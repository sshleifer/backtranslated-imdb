Cavemen was the biggest truck I never used to spend. Based on Geico ads, this show is less entertaining for Geico, a 30-second ad. After making a make-up, a dentist, it was not difficult to imagine the effects of such a caveman with white teeth. If this show was able to get the scent out of the advertising, it was a very bad show. Perhaps, if the writers were different from Geico's ads, that would be a good chance, but the pilot did not have a good story line. I'll give this show 10 to 1, I would like to put zero on 10, but this is not an option. I pray for a quick death for this show, I would give less than 5 episodes before death.
