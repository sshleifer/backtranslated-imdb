I came up with high expectations in this movie. I was different from Greenaway's work and the "The Tempest," and I was interested in an adaptation. I wanted to extinguish it in ten minutes, but I felt it would be unfair. Think of a storm, but do you think of a small child working on a toy boat in his heart? What is symbolic? I continued on a 'ten' button for about ten minutes to leak on my finger, somewhere something interesting to me. This is not Shakespeare, it is not a movie theater. There is time and place for that, but I will not waste my time and I have no place in Shakespeare. Twenty-five minutes later I gave up, and that was the end. Later, I read all the comments on this website, and the ambition of the movie matched its suspicions only. 'She puts a painting ..... then into a gallery', 'keep this ballet on the stage .....'. Shakespeare can be made intelligently and the performances are accessible to mass audiences, and this version helps put Shakespeare and the general population into a market and I do not think Bard will be happy with it.
