At the opening ceremony of the "Malta story", Mr. A.Guinness, the first words, "I have to ask some women to be tense as gongs" or to be a tired bitch in the world. his dialogue is an eternal prose, and even the Master would have difficulty bringing him to life. Indeed, Mr. Guinness is looking for a focal point and, as if he could not find someone, sheds the fatal vulnerability of the entire movie. Mr J. Hawkins also stops early and ends giving a "Jack Hawkins" performance without an individual ounce. It can be merged with any of the many British war movies. There are very few goals to open ordinary suspects in the early fifty years. Luftwaffe did not succeed in knocking down London, bringing Malta out of trouble. The courage of the people of Malta is recognized by the King in the face of enduring threats and the Island George Cross.A is a decent subject you can think of for a movie, but the Maltese Story does not fit in with the word "dignified". This is a quick look for a time to meet, and maybe the actors will live.
