A little disappointing movie, I would say: the player was decorated in some way. In many cases, I did not feel the facial expressions fit into the scene and the intent of the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, heartfelt) character should lead the audience to believe that it is angry (or sad, happy, heartfelt). <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> They do something and say what they're out of nowhere: Andrew accuses parents of sending signals to each other at dinner; then shoots and throws into the storm, tells his father, "Do not touch me, you f!". Perhaps if we saw the precedence, we knew where everything came from, but there was no prekel, so we were a little bit off the sea! <br /> <br /> Andrewin is a strange, exciting goal to go to the old stone quarry, sit down beside the "still water" below; then it reaches the genus and creates a group of cigarettes and light. He did the same in the film three times; I was thinking of seeing it as an act of self-indulgence, which is alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? <br /> <br /> For the fourth time, I lost my account. <br /> <br /> Honestly, he recently understood that he was admitted; this film is very early, so there is no sense of dramatic change that may occur due to this discovery. <br /> <br /> According to some movies, this is a lot of things. <br /> <br /> Behold, an early mountain in your career?
