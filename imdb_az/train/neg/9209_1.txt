First, I did not know about Mazes and Monster when I watched it. I did not know that there was a role-playing debate or a Made-For-TV movie. When I look at the cover (an updated DVD), I thought Tom Hank would be a fantastic adventure like "Legend" to get rid of a princess from a mad maze that entered the mystical world as a giant hero since the 1980s. It sounds exciting, right? The lid is at your first glance. I was given this movie as a gift, obviously on the same basis as the aunt knows that it turned into action movies with my medieval myth. And my favorite actor is Tom Hanks. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" I will admit before I continue, but I do not care about role-playing games. this movie is of the best interest to my content, and M & M (copyright infringement) is a movie that plays a good role with your favorite geeks who use their imaginations to enter the world of awesomeness No! Some religious peoples is an anti-role-playing movie (Barney is the work of Satan) I understand that Satan is an insidious person, but I do not think hopeless The RPG is the soul to turn the lovers into worship, the movie THEE anti-game. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tom's hacking RPGs is not enough to entertain people who play a role, and poor Tom Hanks is a mentally ill patient. <br /> <br /> Tom is a pretext at a Castaway volleyball The poor man was alone, but Tom made his ignorant fun somewhat and thanks to Tom's good player you saw Volleyball as a favorite character. Please watch the movie instead. In this film, Tom has a split personality and the best creepy attack you believe is a dragon that looks like a poorly designed mascot for a RPG group. Tom's behavior is much more than just a bad feeling for his character and something else. It is not right for me to earn points because the poor man has lost his brother and that's because he is delusional. I am not alone for films that use mental illness, and ending with "M & M" has made me feel cr * p. Fortunately, I watched 'Hudson Hawk', and my soul has a good smile without even fluttering. Yeh, 'M & M' by the 'HH'. . . Many! This is not one of Tomin's best films. In fact, it's the most sensitive movie I've ever seen (even "Keep Your Private Ryan" is not that difficult). I went with hope to watch a good movie and ended up feeling completely different. If you want to watch a sad (both emotional and visual) movie, then you have to watch everything. To deliver a message to this movie, it's like: "Do not play RPGs if you're Cuckoo for Coco-Puffs".
