If I asked how to define the word "neat", I would answer "Look at Jerry Bruckheimer's production." If I asked how to define the direction of "direction," I would reply, "Look at Jerry Bruckheimer's production." Bruckheimer's production is almost always around because of a fire in the box office, but critics almost always get critical shots. Only one employer above my head, and one GENTLEMAN and QARA HAWK DOWN can get a very critical acclaim. Kristin Tide also admits some of the critics' accusations, which, of course, is one of Bruckheimer's best films. My problem is the scenario that builds the story: the Russians are fighting Chechens, and the conflict spreads all over Russia, ultimately threatening the ultra-nationalist Russia if they capture a nuclear rocket base and interfere with the West. Maybe it was all about the end of the Cold War, but I found it was not very convincing. Some of the geographical mistakes do not have the same effect as Foxun Med (if there is no Black Sea) or exposition news from the Balkan conflicts. the first Gulf War and even Vietnam. Once again, my "intimate touch" has come to my mind. When the story is right, the story is getting better - the will of a nuclear submarine commander and the number two of his orders are on the battlefield. Director Tony Scott does his best as a railroad, but the problem is still unsatisfactory. The worst thing is that when the WW3 was a real opportunity in the mid-1980s - Ney Probably - this movie has terrified me, but it's a CRIMSON TIDE, which is a threat to the nuclear war after the Cold War.
