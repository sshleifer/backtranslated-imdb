There was a great deal of enthusiasm for this movie beforehand. This is one of the oldest and most sophisticated tales known to humanity, and I was one of the first epic tales I had read as a child (even before Tolkien). I say that GREAT DEPARTMENT BECOMES GREAT DEFEAT. They completely set up a joke area and turned things into a long soap opera. Elements that are loyal to the field have been so popular that the audience laughs many times in the intelligent script that lends lips to all battles in all battles. It was a great disappointment to see a complex character, such as Axilles (a staggering combination of forces like Matrix, absolutely immorality and genuine poetry), with Pitt a good script and more diligently transform it into the most complicated and original warrior Hollywood. The actors were really decent, trying to do the best of a ridiculous scenario. It was really a loss of talent (Peter O'Toole stole the show and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were miserable). Compare it with LOTR or Gladiator and do not even have a candle on them. Many hunters for ladies but not enough battle scenes for a film about a long battle and siege. I pay everybody to see this story drifting as one of the characters (at least this part has the right).
