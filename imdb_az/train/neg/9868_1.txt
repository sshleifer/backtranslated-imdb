I almost do not comment on the movie, but I've seen the 5th glimpse of this movie and decided to pull it in my own eyes. My instructor blended this movie with the Academy screen (AMPAS, aka, Oscar-winning guys), and received a letter in the letter for how often this film was filmed for this class. <br /> <br /> There is no plot in this movie, the scenes are creepy, horribly edited (often using faux "24" style photo-in-picture techniques) and performances (especially those not acting as bad actresses) in most cases it is striking. Nobody really understands the point of the entry, that is, the plot. No installation! Half of the film, neither of me nor of the rest of the class, knew what this movie was about. Opening crane stroke, which forms some kind of crime, never resolved, and now I think the rest of the film is beautiful, but it has been removed from the film. <br /> <br /> Bah, I can really keep going. At least, this movie gives me an updated look at the ability to make a movie.
