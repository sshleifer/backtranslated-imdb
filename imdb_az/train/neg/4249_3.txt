I knew this as soon as I saw this movie Blade: Trinity was messing around the Trinity board when I saw a user knowing how the Wes Craven series was, then Blade made the 'crap' my quick review: scores on IMDb & RottenTomatoes for Dracula Checked out: I learned that Dracula 2000 is the next one in the promotion and search. As I have already mentioned, Wes Craven is following the real strengths on the Dracula boards <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ em> <strong> I remember to see Dracula 2000 and I do not love it, then I see Dracula's points: The rise has diminished my expectations, but still I'm the kind of person I need to watch the movie (any movie) <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, I knew that a few things were small, so I do not have to watch a lot of movies and just pay for the story and motion, and I was a little impressed by some castings in this movie (Jason London , Roy Schieder and Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> Oh geez ?? This movie was CHEESY! But it could be cheerful, at least fun, I sounded so beautifully, I heard you talk about the dialogue on a few scenes, and the foolishness of the characters in this movie. Undoubtedly, they all knew about vampires and some basic things, and Luke had such a book, but did not want to be "infected"? <br /> <br /> In some cases, the girl has the worst frustration to check out the noise that she has never heard of, except the shower and the towel. <br /> <br /> I was also burned at some point because I'm not sure how Dracula's body was in her body, especially when she was a great Jew and angry, and I think I would not want to wear it. <br /> <br /> Does the film end up as a movie of trilogy? instead, I have to wait for the 3rd installment 'Legacy', not 'Cliff Hangar'. Oh worth cheerful movies.
