This is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen ... Unfortunately, I'm a horror movie buff and any horror movie, t.v. When looking at the box, he says that R is evaluated for the price and some languages ​​... What was strange? Was it really a good scene of death that they saw? If I had a short nudity or a good dialogue, I would have considered it. This stupid film did not even have a far-reaching or entertaining line. Sometimes terrifying movies are very stupid because they are very stupid, but it was sad.
