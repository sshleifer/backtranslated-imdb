An Italian movie by Humm, David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I was very peaceful and I really did not expect anything less than what I expected. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen since watching things worse than I was, but this area was often mixed and uninteresting, and some of those savvy scenes save it. Besides, you will love some special effects, they are really cheese and bad. Now I want to watch the same director only "Troll 3", it will not be worse than that.
