When I went and saw this movie, I had great expectations. But I was wrong. This movie was exactly a horror movie. It is a Resident Evil and many other many movies, such as a virus, zombies, and so on. But the difference between these and other films is the story is many weeks. These bad actors and boring music. The picture is complete, and the rest is full. Do not watch this "horror" movie, go anywhere with Ring 2 or any other movie. I hope they will not release horror movies that spread virus and virus, and lead people to zombies. We found that it was enough. The only good thing in the film is the time when it is standing on the roof and hit famous, celebrity celebrities.
