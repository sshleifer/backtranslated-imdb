Have others felt like betrayal? The first hour or so was quite firm but ending. Oh, my God. It was predictable and unpretentious. Not spectacular and epic, but all demonstration runs. The most read news shimmered, but I really do not understand why. In general, we were seriously forecasting the last WAY, but I thought, "No, they will never do it, FAR is very naked." I can make it harder. I feel very dissatisfied. I would like to go out of the door to sell me every season. Someone please. I changed my mind. I want to love it. Very bad. Someone tells me why he is wrong. Great show. Terrible ending.
