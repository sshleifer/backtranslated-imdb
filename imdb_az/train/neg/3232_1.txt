this film has no plot, character development, and no budget. it really depends very much on putting it in the shortest possible time. Since there is no film development, we really try to be artistic or give tone to torture. Which creates two other reasons for watching him. To fall into shock or get out of a sick little strange. Well, here it is short. The girl's reactions can only be dumb. it's easy to say that this terrific professional wrestling looks more realistic than the excuses they are trying to make in this movie. They go into it, but it's falling asleep for many, so it's a little unbearable. Indeed, a valuable part is a crackdown on the scene quickly before leaving the eye, but honestly the girl is ugly and everything is incredibly fake, except for the eyes. See torture film, hostel and hostel 2. Both are real violence, but there is an actual story that draws you and people interested.
