This film is poor in the trash. There is a terrible taste and, though supposedly based on actual events, is infantry and unconvincing - it does not add much, but it creates more disappointment. No good work is done unless scene and dialogue are accomplished. I'm not sure what Robin Williams is doing in this story or story. To begin with, Williams is not as convincing as a gambler in breaking relationships, and the relationship itself is also interesting. What's even worse, its character base is basically a place like ugly pedophile story and a plot device. An old Rory Culkin, a delicious "d_ck_smker" - a good entertaining way - it was annoying enough and then laughed at the character of Williams. Finally, Sandra Oh is a guardian for Williams and an explanation of the end of the entire fiasco. Tony Collete's character is just a rebuke of the 6th Sense performance, which is just plain and annoying. I missed so much.
