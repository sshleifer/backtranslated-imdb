slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words describing the film's film. This is the fact that the film never comes to the end of the book. The best part of the movie was beautiful scenery. The worst part is the slow-moving interaction of actors that connects with endless meaningful looks. Making it sharp and patchy. However, at least the actors were trying to be a little convincing at least with a terrible post. Despite the images reflecting in Peru in the 17th century in Peru, there was not a Peruvian man in Peru. If you have any sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
