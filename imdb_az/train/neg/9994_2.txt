Hmmm, a sports team is stranded on a snowy mountainous plane crash and faces a tough decision to eat dead meat to survive. Whom do you meet? I refer to "Alive" since 1993. Only a big difference here is, of course, a big, white, intoxicating blend of Yeti's many times to drag the dead. <br /> <br /> The spouses will taste better than those who love them. <br /> <br /> Stupid: When eating the yeti, the man on the first stage has no safe firearms, and there is no reserve. <br /> <br /> The plane crash is completely fake. He exploded in the air, exploded in the ground, disappeared. <br /> <br /> People living in prison would not survive, but that was science fiction. It's a good idea to use a part of the burning wreck to prevent death from frozen. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> <br /> One of the prisoners' son offers to search for games and wheels, but there's a scattered part of the plane around them. <br /> <br /> Patient: find coats and hoodies and still there <br /> <br /> Himalayas will not use the hood in the cold! <br /> <br /> Stupid: They look at the sticks, remember that, the plane has pieces. <br /> Prison: Himalayas are unhappy about the storm. Sitting outside the knife would be a general meaning to collect garbage to strengthen their structures. <br /> <br /> WTF: Use the arm of a dead person as a splint when doubting. <br /> <br /> WTF: If a man knows a lot about the hinges, the moon, and the leap-ridden habits of Himalayas, why is he unable to make up for shelter and traps? <br /> <br /> When trying to enter the prison, the fool around the traps always helps when trapped wild animals. <br /> <br /> WTF: Do you know how hard it would be to cut frozen meat? the body with a shard glass? WTF: The band was ready to fight Yeti and was armed, and the latter was defenseless there. Yeti ruined the boy's heart and cut off the girl's head and the band did nothing. There is love. <br /> <br /> Thus, two avenues and evidence are an avalanche .... or imaginary for proving eternal. Mwuhahahaa! The story is getting worse, but most of the action takes place in the last 15 minutes, as usual. Though the javelin and the chain are beautiful, though, they are a little inventive (as if by a chain) at the start of the film, even when they did not shoot. As typical for Sci-Fi Originals, at the end of the Valentine's death they kissed those who died as a horrible thing (they ate human flesh and did not brush their teeth in a few days)). <br /> <br /> But the last result is naked.
