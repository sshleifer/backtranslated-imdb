It's not the best slasher films of all time, but it's pretty fun. The area is bare, but the dead are not very bad. I said that if you do not follow the groups involved in this film, you will not find anything funny as those who make this movie. I knew a man I knew he was watching and I was really upset because of the poor quality of the movie, but you realize that playing in the game is when you play with kids and play in games with friends. .. not taken seriously. The best of punk is a fun movie to have your friends to have friends, with most ubber cheese and over 100 dead, most ultra protect, watch, drink and have fun!
