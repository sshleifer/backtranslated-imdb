I typically write a review for movies I just hate or really love. Probably, I did not love him as you probably thought of the stars. Now that you've read about the plot or even see the movie, I'll skip the summary. <br /> <br /> Experts: Concept: The point here was interesting. It was interesting to use the theory of chaos as a topic. But it was not so good. If I were wrong, you corrected me, but it seems to me that the theory of chaos has been misinterpreted. The event in the film seemed to be more casual than anything else. I think that the butterfly's effect "belongs to God to bring the tsunami." Presentation, though, does not really work. Some people call it smart, but they look like another motion picture. <br /> Story line: Is it just like me or Kemal throws it to an excuse for this game? ten roles? The area is extremely elegant; Govind is in terrible crashes (it is only possible that one bottle can be thrown into one idol, but only half of it alone) <br /> <br /> CGI: Oh god, the CGI. It was unexpectedly encountered in the same hospital, and the molding of one of the only popular singers working with the idol. It was worse than Jaws 3 special effects and they sucked. Immediately, I could say which parts are animated. Even my ten year old cousin knows that my son will not look like submarines. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < font> up: I have to admit, they did a better job than expected. I thought people would play a similar tone of Kemal, so my fake white men and the Japanese, Aikido, kept me safe. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < Asin: His character was probably one of the most devastating films in the film, he was high, efficient, and a devious dwelling on this idol. <br /> <br /> From some threats <br /> <br /> Here's a difference between a chocolate bar and a bottle with a deadly virus inside, and then a CIA agent after a vial was directed to India. instead of having a dancer, the famous Punjabi singer controls a small city hospital in the third world if he can easily afford the best medical treatment, and is shot in the throat with a bullet, you would think he was going to be killed, but the magic bullet cleared his tumor You read this right, BULLET, beat the bottle . <br /> <br /> Pros ... Naidu Char: Perhaps the only negative part of the film was a comedy.
