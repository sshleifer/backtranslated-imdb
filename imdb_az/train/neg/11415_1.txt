Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This movie is part of a clich√© raid. Do not build a comedy in the high school campus. <br /> <br /> THIS IS THEY CLAIM: <br /> <br /> Everything is absolutely compelling, convincing and unrealistic. HEPO (military police) will not come to you, especially if it is not your wedding day. At this stage, the actors were quite embarrassed because the scene did not work because it was very difficult. You can feel her voice. Even if they were not such bad guys, they would not be able to save the scene. <br /> <br /> Then the boy should use a wedding dress. No, it was not the time to get him first. Man, this is great cinematography! <br /> <br /> I remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> There are also girls in the camp - exciting - even if it's one of the models, not so great - unhappy actress I've seen. In Hollywood, I suspect that B is a line in the film. <br /> <br /> The girls in military service are good! Now that's fun. Girls are even placed on the same floor, so we can warn the night room! In fact, they were placed on a rectangular phone and separated by thorns with two fences. <br /> <br /> Sometimes there are tanks that we can use for a fun ride in our spare time. No, tanks are not locked and ignition buttons are placed. <br /> <br /> There are several sex scenes and references, and all are under the waste line. Germans, who are sexually disadvantaged, will also love the film. Switzerland is a very small market for any feature film. Good work! <br /> <br /> There's a sex scene in the kitchen. Of course, none of these objects are locked. <br /> <br /> According to experts, military operations depend largely on what can happen. <br /> <br /> At the end of the whirlwind, the mafia bosses talk about the revenge of a poor boy trying to shoot him! Because he left his fiancee! Of course, I welcome, the Italians are on this way - a jealous gang (not). <br /> <br /> Bad guys work with a two-tiered witness to explicitly illuminate this. Night is not on the dark road. Again, military education yards (where shooting with live shooting) are open to the public, everyone can move freely or go there. No such thing as guards and fences. <br /> <br /> But the job is blocked by the fact that the captain is in a timely manner to the Italian car. The explosion erodes cunning men and an angry fiance from their feet. The car, which is 40 feet away, is not damaged when the car slams onto the sidewalk. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;" This is a comedy, I bought and live with it, no realism is required. it's funny or fun, it's easy, and it's easy to set off in this way ... Unfortunately, there is not one of them, but shy, it's suffering from the unlucky American comedies, and the latter does not have any amateur actors at least professionalism. <br /> This is a very dull and predictable, time and energy loss, and, unfortunately, unfortunately, those who are sitting in the movie.
