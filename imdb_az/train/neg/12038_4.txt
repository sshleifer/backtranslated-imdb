There is nothing in this movie. There are only strange short scenes I do not know what hell is, so it does not count. This film is about to win so much that it comes from a man who likes movies about movies. Undoubtedly I ran after this shit. What Donald Sutherland did, because he completely missed it. And what's happening with the "pedofile" scene at the top of the movie. Everyone is able to sleep! 4/10
