Until the last 20 minutes, perhaps I thought this was Jackie Chan's worst movie (I did not know before 1978). The last battle sequence changed all that: long, good, and tedious - indeed, one of the key moments of Chan's career. But you have to sit by many comedies that will enter the five-year-olds to get it (oh, look! Someone tomato on his face) and endless "soccer" scenes. Dubbing ("How can I turn it off? This is not a tap" - line) - what does it belong to? "Dragon Lord" is just a hire for the final fight, but the rest of the film is for Jackie collectors alone, and even after watching at least 15 films. (**)
