This movie is a loss of movie. Will the plan of the military mission be placed on a large sun-dining patio for anyone with a camera with a binocular or zoom lens? It happened in this movie. You believe that a DEAF person will actually be included in the active army in Europe during World War II to serve in the "Negro" section ... food, supply services, burial and so on. It happened in this movie. Black (and probably clever) officer, same DEAF K.P. Do you believe that he will choose? to become a part of an active combat mission to protect a dam to be destroyed by the Germans before the allies came? It happened in this movie. Are you surprised that DEAF soldier did not realize that the German aircraft was approaching behind and killing and killing him? It happened in this movie. Do you wonder if a group of American soldiers are kept in a home in a German home? They did it in this movie and realized that Germans were not completely protected. Do you believe that at the airport and in the open English, the Captain will not be the same as the person you speak, and will be protected the next day because he is in the open English language in English? Perhaps, they simply sent an emissary to tell us what direction the American attack would have to make for the Germans a little easier. This so-called film should be placed on the list of the 50 best films ever. If it were, it would be good. At your own risk.
