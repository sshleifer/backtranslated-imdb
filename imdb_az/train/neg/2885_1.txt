I really can not say what I think about this film, I watched many films against its rules, and it still had to be the worst, Very Low Budget, I spent all the money slaughter home scenes, a b & w 8mm camera and a monkey made a better job with the staff. It was as bad as I was registered to write just one comment because I did not have to talk to, the movie was not enough for rent. But this is my 2 qepiks, I suggest you borrow from some bad looters who lease it and look at yourself. I'm sure that money will not give me money again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope you did not rent it when you did not refund your money .. =)
