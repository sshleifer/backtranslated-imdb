I do not believe that this is about $ 14.00. Only repetitive quality is poor. The dubbing was worse than I was. Apparently, it was shot with a VHS camera. I think every pfennig has been spent on special effects because there are many parts of blood and body everywhere. One of the worst films I've ever seen, but I have to admit that the entire film is so stupid and unbelievable that it's a lot of unpleasant body
