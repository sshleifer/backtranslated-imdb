Otto Preminger directs this light as a storyteller. Bohemian Jean Seberg and his equally bohemian grandfather, David Niven, shout at the Mylene Demongeot in southern France. Things are good until the family friend Deborah Kerr is shown. Nivens, a cold woman, finds it hard to resist the conquest of Kerr. Nevin likes her and is good with Seberber as she leaves her (as she did with all the women in the past, including Demongeot). Despite being the second banner in Nieve's life, Seberg Kerr is the exact revenge. Preminger explains story in flashbacks from Seber's perspective and intelligently combines black and white with sunny scenes. Cinematography by Georges Périnal is striking. The film has the least weighty aspect of the Preminger, though it rarely allows any approximation to make it difficult for actors to really feel. Arthur Laurents wrote a script, and it is packed with acidic dialogues and comic scenes (mostly bird-brained demongeot). Seberg improves himself fairly, but Niven is at least attractive ... and no chemistry with Seberg or Kerr. Pretty much really wrong with this casting. A role specifically designed for someone closer to Charles Boyer. Geberri Horne and Sberkin's head and Martita Hunt would be his daffy mother. Juliette Gréco plays the title song at Paris night club, playing for himself. The Prettyer of the Perfect Names is the regular Shaul Bass.
