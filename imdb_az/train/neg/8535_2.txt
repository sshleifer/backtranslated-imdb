As I said, the book was very good and it was a good movie if Melissa Gilbert was not so terrifying and unbelievable at the start of the device. Can anything be? In another film I saw, he sounded the same as his horrible Russian accent. He cried every time I opened his mouth. He took 3 attempts before I could not watch the whole movie. Brad Johnson was as good as the other leader. <br /> <br /> I liked the beach scene too. Melissa Gilberts has added a lot of useful shine to overcome your surprise. San Francisco could have used more than theirs. The night scenes actually seemed like SF, but I could be wrong. I do not remember this depressed character in the book. <br /> <br /> Join Melissa Gilberte in future films that require awards!
