When I see a low budget movie, I try to be very objective. I also apply less and less weight to independent and low budget products against large budgeting. I will not wait for the big budget productions and the studios near the flawlessness. That's why I apply strict criteria to major studio releases. But this movie was a dud. Period. Stage was awful. The main character, Mary Gordano (Alicia Silverstone), was incredible as a middle school with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes. There was not enough depth in his character or his artistic work. Also, in order to make this film more mysterious, lighting on certain scenes, especially in the warehouse, did not set the mood. <br /> <br /> I was able to give only three points to a film that was once more disappointing.
