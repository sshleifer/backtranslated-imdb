We congratulate Uwe Bolli. He can not think. He can be the only director in IMDb who has filmed 100 films! He's kinematics like some kind of cockroach. The fewer talents and the worst of these films, however, continue to do so. I know that he finances all through an unusual German fund, but it is one of the great secrets of the universe, in spite of absolute failure, to continue filming. <br /> <br /> Video game developers would not be worse than giving this person the best features. I really liked Alone in the Dark game series. Even the last, The New Nightmare was good for a few hours of play. There was a good movie for Edward Carnby's adventures, but that is not. Now Uwe Boll wins his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: Reckoning. What is Silent Hill? Doom? I think that if this person is not stopped, he is thinking of playing the game with a fit. Some people have to take credit, or no one is more interested in this video game when the publishers get their minds and they shoot a bad movie from a game that kills franchisee. > <br /> Think about it, The Living House or Just a Dark Live Game Title? In no way. A new game for the dead comes out for X-Box and will not care for anyone. The author died on behalf of Uwe Boll. So, if any of your games works for a publisher, or if you know a game publisher or if you refer to a game publisher, alert them. <br /> <br /> This film is not even considered. I can not distinguish what I do not like the rest of this meeting. Of course, everything is about it. Writing, moving, music, CG effects, editing. I thought that if I had waited for the DVD before I left, I would rent it with low expectations, and I would not have been disappointed. My son, I made a mistake. Uwe's BOLL SHALL Tackle a huge, steam-packing capability.
