I can not get it. The film has a very good budget. There is a very good cinematography. Beautiful pacing, good editing and very good orientation. Why? Why? Why did not they hire someone to write a post, so it would not be damn badger and why? Why did they hire such cruel actors who could not get out of a paper bag? This movie would be good. <br /> <br /> "I'm a good film in this movie," he said. <br /> <br /> Indeed, come on someone, really!
