I have a 5-minute note (sometimes I'll leave levan 10). If a movie is not good for the first 5 or 10 minutes, it will probably not get better. I have not yet seen any movie that proves that we have tried this theory. Dan in real life is absolutely no exception. I was watching and thinking about Turkey; <br /> <br /> <strong > I love your sister girlfriend. I suppose, would tagline be the "consultant columnist who used the tips"? I dont know. The nature of the dance did not strike me as a person who could give advice in any way. I know this is a mockery? I dont know. She looks very sweet and goes to see her parents, brothers, siblings and children in a family run, appearing to be a good comedy, potentially eating food for storylines ... none of them ever emerged. The central story basically loves this woman, but she can not own it. <br /> <br /> Everyone who breathes is going to get it right away, but you'll have to endure an unavoidable happy end with a "kiss of love" with a dialogue of painless, unfounded, strange, lifetime film network. <br /> <br /> It's one of the worst films I've really seen.
