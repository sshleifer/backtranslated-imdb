Chan Wook Park is not something inventive. I'm a champion, but if it were good, some of them were full of little technical flowers with some stunning ideas sprinkled on one another. Park, who wants to pursue the love of Marc Caro and Jeunet (LOST CHILDREN CITY, DELICATESSEN), begins a dreamy, clear-cut story that goes from radical to its usual illnesses. <br /> <br /> I hope this is very little. <br /> <br /> The last result is that it is a part of some of its parts and it comes with itself. The presentation is promising, gags are plentiful and soft humor, but will not be able to create any meaningful relationship with the audience. Happily, the sympathy of LADY VENGEANCE was a mistake, so Park was a little surprised, but still managed to show some of the director's unique glows and easily donated after an effective filming . None of the safer trusts ordered by SYMPATHY for TWO SECURITY area or MR. VENGEANCE looks obvious here. I'm a CYBORG, but I've been abandoned in a completely unrecognized way and in time I started to make myself an instinctive adventure (as the movie progressed more on a regular basis). I gave LADY 5/10 and this event is likely to be worth more than 3. For the sake of old time, I will be generous: 4/10
