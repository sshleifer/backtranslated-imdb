I felt that Rancid Aluminum was two hours full of wasting, the plot line was subtle and mixed, the influential line of players was some terrific dialogue and extremely suspicious accent. The camera work was somewhat experienced in the field and it was even harder to watch, though the director wanted to convey it. Rancid Aluminum's most uncomfortable rings use almost all the stories as directed by the audience. The best speeches are related to actor. In fact, it is likely that the most convincing indicator has come from all humanity, Dani Behr, usually a stereotypical office secretary. Do not be in any situation and do not see this movie unless you need to get some lost sleep, there are better ways to spend your hard earned money.
