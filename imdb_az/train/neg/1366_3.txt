** REQUIRES CLAIMS <br /> <br /> In this film, really delicate at opening moments, really delicate Sean Young (in some scenes, it looks like Elizabeth Taylor by touching her hair). Sitting behind a police car waiting for a bust sounds, his face and body are intense and attractive. Unfortunately, after leaving the bust, Young's tension goes down. <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ p> <p> Walker is always open, emotionally and comfortably ... so there is no barrier between what he feels and his expression. It is an open book. On the other hand, young people act in a fear-inspiring, self-centered way of waiting for your neighbor to act, and suddenly they play a role in a movie. <br /> <br /> With this great void in the center of the film, we're here to think about the inability of the story. For example, when Miss Young was abducted by a criminal and behind him, he broke the door when he was alone. Of course, she was dressed in just one bra and panties, but in such a situation, have you come back to a door with a psycho captain every moment ... or have taken the time to dress or dress up? I guess that this and other scenes are trying to offer mixed emotions to each other, but Miss Young's character is in its nature, but Young can not handle that kind of complexity. <br /> <br /> There are several impressive moments in the film, such as interviews with past victims of criminal offenses, but this is usually an undesirable attempt. Too bad, Miss Ganji was replaced when he was filming a comic book style with some people. It could limit some humor (BATMAN and DICK TRACY). Miss Young's watch, at least in this "tension," is a sad look.
