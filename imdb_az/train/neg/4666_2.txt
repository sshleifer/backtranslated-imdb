This film is related to a Japanese woman who has been drowned in calligraphy. <br /> <br /> The solution is totally strange. I have never seen any 'sensitive' or 'erotic' weak. The site transforms an ancient art form into a fetishist pornography. Additionally, Hong Kong scenes, of course, describe the bad parts of Hong Kong, for example, the airport in the city center, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the entire movie, I think the "Pillow Book" has offended the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. <br /> <br /> The "Pillow Book" is a fried but boring film. Seriously avoid it.
