I thought the movie was good, but they were so excited that they did not take the true image of their lives. I look forward to seeing my mother's real Jamaica, pushing me crazy. While watching the movie, I said the movie was not accurate. It's a subject that's just about a couple of seconds from the start of the movie. I'm very disappointed, like Mark Anthony, watching the story of a biography and playing the role of Arnold. I do not know if the writer thinks the movie is going to lose a valuable piece, but I'm sure he played a big role in his mother's life. I'm okay as it was a big Fla movie !!!!!!
