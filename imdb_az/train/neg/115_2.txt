Never get models and Playboy bunnies on your movies! Bob Fosse's book, "Star 80," belongs to Dorothy Stratten. Bogdanovic was quite cautious enough to marry SISTER after his murder in the hands of his wife, and millions of times more interesting than the silver screen on Dorothy himself. Patty Hansen is also no actress ... I was planning to see some kind of La Orson Welles, the missing masterpiece, but Audrey Hepburn, breasts and a god-terrible "poodlesque" hair .... Very desperate ... "Paper Bear" and "Last Picture Show" I could have watched it again. This meeting only sat once. This film was released under the name of Stratten's death; I think the real reason was that it was so bad!
