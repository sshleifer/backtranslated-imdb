If you want to study the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, spend $ 9 on the textbook, not the film. The money that I spent was used to send Koy-Aid to Guyana, a little worrying. <br /> <br /> My leaders really have a point, I think, but maybe they wanted to do a few things: 1) Science can explain everything we do - our life is deterministic; 2) Science can not be used to explain everything we do, that is, we have a free will; 3) Science is really cool; 4) We are God; 5) The world exists only in our minds; 6) Sarah Norman plays a challenging role, and 7) Put this small paper in your mouth and see something really fascinating.
