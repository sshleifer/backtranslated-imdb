Since I was a big fan of Corman's horror films, I was expecting a bit more from the West. Yes, they enjoyed a good game. <br /> <br /> While watching the burning Saddles of Mel Brooks, there was almost a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> Look at the signs of mobile tire in the old western rice. If you happen to have another boring scene, you can kill them by counting them. And the horses seem to have gear as well, considering fast forward pursuits. Since 1920, a certain style of dance reminds you of the decoration of the traditional barber room of the traditional wild western hall decades ago, before it was designed. <br /> <br /> They will not crash around the hall. <br /> <br /> In the middle of all this, key actors do a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are really good. Often, Johnny Guitar makes a special definition to do their best with the material that is raised, but not surprisingly the same way. But such a hero does not really have a mistake in the west. Like an old fear movie, it may be temporarily in one way, but in any case it will succeed. Corman's case is appealing to me, so if you get the chance I come to live in this movie.
