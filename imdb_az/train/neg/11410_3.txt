Christopher Lambert creates grief and disappointment in his description of GIDEON. <br /> <br /> This film was classic as Raymond Babbitt at RAIN MAN, as Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman at Lambertin Forrest Gump, or Sean Penn, like Sam Dawson in SAM. <br /> <br /> It is so bad that the story line is remarkable in our lives, the performances supported by Charlton Heston, Carroll O'Connor, Shirley Jones, Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were perfect. 10 to 10-a.
