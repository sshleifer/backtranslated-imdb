This film proves that every single movie made on Hollywood's celebrated days is not worth seeing. This may be a bookmark written by a chimpanzee because it's a perfect ensemble! Think about it - There is still a bad movie in the film by Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Charles Boyer, Gloria Graham, Lillian Gish and Paul Stewart! The basic structure of the movie is not bad - a special psychiatric hospital where workers are relatively more patient than patients! Moreover, the subplot that covers the long-term spouse (Widmark and Graham) has pledged much. But the script has been handled with all the delicacy and intrigue of the drunken buffalo - over and over again in the movie and on top stages. In fact, it was less like a drama and more like a "General Hospital" episode. Fine, this is not a movie! Realist is not this movie! <br /> <br /> The majority of this movie was terrible, but I also blame veteran actors for blame and transfer of the producers. For example, Paul Stewart could not be home-named, but this characteristic actor had exceptional talent - especially when playing gangsters in Film Noir. Stewart is here as a very insignificant psychiatrist with some strange European accents - it's just beyond the range of its functioning and its character is not fully developed and dimensioned. Also, Charles Boyer looked unhappy in the face and was completely out of the way. <br /> <br /> It was strange to see this beautiful romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heart of America. <br /> In general, this is a very scary movie. A type of train accident is paying much attention, but of course not very nice. My husband and I did not like most of the film but felt that it would be great if the writing was talented. PS - An Oscar Levant, an example of an art that imitates his life, has played one of the patients. In the real life, the brilliant Levant spent most of his life in intelligence bodies and abroad.
