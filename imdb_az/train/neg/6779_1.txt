Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer have a high expectation to sit down to watch a comedy with a comedy. Stanley Donen, the director of the film, is more delighted when it comes to directing the comic touch, such as DAMN YANKEES !, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. The first 5 minutes, or reminder, can meet these expectations and then appear. There is nothing. Suzy Parker has recently been criticized for his performance or lack of space, in which a large Cary Grant is often seen on a flat and wooden surface. Attacks in Park Parker seem unfair. <br /> <br /> This tension, like Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day, was dragged off by itself and accelerating the audience's interest and patience could change the conquest of a terrifying and completely meaningless script. <br /> <br /> The rest of the rest, especially Ray Walston, tries to breathe a bit at the trial, but the terrible post is out of the resuscitation. <br /> <br /> Desperate efforts to drag a half-hearted laugh from the numbed audience at the last minute of the film is just an insult to injury. <br /> <br /> This film is a great disappointment at all levels.
