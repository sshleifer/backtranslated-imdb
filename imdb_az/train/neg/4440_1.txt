Let me be clear. I've used IMDb for years. But today I was worried about just registering on the site, so I could give this movie the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of movies, some are bad, some terrible. Never before have I seen a contrast, such as an excuse, an inability, a high intention and failure. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, a reputable, but totally unbelievable, young boy, is Phocion. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining character, but it is worse than the unusual French game Maripax, which has a source of dialogue in the film (which has not yet reached Hollywood and we should keep it as well). <Br /> <br /> For example, to show that Leonty is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, he shouts the names of the famous scholars and pours out from the gut to the chimney in chemicals. And romance between Agis and the prince is even played sillier. For this, the couple should be honored with the Clair Danes award, which is anaconic and refreshingly re-interpreted from literature in a fair world in the 1990s (for example, see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). <br /> <br /> Besides the violent plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to present artistic tropics in the filming. For example, a few viewers are sitting on the pods, despite the motion, and left to watch the main characters. The director wants to understand that we are adapting to the game. I'm getting it. But it does not happen until now. At this point, it is a creepy and noticeable sight sitting in chairs for a moment and then seeing a disappeared crowd. They are like a terrifying zombie crowd, full of fear-filled, musk-like types. <br /> <br /> When you see the horrible frolic and the song that ends with this movie, you want to kill all of your zombies and kill them all 112 minutes to act unwillingly. <br /> <br /> - Matthew McGuire
