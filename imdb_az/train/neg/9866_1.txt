You want to see "THE GAMERS" by Dead Gentlemen Productions. This is not a movie. This movie is not funny. <br /> <br /> All good comments here (poorly hidden) appear to be written by counterfeit third parties. People who shoot this movie seem to be trying to synthesize their fake interests. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good mockumentary. <br /> <br /> The movie is a destroyers against Spinal Tap or Christopher Guest. <br /> <br /> The film has been morally upset. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Laughing yourself is of great importance, <br /> <br /> The cause of the film is the great line of taboo theme, but due to constant care.
