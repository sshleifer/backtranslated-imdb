Interestingly, a novel without a plot is the basis of two films. <br /> <br /> If Heiress is good, but not adaptable, it is hard and inconvenient to the film, except for the film, which can be very good except for Washington Square Dr Sloper. <br /> <br /> The director's attempts to create 'beautiful' scenes were so clear that I really cried. There is no simple and straightforward beauty that can be a film that has no area like Onegin. I agree with Leigh's other comment on Catherine's description of the cunning rather than legendary and shy; <br /> <br /> Relying on Catherine's childhood adult cynicism, the whole story of the story was internalized as in the novel. But we do not take advantage of the narrative to explain us in a movie! I think someone has succeeded in adapting to classroom movies. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the director's attempts to create a moving and beautiful movie from a tough text, but it did not work.
