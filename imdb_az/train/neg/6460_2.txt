* Where is someone COMEDY to me? (Charlie Sheen) is a very poor comedian (Thomas Haden Church) looks so weak (with him!) And the whole thing is so thick! <br /> <br /> * They tried to make a lively comic book that turned out to be a brown comic nightmare and was even funny? Like a scene in the bathroom; it was very good with its kinematic imagination, but there is nothing else .. With the exception of the net! <br /> <br /> * Donald Sutherland! <br /> <br /> This is actually something that is just a matter of making it and making money, but it would have been money. <br /> <br /> Yes, if it's a big production and a major role in Brandon If he plays, he would have been very bad. <br /> <br /> Sheen's family is here. Just be aware of them! <br /> <br /> Everyone who loves this movie or who loves God is Forbid! * (Brando) is undoubtedly a genius, but not a movie! And he does not intend to be here after reading this! But no one has ever done anything in this business, or who wants to be at least clever or even a good time, the biggest problem! (Sorry, I'm crying now! It's incredible to torture the movie!). <br /> <br /> * Brandon's (Mira Sorvino) has a scene with his shoe! This was a very realistic! Perhaps he was punished for such a tear! <br /> <br /> Billion times: It could have been better (or less bad)! The scenario was nice to the train's thirst and I thought I was running just like another (Smokey and Bandit), but like Sheriff (Brando). <br /> <br /> Why was this prize worthy of the Razzie prize ?! Want to force this movie to believe that you have fewer movies? I do not think so! <br /> <br /> <strong> Razzie's supervisor is a must-win for his negligence. <br /> <br /> Martin Shen is here as a guest star supporting his unsuccessful son, but ironically his father's son !! and why? Yes! I do not doubt that the hateful Martin Sheen may have hated more comic movies than hated it! <br /> <br /> This is a comedy film, NO .. It is a fear! I hate the horror movies I propagated as especially funny ones! <br /> <br /> Can I say something good about it? Hmmm! Yes, it would be close to Casablanca (Dr. Moreau Island - 1996) compared to another Marlon Brandon monster movie! <br /> <br /> PS: You still want to know what is bad or bad in this movie, ugly and ugly .. Only you can pray and watch your last prayers .. God can help you!
