German filmmaker Ulli Lommel fulfilled a task that many sad people thought was: a man named Teuton Uwe Boll for the crown for the director of the worst horror film ever made. <br /> <br /> Lommel is really Ed Wood's new millennium. This film is sad and laughable as the worst of EW's. Both were proud and embarrassed that I watched him and watched that I was amazed to see that the sticks were low. Answer: underground; Lommel dug a hole and buried him. <br /> <br /> Entertainment begins with a cast of international generations. A person living in Los Angeles who is an actor or screenwriter for every auto mechanic, doctor, and writer to discover, easily understood how Lommel found numerous actors who wanted to spread his ridiculous dialogue with a straight face. <br /> <br /> The main character is played by a legendary defeated police, a German actor with a thick German accent. Besides being a consecutive killer, he is also the oldest police officer in Los Angeles. While innocent women drive and take them into custody, they drive them to their home (this is clearly the top floor of a furniture store) and all of them make a simple look of their bloody partners, LAPD <br /> The voice of those who vote most of them are bad. The designer's budget, apparently, includes enough money for paint painting; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < it is fair to note that they were springing up for a few real-looking police uniforms after spending a little bit of money on any cash set, special efx, spot, or other value. Unfortunately, they will not be able to afford a police car; The streets of uniformed police are watching for a new Mercury rental. <br /> <br /> More than half of the story focuses on the dirty deeds of our LAPD officer and the hassle of two young tea houses to stop him. One of these young actors is especially sad because in this film, despite all his true career, he is the only actor in this confusion. <strong> <font color = red> <br /> </ span> <br /> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> after killing the girl he again made a savior magic by entering one of the voodoo priests. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong>, zombie girls try to give the appearance. Before death, maybe it looks even better, with black attractive makeup, neatly surrounded their eyes. If they do not look like a zombie, they look more like high-fashioned models ready for the run. <br /> <br /> At this point of the film, Lommel takes a creative note from proud citizen Boll and into a large-scale Euro-soundtrack into a trash techno. We speak prehistoric electronic bamboo sounds. <br /> <br /> Lommel may have probably been playing at an Ibiza disco at the youth. <br /> Unlike other zombies, Lommel's daughters speak normally and work normally ... before becoming a zombie. This gives us extensive opportunities for our auteur to shower with more of the golden dialogue. Yes, there is a golden shower. <br /> <br /> I will destroy something by exposing the end of the shock. We can say all this is a perfect thing with the rest of this work. Ed Wood's soul lives ... or his geist.
