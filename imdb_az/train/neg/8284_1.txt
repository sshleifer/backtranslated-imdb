Who wrote this? A man named John Cohen. I do not know, it was the first scenario that did not work. <br /> <br /> Someone tells him that he is capable of writing a dialogue. <br /> Who controls this? Scott Marshall? Gerry Marshall's son. My nuts were far away from the tree. Someone might have wanted to tell you that he knew he could take a taxi in New York, and that would look real and you would not be fooled by blue screen for any reason. <br /> <br /> <strong> Jessica may have wanted to know if she wanted to get away from Simpson, but I hope we have a lesson now. <br /> And Jessica Simpson ... can not move naturally. Hell makes Jessica Alba look like Audrey Hepburn and is still playing in this movie. Wait, he was prepared by his father. Okay, that's why it's part. <br /> <br /> So, this is bad, is not it surprising? No. Should I be surprised at how bad it is? As I thought, if they had seen many, they'd see a lot. That means you're expecting a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this is not just bad, but the contrary to the classic movie. Imagine a beautiful Woody Allen movie, this movie is as bad as it is good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Annie Hall </ span> <strong> <br /> <br /> I'm glad that I did not pay to see it, I did not go for ten minutes. Certainly, I would get out of the theater more often. In fact, I'm surprised that more than 6 people in the theater have really stayed and watched everything. The film begins to deteriorate and then a very bad Chinese water torture. And then, when the first action is over, you just have to be worse, or you have to leave, or understand when you kill yourself <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie should be held under the Guantanamo Bay water convention . Some people prefer to live in the water.
