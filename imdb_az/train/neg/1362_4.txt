Maggie Smith and Peter Ustinov are a very difficult couple in a very difficult movie. <br /> <br /> The film shows that Ustinov promised to be released from prison for robbery. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> As in 1938, as in Marie Antoinette. Perhaps that genre had to be returned. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good laugh. <br /> <br /> Maggie Smith said in a film titled "Prime Minister of Miss Jean Brodie," that she violated the Oscars performance in those years. <br /> <br /> Ms. Smith is here to be a dazzling redhead, but with the end of the movie, he is the brain of the material. The writing did not go with him.
