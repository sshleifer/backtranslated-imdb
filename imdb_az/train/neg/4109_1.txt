It can only be described as terrible. Start is bad and gets worse. When you start, you really have to watch it because it's impossible to believe that it can get worse - but do not be afraid. Another written script for a donkey director for any talented children of the past movie stars. It is difficult to decide whether the scenario is worse than the game or that management is worse than both. As for the hero, he also covers a scene that opens a hero's door and erases it from the window by alleviating harsh stiffness. And on another stage, he is thrown out of a window and crushed to a concrete 20ft - even does not break - then rises and gets into baddies. This is really a funny movie. I'm lucky that only $ 1 is spent on the job.
