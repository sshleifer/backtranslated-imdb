Despite the fact that it was like a horror movie trying to sell itself, it was not enough to have blood. <br /> <br /> He also has a professional directorship, moving, editing and writing. <br /> <br /> Jeremy London has put one of the most terrible speeches I've ever seen - his "crazy cave" is foolishly self-aware and calm. Oh, look at him! Oh drink him strong spirits! Oh lift her eyebrows and watch your cock at a dark angle! See oil-free, greasy black hair! Listen to his impressive voice! He must be a tortured artist / writer / genius! Oh, yes, the poet-shirt comes - another guy who thinks he's Byron. (Or Poe.) For Love ... Someone gave a lesson to the boy about "Doing Good Good" or a little bargain-bin grains brand of the unfinished little plastic toy prize if they were pulled out of a carton box. <br /> <br /> Katherine Heigl is a very sweet, very briar flower, but is still becoming her toy shoes. this film - he was conveying his lines as it was, in fact his entire performance was a tree that made him a tough one - he knows, maybe he only reacted, trying to become ineffective, Jeremy London flailing <br /> <br /> Arie Verveen is known as Poe - the role of her character is mixed, but provides the best performance. He just seems right, but it's more - he has some kind of depth, and I believed that the rest of his characters had a life beyond the double sensitive quality. Perhaps I love Poe, so it's only possible that my mind can set off and invent when it comes to the screen - otherwise, the interest factor has otherwise disappeared. <br /> <br /> The rest of the heroes are a wireless grace - all the usual cartoons are: a perky blonde who is a bit of a floozy blonde best friend; a local police officer who has a hit with a dork; Perhaps the heroine has a fearsome old man with many fatherly interests; planning old witch, etc., yaw, yaw. <br /> <br /> As in the case of "the faultlessness of the blood for the horror movie," none of the topics we mentioned (and the characteristic of London, the attack on Scathingly - Poe) were ten. There is a potential here: murder, incest, - really shocking things, but instead they have gone away from problems and avoiding violence (turn off the air from the candle - hang on the victim and then black - cut it! Traditionally awesome, it's really as expected and happens - especially when it comes with fake lightning tears and dense Siouxie eye makeup, "says the Generation," it just calms down or looks like it's crazy at the last minute). It could have been a very stressful psychological tension - the palingenez / delusion / madness horror - or simple and funny) slasher movie: either or both (something new and exciting!) But dismally fails in any way. br> <br /> The only horror element in this film is epic embarrassment /> <br /> I think the editor (if any) should have been drunk after giving this thing - foreshortened scenes, confused; Undisclosed scenes (but it could have been just a poor scripts). I beg a director and a cinematographer - There were many strange shots and frames that Hitchcock or Browning wanted to be tributes, but it just seemed meaningless (again, in a good noise, but that was trying to do something else). ) <br /> <br /> Everything may have been funny (as did the previous reviewers say, "How did OMG get this?") The bagging, unfortunately, was sitting on the wall for me, with low lights, With the intention - this is a very bad movie, and I'm afraid it's for people to laugh. <br /> <br /> Please do not waste your time or money on it - either take a real horror / tension movie or find some way to Poe's fantastic stories, to achieve this trash you will experience a much more strange and fearful night than you can hope for.
