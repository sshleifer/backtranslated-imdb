I am current A.S.L. She had to watch this movie in a student and classroom, and it was a clear-cut approach in the film I came out of. The film is clearly P.O.V. There is no place in the middle of the "common sense of snow". Also, the film did not mention or ignore other cases discussed in this regard. Ä°.E. Hearing, hearing and then deaf people. Is it true or false in this situation? The film is impartial and almost all the deafness is thought to be the "D". This is not bad, but it should try to be a little unbiased in order to be a true documentary film.
