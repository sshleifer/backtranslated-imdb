Basically "Caprica" ​​is the story of Cylon origin. The show is interesting. However, the writers watched many storylines and linked them with a large number of POV symbols, similar to storytelling. What can be the creeping part of the surface of the surface, which eliminates the tension. In any episode, little or nothing happens. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robotic soldier using a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only work prototype is based on the Zoe's AI version of his dead daughter, who died in a bomb attack by Soldiers of the One (STO). <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Joseph Adama (father of the Battlestar Galactica commander Adama's father), while bringing together the AI ​​version (similar to the 1930s), his daughter (also killed in a bombardment) in Caprica's virtual version of Machiavellian fights to marry Chicago). <br /> <br /> In addition to Vapid, Caprica suffers from a similar problem, like many stories. We already know how it ended (Cylones develop their own culture and rebellion against humanity).
