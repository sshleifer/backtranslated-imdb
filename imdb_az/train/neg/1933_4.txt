<br /> <br /> 4.3 (from 10) <br /> <br /> Atlantis: The Lost Empire appeared a few years ago, which seemed a brave, serious new direction in Disney animation. Yet, one year after the innovative and nearly genius "Empire's New Gruvia," it takes a step back from Disney Formula to release Disney. I'm a great fan of the length of Disney animation films. You need to see them love or hate all of them. "Atlantis", "20,000 Leaves on the Sea" and animated film for adventure-like adventure philosophy in the 50s and 60s. The point is that there is no original idea in this version. It feels like the actual Disney remakes (Tarzan, Notre Dame The Hunchback) something more. Symbols are typically less commonly used than a picnic clip of ordinary suspects covering such films (odball mechanics, gung ho general, weak tough women). The player supporting Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner) is straightforward. The film also suffers from a short pace. Instead of turning to an epic story, Disney, brushing over opportunities to grow, usually squeezes a lot of things in the short term ... doubt, the characters are really something. They carried us to this new and magnificent world and did not let our bar associates. An unusual tempo sometimes mixes a relatively simple story. Animated is dark and jerky and inexpensive. This thing looked like a cartoon on Saturday morning. Let's hope that the 2D traditional animation can still be spectacular. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For a long time, The creative moment of the film.
