When I was a kid, I saw this movie in the theater and always remembered it as my first experience with the disassembly of a horrible movie with a good trade. The trade was very nice, but then I learned that every movie in the movie (about 4) and even in a movie had an explosion or a special effect. There were some alien-related traps, but far from what I remembered was never shown in the film. It was one of the cheapest movies made by people to scam. That day ended when I saw that my evil guilt was wicked people, who were the wicked sinners of my world.
