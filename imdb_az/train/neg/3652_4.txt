I watched this movie in DVD format. My image could be impressive, but I was disappointed with the lack of the menu screen for the DVD. I will say that Claire Forlani is the first reason to look at this movie. Despite all the fun, I feel that my other films do not fit my expectations so far. In fact, I was pleased to see Arkin's turn in a humorous outlet. I was not familiar with two other actors and could not compare their performance, but they were pretty pleasant. In my opinion, the only pleasing quality of this film is the actor. The story line, some of which was a little modest, not directed. I feel that the main problem is that of the script, not the direction of this movie. If you enjoy any of these actors, I recommend this movie, but otherwise I leave it.
