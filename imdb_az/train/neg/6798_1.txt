This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Everyone involved is embarrassed. Everyone. Ice-T is open, dialogue is totally horrifying and kokyo begins to portray the performance of each actor in this movie. It is a serious contradiction to the Executive Executive Decision, but is compared to Air Rage Executive Decision Academy Award. Never been so disappointed when I watched a movie. Air Rage should be burned with a vaulted locked ash to never see the light of day. Everyone who sees this should take a shower and wash the sadness of the sad movie. The best part of this film is likely to come from the time the credits are spread. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T should be law-abiding and other people in this film should either be retired early or commit suicide. In either case, they should never try to be in a movie.
