I found a real task to sit with this movie. The sound track was not good and it was difficult to figure out what some of the habits were. There was very little to move the field, and often the activity was simply stopped and there were long-lasting conversations that seemed to be against the film. This conversation took place between family groups and the observer was assigned to try and break the common issues. I rarely find this movie low, and in this case, I think that all the viewing experience was what I was thinking of "what" and "why I spent my time".
