This movie thinks that others I see with Combs are an accident. There was more space than I could see in a movie that meant something more than the "b" of the site. The player was so laughable that Combs was not enough to remember the victories in past camps. Taking into account the scenario, I believe that the budget does not have enough sustainability and original ideas. I'm very upset that I've paid the Blockbuster prices for this trash. This truth made for television was something to keep me away from this persecution and of course, these poor movies protect you from something that you need to warn. Avoid this movie regardless of.
