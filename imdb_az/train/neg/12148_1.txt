Honestly, who gave this movie 8.1 rating on behalf of God? Indeed, people who make or sound in the film are those who vote. Otherwise, this film suffers! This movie is nothing more than an amateur, or perhaps a student film. I'm a fan of movies and horror movies, but nothing here was worth it. The story and the player was the worst I've ever seen. Toy toys, using airsoft weapons with terrifying special effects, are as bad as everything here. I have everything to do with the bad tone of the film, but F-Bomb fell on every third word, and I think we can win the most out of F-Bomb for a single movie. The film is also made with cheap video cameras, not the actual movie. <br /> <br /> This is just a DVD movie that I would only expect for an amateur film shown on the country's public speaking stations. <br /> <br /> Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say is that it was a terrible loss of a free movie rental voucher. This is a precious time you will never come back. Unfortunately, it was lost for me at this time, but it's not too late for you. If you rent this movie, consider this alert.
