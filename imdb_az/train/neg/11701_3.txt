Another example of Stephen King's books not being filmed. (Even Carrie, one of the best, was dropped from the book to fit the screen). The main purpose of the story is always around a lawyer over a diet that "deliberately" killed an ancient gypsy woman. He was not guilty in the court, though he was guilty of an accident with the help of the judge and the local police chief. The dead body of a dead-chained woman's 3 is damaging, and our main character, Billy (guilty), is subtle and delicate. Although the film was kept with the book, on the contrary, despite the end of a typical King, the actor was stylized and forced. We did not go from one scene to another, and acted as we read in a consecutive game. King himself made a crowd in the film (like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that these authors should remain: authors. Leave actors to actors. Everyone in this movie is not that great. I've seen the biggest characters in the movie better.
