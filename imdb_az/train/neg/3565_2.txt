Stephen King is generally well-known for his illness, and this is good, but this story is very tragic. Some movies, characters, or feelings of sadness for the situation they are ending up here ... You just feel depression. The film welcomes the family and the creepy old Fred Guinea, who first informs the cemetery of the pets, but this ground will not stay anywhere. <br /> <br /> Lui (Dale Midkoff), his wife, and his wife Lale (Dale Midkoff), have a lot of potential, but after losing their potential to be a good horror movie and poor, extremely dumb, Rachel (Denise Crosby), their children Ellie and Gage and their cat move to a new home in Maine. Judge Fred Gwyne is warned by a livestock farmer on how to cater for the local pet cemetery and how. Louis does not think this and nothing, until the family cat is killed. He buries the cemetery in the cemetery and comes to his life, feeling constant in the family and wants to stay alone. One day, Gage runs along the road and runs to a truck and is killed and Louis knows that he should bury her in the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Gage changes when she comes to life and wants to kill her. <br /> <br /> I blame the directors and screenwriters with Stephen King's works that do not translate well into films. In this case, Mr. King was a screenwriter, but I blame him for his terrible story. Until the end, it's so meaningless and fancy, but it laughs before. A little dead comes back from the dead and tries to kill things that seem to be a small scalpel, and not just that, but to lift their bodies and eventually take the body from the outside to the ground! (?) I know that this is actually not certain, seriously, how foolish it might be? The scene of the death of Louis, the cats, now residing in order to kill him, is sad, because the cat did not deserve it. All of this took into consideration his own work and killed him. The event in which he placed his own baby is instantly unbearable. It is not unpleasant sad, the whole situation is not terrible to just think. After Gage's princesses, who avoid the drunken surroundings before dying, why .... Why was a movie that ended with a baby's death? But ... even worse, even after the killing of Gage, what happened to Louis in the cemetery? What did he expect? Why did King King write this horrible story and why turned into a movie? <br /> <br /> My rating: **** *. 90 minutes. R. for violence.
