Probably when I explained the meaning of the "B-film", I left the meeting, but what I saw was ridiculous. Want a good summary of this movie? <br /> <br /> The 5-minute "V-SAN staff" (the most terrifying acronym) I've never heard of in the film is that a "base" was killed by vampires, and then in the background there was a clear ladder on a billboard with a clear daylight (DOWN? When will this happen?) 2210. OK ... (smoke, I'll go back) <br /> Yes, a good flavor Asian chick, red cowboy wannabe, floating captain, goth vampire / Hot Topic is a part-time cashier, and wussy noob is second to none, all of them being played by the same actors, as if I was seeing Micheal Ironside with this flick. Sam Fischer does not have enough money in Splinter Cell? <br /> <br /> The very original thing about Vampire Wars is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> When I looked at this movie, it was one of the most delicate attempts I had ever given to PCI PC cards When will the wall begin to count as a room in a magic room? The money needed for this film could be used better.
