In this movie, I bought a DVD for this girlfriend who shared the same name as a dream girl and took a movie about paranormal. The film is completely video, so it has a special PBS look. Special effects are phonetic, but in reality, we have some fears in the film we are jumping into the chair. <br /> <br /> In some cases, there is a particularly fearful sign of the Burial Mary monument. <br /> <br /> HAPPINESS, the bad action, the plot scenes are long and boring, and I'll tell you the last. If you buy the movie, rent it, and if you buy it, please make sure you pay less than $ 5.
