<br /> <br /> Since I have been to Hungary, I have heard so many people saying good and better things about Ãœvegtigris so far, but in fact I do not understand the cause of all the fuss. <br /> <br /> I've had many points in the movie, some drawings really make me happy, but as with every Hungarian movie, stereotyped characters are again present, and the story is also very elegant. <br /> <br /> Rudolf Peter is always as good as it is, Reviczky is brilliant, but others are just <br /> <br /> How long should a good Hungarian film pass?
