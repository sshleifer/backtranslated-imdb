Warning Spoiler. . . I have to agree with you, it was almost there. It was such a bad movie about such an interesting and interesting story. There was such a word, but the player was the best laugh. Some sets were beautiful and realistic. Others are outside a theme park. As I look, I was laughing, I thought what would happen, serious scenes. I really like this movie, but I could not. The best part was the battle between the "King" and the death of friends. I liked the penalty of Queens. And the last shot was a nice shot though. There are so many better movies to watch. I do not recommend this.
