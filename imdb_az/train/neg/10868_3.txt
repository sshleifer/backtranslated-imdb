With a story and scenario written by older pupils, the Seduction Gospel tries to present the romantic, experienced experience itself. The two main characters have the potential to be interested - both male and female, engage in "single women (or woman lead)", but the "Seduction Gospel" does not even work. The 'Seduction Gospel', which refrains from sincerely examining the identity of these two characters, depends on a subtle, pseudo-stereotype-based substance. "Art of Hate" is an insult - insulting men and women, insulting their characters, and insulting the audience's expectations. He gets all the awesome good people we know and plays painful interactions while waiting to put us into idols. Ji-wan is a grown-up, spoiled, manipulative bitch. As the viewer likes it, he is expected to close his flaws and forgive. Min-jun, well, it's the same. What a wonderful person. In this film, "humor" is primarily about attempts by Ji-wan and Min-ju to intertwine each other in the glorious art of lying and manipulation. No character development has been made, and we have not learned what Ji-wan and Min-ju really are. We just have to accept them and do not ask questions - they are not cute, and that's all it's important. Many references to the popularity of the main actors in the scene views of Azn Cinema are called "Seduction's Stiffness Art". <br /> <br /> If you're still in high school, you've loved Grace, or you're a victim of a pain, you can enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> "Romantic" is not a very good history film.
