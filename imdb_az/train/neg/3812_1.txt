Full House is one of the worst TV series ever! Why? Because you think that all the characters are so terrible. The best character Joey is sometimes irritating. I want to kill myself when I talk to her, DJ, who writes her character. To celebrate when Danny started with her own philosophy. <br /> <br /> Example: DJ earned about ten thousand dollars or more in casino. However, he should not gamble according to the law, but not eighteen. She was ready to pay her money, but then Danny let her go and did not allow her to raise money because she was not eighteen years old. Give me life, give me a break? The scene I saw was stupid and childhood, I immediately closed the television. Some of them say that they did not sell such a child. Can we imagine that the Full House in the world is entertaining and funny? Every word that Shakespeare has written in this series knows how to write to Shakespeare and writing a complete home, except for the sake of writing a stupid thing like a child and stupid! <br /> <br /> Make an episode like 'Do not Follow the Full House' for a poor heart or anyone with a bad medical condition or any life or real will. Keep yourself stupid and bully. This is not the worst TV show ever! I would like to follow Teletubbies later. 'Do not Follow'.
