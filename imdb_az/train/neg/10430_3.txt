There are many good things about the new BSG: There are several Cylon roles for models 8 and 6, for example, two actors played very well. Galactica ("The ship is not a network on my dead body!") Industrial design has a sense of the old school Also, all the space battles, special effects (experienced fantastic watcher cartoon) This is the bitter end of the end of childhood <br /> Yes, in the first part, the scenes in space, the rails in the cage, and the very good thing, but the mushy ending? I always watch movies and show them with a hidden timer, so how much time I did not know that it was up to the end, for me it was a kind of torture to see that it was the end of the process every time I thought it was the last scene, the last stroke, the nature of every frakking! It's important for us to know this: a) a great sister and grandfather What is the point of connection? Now I have more European style of work and casual attempts at movies and shows, but it was funny but it was funny . <br /> <br /> I saw that part of life is the "Last Frakkin Special," and Ron has shown his cluelessness in this area: a good end to the story, so I just did not do it! As in the last episode, there is not much about the characters. All this was thought to be "in the past for thousands of years", the mitochondrial Eve thing was also used in the Hitchhikers Manual for Galaxy and I believe that there are many BSG guards who know this story, especially the H2G2 story. And Hera has spoken, now it's all a good, well-worked storyline. Instead, Roslin is a former student who is younger than 20 years old. Do not get me wrong, I am full of young men and old women. More power than them. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is simply the writing of this series. This is going to moreso even for the latest episode. Hopefully, it's good with Lost and 24 Series finals.
