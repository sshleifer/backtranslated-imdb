Angered by nerves such as nails on the blackboard, a zombie-like move was to embarrass the casting of a second film; like the Teenaged Witch heroes in Sabrina --- Being a cult film, even though the "stoners" are still around if a movie is so terrible, but oh so amateur, scripts can act around the actors, their lines are read as slowly as the film is mixed --- Modeled, non-logical sets after the LA subdivisions save straight from ToysRus! Was this a totally and completely brave film? Logic in this wind, with no sense, meaningless and "monster", blew a wind, so foolish and unable to catch a turtle in a buzz - iron, lip and amazon! My focus was on all the way; a smoky, persistent chain crash, which covers many vehicles, ends at an end ... after a ridiculous ray-gun battle in prison on another planet, a pneumatically-disadvantaged sexual and mental unbalanced bounty hunter holds a delayed extra hero leak --- EARTH! The fact that no one is forced to explode can really enjoy watching one of these. That's bad!
