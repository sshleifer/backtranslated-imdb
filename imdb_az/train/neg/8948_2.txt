"Nineteen Sekty-Four" is a film about a futuristic society that controls everything and can not be trusted to anyone. It's a very dark movie, and it's something you will not feel good about. It is self-dependent on the treachery and the human nature of a romantic and love affair in society. The film has very good ideas and it is good for the society to describe the colors in dark colors (compared to the dreams of happiness and bright colors) and images with a sense of loneliness through people and places. However, despite the foolishness of the film that reflected this idea, the film was too slow and did not fully accept the ideas. Instead of explaining a story, he spent a lot of time thinking about it.
