When I released this movie from my work with the other three similar films .. I watched with very low expectations. Now this movie is wrong. What are you paying for? It's a love, betrayal, lie, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. Of course, it's not Hollywood's blockbuster, it's not bad for those who are cheaper. Perhaps I will not watch this movie again. In short, it is a type of movie that you want to spend a lot of time at a local television station late at night, or spend a bit of time on a Sunday afternoon in a television station that wants to spend some time. Despite the bad acting, stereo lines and the lower cameras running. I'm not like putting the movie off and not getting into my DVD player. The story has been seen many times in many films. It is not different, but better, not worse. <br /> <br /> Only moderate movie.
