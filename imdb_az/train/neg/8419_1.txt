I was expecting Dreamgirls to wait a while ... all this attracts the attention of conscious investigations, nominations and the press. And it should be said that the first quarter of the movie was good! This really describes the scene of black music later. However, as in the film, my family and our whole family were swayed by our thoughts. Reading the word went on one after the other. I say something serious, there is only one music number, and it would be broken down by RENT. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I do not notice any character development in any character; I did not think what happened to them! Even though Eddie Murphy's character is dead than the drug dose, I was not sad, but could not feel any emotionally for this character. Finally, the conflict was not merely enough to care for the viewer, but along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a movie based on Ray, Chicago and Rental (Ray and Chicago were beautiful films in my opinion). I generally think that this movie will fit into one who really does not care about a common story but will enjoy two hours of entertaining and entertaining songs.
