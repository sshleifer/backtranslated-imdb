When I was young, I thought that the first film was really good at the time of childhood, so I decided to see it later. Why is it that some movies do not go on, because the first movie is usually good and that's it? Mostly because of Ariel and Eric, Ursula's brother (his family's octopus feet) has a daughter that is not allowed outside of home because Morgana is concerned about her getting married. Ursula's sister urges her to become her mermaid, as her mother is. This is Ariel's return to the sea to find him. The same good voice artists, a story that can think a little more. Enough!
