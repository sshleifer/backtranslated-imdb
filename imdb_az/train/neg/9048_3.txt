The beginning of the week as an ABC movie. This is a young student of two innocent women who go to the prison in a small Southern city by railroad. They are not allowed to phone calls, and nobody knows. <br /> <br /> Television version (for the time) was scary. <br /> <br /> Aggression, torture, beating, insulting, and degradation lead to a very disturbing conclusion. No nudity and beatings were quite discreet, but the general feeling of sleaziness fell. The unrated version is even worse - there is plenty of nudity, extreme violence and, in particular a disgusting sequence, we see a crying female prisoner who is forced to "use" a lesbian guard. YUCK! There is nothing wrong with exploiting movies, but it only stretches out its threshold. Filmmakers have the feeling that they are tortured and ill-treated by these poor women - all of them are dragged onto your face as you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> What is the situation in the Caucasus? One patient, sleazy film. Not recommended.
