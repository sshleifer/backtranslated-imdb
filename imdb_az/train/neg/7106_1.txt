I'm not a big fan of horror movies, and I just saw a handful of them (and none on Halloween or Friday) - but I'm grateful for a horror movie. <br /> <br /> What a strange thing about a small plastic skull that goes everywhere? All the images are long-lasting, so there is no real surprise in this movie. <br /> <br /> The third cousin of his wife, Claus Von Bulov (John Hudson), marries as a family of Donna. (Peggey Webber, one of the worst performances), starts seeing the skulls and listens to the mysterious cries of a group of peacocks in her husband's house. Did I remind myself that her husband lost her first marriage in a mysterious choking event? OOOOH !!!! <br /> <br /> <strong> Violence against the people living in the Caucasus, if you want to see a good version of these goods, try "Fortune-i Reverse". <br /> <br /> <strong> MSTing's health was good, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> It is short, paired with Silver, but allows you to watch well. <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Screaming Skull"; <br /> Eight stars for MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Now Von Bulov himself says, "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
