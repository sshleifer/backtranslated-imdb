This is one of the movies that should be better than it's been. I'm afraid to think of what the editor of the Blockbuster has looked like, because it was part of the director's DVD epic episodes. <br /> <br /> There were many sweet guys in this movie, but there were many lovers in this movie. Harmful exploitation. I want to write up the next guy around their BVDs as I watch a bevy of hotties, but even have a right to wait a little more. However, there was no general loss; at least one of Drew Fuller's (covered) debris and we really want to cut his hair. And Huntley Ritter also has a "cuter look" (and also acting) of "Bring it to Him." There are always silver lining children. For this you need to look really hard. And sometimes, you need to use your pause button.
