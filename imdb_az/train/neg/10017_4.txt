"The Life of Dragstrip Hollow" appears to have occurred in a period of time throughout the world when a child could experience the biggest offense, the law and the traffic ticket. It opens with a young female automaker of the business, who is oppressing himself in the car race. It's about this racing race - it's B-flick basically rock-n roll, man! The American people love the party, and yet they did not oppose a brother among adults. There are several entertaining double entrances and fruits sharing (Necking Kid: "We thought we were going for a little fresh air" ... Father: "Where did you think you would find him in the throat?") But it's a little late when the ghost comes. The 65-minute short film really tricks us with a screen shot and a climactic car race with a masquerade decorated with a Scooby Doo. But for some nostalgia enthusiasts, some stupid entertainers. ** from ****
