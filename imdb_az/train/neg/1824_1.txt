I do not envy this movie Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black. In short, do not dig. Perhaps the very predictable, more or less exploited Ben Stiller's missing role, or all the funny scenes, is something to forget about this movie. Even Christopher Walken's appearance is fierce. I'm very upset. I love Stiller's player. I liked most of his films, the latter was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and was not so bad. About Jack Black ... Well, I did not see you doing something better than Ali Fidelity. What is Rock School? Ooops, terrible.
