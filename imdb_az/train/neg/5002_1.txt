How could such a terrible script make this shooting? Ridiculous, predictable and thoroughly incredible, it is well-directed and slickly directed, but the material is too bad, and it's still one of the worst alarms I've ever seen for many years. It's not a strange bad and entertaining way. Even if you are an admirer of the outside, do not spend any kind of money.
