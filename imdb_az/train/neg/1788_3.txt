<br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the lowest point of BING CROSBY's long career at Paramount. The scenario is as calm as you can imagine, and neither casual Bing nor William Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwicke can do anything to restore it. <br /> <br /> Bendix looks extremely foolish in a page boy's parent. The weak Rhonda Fleming is a hero of a stock suit requiring adoringly in Bing, and another thing is likely to fight a few unequal ballads with a voice called the occasion. <br /> <br /> Just plain horrible! Mark Twain's mind scenario is unclear. Crosby fans can only permanently evaluate this defect in a surprising way. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> Not recommended for children.
