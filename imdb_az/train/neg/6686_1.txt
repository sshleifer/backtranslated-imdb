This movie does not have a lot of fun. This movie does not have a frightening, funny or even interesting scene. He introduces himself as a horror, and then calls himself a comedy. Even the Bible is written. <br /> <br /> In this film, you need to be one of the easiest entertainment on earth to have good health. Even if you love this movie, there is no standard for the audience, even a LITTLE BIT. I'm having a very difficult time to figure out that filmmakers are trying to do the job. Its funny, intimidating, shocking, or not interesting. So it was necessary to have a drama? Because it's not really dramatic. <br /> <br /> Please give yourself a favor and do not see this movie. Life is very valuable to watch this 90 minutes.
