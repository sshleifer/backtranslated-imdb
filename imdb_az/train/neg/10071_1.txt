I saw this movie in a film that took place at Sundance 09. <br /> <br /> Because I was a movie that American beauty would say something, I hoped for Towelhead. Unfortunately, this was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Naturally, I have seen numerous Sundance festivals, Towelhead, the only Sundance movie I want to go early. <br /> <br /> The worst problem with the towel begins with a collection of "provocative" concepts related to cultural stereotypes, not with a clear body drama. Scenario comes from the same novel by Alicia Erian. The famous Edith Wharton timetable comes to mind: Although I admire the author's political views, I know a good novel enough to be good. These observations, in particular, threaten to be abandoned, because its political views are deeply rooted and simple. <br /> <br /> For a more detailed review, please see: Any of the many professional reviews available online. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, amateur glances look more bamboozled. When you look at these and similar websites, you often encounter the "perfect", "breath", "deep", "shocking" ... you are embarrassed to read me, but it surprises me. Indeed, I have met many people who have come up with a thoughtful, thought-provoking, deeply thought-provoking idea of ​​any book or movie dealing with racial, cultural, sexual or sexual matters. If you are such a person, in any way, Towelhead is rented and transferred by him. On the other hand, you can safely pass your standards to a higher level.
