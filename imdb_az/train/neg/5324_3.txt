Vovochka, daytime hooligan and so on. The main character Vovochka is labeled as a bad influence for children in the neighborhood. He meets with the words of wisdom from several adults, he changes his difficult ways and still deserves to be. Personally, I saw the actor playing Vovochkaya, but it was disappointing, but the change of the movie snooze would make Vovochka feel when he wanted to be good, but when the bad things were not happening yet. It's a little bit different from what I want to say, this fight is a bit different from the other films of the same genre. Generally I did not really care about this movie, though it was intended for a young audience.
