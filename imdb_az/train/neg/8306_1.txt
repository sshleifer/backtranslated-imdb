The ET is cautious with Dannielyn Smith. Leave the child alone. He is most likely to be psychotic, depressed or aggravated on a regular basis. Imagine how she thinks about Princess Diana and her personal life. Now poor little girl Ashley Olson wants to stay alone. No miracle Greta Garbo was a fuss and said, "I want to be alone." How much does ET get from this little girl? Is there anything better in the ET report? I have many people who do not really care about the color of his birthday cake and balloons. By the way, I never heard of any of these trials on Anna Nicholas's will and her legacy. Who pays Larry, Howard and little Dannielynn's lifestyle? Is it ET?
