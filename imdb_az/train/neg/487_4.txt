What Does the Leader Think About? Anyone who read Artemis' biography was impressed by the courage to suffer social upheaval during the Renaissance and tortured Tassi to prove his guilt. It shows real independence and freedom - it puts MAN at its worst time. Why should films that describe Renaissance be clinically beautiful and romantic? Are we afraid of seeing the mighty side of life or winning a happy happy Hollywood? I will always defend the freedom of a filmmaker to create his own reality in a movie, and I will not be able to turn Arimisia's life story into my head. This is a very disappointing choice by the creators of this film.
