This documentary is the reconstruction of Betty Pajin (Paige Richards) in the last few years of his career. Tennessee tease was the most famous pin-up queen in history. The most memorable work came in the 1950s and was fetorial images, captive and cat fighting "girly flicks." Kino Star News Irving Klaw (Dukey Flyswatter) taught Betty what he would do in front of the camera. There were no nudity in popular photographs or "stag films", but Klawa was charged with distributing immoral materials and was ordered to destroy them in order to avoid tracking. It's not surprising that Betty's follow up on his career. The jacket with her black hair, brown eyes and an hour-long glass-shaped gear would not have been disappointing for decades. For all this, Marilyn said that she had taken more pictures from Monroe and was second only to Elvis Presley, the world's most photographed picture. Betty Peysi has denied her last years. This movie would be really good; <br /> <br /> Miss Richards is surprised at her. Bra, panties, garter belt and hose do not damage at least its appearance. The cast also includes Jaimie Henkin, Jana Strain, Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone. Please be advised that this movie may change the heart rate.
