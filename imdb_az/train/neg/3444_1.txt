This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Despite the shooting, the "special effects", moving and I talk about the plot? <br /> <br /> According to some information, this is something. <br /> <br /> This is a good example of "working hard" and I will try to explain it: <br /> she tried to shoot this movie; it should have been one of the movies that you can not really say is that hell continues until the end. Break open for the next 5 minutes, knowing who's dead and who has died, who and why you did not know who killed and killed, when you thought you had a lot of time and the movie was over! But Olga Levens, the writer who is the writer, is Olga, if you know it is something like "Unbreakable" or "Business." Writer, Director, Producer, Scriptwriter, Caster, Producer of Design, Art Director, Costume Designer and one of the characters is a double scene ... It is basically a female film and Olga Levens can not go wrong with "Levens Productions" :-): ) It might come as a good shock, but "this time" Olga dream is to skip the scene instead of this event, dreams come true ... but wait! it was all a dream ... or was not it ??? The picture was demolished and I realized that there was no such thing, the girl was alone on the boat ... in fact there was no ship ... wait! Again, there is a ship and children! They are alive! Thank God! No, they urge him to shout ... but then the boat disappears, maybe they will die? or maybe have never begun. <br /> <br /> If you understand that you love this movie, on the contrary, this is a drill and I want to know how this hell will end this movie ... <br /> <br /> If you value your time , in this case there is a waste of 90 minutes ...
