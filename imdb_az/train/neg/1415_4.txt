I have been looking at many views from this point of view and have had high expectations. Then .... <br /> <br /> Here's my extra "two cents" already sent, a great "translation missing" review. Premise: Morgan was 'stuck' in a dusty little town he met with his favorite Scarlet running at a local supermarket. <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> Qafqaz> NOT. About this shopping destination. First, Freeman looks at Target as he enters Harrods. Later, he entered a T-shirt rack that had not been in any store from the beautiful Red. Morgan Scarlet is portrayed by any and all of the reality and is brilliantly described by everyone and Scarlett knowing everything in life. <br /> <br /> A repertoire liked Scarlet and the old Cuban battlefield, in which case a car, physically requires a previous hubby attack. Freeman's defense ... finally ... he is shattered from disbelief and can not really do anything to deal with this very real, sadly sadistic aspect of life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Freeman's character is considered to be Scarlet's job interview key for washing car wash and new, very closely blouse blouse. Another point that Freeman is CLUELESS. All the aspects of Freeman's Scarlet Truth are concerned with the endless "scene talk" that he or she enters in one or other phase of Freeman's experience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Freeman has the right to say that Scarlet would be a young man in the future, and then ignore the brick walls facing comfortably: uneducated, white-colored skills and experiences, very poor, family support, and self-esteem for a lifetime. Scarlet, from Freeman, learns this kind of life lessons: some people pay $ 100 for a T-shirt and can open a blouse for educational and white work skills instead of doors. In the end, Freeman offers Scarlet a strange provocation with a 'star', even knowing that Freeman can not go back to his immutable life in the city, even though he can not afford gas for the death of Scarlet at night.
