It is a mild, gentle 80th Armenian fest, with some taste of some evil beetle for human blood. If you can overcome the ridicule of everything, it can actually be a little bit of a benefit. The actor is terrifying and unobtrusive, you just have to capture movies along with the sounds of gury slug, but the film does not spend a full time. Special effects are really good and have good eyesight. Perhaps he reminded of the reconstruction of Blob, probably everyone's hardness. All of this, of course, may worsen your time in half an hour, but there is a strong stomach and I will not see this movie if it is not.
