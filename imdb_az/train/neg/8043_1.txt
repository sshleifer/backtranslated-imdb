I do not usually have a problem getting away from a bad movie, but it's a unique situation. This movie was so bad that we were sitting in almost everything and wished that it would take a minute of a good movie to pray. Undoubtedly, I was disappointed with betrayal. Set up in a beach house that celebrates a group of college-friendly holidays, this film suffers from many problems that cause it to fail. First, there are intermediate gaps. Secondly, the C-list can perform a damn very little of the value of the actors (I do not even boldly call them B), so potentially failing in any scene. Thirdly, the film's degree is not too awkward to watch the most out of the building, making the most difficult and extremely difficult time for the audience to have very little surprises. Fourth, and most importantly, the end is partly because of how it ends (it turns out to be a killer) and the information is just terribly partial because it's completely anti-climate. film credits, So it would just be like a bad joke /> This is not the only movie that I ever say is the worst movie in the scene and i have a lot. <br /> As you run across all the opposite directions you've been seeing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know the secret you will be doing is never happy to hear it really.
