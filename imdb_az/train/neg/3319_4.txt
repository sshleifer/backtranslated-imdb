I was surprised to see this movie. I heard it was the best movie in the novel. <br /> <br /> The true Jane Austen fan can appreciate this adaptation and is a mystery to my eyes. Scenario writers are determined to end the funny humor that embarrasses the best in the world and destroys the sense of the era. Gwyneth Paltrow is a tougher heroine (but then you can play any 'hot' American star), Tony Collette is wrong, and poor Ewan McGregor is getting ready to appear laughable! <br /> <br> I can not say anything really good about this movie. I look like few people who do not appreciate it, but I do not want my advice, look at Kate Beckinsale's television production - believe me, it's better for the garbage.
