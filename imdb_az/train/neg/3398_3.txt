Apparently, the film's aim is to show the Russians the aggressive nature of the Russians, or at least those Russians who can go beyond their own countries; It is very easy to rob a bank in England; The British police are so ineffective that these subjects can not find a bank robbery when leaving the country. Additionally, Nicole Kidman and his predecessor Russian counterparts have spoken a language that has not been identified anywhere, but may have been spoken by aliens in the Ural Mountains, but it was part of Russia. So Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, please go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and do not learn Russian grammar and its pronunciation.
