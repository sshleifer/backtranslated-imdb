Sunshine is a product imported from Europe in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, an epic story of the Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name appears to be the Sun. The family has a modest start, then it is wise, it moves upward, renamed it, and hopes to integrate into the Hungarian society that successive generations can develop professionally. This story is explained by the eyes of the greatest child in each of the three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. The approach of Sonnensch to the life of WW-II and the Holocaust in Europe does not work very well. <br /> <br /> Sunshine is regarded as an artistic achievement, but it missed an opportunity. The story line dominated by world history is expected and transparent; it's enhanced by voice coverage narrations and television footage. The family's "plan" is a predictable event [ie. Hapsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, fascism, communism, etc.) with less continuity, depth or detail. The subject of Jewish assimilation is unique and significant sub-themes [clandestine 'daily and family philosophy] that end up in the family's character and reliability will end. Alternatively, cinematographers ensure the continuity of the generations using the hate and insufficient themes. Ralph Fiennes shows sparkle lights, but its performance is far from premium material. The casting format "3 to 1" is the distribution of a viewer and is going to be a better movie theater than a movie theater. Sunshine is mainly the Hungarian "History Channel" material. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
