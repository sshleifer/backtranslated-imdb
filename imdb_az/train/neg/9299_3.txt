While watching this movie, I tried to figure out why I was worried about it. Although the film's main area is potentially good, there is every kind of inaccurate / useless subplot. The Hollywood marketing people had to dictate men and women who were too bad, endless dual crickets and very close and sexually explicit men. It is strange to see that we are more sexually explicit than the President and his wife. Many fields and subpopulations make the film much wider, and none of the symbols develop properly - I did not feel as if I knew no one, except that everyone was corrupt and bad. The end is totally incomplete - it was more than what anyone could want, but what it meant. As a result, there is no explanation for what everyone has done, except for the double-crossing, which serves as an additional symbol of corruption. I am surprised that many established (and good) actors agree to make such a blank movie. <br /> <br /> It looked like a movie made by college students working on the 2nd or 3rd project. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time, regardless of whether you are in the movie class or what you do. shoot a film.
