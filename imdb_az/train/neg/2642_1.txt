Slow, Slow, Slow ... There is no mystery or excitement in this movie. If you do not understand who the "mole" is in the first ten minutes, you must be brain dead. It could have been a secret service because it took them all together to bring together movies. There are no charming characters in the movie (not a movie). The speed of the movie is slow and there is no tension. A massive killer is a good shot if he does not want to hit Michael Douglas, though he seems to hit a huge glass. The funniest scene in the film is when the presidents spoil the word code at the end of the anticlimactic. Highly ridiculous laugh. At least six people got up and left the film early. If I did not sit in the middle of my troops, I would join them. I do not recommend this movie to everyone.
