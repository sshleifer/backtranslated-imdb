There are a few spoilers below, in which one ONE can disrupt the surprise of an unexpected and really funny scene. This series also contains information about the first film. <br /> <br /> I took this movie to the DVD, someone gave me a gift for my room. <br /> <br /> This film was worse than La Noche del Terror Ciego first of all. In addition, many of the features of the first film have changed dramatically. <br /> <br /> The concept behind the series has long been the Knights Templar local department. The feature film is filmed in horrible and secret ceremonies in English (first subtitled). After these murders were discovered, local immigrants put Templars on death that their eyes could no longer be used, so they were able to escape from Hell. Now, because of some events, the Templars go from the dead to the ancients, in the first place, to take revenge on the villagers they have fabricated. Of course, because conscious knights do not have eyes, they can find their victims when they get a little sound. <br /> <br /> Templars from the 12th century, the Crusaders. They were only 150 years ago, before the suppression of the Pope and others in the early 1300's. Since they were secret, there were always rumors about their ceremonies, especially for the initiative. Also, for the cause of society, you do not have church officials who control things, that is, when there were things that were not heated, they did not have any men. And according to the nature of their trials, they confessed to torture. The order was strong in France, but there were films in Portugal and Spain. <br /> <br /> In the first film, the victim of virginity and drinking blood, of course, the breasts of horror, of course, this is a frightening film), after the knights come to their lives, attacking their victims, eating and drinking their blood; After all this, it all disappears. You still have the same scene (redone, same footage) that gives the virgin sacrifice, but they drain blood into a bowl and drink it. So, when they come back, they only cut off swords or punish people, and I must say that they are less effective means of disturbing the audience. There is also a problem: In the first film, these places now say that here they are close to the Templars, where about 1473 burning people on the cross and the 500th anniversary of the peasants. Templars are less interested in losing their eyes. First, they are scattering them with crows. Yes, maybe it was just me, but many people appeared in the film for the first time, though it was dead). <br /> <br /> The purpose of this film is to have a rich person who used a time frame. The shooting of the film differs from each other. Distract the child's unconscious when giving a break for the jeep. The child's father was already forced to try to get a jeep from this rich man, so he went and said to find his father. Blue goes up a bit and is funniest scene in the movie. Of course, at this point the child will not die? <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie to anyone. It's not so bad that it's funny, so it's just a mediocre fear movie. Most of the film is made up of a few people in a church, each of them making different attempts to go alone to save the blind dead. At the end of the movie, you are not surprised at the end; in fact it was quite disappointing. If you're into the news of seeing a Spanish horror movie, look at the first movie that has at least not innovative ideas and anticipated results.
