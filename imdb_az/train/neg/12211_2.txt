George P. Cosmatos fulfills a pure desire "Rambo: First Blood Part II". The United States did not win a war in Vietnam. This country has been damaged by the imagination, and this movie continues the fairy story of innocent soldiers. Only the bad guys were the leaders of this war. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice it. US-Americans are very patriotic, bemoans who do not appreciate the achievements of a single soldier, but there is nothing else but confidence in leading officers and politicians. As with any war-defying film (for example, "We Have Soldiers"), this also refers to a clear cause for engagement in South Asia. And the reason for this is that of every US soldier there. Instead, Rambo will take revenge on all the wounds of the nation. It would be better to do better than to deal with the dreams. "We have to win this time?" Yes, you do it.
