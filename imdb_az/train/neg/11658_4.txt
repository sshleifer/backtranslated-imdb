Scary Movie 2 is definitely worse than 4 movies, because there are many areas, bad moves, pretty tedious and really cheesy jokes. But. And that's great, but it's a good actor, a good recurring joke, and a good start. Tim Curry, a good actor, is a good recurring joke, creepy, bizarre butterfly disgusting man who is always poverty, laughing decent things. And the good start is scary Movie 2 plot is original and is being invited to stay in a creepy night with the main characters, which are a host of new characters along the way /> Excursist. <br /> <br /> Is not the old palace, not the deceit, but will the night survive? This movie is not very good, but if you're bored, you can watch it too!
