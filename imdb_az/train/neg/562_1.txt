I like music, but I hate it as an admirer of Dickens. ** ARMED FORCES ** How many guys have enough energy to read and dance at work? London's poor go to school? Fagin and Dodger are going to sunbathe? Romania is not fully committed.

The worst thing is that Mark Lester, like Oliver, is often surprised and surprised by whether he really is the main character. Whatever he can do when he reads his picture in no way does not help a girl to hear the voice. <br /> <br /> Dickens, who respects her, resembles David Lean's 1948 fine movie or 6-hour adaptation of the BBC. -80. Avoid this bloody bleaching of a musical.
