I am a great admirer of the science of the 50s, but this is not my favorite. Although the concept behind the film is a natural tool for a classic child bopper fantasy, the director considered it very difficult to carry the film. It is clear that he did not work with any money, because the whole film is packed with swollen dialogue that goes on forever. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a movie in a movie that I often killed. <br /> <br /> Probably, the "blob images" in the entire movie are less than 60 seconds, and the rest is in a very poorly written, dialogue dialogue. Steve M. and Anita C were good to see together, but the good heavens ... how do you think someone believes in the correct thoughts as teenagers?
