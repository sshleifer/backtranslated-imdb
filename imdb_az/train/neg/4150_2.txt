Really really. For some reason, I've seen films that I do not like much, but I have never seen a film that has failed in every aspect of the movie. Despite the failure of the film, Hercules in New York can be said in some ways. <br /> <br /> This is not the least loved movie, but the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Acting is the first thing that hit you. I have never seen a worse movie than pornography. In fact, there are plenty of pornographic films, so a cursed site is better. <br /> Of course, this is a terrible thing. The camera job is amateur.

Finally, this movie is not so bad that it is good or bad, in any way it is pleasant, even drunk. Only a mess and no one is watching.
