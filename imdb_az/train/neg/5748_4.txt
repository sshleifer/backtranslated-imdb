I have to say I hate this movie. I do not want to say that there is Gerard Butler. About half an hour of dull conversation, I really apologize to those who are careful about the plot, and I've been moving rapidly to Gerry's scenes. I really do not know the end, and I'm unhappy. If Gerry was not there, I probably did either of two things: I fell asleep or closed it, but Gerry was the brightest of this movie because she was in the majority of her previous films. Do not worry if you're an admirer of Gerry, it's always beautiful and precious, but if you really want to watch the movie for a movie, you have a good chance, because it's necessary or too many coffee or soda to keep you awake! <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
