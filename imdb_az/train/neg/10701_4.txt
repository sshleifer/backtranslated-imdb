In Merry Madcaps in London, with a treasure hunt, a mistakenly married married politician corrects a young woman with a strong, independent woman who loves her fiancé. An interesting tool for Katharine Hepburn has been very self-motivated to give himself to any person playing aviatrix like Amelia Earhart. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and scriptwriter (Zoe Akins, adapting Gilbert Frankau's book) were designated for this project to have a female perspective, but why all the old clichés were frozen? Billie Burke is a sympathetic, bummer, and the last scene of Hepburn, when her husband went to bed when she went wrong. A curious work, but not a classic for Kate-watchers. ** from ****
