Whoopi Goldberg is weak. Think of it at a friend's banquet party and add a comment to a deep political debate. People only look at him and say, "Oh, what do you know, 'Theodore Rex's star.'" How could someone take it seriously after lowering himself to be the star of this terrible body? Even small children would be terrified of this. This reminded, in particular, the episode "Sigmund and Sea Monsters". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> "Sigmund" has come to think about it. Lying with a smuggler before the producer told him about it? Look at this evil witch in your own danger.
