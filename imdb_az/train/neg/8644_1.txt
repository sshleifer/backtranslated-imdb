<br /> <br /> This film was shot in the north west of Rajasthan province. See Chase - vehicles from India; The whole inscription is Hindi in Hindi. The driver is on the typical Jaipur streets. The palace is located in Amer - Jaipur, about 10 miles from Rajasthan. The film believes that filmmakers in DVD shoot their lives in Kabul and surrounding areas. Almost all of them move scenes in India. The scene they saw in a group of firefighters is so misleading that they did not want to change it to popular songs in Afghanistan. They wrote only the Rajasthani folk song. I know how to do that, because I traveled extensively to that area. They will be able to play a major role in the issue. I protest against film shooters.
