This is the most horrible film I've ever seen. How much loss of magnificent waste. James Cromwell is not an ignorant MP. I could go, but I'll spend more time than anyone who has spent more time at this glance. What part of this film is with us and how will any mind get a plate rifle beyond human tolerance? This is one of the worst 10 films I've ever seen and I love James Garner.
