This film is a long flower one after another. First and foremost, though, they have an unreasonable doping scene where John has smoked his mouth as a stupidity. Wigs and accents are terrible. Older Beatle animated cartoons sound worse. John is portrayed as a liar, jealous, hidden homosexual, liar, in the book of Albert Goldman. Even in regular conversations, "the song was always just two of us". John could not have been meaningful for such supporters. If something like his death showed us, he was very beautiful. A funny scene is just a dumb Beatle fan who just knows John and asks Paul to read yesterday. An outrageous John says, "Sure and I croon knock on one knee, why not put your spouse on the knees and lick my lip" along a line. It made me laugh for days. Indeed, this movie is funny when it tries to get out of the ridicule. John and Paul did not sit at all pontificating all day, they were funny light hearted children to break here where they were more attractive here during The Beatles. Forget it.
