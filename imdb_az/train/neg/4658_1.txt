KEÇMİŞ ENCOUNTER is a terrifying and meaningless manifestation of David Lean classics in 1945 based on Christmas Coward's "Still Life". A doctor brings a spark from a woman's eyes at a railway station, a weak connection, a happy married wife of the Italian family. They encounter an accident with another event, create a momentary momentum, and encourage each other every Wednesday to meet each other. Couple lover, but after spending several days together, they realize they have no real chance and partly agreed. Coward was interested in two ordinary people who love the original game of action. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, veterans of both Super Star and Hollywood Epic, are not the idea of ​​'ordinary people'. Loren is particularly vulnerable - Sophia Loren looks at a full makeup, looks like a million dollars, works as a part-time volunteer public worker at the Counseling Bureau, just right. Burton is looking for confusion with her horned hair, wearing many makeup and platform shoes, and does not seem to be the average General Pratiser. And then, after seeing their comrades, you really do not blame them for having a relationship. Burton is a literary critic who is involved in toxic studies in the evening and treats her husband respectfully. Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, is all day scoop around the house and extremely boring: the most interesting thing you've ever had is about six years ago. Their final scene will aggravate the situation ("You have been a long, far-off road" and so on). This great English actress, John LeMesurier, has a three-minute source as Burton's friend and speaks a little bit of a humble, slightly modest look. A sad and unforgettable performance in a terrible, terrible rehab of cinema classics. Avoid all costs.
