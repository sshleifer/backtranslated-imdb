Spike Lee is sure why this train crash and incorrect Stevie Wander has embraced beautiful music with this beautiful theater scene. It also blasphemes as part of a normal copy of professional blacks. The torture of ethnic filmmakers is a shame. The images are blue and images that have nothing to do with the theme or subtitles, as some college children have written it out. I hate the naked scene, which is sparsely sparring and cops coming in and out of the snipes up to no reason, especially for two reasons. Potential replacement feels that Spike does not respect the audience or has no idea what a film is about. The last scene appears to be thrown to justify the use of a small hammer. This film also supports the idea that all cultural figures use the F-word in a random conversation. I hope the rest of the films will realize that they are in the same pool as they are a movie maker. I think the Clockers association with Scorcesee made a wise move. She should continue to produce documentary films like the Four Minor Girls. Shocking movies do not make the Oscars.
