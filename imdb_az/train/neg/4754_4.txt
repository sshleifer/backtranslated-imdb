I liked the original. It's gorgeous and will always be. Strangely enough, I was really looking forward to seeing again. I'm usually a little older than rebuilding, because there are many of them, but that's what I'm interested in. I really like to get started. Caine is brilliant as usual, and with her Jude Law, which she controls. It was up-to-date and functioning. The last seven minutes to stop it from being really good. In fact, he runs away from being mentally and is simply annoying. The end of the original was fantastic! There was too much tension and incredibly clever! What is this? Despite the tension, it seems that they decided to homosexual Gay's character. If they were too far from trying to be different. And then ... BANG! The law is dead. Roll Credits. This movie is just worth the performance, but the last seven minutes are really dragging it. What a pity!
