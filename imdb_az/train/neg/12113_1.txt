Townies are the most lucrative movie I've ever seen and I've seen Blair Witch movies (parts one and two). It seems confused as you want it to be. It's not funny enough for the comedy, it's not catastrophic for drama, it's not bloody enough for horror and it's not good enough to watch. In my opinion, this movie will be in the "Toxic Avenger" and "Street Trash", there are scenes of a man who "slapstick / bloody" karate. Then a missing girl, a defective (mentally retarded) woman, and a trusting mother is dropped without a drama warning. The only good part of the movie, which seems to be set up as a sitcom without laughter tracks slap herself. The part I talked to is a single TOWNIE, so comforting in an ugly body. This was the only part of the movie that gave me EVERYTHING. The rest were the backbone of my life. Then, at the end of Wayne's (director's) film, a fun documentary with Toby (star) in the public is shown to show how CRUEL Wayne is. It made me sick. While Killer Nerd and Bride Killer Nerd (two movies by Wayne) are not the best, at least it is thought enough that you're up to the end credits. I love Killer Nerd a bit, and there are several lines I have ever used. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, you like superficial movies and want to watch your feet, > <br />
