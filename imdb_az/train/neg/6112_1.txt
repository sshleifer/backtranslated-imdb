When I saw this movie, I was ten years old. I expected a lot of activities. Since I was given 16 degrees Celsius from New York to Escape from Germany, I accepted the film as my return. It was so boring. Later, I realized that this was the place where her husband's husband exhibited. So today you do it through the internet and pay for instant access. Then, 20 years ago, I am still angry that I have spent my time with this movie. This is a mild porn for schoolchildren. Bo Derek's coloring and coloring are fine. But they called the movie Undressing Bo and painted it.
