When I checked it on IMDB after seeing it, I was very surprised to find out that this movie has a good rating. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. It looks like a good movie from the beginning, but I could not believe how bad it was when it came to surgery. This noise destroys everything! Imagine that this is open and then you listen to what you say. I saw Germany in the film, but I do not know what they say in English, but ironic things like "Yes, it's not right, it does not hurt" ... what is this? It's just stupid to say yourself "think about something else" and then forget your pain just by thinking about your daughter. And his mother ... how hell is doing something like this? Someone came to tell her, her son was killed in an operation (what type of wait was needed). He found some letters in the Jessica Albas bag. plus "he knows the hospital" things ... and then makes him understand "a second"? What is hell? ^ And the end ... why the police twist them? The patient died in the operation, all this happened. This drunken doctor does not know anything else ... and then they all, even the girlfriend, knock? Why ??? Despite all this, I think Christensen is doing a bad job, but it does not really matter to me ... The mistakes I have mentioned above and the stupid things are a problem. I watched this movie with some friends and we were all so disappointed ... I say one of the worst films I've ever seen ... Do not just watch it;)
