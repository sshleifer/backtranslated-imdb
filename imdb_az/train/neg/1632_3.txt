Karin Mani (who?) Has cleared a 'bubble', an embarrassing draft for a charismatic Charles Bronson, who spoiled his parents, grandparents or somebody else, and surprised the young excitement with "karate" skills. On an important stage, he interferes with the abduction of a raid, and a moron police officer leaves the HER everywhere, so after taking off some cool shower scenes and some abortion jails, he must take his blah blah blah. Are there many movies like this? If you believe it, the script will be counted more than ever before. Mani turns out to be a complete type of Shaw Type, which he prepares with his role as Death Wish, and I'm delighted with this type of thing, but the movie is a dull apparatus. Successful actors will be frustrated by their roles and will be able to unleash a fantastic non-boring skill and a judge who is uncle of the producer.
