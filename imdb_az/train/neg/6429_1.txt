I personally advise you to stay out of this movie. There is a hole in which everyone is watching and weak choreography of war. It's slow and not very convincing. <br /> <br /> If you buy a DVD version of this movie Hong Kong Legends, then the only thing you need to hear is the Bey Logan audio commentary. <br /> <br /> But in any case, Tracking. In general, as for movies, there is a golden rule: Avoid any movie containing the word "Ninja".
