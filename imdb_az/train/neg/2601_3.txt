I watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch Drew Barrymore as I love and see one of his early films. <br /> <br /> The movie is played by a girl from New York to LA (young and beautiful by Drew Barrymore) to get her worry about her recently. <br /> <br /> After transferring to a guy who likes the movie and loves it, he has a terrible binary = doppelganger in a short time. Both dialogues and actor movies are not worth it. Summarizing them is something for Drew Barrymore.
