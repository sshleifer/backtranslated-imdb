I do not know if I'm watching this "documentary" movie, I have never seen this comedy! This movie is packed with bad scripting and laughable moments. In particular, the Afghan police / soldiers are in a place where they can shoot in the streets while Don Larson is allowed to shoot in cameras and then to continue shooting, possibly plush at the hotel. <br /> <br /> A car crashed, an explosion occurred, and there was a place where a car hit the roadside. <br /> <br /> I am surprised At this time, I have a rating (5.8 / 10). I thought IMDb users were more meaningful.
