I did not know I was leaving here, but I do not believe most of these positive comments are in this movie. In my opinion, this was a foolishness and a little over the top. <br/> <br /> <br /> Some of the movies are very important to me. <br /> <br /> I love the movie B, but this alphabet was a bit lower. to me In one of them I saw one of the humor and horror on the subject "Dark Army" and "The Shaman of the Dead" and "Re-Animator". You have to joke. I did not find this movie laughable, tried, I made a lot of effort (maybe I did a lot of effort), but in my opinion it failed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But here there was only a lack of original thought. Certainly, there were some nice special effects, but it was a good movie, but it was all about carrying the movie. Mutated Grant appeared as a cross between Jabba Hut and the early stages of mutation - the "Strange Science" (after he turned the monster) and "The Explorers", one of the alien / children who were foreigners. It just did not work. I thought it looked like something like a child from the 5th grade art class. Then Brenda had a woman impregnated by a woman and chained in a barn. When he finally arrived, he appeared to be a huge boom waiting to be dumped. The design was completely impossible. One round round one-colored balloon. * yawn * <br /> <br /> Now about zombies - More and more films I see with zombies these days are more about George A. Romero's patenting them and only about the writer / director's films. Except for Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (only a comedy), she is the only person to do so. Oh, and Danny Boyle, but they were a different zombie. Perhaps Romero has been destroying any zombie movie for me by means of their powerful abilities to shake and drown their actors with their intestines dried and even a drop of synovial fluid, and they fight against the muscles of their muscles. They have begun to re-animate, causing rigor mortis . <br /> <br /> As a result, I gave Slither, a few laughs and a few people did not have the right motivation for the "wheels" ... they were terrible zombies. beautiful gore scenes.
