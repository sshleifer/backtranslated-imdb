As for this point, the gentle rain was a movie I found the most fun of history. Postponed by this "blockbuster" outside of Asia. There is a "star" and this is John Rys Davies. He is out of shape to be a purple flying badger that throws it here. The rest of the people could not get out of the small school games. No stereo was missed in the dialogue, and special effects were often as often as possible. <br /> <br /> Some parts of Asia were a few bucks, and some actors needed a vehicle. wanted to throw money. Or maybe a director or a writer who needed a loan. I guess that every film career in this movie credentials is a great deal to yourself and do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Some smiles could not consume this turkey. <br /> <br /> A comic scene was unwanted. The king's brother appears on stage. King? A beautiful, old, short Asian actor. (Bad Actor) My brother? European feet. (And a bad actor). There was no excuse for this. They simply expected that this poor man Jet Li's brother, Warnabe Pierce Brosnan, who was the cheapest "Injun" curtain of an old western cinema at the age of 40.
