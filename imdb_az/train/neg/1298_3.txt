Sogo Ishii can be a talented filmmaker in the right conditions, but Gojoe explains a story of a warrior priest and his only rival, the Genji tribe. Filmmaking is a key feature of low-budget production: fuzzy combat scenes and unusual assemblies (see below). The Lord Benkei tells his spiritual teacher that his destiny defeats the mysterious spirit that guarded the Gojo bridge overnight, but he does not know that this decision will bring about a conflict with almost every element of society at that time. He could have enlightened her. <br /> <br /> Although it is a manifestation of the conflict between the Holy and the world, there is no lack of ambitions. Artsy helps some to compensate for a loose filmmaking style in photography and editing. <br /> <br /> A disappointment.
