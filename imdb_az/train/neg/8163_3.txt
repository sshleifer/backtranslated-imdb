I agree with all these words, but I must add that this soundtrack is probably the worst thing I've ever heard of all my life! When you need to listen to the actors, there's a real vocal! And it looks like a conscious version of vocal Danzig: "Darkness, darkness of the forest!" or something else that is unreatreatening. The singer has a terrific vibrato and has been recorded with a treble-y microphone over some synthed-up string sections and fake drum beats. Terrible! <br /> Yes, the fate of men is terrible. The same is true for women. This is one of the worst cases of sexual stereotyping - it's very bad! Everything you say is about to be a man or a woman, just playing stereotypes up to the maximum. Makes me sick. Soooo Drill! <br /> <br /> The children were awakened in their lines and did not understand them. And why women's dreams are always cute little to the children's hair, pretty blue dresses and long hair? And ghost boys always wear clean cut trousers with cute little glossy blonde hair? Not terrible - STUPID. <br /> <br /> Daddy's face was too stained to be a man living in a cave. Beautiful beard and bangs, pa. <br /> <br /> Do not know if you cut yourself off with a knife or walk around the city and go to the hall?
