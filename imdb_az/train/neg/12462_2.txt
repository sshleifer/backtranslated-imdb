I saw this movie last night without much good reviews from many sources. I would also like to note that if you are not ready to make a continuous effort and prepare, who and what will you hate this movie? <br /> <br /> I'm still struggling to understand the roles of actors In this film, the movie jumped from different stories and does not really allow you to assert any role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Probably very good, but for medium movie watchers, this movie is difficult, very dull and you will leave the movie mixed and paid for entry fees. <br /> Everyone is 100% interested in details or politics every minute. If you want to watch movies, do not see it.
