Marilyn Miller had filmed three films before his death - magnificent SALLY (1929), comedy HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this magnificent SUNNY (1930). Although he has four dance numbers, he only singles two songs (WHO and ONE MAN ALONE), as well as an early talk and music attempt. We can keep track of the last ones that have been called sequentially. Miller is overweight and amateur here - no star quality. Even his dances are all. The film is very poorly written, stocked with old and unfunny jokes and stupid situations. If you are interested in a Miller player, check it out, but stay away from the general entertainment.
