I was thinking that these films would be much better than I did. I did not pay to see this movie, and I'm so glad I did not sit in a movie theater. The film that began in this film, the actors in this movie were average, humor was terrible, and the overall story of this movie was not special. I thought that this movie would be great, but it was a pessimistic time. I think that this movie, acting in this movie, was like the fact that the players were not afraid of anyone, only there. Maybe it would have been better if we played a different player from Jay Barucheld Kirk, but I did not feel that I watched this movie in high regard and did not move in that movie. Now Alice Eve has done a great job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between him and Jay. All actors of this film had no name and had little effect in this film. The humor in this film is not funny; there were a few liners in this movie, but it was OK, but they would understand that it's worth telling your friends. I think that Jim Field Smith had a hard time finding this romantic or comedy-free decision. Honestly, I think he should stay with Burger King ads. I think this movie would be better if the writer went to another filmmaker. The story of this movie is just like a hot girl, just the story of an OK boy. It would have been better if I had more authenticity. Honesty will not recommend to anyone watching this movie. I think you will be entertained by this dentist in this movie. Release yourselves from the torment and do not see.
