I was expecting it to be better. I love the work of Tim Burton, so it's exciting to see these online short films. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> I think they are simply boring. <br /> <br /> Although I love Roy, Toxic Boy and Stainboy, the voice disturbs me and most of the characters. <br /> <br /> Even though the episode of the Match Girl was probably very funny, she broke me most. <br /> <br /> I do not like some of the characters die. Just as the girl they are dealing with is mostly filling a petrol station, or as the girl who has escaped escapes. Roy's death was fun, surprising. Death by car freshener. Very original ;-) This made me laugh ... <br /> <br /> There are some things that are not suitable for kids. Some languages ​​and gore. Almost all of this is true! 3/10
