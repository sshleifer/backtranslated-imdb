1st Watch 5/17/2002 - From 3 to 10 (Dir-Ewald Andre Dupont): The most intelligent account of the Titanic disaster is the first version of this very well-known event. Repetition of the disaster is not bad, but the surrounding dramas are sometimes foolish, miserable, and too much soap operas. This story is as different as the last Oscar winner, and we do not exclude that the crew tried to hide the disaster that occurred until it was too late. Not only is it good for the purpose of nostalgia and James Cameron's (at least in his rest) opponent's competition to get a feel.
