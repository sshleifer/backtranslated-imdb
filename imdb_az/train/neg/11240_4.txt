Ambitious fantasy, which does not doubt Kerry Conran, is love for love. Unfortunately, this is not good. It all starts well enough - an epic, but limited edition, Lucas and Hitchcock style correction and Spielberg's brilliant cinematography. The film also touches on many pulp fantasy novels, novels, and films such as the Superman, Metropolis, The Monkey Planet, The Iron Giant, Star Wars, and My Loving Devil. The film, however, has never been so good for a number of reasons: the most important thing is that Conran, who is interested in creating such a love, throwing everything on the screen and creating a brave new world, is really a movie. There are no tensions, no atmosphere and no magic here, despite battles for air battles, dinosaurs, and races. Even noir elements fall flat. This is a great way to look at everything - these elements are mostly nonexistent, because nothing is really perceived and obviously fake - the green screen resembles only a half-time video game and it is clear that actors are subsequently pasted. Actors do not do a lot - Jude Law is spending money on wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow, annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie - and all this terrible script - about to explain everything. This is a worthy experience, and some can get a sense of nostalgia, but ultimately it is a senseless step to bring the world to life. It's fine, but it's over.
