<br /> <br /> Wow, after a few attempts, I ended up watching this divine horror movie, only to find out that Rick Sloane and his production team had completed a flat video this year. all films have been reviewed by MST3K and they are really "Manos", "Werewolf", "The Incredibly Strange" and less "Laserblast", "Zombie Nightmare" and "Time Chasers" - this, of course, which is perfect for it) must be the largest garbage collection. It is very simple that the film consists of greetings, such as Munchies, which end in killing people, fame, wealth, prowess, and, of course, the desires of the sexually exploited people. But this is a movie that is very ridiculous for a player (for example, a car's test is illustrated by two boys fighting in the front yard with garden tools), and the writing is forced (for example, a gremin scene hanging on a girl's arm, (this is not the first time in this film) and the story is ... it rarely draws attention (hence the MST3K riff, a film in which films will be prepared by FILMmakers in the future), really roams for furry puppets on the screen to kill everyone .
