If there is a movie that's the worst movie of the year - this TASHAN first promo movie will be an awesome Dhoom 2 style movie, and I knew it was just a bad movie. Being a Yashraj movie, or maybe a joyous promo does not show up The movie shocked me, even worse then was Dhoom 2 and I thought it was boring to introduce Saif's first. Saif-Kareena met, Kareena is very artificial, then Anil Kapoor oh god, what does she do in such a strange movie? What a strange role? What does he do? His first scene is wrong, but then his actions are repeated and very high. Later, Akshay came up with a beautiful scene, but then the film was more dull and childhood romance with all the obsolete things, the action scenes of the childhood Rajnikant style and the dull scenes. Vijay Krishna Acharya, in the case of this movie, is a life-saving strategy, not just money. Vijay is another addition to their list. (Vishal Shekhar) is a usual toy. Scenes Akshay Kumar comes as a fresh air in the film, she actually delights seductive Saif Ali Khan irritates, Kareena is equally bad Anil Kapoor hams are ugly and the show even more condemns recreation
