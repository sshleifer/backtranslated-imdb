Only 12-year-olds should be allowed to see this movie. The rest of us need to buy a book, an MP3 reel, or get a good healing to endure the experience of this event. This can be summed up in a good way as a "blown" television movie is distributed to theaters. Kids want to see this movie, and they will love and enjoy the movie.
