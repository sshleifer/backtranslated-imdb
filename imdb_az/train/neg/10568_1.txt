Amazing! Wow. In my time I've seen some really bad movies, but it really gets a cake. <br /> <br /> As a US Army veteran of war in Afghanistan, it's almost impossible to watch this ridiculous movie. it brought back memories - away from it - but there was no attempt to join the "originality" anywhere in the film. The smallest piece is not as small as the smallest. It looks like an 8-year-old boy writes out all the war insights (and military behavior) from comic books. The film should have been a hint in Honduras, but it could not even fully explain the voracious production values ​​of this garbage dump. <br /> <br /> I have all the infinite technical deficiencies, but it actually takes forever. After the Second World War, they wrote the name of the character as an unseen or outdated old uniform shoulder patch and "ColCollins" ("Colonel Collins" character), on the contrary, the mirror image is from the "N" Russian alphabet (not US alphabet). <br /> <br /> We want to convey to you that every scene is just ridiculous flaws, inaccuracies, and totally illogical stereotypes. nor the characters were at least incredible or convincing. He was a very funny guy, he was too extravagant. <br /> <br /> This was a movie that was intended to appeal to boys who had pre-mashed the movie, and I do not doubt that they will consider this film totally absurd. <br /> In short, this movie has absolutely irreplaceable qualities. This is a waste of time. I would strongly advise anyone who reads this garbage passage; it is not worth pushing for a moment of your time.
