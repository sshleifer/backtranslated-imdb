This film will fail if it obstructs people from being drug addicts. I was waiting for something to happen and I was ready to use them. This movie is horror or drama. Only paranoid of meth users. This film can earn awards for the "F" word several times a day and for a little more useless use. It was not a good thing, but it felt like Meth replaced Meth with no one else. Hector was worse and smoother than the film went, and the girl was more hopeless. In the end, it did not really mean anything. The film did not make any sense unless it showed how squeezing it was in a home in the middle of nowhere. When I decided to watch this movie, I referred to other reviews and the rating should be very low.
