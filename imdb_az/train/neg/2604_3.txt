Doppelganger has moments but they are far from each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is a mix of pop-psych tricks, fantasy story, and horror B. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman with his past (most of the family being killed and at least one suspect), or is he just a few personalities really in a bad state of disorder? <br /> <br /> The nature of the new generation is incredibly sympathetic, and it's also Barrymore's good performance (not exactly good). Occasionally, the heartwarming part of the heartwarming writings and sometimes irregular redirects merged to forget the majority's performance. <br /> <br /> The character of his wife Leslie Umid is memorable, but is unhappy with your desire to forget it. <br /> <br /> Finally, the plot is bifurcated (a story is summer psychological realism, and the other is unnatural horror) <br /> <br /> The film is thought to be badly opposed to the vast majority of its value, and took a photo. <br /> <br /> Generally, the film is the first licensed film class of M. Knight Shamalian. <br /> <br /> My suggestion - send your doppelganger, but do not hesitate first, but it is a personal encounter.
