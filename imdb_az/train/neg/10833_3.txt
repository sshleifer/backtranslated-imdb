I would like to love the magnolia. The land recalled the Grand Canyon (I liked it). At the end of the four different life / stories that came together, but half of the Magnolia movie made a wrong turn and I lost it. I almost stopped there after that, but I must finally get there until another 1/1 hour, another torture. Thank God for renting me instead of seeing in the theater. I screamed for about 2 hours after disappointment. The biggest blow to the pants was the frog scene. My DVD player still has not forgiven me, and I'm not blaming it for a while. It was a unique film, but a dingy, boring and meaningless movie.
