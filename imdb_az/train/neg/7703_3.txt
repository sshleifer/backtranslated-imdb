The famous show master enters the lane with his girlfriend. Suddenly a woman kills and runs when she is in a heart attack. The murder of a woman is Sawa. She still goes to school and works for a bad criminal, Akay, who sleeps with her. One day, Sawa understood that he was killing his parents. Even the greatest anime fans have caused disappointment in this bad movement. There is a "kite" style, but it's still rubbish. A strange scheme about a young girl who killed a man worked with fear and at the same time trying to touch the story only. One of the peaks shows that the good and bad hero Sawa has fallen along with a brigade's bodyguard, but the dramatic structure is relatively well-organized and is a strange and strange animation of the director Yasoumi Umetsu's characteristic faces. <br /> <br /> Sound: 3/10
