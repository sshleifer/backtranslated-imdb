The black man fights ... and he's winning ... yeah ... 1/10. <br /> <br /> So, we're introducing a nice dash, a beautiful line of lineage and even a beautiful plot line. It's strange, after the end .. After we've fallen into the fiction. <br /> <br /> Michael Jay White, the black guy does not mix with such a name .. describes the black boy .. Umm, it's all. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to find a good help, black guys should hire their friends down to the budget, the first movie scenes with the shadow of the camera ... You and me like .. but yes. <br /> <br /> 10 lines. reviewed. If you pay to see this movie, you're screwed up.
