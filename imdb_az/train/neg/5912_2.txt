Mike Myers's previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live) was much higher than the expectations of the 60s I enjoyed. After the first minutes, this is a workout to be as brave and festive as possible. Ten minutes later I closed. I watched the second day to see if I had been there for the first time. Ten minutes later I quit it. I believe how a twelve-year-old boy can find this funny thing. The dialogue is that Myers is painful to watch (including Heather Graham) and the sequence of characters, including Fat Bastard, is getting worse. Along with a lightweight fun hood and psychedelic set design, it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. Personally, I advise you to save yourself from this illness, but a few of my friends (perhaps their eyes were covered).
