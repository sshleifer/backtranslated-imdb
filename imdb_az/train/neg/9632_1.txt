I'm "Boom!" There is a terrific pan-and video cameras and I want to see it all in the wide screen glory. So I voted "1" and I hope you will be. Together, we can shoot this movie in the cinematic dross pits and hope that someone will BUM PUL "Bum!" Cut the Extended version of the Director. The movie is one of my favorites. You just look at the participants, directors, actors, cameras and say to yourself: "Yep, I can often deceive many people." Producers "Boom!" Consider the DVD version. It should be noted that everywhere it has been shown that there is a support for theaters in the theater. The Frostbite Waterfall is still there.
