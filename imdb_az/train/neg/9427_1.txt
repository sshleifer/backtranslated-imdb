When I rented "Unhinged," I was looking for an eye-catcher. The box claimed that the film had extreme scenes of violent freedom of theater (I have serious doubts about the release of this theater). After completing the film, I wondered how to get a video script. <br /> <br /> The plot is as follows: Three young women have been riding a car on a car trip. These women are able to go to a site containing a sexist woman. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this film is to create useless scenes, which will prevent the film from being prepared for a long time. <br /> <br /> One of the things that makes this movie horrible is an actor. Lisa Munson, who plays the main character, appears to appear as if she were looking to wipe her off the line. Movers are bad, but not as bad as themselves. Another thing that makes this movie worse is camera technology. Most shots are made by cameras attached to the ceiling. As the film progresses, it becomes very boring. On top of that, there is very little eye, this box is very deceiving. <br /> <br /> Do not waste time doing that. Rating: 10 out of 1
