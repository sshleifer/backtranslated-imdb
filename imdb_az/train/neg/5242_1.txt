Well, I hate it, I hate the 40-year-old virgin and this little gem is part of an empty movie. Give yourself a blessing and throw it away. I admit that I did not like actors in this movie, and after showing my 18-year-old son's DVD cover, "I do not want this movie," but, unfortunately, I decided to give it a try. <br /> <br /> In the film, I closed it two minutes and I was so upset. it's just disgusting. Any worthy person will be charmed in this movie. she tells me old fashion, but you close her hand on a friend's face, so she has "bought some", in my opinion, on the justice line. Yes, how this ugly little movie started, and I can only imagine that it's getting worse. Another real winner for Mr. Rudd. I'm proud to be surprised. You can only play a worthwhile role as you get, imagine, will you be in the movie? I would not be paying. <br /> <br /> I must get to know better; next time I'll do it.
