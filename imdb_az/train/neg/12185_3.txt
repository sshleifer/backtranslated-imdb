What has happened to Martin Scorcese to correct this movie? And just made it and completely destroyed it? Robert DeNiro is an impartial decision to make a religious fanatic character, ridiculous and attitudes towards Hollywood (and especially Mr. Scorcese) - the best way to crack a character is to crucify him . Anyway, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br />
