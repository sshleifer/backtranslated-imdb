I believe that war movies should try to convey war terrorism, escape idealism, and respect some basic principles. Zvezda became the first with difficulty. I was expecting Zwezda to be a Russian war film, patriotism, emotions, beautiful poetic pictures, lightweight, Slavic rectangles and brutal Germans. What I did not need was simply a misguided, unfounded misconception of war scenes and syrup sounds in a film that ignored all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust). Nevertheless, insult to the interests of our history is an endnote about "liberating Poland." An opportunity missed as a film, but not as a propaganda.
