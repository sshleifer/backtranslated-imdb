I hired this movie yesterday because of a summary of the very good-looking art and jacket. After hitting my DVD player, I re-reviewed the jacket cover and I did not read any of the production details on the film even though I got a plastic cover. This movie tells Jacket at Evil and should go to the Faith Films site to find any connection to IMDb. <br /> <br /> The shooting and special effects of the movie seemed pretty good in the film. ... Then, speaking to a line read actor. My dear ... this actor's recitation was only a pimple-faced lyokok joke, because his voice was only able to change the pitch and ordered the script to go beyond reading the lines. Initially I thought I was making a bad disk from sound synchronization, and then I had to think that since I was not reading it was an external movie ... English was dubbed. If they have thrown the right people to dubble in the dialogue, this film is worth MIGHT. When I discovered that a bad line reader was not killed, but found not to stay as the main core reinforcements, I gave him a chance of about 20 minutes before taking it out. Yes, that's bad! The art of the jacket and the art in the film are so great that it has given a star, but minus 1,999,999 stars for rotten dialogue. I do not offer this!
