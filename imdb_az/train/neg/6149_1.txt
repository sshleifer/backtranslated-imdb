I'll spend a couple of days dedicated to Ron Howard before he is completely lying. Unfortunately, at such a young age, Howard is dealing with a large number of features of Lucas. How do you explain the anger of other calamities? His only useful film was, of course, 'Willow'. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> He can not even be a clever man like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard compressed his Spilbergiya with crushing features that he would soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> Here we have an old saying: "Everybody loves love, even the disease." Lynch, who is too bad for Howard, has more subtext than ever before. Heck, even Disney was better than this. <br /> <br /> Do not rent a DVD to the US Embassy in Azerbaijan. <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = Sinematic Dud
