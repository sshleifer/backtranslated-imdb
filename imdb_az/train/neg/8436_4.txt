David Mamet is a very interesting and very direct director. </ p> </ style> </ font> </ div> Under the name of "murder", she tries to turn the audience's mind into a common crime drama. The main heroes deal with two police, one Jewish and one racist country of Ireland. <br /> <br /> The killing of the owner of an ancient Jewish shop, which proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence War, is a Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective. <br /> <br /> This is clearer than the film's defects. The waking process is dramatic and hard to believe, the Jewish militia group is operative and the path to the ultimate violent conflict is pitiful. The film itself is clever as Mamet, but the human imagination is emotional. <br /> <br /> Joe Mantegna and William Macy give powerful speeches, but the story's flaws will be easily compensated.
