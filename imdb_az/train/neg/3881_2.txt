A few days ago, I was watching a documentary called FIFTY WORST MOVIES at all times, and this was the first time I heard from INSTANTIBLE MELTING MAN. If I'm the lover of the movie, I try to find some part of the movie in a documentary - not just a REAL MELTING MAN. In fact, MELTING MAN is the first "bad movie" I've ever seen and I'm very disappointed. <br /> </ strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ span> </ strong> <br /> <br /> </ strong> <br /> <br /> </ strong> <br /> Despite the same title, the book came out long before the documentary filmmakers and documented artists were never considered Medved by concept. From Medved's book, I've seen 35 of the 50 films, but I've come to a standstill - the rest of the movies are not available on VHS or DVD. So I thought I would work with the same title. <br /> <br /> My most gentle reason was that there were some good elements in the movie. First, the melting man's particular effects were generally cool and disgusting. Obviously, a professional (known rich Baker) was involved in making this appearance. At the same time, I also need to note that there are also a few cheap and evolutionary effects - the way to run around the fluid after cutting off the plastic head and left arm - is under the "clever secret" dress! As for the story, it's just stupid. A group of astronauts miraculously penetrates Saturn's rings without collapsing. Then they tell us how beautiful the sun is - we see its proximity. Since Saturn is so far away, this is the only thing that should look - this should be a great spot. Regardless of the scene, the scene is changing immediately and we say that one of the surviving astronauts is in the hospital. What has happened between the last scene and this one? Yep, this is everyone's guess. <br /> <br /> Therefore, after a while, he gets rid of the survivors and melts his whole body and deals with a deadly hurricane. <br /> <br /> Now think of running a psycho who looks like their early popsicle, remove all stops to find and stop him, right? It's wrong. A single general deals with a single doctor to find her alone! There is no army, no police - just a dopey doctor. <br /> <br /> Now, when the body begins to recover, the physician or the general will not do anything to organize or make a backup. <br /> <br /> Now you will not be surprised as you take into account the film's fool <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If a woman sees a small husband, she barricades the door to protect her. If the house had no back door, that would be wise! Instead of just leaving the house and escaping, she is waiting! <br /> <br /> When capturing a photographer and his model moments, the man holds the helper and burns it from above. Why? <br /> <br /> Spectators are a little cheerleading and making him a degree R. <br /> <br /> When the mopping friend finally arrives and the sheriff has a clear shot on him, the doctor stops him. Now the wolf killed half a dozen people. <br /> <br /> So, as you can see in the movie, it's full of foolish plot elements. This is a very bad movie. But sometimes, with good special effects, I was just a movie, as I was hoping for. Of course, it is good for a laugh, but nowhere else, it should not be included in the list of the worst films ever made, from the 9th chapter of the WRONG WRITING.
