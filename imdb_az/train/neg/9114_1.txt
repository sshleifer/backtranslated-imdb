Because "cruel" would be the only word available to describe the filmmakers' intentions. Where do you start? Yes, in a song, I will start with a horrible act of nearly everyone in this movie. Draw. This sentence is almost not relevant. I do not think of a character that is well described. Although, with all fairness, it is almost impossible to describe these zero-dimensional characters successfully. Still, Katherine is still one of the worst actors ever played by a guy who plays Sebastian, playing Katherine (whose name I did not target - I do not claim to belong to her). Story God was terrible. The first one tried to reflect the glare, but failed in many ways. Every part of the multitude was meaningless - nevertheless, (unhappiness) the plot was pretty good, and I would admit that it was a surprise. And the end was at least a bit humorous. But this movie is the worst I've ever seen. Do not follow. Just do it. There is nothing worth watching. There is no. Only takes the taste of the first one.
