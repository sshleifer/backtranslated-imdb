NASA's alleged fraudulent idea of ​​the Earth has recently been compared with the historical weather data of Apollo 11 and has shown a good match between the cloud samples and the actual rainfall record in the video rankings. <br /> <br /> This is a good match, shows that the "whole Earth" is actually a small part of the planet that is framed by the spacecraft window. <br /> <br /> Bart Sibrell claims that the historical weather data has been falsified by NASA, although not every copy of the archived newspaper will be replaced by the weather map and the private hands. Question: This film is based on NASA's weather data It's a tempting but insignificant argument, but it's a weak and invalid argument, and there are images and evidence in the movie? A wise man once said something about elimination: heals mosquitoes and camels, maybe it's about what you're trying to do here :-) <br /> <br /> According to NASA, according to the US NASA, third, the US government has only one month's missions, and that it is a true master of the universe. <br /> <br /> According to NASA, "full of irrefutable evidence", the rest of the film Sibrel, I thought there was not much in the movie, he had previously edited it as part of a hidden movie and added his own commentary. Unfortunately, for him, the source film is public and Siberian bits are contrary to his claims.
