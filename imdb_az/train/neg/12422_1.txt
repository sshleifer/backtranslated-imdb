I hired this movie to see if I could be a bloody, non-stop action movie, and bought this very sensitive and super cheap cheap budget drama drama, which made Kickboxer look like Die Hard. While Lou and Reb are holding the Reb in Vietnam, Lou Lou, she easily eats one of the worst effects. Some of the Vietnam scenes are shot in the back yard, I swear! Lou is already damaged by the brain and Reb and his coexist and have a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is willing to fight for a coffin, and Reb continues to suffer a killing to get him back. There are no good fight scenes, punches are two inches from one person. Character identities change in seconds. A guy is bad and good at the next stage. The actor is strange and plays a very sensitive Frank Stallone that will illuminate music. I hated this movie.
