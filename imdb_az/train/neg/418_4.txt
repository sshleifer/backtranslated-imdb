One may wish that a good idea like "invisible man" works better and will be treated more carefully during fantastic special effects, but that is not the case. The story, the characters, and finally the last 20 minutes of the movie, are as fresh as a mad scientist figure since the early 50's. There are some great moments, thanks to the idea of ​​an invisible man waiting mainly for beautiful special effects and streets. Unfortunately, soon we are in a limited prison in the underground laboratory, so the rest of the film is not only predictable, but also schematic. <br /> <br /> In the past, there are many remakes of films or television shows over the past decade and some have decorations. But for every movie it is clearer and clear that the idea of ​​putting the classics under the nose of the delicious dragon like Verhoeven (his mom) is very bad. Obviously, the money here is the key issue: the time and energy of the scenario is not sufficiently close, and as a result, Hollow Man is severely damaged by stereotypes, strange characters, predictability and no depth. <br /> <br /> However, something that really impressed me was strange, except for special effects. When preparing this kind of film, modern producers are very eager to see their children. That's why the language (and sometimes violence and gender) is exaggerated. When the whole world hit, the good guys "Oh darn!" and "Oh My God". The "Disgusting Man" expresses gratitude for such hypocrisy and the freedom of the characters to express themselves most freely. The most natural reaction to something wrong is that we have to swear - but if some of them actually beg, it becomes more convincing. We can thank Verkhoven for this.
