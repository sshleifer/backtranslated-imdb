It was probably the intentional aspect of the film that the film was going to travel at an extremely fast pace, and that it was to say that life was growing like a young teenager in China. Nevertheless, I have found a combination of "glacier" efforts and general shooting style in an extraordinary way, to be completely alien to global audiences, especially to the global audience. At times, I had difficulty distinguishing some characters from this distance. For two hours, I was completely cared for. Just like someone who was not interested in music but entered the Chinese history and culture (and no stranger to Chinese cinema), I could not deal with one character and found nothing to take on the teeth. He asks this question: If I do not like him, who wants on earth? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of any Chinese director I see. This sad effort is not entirely measurable. I'm sorry to see that Chinese cinema is judged against this criterion.
