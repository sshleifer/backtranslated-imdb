This "movie" is more like a music video. Kusturica says she feels like doing music while filming in 2004 and feels like filming while playing music. <br /> <br /> Kusturica says in the same interview that dialogs in movies are like noise. The best thing to say "Give me a word" is music written by Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> I liked the "Life is a miracle". It was like music videos in the first 30 minutes and at some points, but there was a beautiful plot. There is no plot to "promise me". I'm looking forward to this movie because I read this movie, written by Ranko Bozic, one of my favorite comedy writers, who also participated in "Life is a miracle." Ranko Bozic writes great dialogues, but for Kusturica they were "noise" and, unfortunately, I just saw two dialogs and I was able to identify it as written by Ranko Bozic. The other part of the script was used by the director to create a chaotic music video for his son Stribor's music. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gordan Mihic The Black Cat White Cat will not touch it just because it says Kusturica. According to Gordan Mihic, all Kusturica then comes back to the script, and if not, it does not feature a good movie. And like it, this is the word "promise me". <br /> <br /> I'm talking about the events in the Caucasus. The comedy moments are the same as the "Black Cat White Cat", but it is not so funny. The difference is that the difference is that "Black Cat White Cat" by Qordan Mihic is written. <br /> <br /> But I know some people who love to promise me a very positive film.
