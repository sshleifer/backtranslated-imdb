A sharp insect screech is something that is pretty unpleasant for television watching. Ants are becoming ants in the vicinity of a mysterious hotel. I think that the hotel cuisine flows directly into the gravel bed, and I think it's a hotel dining. This film does not have a defective defect, and it's not scary. <br /> <br /> He said the ants could not be heroes. Must be a mysterious virus. Once the inspector says this, the hero takes the bulldozer and distributes the big ant colony. This disturbs millions of people and traps the people in the hotel. <br /> <br /> Last spoilers Overall, this movie is extremely naked. I do not understand why DVD is the reason for the lack of any of the most decent films. The only speculation of my DVDs is that Suzanne Summers is featured in the movie. It's a movie to avoid.
