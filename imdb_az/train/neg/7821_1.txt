Have the filmmakers reviewed this beforehand before leaving it? The script throws it down without any explanation. The start is not clear if it's a prequel or not. It begins with the beginning of the Supermans on the Earth, and is thrown to a point after the last film - but it does not tell the audience. Very Amazing! Superman himself is weak and needs Prozak. He is portrayed as potential home-fire, stalker and clear depression and confusion. This type of character is rarely an interesting hero. The latter is definitely ridiculous. Superman, who ended up in a hospital, just wanted to kill me. I'm seriously waiting for a SNL sketch where Maury says Maury Povich and Maury say, "There are consequences - in case of a child, Superman, you are a father." To finalize - it's OK, but it's HORRIBLE script, run by Superman and Kevin Spacey. The film is basically inevitable.
