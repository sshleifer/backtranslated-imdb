<br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is that Harry keeps in mind the needs of three blackmailers - because they are relatively easy to learn. <br /> <br /> The whole scene kidnapped by his wife decides to split the classic car (with the money in it), which makes us leap to a high logic. <br /> <br /> Okay, because her husband wanted to join the DA campaign, she wanted to keep in touch with Cini and the public. I can see it, but why does not someone hire someone to kill someone after finding out that there is no evidence of actual blackmail (for example, Cini's body)? These are the first 2/3 of them. After that, this kind of separation.
