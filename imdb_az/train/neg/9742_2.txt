This is a very boring movie about a scientist who was taken in a terrible way when creating a teleporter device and using a car to transport itself. A simple sow is carried out from the beginning and the others. He refutes, but can also make electrons by touching man. It is really indifferent to this film that it is believed to be against the place where it works. Perhaps millions of people could have been working for the organization, but the organization's teleporter tried to sabotage every step of the way. Finally, the predicted person goes after three people who abuse the electric shock for any reason.
