Did HeidiJean actually see this movie? A great Christmas movie? Not even close. Gentle, soft and completely imaginable and unkempt. Hell, watching this movie, wondering if Carly Pope might have been in this movie! There is no obvious identity in the woman, and she gives a completely unbreakable performance. Baransky was in the ordinary situation and provided all the interesting things. Probably, his presence was the only reason for the green light to be launched. Maybe I'm expecting a lot for a 15-day live film, but with a different filmmaker and at least a player that can unleash sympathy with JJ's rebuilding, it could have been a pretty favorite movie.
