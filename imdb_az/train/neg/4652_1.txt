It was a painful example for a cheap, boring and unoriginal show produced by Australian television stations to perform local content quotas. <br /> <br /> Nothing about this TV series is funny - it's not so - the writer was really terrible and I'm not surprised that writers are responsible for the worst movie in Australia. <br /> <br /> Gently entertaining. It was just tired and bad and the worst I really thought was it was funny. <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < Trying to (real) review by an Australian viewer is not possible. Or crazy. There are even more bread bakeries than this show. <br /> <br /> If the show runs out of the price and it's on the DVD, remember that gratification is impeccable.
