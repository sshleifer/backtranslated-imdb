As a young child, I had to watch all of these movies, and I was not called REAL! Talk about child abuse. I was less afraid of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is good for people who only believe in this ridicule and at the same time want to incite their children to believers. Apart from open problems with brainwashing and touching, there are also bad behaviors, bad writing, and BAD "special effects." They are just horrible, horrible movies around. Yes, it's incredible (and terrible) for a kid, but I do not think of a big purchase of this shock. Nevertheless, I must say that today I was interested in seeing them as adults. They may have some midnight / culinary feelings.
