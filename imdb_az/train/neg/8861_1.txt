Terrible horror continues "The Howling". It is selected by Karen White's funeral (killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Croskoe (Christopher Lee regretfully) came to Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown) saying Karen is a werewolf. Transylvania's Striba (Sybil Danning) will go head to head to kill her. A friend of me and Karens (Annie McEnroe) joins her. <br /> <br /> A terrible post, bad direction, a modest arrangement, and those who are really terrified by Brown and McEnroe are handling one another. Werewolf's effects are mainly kept in the dark - for good reason! They are afraid when they see them. Even subpar special effects - although I do not like the cartoon lightning coming from Danning fingers. Particularly a stupid man who has a stupid man, and at least eight times a day at Dan's concession loans! <br /> <br /> There are some good things - I've found a fun village in Transylvania - it's a horror from the 1930s! Transition scenes include interesting camera tricks; Brown and McEnroe have good corpses, and Lee and Danning are good on this subject - but they can not keep it. Really - WHY did it do it? Where are they tough for the money? This is one of the IMDb's low-cost films. I can only say one thing. Probably, when he saw the film, Dan was terrified - why can I understand it! We need to.
