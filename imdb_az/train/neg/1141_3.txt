It's been a pleasant surprise to open the "Erler" (more than five minutes) with extreme expectations. <br /> <br /> I do not believe the new shooting is A grade material, but it has provided a solid foundation for having a good whole movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this was in 1955, during one day shooting plans. After the new shootings, Jules White decided to draw only the images of Bridless Groom for a short time, and Jules and Felix Adler tried to capture a new look with new pictures. <br /> <br /> The last of the 3/10, the old, outdated end of boys (Moe & Larry in this case)
