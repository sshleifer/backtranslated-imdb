I did not see the original, but I wanted to give a quick note to anyone who was so far away: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've ever seen. Maybe two years. <br /> <br /> I will give these two points: Cage's character has at least a bit of laugh, and I can ask the theater to warn myself to return my money. The view from the island and the island was wonderful. Sorry, that's it. Here comes gay. The plot of the film is just put forward, because the other characters will not answer Cage in any way - and that's the point! How it can last for more than an hour (fewer days in the movie) beyond me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In order to fill the library, you leave a lot of unanswered questions to the theater. Everyone should read and think of this script: "Yes, people should pay $ 11 to see this cold concept that a movie should look like" <br /> <br /> Do not flick in. Or even rent it on a DVD.
