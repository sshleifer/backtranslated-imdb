Often I do not watch such a terrible movie. I continued watching it every minute, hoping that it was intended as a single attraction, which meant taking it seriously. Well, as seriously as this genre wants. <br /> <br /> The player's shamefulness and circumstances are a frightening form and clich√©. If the movie was shot in 1920 (for example, a film) and if we had the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) in it, then we thought the movie was naive. No matter, this movie was made in 2000, and I have never seen a movie that has been such a charming silent epoch. <br /> <br /> Not necessarily for serious filmmaking. /> <br /> [Not worth the price]
