I'll give credit to where the loan is, and I'm telling you that Linda Fiorentino has a good performance as a drunken actress who does whatever she wants. She is fragile, sassy, ​​tough and very sexy; <br /> <br /> <strong> Better than this movie. <br /> <br /> But it's BT. This dull tension film is a magic tension, a criminal trial, a loose and treacherous story and a fragmented confusion that wants to be an erotic tension in steam. <br /> <br /> For example, who is thinking who carries Thomas Thomas as a desirable leader? He was not ugly, but Fiorentino's hard-working goddess took him to a kindergarten teacher to cry out loudly. <br /> <br /> Film shooting, film shooting, and so on. Fiorentino's character is not as confused as phone calls, and there is no secret of his fault in the film's focus, and Howell, who does not lose Fiorentino's disappointment, has no sense of freedom. <br /> <br /> Interesting but poorly made brides by Adam Ant and Issac Hayes and really a really good sex scene between Howell and Fiorentino. In addition, my first impulse is to put this garbage piece down and to rent something else.
