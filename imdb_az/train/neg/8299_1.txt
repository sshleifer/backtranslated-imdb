A Christmas Story is a classic and beloved movie. Of course, I liked this movie when I came out in 1994. I saw the day open and I was prepared to use myself. I got up and digested. The Antsipation, which has the right color in a Christmas Story, is inevitable of this confusion. The Red Ryder BB Day is better than a Chinese wholesale. And not very funny. Charles Grodin is good, but Buck stands there. Bottom Line: 1 Star. Do not even worry.
