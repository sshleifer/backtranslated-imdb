When I looked at this film, I was attracted to it, but after watching it I felt a little disappointing. The main problem of this film is that actors can not keep up with this movie. Why? Because bad script. Dillon, Lane and Jones are working hard to make another film, but they do not have an innovative storyline and the direction is very ordinary. For Matt Dillon fans, this is also a watchable movie, as it is for fans of this beautiful Diane Lane. The legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great but this is not a movie for her; its much lower than its level. So, if you're sitting with this big cast, look, but you do not expect anything big or unusual. The only thing you will remember about this flick is Diane Lane scenes; the rest is very memorable.
