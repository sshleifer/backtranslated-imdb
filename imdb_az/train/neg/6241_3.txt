What Al Gore (and his supporters) does not really go down is something that is all about consensus. <br /> <br /> If there was such a consensus, everyone who does not damage the global warming line is accused of what is foolish or stupid. or the salary of oil companies (apparently, being a professional global warming researcher does not mean that you are a wage person in this spectacular world) ... Why is there such a need for everyone to see how the whole question is settled? Is the nature of science to ask questions about honest hypotheses? For some ideas to answer these questions, read well by the oil stoyo Michael Crichton ... O wait, it's not the salary of the rich and oil companies. Because he did not touch the Greens and other Kyoto temples, he took a great career risk and said the truth when he examined it. By the way, because of its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol, will the temperatures be almost ineffective, according to their supporters? <br /> <br /> Thus, Al Gore was convinced that the surrounding lobby would stay away from it until it could not decide to run again. <br /> So who is a stooge ..?
