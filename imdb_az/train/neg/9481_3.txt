James Bishop (Matt Stasi) goes to the "mental illness facility" for medical treatment with Dr McCort (Bruce Paynes). There, he realized that many practitioners were killed by the "Ripper", Dr. In a religion supported by McCort, he has taken on the devil's souls. This story is very absurd and faultless, so it is impossible to write a summary. Dialogs are very ridiculous, especially when Helen's character, James Bishop's blonde fianc√©e, is almost incredible when she writes a writer to a scenario. What is the return of Judas to the hospital to bring the dead to the files? And the castle of smooth actors and actresses? Honestly, I do not know who the worst or who is in this movie: scenario, director or casting. True, the correct answer is all of them. I've seen this flick in cable television and I'm surprised that the manufacturer can spend on such a trash. This fear movie is very funny considering the absurdity of the field. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;">
