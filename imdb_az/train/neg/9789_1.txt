They should have called this movie: "This is a small version of the Mouse Brother's Book, which inspired a few of the things that Stuart Little did wrong with, but I remember the name mostly" If that's not the case, it's a better view. <br /> <br /> But serious people, give your children a favor and read them. <br /> <br /> Some of Stuart's books talk about a very small man, not a mouse. like a mouse. She was not born of her parents. The book is about his life and the journey from the next house and on his journey. There is a cat named Kartop, he thinks he is eating and wants to eat it, but the Snowball can not talk. <br /> <br /> They shot all of them in the film. I think the only thing they kept in the book was boat races and names.
