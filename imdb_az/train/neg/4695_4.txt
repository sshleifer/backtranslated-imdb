<br /> <br /> I watched this movie a few times and really did not think it was funny, but I like to look at a little laugh. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> > <p> Dabney Coleman is one of the more than 80 stars who play the best bad guy, not really bad, just the opposite. Dolly Partin is a favorite and entertaining to watch comedies, and in her lower southern mouth she really shines. It's like Jane Fonda and it's too little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has funniest lines and she has to laugh at me a few times and love her. <br /> I can advise those who love the comedy of the 80s. I love the movie, but there are things I do not like. It begins with a good start, and there is a beautiful stream, and then everything comes together and gives less attention to the characters. All of these have very little dreams about what they want to make the boss, and I think the film's flow slows down, even though I'm "sweet". <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> As the film continues, once more, funniest things happen and once more slows down If you see the stars, but give it a try, you do not see it. I think that may be more or less likable, depending on the mood.
