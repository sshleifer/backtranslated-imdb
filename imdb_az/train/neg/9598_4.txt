Robert Colomb has two full-fledged jobs. Known worldwide as a globetrotting TV reporter. <br /> <br /> Like Vivre pour Vivre, a full-time betrayer who is less well-known but equally exhausted in my English-language version of the "Life to Live". Some life! Robert has at least three women in his life: a woman on his way, a wife on a road and a betrayal at home. This helper Robert is a liar. Among his most useful lies are, "I call you tomorrow" and "It's been a while since my business has been settled." He spends lots of time and money on airplanes, trains and hotel rooms. <br /> <br /> Some people may feel excited, but I think it's tedious. His cousins, Catherine, are all charming and desirable women. <br /> <br /> Lifestyle is awful, and it is so cheating that you are surprised to enjoy it all. <br /> <br /> The addition of Tedium is that there is no more plot. There are no dialogues or large sections that do not have a French dialogue alone. We see documented war, torture, and military documents. <br /> <br /> Annie Girardot is a prominent performer in this film. Annie Girardot, after returning from Africa, expect the plane to reach the airport and wait for the plane. Hers was the most interesting character and he played with excellence. It was nice to see Candice Bergen at the beginning of his career. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some of Claude Lell's novel techniques. On the scene of a hotel room, claiming to be around Roberto Cameron's office and his author. We need to see them as soon as each passage around the room is. Elsewhere in a car lying on a train, Robert is downstairs while lying in the upper tract. Robert gives some important but embarrassing news for his wife, but we hear only a portion of the train collapse. I also felt that her husband had difficulty grabbing every word because of the shocking nature of the news. I also enjoyed African fascinating safari scenes. <br /> <br /> I was watching this movie in a Congressional Library project. I called the FIFTY project 50 different films for 50 years. It is best to say that this movie, like the other forty-nine I've seen, has not been broadcasted in the United States on video, telecast or broadcast since the original version. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it still deserves to be. <br /> <br />
