There is no reason to bother to rent this flick. I knew open loans. <br /> <br /> This is a mild porn movie, but there's really nothing erotic about it. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to look at the world of sexual dependency, but to a point. <br /> <br /> Dragging sex scenes, bad conspiracies and community by Ed Begley and Rosanna Arquette are not enough to keep this movie.
