If I had a worse comedy than "Gray Matters," I was not aware of that. The funny work of New York's Jewish comedy, Sam and Gray, is to find out that several brothers are wrong, and that they are equally drawn to Gray's goal, as they decide to make a girl Sam. Gray's secret announcement is just amazing to him. Moynahan and Graham have a profoundly embarrassing "drunken motion," and everywhere there is a sense of embarrassment from the woods of Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek demonstrates that it is completely impossible to make a comedy, and wants it to be removed from its rubber. Molly Shannon plays with a naked friend lumpen insouciance. Only Alan Cumming comes with any loan, but it does not work well and is not going to work. The whole disaster resulted in Graham's staggering turnaround, with the final scene. Although the scene is put on the lesbian bar, she is wearing a comedy hats and coats. It is surprising that this film has no irreplaceable character and should avoid all costs.
