Axis & Allies played spying games in most parts of North Africa and the rest of the world. Not the best of films, perhaps the worst of budgetary films is not one of the pre-made Warriors classics. <br /> <br /> Duncan was really good at one of the first movies on Cisco Kid Renaldo. I really enjoyed Harry Park's (known as Parkyarkarkus) activity. Why has not he ever played a bigger role? He played the role of a perfect friend / partner and rescued the movie ... imho. <br /> <br /> As you know, this movie is part of the budget package called War Classics called Super Box-Mart. <br /> <br /> This script is good, not so hot. Eight movies for eight dollars, some worthy stars, some of the unheard of films are trying to pay. Editing and cinematography ... is bad. If you want to see all this in the future and Cisco Kid and just a great sidekick that does not fulfill its true potential, you must take it! Otherwise, there are other WW2 movies to watch. <br /> <br /> -Thunderossa.
