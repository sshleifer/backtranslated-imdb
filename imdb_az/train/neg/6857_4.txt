This "torn comedy" looks very compelling. Actually, actors spend a lot of time to pass a baseless script. Ultimately, it does not go anywhere. Once you get a quickie divorce, a woman's opinion that she is pregnant is all that funny. And then, after kidnapping Cooper for kidnapping a baby, putting it to adopt may seem strange and it's really hard to turn it into a comedy. It's really a shame that players can do more than scripture, and I'm sorry for all the trouble. Given that Cooper is so good comedy, I advise them to see them instead.
