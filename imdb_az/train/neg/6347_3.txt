Perhaps I am always going to see the film Woody Alleb, because he knows when he's just returned to his former splendor. Only one or two great moments or lines can make it worthwhile. Unfortunately, this movie just does not have any account. Thar makes me sad and even a little guilty. I'm sure that my reaction is like many other Woody fans, but what can I say? Perhaps, in my opinion, it's pretty good that it's time to concentrate on Clarinet. By saying all this, I can still go to any new film that will come up with Woody in the future. There is always hope, and I will love you and continue to respect you!
