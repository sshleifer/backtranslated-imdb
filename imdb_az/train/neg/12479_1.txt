DEATHSTALKER is ideal for B-fantasy fans; This 80-minute movie shooter may want hecklers - a non-existent cunning, awesome toy (for at least one raspy voice for old lady), funny scripting and schlock adjustment, and bargain-basement style background settings. There is no such thing as a seemingly interesting and interesting one (in particular, there is nothing tempting about his predecessor), and the actors did nothing to rise above the F-grade material. If this is not enough, then what is DEATHSTALKER's absence of an attractive area to join the main Turkey (which does not have this kind of film)? I was also disturbed by the fact that the women in this film did not serve any purpose: 1) topless and / or covered in small quantities; 2) be harassed; 3) be in contact with the hero; 4) above all. In addition, background music is moderate; electronic noise, stunning chorus explosions, and an orchestral cacophony. Numbing numbing something numbing something to keep something interesting and numbing something naughty, DEATHSTALKER is likely to fit people looking for something to laugh (and I believe there's plenty to do). Otherwise, I do not want to give 100th grade CONAN.
