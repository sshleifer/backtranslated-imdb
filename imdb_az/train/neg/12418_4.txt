This film is now seen, released and welcomed as the best picture of Israel in the year. <br /> <br /> This is Dror's second feature film, and I have to admit that this is the first picture he created and his drama drama. In addition, this is the first attempt at drama management. <br /> <br /> I will never see this movie, the first thing I have to know is: The 21st century Israel has hated Kibbutz and its value. Formation of the Israeli state. The real state of kibbutzime is very strange, and some of them disappear. Kibbutz, the Greek word for collective word, equality and socialism, was a kind of village for only members who were dogmatic for everyday life. with the change of social values ​​over time, it seems that kibbutz is now a place where the human spirit is suppressed, locked in the rules of dogma, and appears without a ticket. The introduction of capitalist values ​​and lifestyles in the 1990s, and so far, became very difficult in my pocket. <br /> <br /> But I think this movie has nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of kibbutz. it was a dream of every young man to live in kibbutz once and to raise children in this beautiful and beautiful environment. but the film shows otherwise. Kibbutz, with his socialist dogma, was a place of prayer for the foolish ideas that attracted the individual's freedom within the collective. this is the central philosophy of postmodern capitalism: your individual is the most important thing. you have to put yourself in the center, and no one else is yours. <br /> <br /> If you agree with me, I am convinced that you accept the tone, actor, movie tone of the film, but I am sure that the film's philosophy and its first crime. , this script and its direction are the following four sins. the film has no real visual text, and none of its shootings is remembered. is more sensitive to attracting non-superficial feelings, not with the audience, but with the audience. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Perhaps Israel meets the rest of the world that he hates socialist and human values? or maybe the Israelites are a "sensitive" place, not dogma and fanaticism? are we mainly people who are good people, especially when they are fake, as we expect capitalism to emotion? or because it is one of the greatest lie in Israeli cinema in recent years, could cause a lie that is the basis of the existence of the Jewish state? No matter what your answer, it's not a good thing. not for the world, but for the Jewish people.
