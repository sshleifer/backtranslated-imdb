Where to start here? Straightheadhead presents me with a dilemma. In 1975, when this film, directed by Ruggero Deodatto and filmed by David Hess, came from Italy, I was driving in the summer more frequently than the Labrador drink. Since Tarantino and Rodriguez respected the grindhouse cinema, Dan Reed produced a very ridiculous intrigue / revenge in the UK and Rodriguez came to a budget similar to Rose McGowan's machine gun. Because if you want to play a grindhouse bingo, call me 'numbers': 1. Rich, high-flying career women mistakenly misunderstood a wrong side and gets implausibly hots for her. <br /> <br /> 2. Free pictures from a flying career woman in nudity in different states. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There is no depth. <br /> <br /> 5. The murderous and bloody murder and revenge scenes all round. Bingo! <br /> <br /> Straightheads is pretty basic: Dyer meets Anderson, and invites him to a party in a country where he owns his boss. On his way home, Dyer was disturbed by three local people in Landover, who took revenge on Anderson with a good shoe and gang. The couple then decided to take revenge. So far, Straw Dogs, Night Night Trails, House on the Park, My Tomb of Tomb, and so on. Why did not I think most of this movie? There are many reasons for this: First of all, I think that Gillian Anderson's love with the cast prima facie leads to a better outlook, but here it is more honest than most. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows exactly what he has always got after watching Hess and his first terrorist women and slaughtering the numbers of the 70s - just shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator low budget speeds to make. The Buddhists want to kill goodwill and murder, turn tables on the blessings of the blessings and kill them, and wipe out some of the worst violence in the knowledge that the world order has been restored, satisfying everyone and looking safe. <br /> <br /> As a writer and director, Dan Reed obviously strives to talk more about the state of human soul and not to leave an incredibly deep philosophical depth. . For example, when Anderson and Dyer are planning a revenge on attackers, one of the attackers learns that they are a fourteen year old daughter and that they are the purpose of lust for two men hanging around her. When Anderson finally came face to face, he acknowledged that only two of his followers were raped by him as a miracle to bring his daughter to the attention! Reed is simply jawping in a random and courageous way to attack this small wild field, and this simple reference to pedophilia is enough to throw the audience out of the spirit and think of them leaving the movie theater. we just sat down with something important. At this point, we were used for the second time with aggression and aggression in order to make sure that we were "getting" it, but Reed's got a lot more shots Anderson's brutal capture and raped his car's bonnet. <br /> <br /> After giving her information about her causes to kill her, Anderson connects her to a table, completes the work of a sniper rifle (with a large silencer it's not as vivid as her wave, but there is no courage to shoot a shooter, Dyer this is not a moral quality.) Dyer claims otherwise, and their moral dilemma is presented as something discussed by Wittgenstein and Russell on tea and cakes in the Cambridge room. <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <strong> He wants to leave Scully behind and bless him, of course, Mulder knows that a friend gets a leak on the edge of the road and then throws a man to a gun Dyer, on the other hand, does what he does in every movie he has so far made - that is, a b You're tired of blowing a horrific cock cockney-type chip, an embarrassing line and a lot of people never going to go. After killing those who attacked the cold blood, and when Dyer looked at the camera, I am convinced that on the final stage, which is a view of the inhuman breath that invites us to the hand of the hand, we have seized it and eliminated the moral problems that we had to overcome, but instead, Stan Stan reminds Oliver Hardy to be surprised by the camera after he had come to another great confusion. By accident, this film finishes perfectly.
