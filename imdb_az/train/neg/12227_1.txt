This may be the worst movie, and maybe it's worth seeing alone. Streisand is incredibly laughable as a young woman who creates a man for learning Judaism. The soundtrack is torturous, featuring some belting of the weakest blather to Barbara's film. And even in my field I did not start. In fact, more puppets than this movie will be more than comedy because it's a terrible thing. The drunken ego of Streisand, causing this stinker to rise to the height of the Oscars, caused this disaster. I'm sure that writer Isaac Beshchi Singer hated this movie and never donated Strysan. I can not blame him. This film is watching a car crash on slow movement over two hours, 'The Sound of Music' is back to the old turntable. This is really bad. I'm surprised that everyone from Streisand uses this movie at the intended level.
