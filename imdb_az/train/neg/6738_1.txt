There are many films on the same subject. the only cute girl needs a nice guy to impress before, paying him and then fumbling on a number then before a happy end, everyone is in love with it (guess what?) /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> But still, I was still waiting for her. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <i> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A woman, <br /> <br /> A completely unreal movie full of unrealistic characters, none of which had ever been done, had more money than all of them, and after learning that she was sleeping with her best friend, she still had to marry a bride who has gone ahead ... plus never had a meeting "!!!!! I can go, but I realize that I spend more time on this crazy ..... It's just a humorous thing to do in the movie, just to get acquainted with a character to make a cheap laugh just for the "odunculu".
