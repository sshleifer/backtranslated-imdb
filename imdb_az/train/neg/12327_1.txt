In the previous review, the film said that the film was not all bad. Yes?!?!?! The film honors child abuse. But Sylvia Kristel was naked, so let's give 5 out of 10 children. Why exactly 10? Since the filmography was "annoying," the child's shocking look was "unreal," and his greasy friend was "irritating." In the theory of man, nowhere in the 1981 film, the American movie has no insult on the scenes of a child who has sex with a teenage woman. She was able to steer this movie while staying at a Showtime hotel. If my fat friend walked up to the storm and was worthy of Oscar, I still have to give the movie just one star. Howard Hessman, the TV's spouse, is also laughable, as it appears on the WKRP. But I do not have a word for that!
