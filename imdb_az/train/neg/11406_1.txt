But I bought it. It seems to me that the author of the book loves Caroline. I was very sorry for the character Louise and compared with Esau, who is always worse, I just felt that the comparison was a bit rigid and non-realistic. Indeed, the film was bad. If I'm ready for a great hurdle, I will not really see it.
