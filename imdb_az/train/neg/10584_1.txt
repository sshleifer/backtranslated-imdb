The only payout quality of this movie is bad enough to be a comedy. Everyone in this movie seems to be releasing a porn industry. In fact, I worked better on low budget pornography. Even if I've rented a gay gay porn after this classic scene, Jim: See your partner Nick: You're watching (together): I will not be back! <br /> <br /> The first action sequence is terribly produced, but its really funny: Good guys have a transformer gun! On one scene, all have fake HK MP5 sub-machine guns. The next scene, AK-47 replicas! And then, all off, there are some weapons that change between several M-16s scenes! I think they were not enough to go between good guys and bad guys, but a budget deficit for weapons. The fight against scenes is badly coordinated and fake as all hell. You need to pull a grenade pin / spoon to explode. You can not shoot any rocket launcher while you're on a helicopter. The weapon you are thrown will not appear again and again. When it comes to the bullet, it is still stupid to throw it. If you have no idea how to reload them, the big slower sliding around the first gear makes for unusual motion scenes. I really do not believe these films will actually be produced. This movie would be cheerful about nitrous oxide or perhaps just drunk.
