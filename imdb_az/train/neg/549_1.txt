I do not believe the Indian film industry has still drawn a third degree dross like Waqt. The story for beginners is completely complicated? The ugly son is thrown out of the family home to teach him to trust himself. What does he do? Instead of jumping in front of the jury, some stars continue to join a number of national talent competitions (I honestly do not joke here). Meanwhile, her father dies with lung cancer, but keeps her son secret, but remains long enough to make her son famous, see her new grandson, and make a new toy giraffe with her own hands. <br /> <br /> Is there something in the player's hammock? in this film, no effort was made to convince any of the key players to work and act. Like ordinary Indian films, he lived in a large mosque and did not seem to be more restrained with real world concerns. <br /> <br /> It is important to be honest, that when those films are shot, those who lose their minds are smart watchers who make a movie mistake. Actors like Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar will still be acquainted with God by people who do not believe in something else in Bollywood.
