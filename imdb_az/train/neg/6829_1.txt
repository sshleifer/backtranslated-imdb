I wrote at least half the details of this horrible little flick and nobody was published, so one should think that someone likes this horrible movie on the imdb.com site. A group of oil workers assumes that it has been rebuilding and rebuilding a military tank in the desert for more than a decade. Actuality and direction are the same. Go to her.
