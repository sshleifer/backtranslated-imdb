I do not like this movie very much. <br /> <br /> If you read Puzo's books or at least watch the two first movies (especially the first one), you'll agree with me. <br /> <br /> Corona's epic is Puzo's novel, and the script of this movie is sometimes ridiculous. Heroes and their relationships are distorted. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film is in a number of directions, the story is no longer available. <br /> <br /> For the Corleone's epic in the 1990s, different times are expected and we'll find everything as it was before. On the other hand, I do not know why they have been transmitted in contexts why other movies do not match their dialogues. Why is this? <br /> <br /> Pozo, Coppola and Al Pacino will never be able to understand this topic. Apocalypse Now and Godfather have to be forgiven for everything they do in the movie before they die. Al Pacino is like an actor. But Mario Puzo did not write it. How come? All previous jobs were damaged. What a shame, dude. Puzo's novel The Last Don is part of the 90th story, and it's great. We can never say anything about the third form of God's fatherhood.
