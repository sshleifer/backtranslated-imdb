This movie is a giant pants burden. Paul Schrader has completely lost his bad scene. And his orientation depends, in essence, of the fact that he did not fall asleep during the process. <br /> <br /> The worst case is Woody Harrelson. She plays a "giant" man, a gay man in DC who is a social friend to the elegant women of the Washington elite. If he was cut off from a magazine and returned to the popsicle bar in front of the camera, he could not have been more dimensional. Its "southern accents" are the "stubborn" version of the South Caucasus, with its heat and humidity diminishing its everyday energy, from the beginning to the end of each line. This is a monotone. But it's not the worst hit in the movie. Moritz Bleibtreau's "lover", attempting to influence a portion of the Middle East, is so bad that it only reduces the bad lines written for him. Although he is German in real life and has spoken several languages, he is unable to dispatch rs - one of them is Italian! Is this a good reason to think of someone else? <br /> <br /> According to the story, scenario, leadership, camera work, and speeches, this movie is bad from start to finish. The only tolerable thing in this film came from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall, and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three films have succeeded in acting in line with their dignity. In fact, the three are really good despite the fact that they are trapped in a bad film. Unfortunately, nobody could have been good enough to compensate for this infinite series of failures. If you want these three actors, look something else. This movie is not worth your time.
