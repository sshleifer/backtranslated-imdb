After seeing Sexy Eliza Dushku in a pretty good Wrong Tour, I decided not to return all the films to the dead, but to choose one. I have not seen anyone yet, but I think it's one of the most popular horror films, and we can say that she has made a wrong choice. There is simply nothing to recommend this film, and I'm talking about killing a superfluous killer. It did not have the sexual desire of young people in poor film movies, as I was acquainted with last summer or Valentine's Day or city legend. They simply did not have any excitement, they wrote little or no interest. The release date has been dismissed several times a year, and the reason is clear. All movies come as a trivial scene that is directly encountered, meaningless effect. If you want to see Dushku, get the wrong turn instead. I would like to see a movie with him and super-hot Elisabeth Harnois, but I do not think it will be possible to wait for this movie. Casey Affleck is so encouraging, in a good hunting, a terrible thing here - it looks like both exploration and indoctrination. That's enough.
