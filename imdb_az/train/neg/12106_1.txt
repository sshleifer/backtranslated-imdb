A brave, cowardly film. Director Boorman welcomes Cahill to rich homes with robbery, but shows that the widow who lives in the man is faithful. The clerk who investigated Cahill has been exploded in his car, but the rat is facing the rats and does not look like a beautiful person, so all is good. Beats, owner of Russborrough House, earned money by exploiting "darkness" diamond drums. It's better to rob them of expensive craftsmanship and hide them in a bunker in the Wicklow Mountains. Garda kills prostitutes and is charged with murder. Moral substitution is sick, Boorman is looking for a hit movie, but I do not have the courage to stand up against the murder of the generals who have killed the neighbors terrorist and opened another wave of waves over Dublin. He generally agreed with the son of Generals. It's disgusting. I'm sorry to be scared.
