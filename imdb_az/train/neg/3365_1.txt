The weak adjustment of the classic of 1963 started very well, and then replaced the vulnerability with inadequate and meaningless special effects. For example, one of the coldest moments in the original, Nell and Theo listen to the noise of their room while lying side by side in a double bed. Nell says to Theo to let her go, because it hurt her. Nell then looks at Theo, a few feet away, and realizes that Theo does not hold her hand. In the latest version, Nell slides from the floor while lying down on bed. When he says unseen power to not let him go, so that we can understand what has happened. <br /> <br /> What do Nile's last words mean? - What is your saying about "Family, always about family"? <br /> <br /> Lili Taylor's speech can not save this movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones once again demonstrates that it's far beyond its depth. In fact, Claire Bloom presented himself in a delicate fashion. Zeta-Jones, for example, has to write it down, for example, if Nel has a man or a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Certainly, this should be sent to a meaningless remakes cemetery.
