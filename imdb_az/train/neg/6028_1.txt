I am a Christian ... and I feel that this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> This movie is the only one in the world. The message is just about you. If you want to touch a larger audience, you need to be smarter. At every stage, the Father can not be a father who roams and accompanies the Holiness. RIDICULOUS! <br /> <br /> Weak direction. It was terrible to find missing people, but it was funny. They put their clothes on the floor? He recalls the old Ed Wood films: "O God, people are missing!" The scene on the plane is just stupid. Think about it: If you find your nearest garments, "I am the Lord, they are gone!" They say. start crying and shouting. You would first deny it ... you will not skip this conclusion. Follow Jodie Foster at FLIGHTPLAN. My favorite focus is the dog sitting on the river with clothes and boots next to her. <br /> <br /> They were so laughing since the beginning of the interview. <br /> <br /> Music was very bad and drew much attention. Composer was like hitting his own films in his own world. "It's my chance to make a tension here," "My chance to act here!" THEY WANT TO DOWNLOAD A good score supports what happens on the screen ... this movie needs more than one UNDER account, but it's a lot like your message. <br /> <br /> The writing was soft. Captain Christian Kirk Cameron was such. Young people were worse: "You do not understand, people are missing!". Brad Johnson laughed. The two speeches came from Anti-Christ and the old man (those who did not apologize, who could not remember their names). The producers, filmmakers and actors say "we will reach a wide audience" and "Brad Johnson is incredible" and "this is like a Hollywood movie" while watching "The Decision" ("What Do They Think?"). <br /> <br /> I did not know what it was. <br /> <br /> I highly appreciate my efforts. It's a fantastic idea to send a message to a large audience. The film is the best way to do it. Watch movies such as WIDE AWAKE, SIGNNS, COMMUNICATION, MESSENGER PASSION, OBROTHER. Instead, the film needs to be done by people with talent and vision. Unfortunately, it was not.
