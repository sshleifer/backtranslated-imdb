I just sat in the theater of hell, I wanted to leave half of the movie. Area is simple 4 Samoan children are distributing their wedding. So let them bring a date for the wedding. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm talking about the events in the Caucasus. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The operation was centered below, and this movie just went through and I was not about anything but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predicted plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Run away .
