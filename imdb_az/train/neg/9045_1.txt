This film has begun with some images of a plot, then left for an endless random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with the story forward. It was not possible to deal with this movie. This movie is a very dirty pile created by some people with animated skills but with a lack of creativity or storytelling. It's a shocking effort from a big studio. Obviously, Disney has moral and motivational problems, and can not talk about the lack of inspection and quality. This allowed the authorities to see the light of the day talking about the volume of their incompetence and desperation. This movie joins my very short list of "The Worst Movies of All Time".
