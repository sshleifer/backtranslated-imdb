This is the worst West I've ever seen. The story is followed by a common formula for Western and martial arts films - the hero learns that family / friends have been killed, the hero definitely revenges, corrects ineffective lawyers, abducts kidnapped lover, and kills experts in the arch-nemesis in the brutal duel. This formula has often succeeded - otherwise it would not be a formula - but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric performance you can see. Comedy writing is simple and insulting; the high level teacher sounds like it's written because the dialogue has no depth, maturity and reality. Sound is bad; sometimes appear dubbed. Cinematography is naked and sets are sometimes facades. This is the leadership; Instead, some of the performers are responsible for the script, but others can not use this excuse. Hopefully, I will not see Chris Lybbert as a speaker; Every time he says angrily or say something, he does nothing but lowering his voice, and he sounds like a child trying to play. When talking about Hopalong Chris Lybbert (if you have the courage to watch this movie), he will wear these new clothes, which look more like a Roy Rogers than a more profitable, low and dirty cowboy. Whether you enjoy good kinematic prices for worshiping Hopalong Cassidy's imaginative majesty, after that, but if you have two giant neurons, look at something else.
