I have always been interested in something about Bigfoot, so I was watching when I looked for a movie to rent. It was at least $ 4.50 that you never spent and would like to return my money! Please do not lose money on this! It was one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie was incredibly boring and I found myself getting rounded up and could not even follow it all the way. I just nourished. The player was strange, the effects were terrible, everything was just bad and tasteless. All this was really a bad, boring film and a total loss of time and money. Hopefully, one day they will make a good movie about Sasquatch, but until then I have to sit with so many cheap ducks to find this true masterpiece.
