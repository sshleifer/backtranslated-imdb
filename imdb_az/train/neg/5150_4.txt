The DVDs were looking forward to getting a good idea of ​​how the funds would be funded from the library at main opera production. I must say that I was very disappointed. The subject was very potent. Groups that are involved in a Wagnerian production must be complicated and compelling, and the story behind their creation and use could be an excellent educational experience. Instead, we help him along with a comment that does not pay attention to the negatives, getting a hodgepodge of clips of people who move around on the big items in the scene. First of all, I listen to music background music from the opera. I had a very good impression that the efforts to make such a production had a great impact, and I was in the opera the next time, but I am sure that this video will be remembered - but with a slightly deceived feeling of lack of detailed commentary and explanation.
