It could have been a good movie if I could watch it. The hand-held camera was very bouncy. I'm worried about opening loans. We've seen a great deal of complexity up to the end. But we were up until the end, because it was a charming and interesting film and gave an idea to the young pop culture in South Africa. The black and white film has increased the artistic sense. The actor seemed very safe. Some of the dialogue was a bit difficult to figure out, but a full non-South African theater found the most ridiculous. If you get into any illness, you can seriously skip this movie. This is strange, but not worth it.
