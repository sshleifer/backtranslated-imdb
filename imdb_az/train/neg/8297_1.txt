Ugh! The starting point ... first, Campbell Scott's non-stop angst, after a short time (after a very short period of time), internalizes the pain, curiosity and anger of his assembly. Not just us! These characters, presented by the writer and the director, are not entirely difficult, and there is a key. They did not give us anything to care for them, even though they were weak and were still in love with each other. When Scott quietly says to his three daughters, "I can kill you," I wish I could almost wake up after the devastating selfish feast of time - then the same thing, before Denis Leary's clever appearance before looney box was removed. Time is completely wasted, and maybe it's probably resources.
