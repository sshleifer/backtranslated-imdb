I really do not have any idea how to comment on this movie. Special effects were awful, the player was strange and if there was a structure for all this, it was on the back of the box. For a long time, I do not think this movie can remember a movie and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies! <br /> <br /> Even this movie can not be just a terrible pretext to pay someone (or sleep in that case) to stand in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> I have very little overall "zombie" effect. As you can see in this film, zombies are working here and there on a pair, and accidentally talk about a gas station (in front of a renovated glass, but with an inner bathroom), as zombie film is a factor until the end. <br /> <br /> Vampires: As you can see, all zombies are men and all vampires are women, women are women, and those with me are good. I'm not sure how the vampires go out in the day or why the soldier's vampire stands in the middle of the road, but still waiting for the Queen, holding her weapon. Vampires will slide all the way. The last part of the old khanate did not make any sense, and when a hot lesbian vampire asked another hot vampire, "Do you think we are doing the right thing?" <br /> <br /> In the film they killed two different heroes. <br /> <br /> Acting and special effects were always low. Undoubtedly, the cunningly saw the fake blood drawn near the zombie flying over the general. When speaking to the General, what did THY look at at Kenny Rogers? <br /> <br /> Generally, you can watch the movie if you have a good call or if you have a strong call to spend $ 3. Only my $ 0.02.
