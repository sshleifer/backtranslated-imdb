The National Treasure is in a very extreme and excessive sensitivity if they come. Nicholas Cage is an incredible action hero in no way and this movie is not "Indiana Jones". <br /> <br /> People who have compared this movie to the Hind Jones classic trilogy are seriously dropping from their rock band. <br /> <br /> It is not possible to understand which film is targeted to the target audience. Perhaps he likes pre-teenage audiences, but I found it totally funny. I can not imagine it to be a big movie from adults and young people. <br /> <br /> The National Treasurer can not change his debt to the "Da Vinci Code". I advise you to leave this movie in 2006 and wait for this nonsense. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​stealing the Declaration of Independence and the ability to walk around all Washington and Philadelphia. it is absurd to meet the "bad guys" and when it comes to the possibility of being "unstoppable". In particular, when I went to the scene, I was infected with the Covered Declaration. My brother! <br /> <br /> He recalled the episode "Brady Bunch" to my fun park and Mr Brady lost his architectural plans. Moreover, Brady Bunch's episode was better than this movie! <br /> <br /> In the hidden ruins of the US, the idea of ​​a great treasure that no one can believe is outside. Certainly, there are "priceless" things in this treasure that are not discovered by thousands. Yes right! Ridiculous !! <br /> <br /> Even worse, it clarifies figures that Cage finds and what the "tough" tips of these ancient characters are! Oh, humanity! <br /> <br /> Cage, Voight, and other actors of the "National Treasure" appear tough, wooden and flat as they come from. <strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <strong> Military operations against people living in the Caucasus continue. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;
