"Raw Force" is an ultra-sleazy and perverse version of the Love Boat with additional Kung Fu battles, demented cannibalistic monks, white slave trading, energetic zombies and very bad performance performances. This film is included in the recently released "Grindhouse Experience 20 Movie Box". Everything is incompatible with the abuse of looking for fanatics, and has a blend of visible native script! Production values ​​are extremely poor and technical aspects are extraordinary, but the amount of unequal violence and sex can be hardly described. The movie opens in a tropical sunny place called Warriors Island. Here, monk priests raise the dead for no other reason than to become Kung Fu fighters. Leaders buy sexual slaves because they are a businessman, and even women's body provides the necessary powers to increase the zombie army. There are tourists, three martial arts fighter, a woman la police and a lot of women who are frustrated by the ship's cruise ship, by Hitler's sister, because they are planning a trip to the island of Warriors. Their rescuer bathes all over the island and the priests call on the survivors to battle the zombies. Okay, how does it sound for a crazy midnight horror film? Piranhas, wild boat orgies at "Raw Force", Cameron Mitchell is a more embarrassing leading role and has a totally less junk look because of Duchess Camille Keaton ("I Spit on Your Grave"). Bad things, including massacres and bullying, humorous jokes and bad tasty romanticism, have taken place. The garbage value of this movie will remain silent. The bad backgrounds of the monks are, naturally, undisclosed and not even punished for their suspicious hobbies. Perhaps that is why the film stands for "The End" instead of "Continuing". Finally, if the IMDb did not show such a list then it was never in the past.
