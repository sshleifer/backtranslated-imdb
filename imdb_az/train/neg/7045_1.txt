This means being the worst and worst biker movie ever! <br /> <br /> We know what happens with Ginger after the island of Gilligan! Tina Louise, who looked sad, was probably scared by some of the most striking motorcycle networks in the film's history. But do not worry about the fans! Batman comes to rescue Adam as a hick-town physician of the West! Pow! Do not hit! No explosion! Holy Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only good moments of this "bomb" are some lovely ladies, some funny fighting scenes and still "sexy" Tina Louise!
