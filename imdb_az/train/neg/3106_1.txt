This is always a movie when I make a list of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is no indisputable quality of this. <br /> <br /> I do not want to talk about some things. <br /> <br /> Therefore, <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm the only one in the theater and I was a lonely, lonely, lonely, relentless young man who was sitting next to me. It was clear that they spent a good Saturday night and some "laughs" had come to this "comedy". Before the film begins, during preview, laughs, jokes and loud voices make it a great time to pass. Borderlessly teasing; If they had been jealous of their true movie, I had said something, but I felt the excitement and inspiration, I let it. <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Because of this claim, you can criticize the "comedy" not only by myself, but with this strange gang. <br /> <br /> During the whole film, one person laughed at the theater. Not once. Not myself, not dark children. The silence on the edge of the soundtrack. When the movie was over and the lights shifted, we all slowly slowly and nervously pulled it out of the theater. It could have been funeral. <br /> <br /> It affected the production of this "comedy". I'm not laughing, not using, but absolutely DEPRESSION. It was a challenging, exciting movie, and the smallest thing is funny. Preachy is charming, surprising, but not funny. <br /> <br /> I think Mel Brooks's "Silent Saddles" will be in the short list for Ever's Funniest Film. <br /> <br /> In short, if you feel very happy, give this movie a twist; Otherwise, I have not notified you.
