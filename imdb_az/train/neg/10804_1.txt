It is not difficult to say that KAZAAM's review and a bad film - all this, when the critics excited this movie - they said it was one of the worst films ever! Well, I say bad things or anyone says that it's bad, of course, it does not surprise me. Like someone who talked about World War II - practically no one says that's a good thing, right? My question and I will not be able to answer anywhere in the IMD "Why did they do it first?". For all this, it is clear to anyone who does not have serious brain thinking that the film will be terrible. Only ED (baseball chimpanzee), COOL AS ICE (always played by the famous Vanilla Ice), TROLL 2 (even without any trolls), BABY GENIUSES (Super Hero Babies Like Einstain) and PINOCCHIO (huh !!!) any idea, no matter how silent it is, proves that it can make it bigger! So, the best basketball player of the time seems to be a 'normal' for a little jerk that plays like a gin! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a child who is causing the opening of the cupboards in the corridor of the school. Like a punk from WILLY FREE, this child is in any way a 'misunderstood' (in other words, a common constellation) and you know that until the end of the movie he grew up after learning something, no matter how selfish and terrible. Only one time, I would like to see this kind of pank child in prison or dead! Finally, when accusers in the neighborhood are in the midst of pummeling, Jin Kazaam (Shaquil O'Neal) is accidentally released and insists on giving three wishes. <br /> <br /> Finally, Brat understands that Kazaam is real. However, unlike most children, she keeps her desires, while Kazaam is forced to follow her everywhere as her own servant. And according to the cliché, you know that until the end of the movie, Max and Kazaam will become their husbands and some will be tears. Oh, and Max came to meet his father's fiancée (I'm going to go). As you can see, this genie is part of an additional social worker, such as a wishful thinking. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Kazaam, Shaquille speaks most of the film and even calls rapes ... it's too bad. I'm a middle-aged mentor and at least I'm rap. He's an incredible basketball player and I've heard he's a wonderful guy - but a rapper ... no way! As he did, it was not good, there was such a beautiful personality in the film that it is difficult to hate it - even though it is very stupid to do it. <br /> <br /> As you probably heard, the movie frightens you as excited? With the first two thirds of the film, I will not say anything. She has done a good job with a difficult child and a bad post. However, then the film is badly worse - it is very unusual for him to help the child when he really needs it. A rap star of the accident (!!?!) As the guy who wants to set up to become a bad mobster, the surface is really strange! And, of course, this man acknowledges that Kazaam is a genie without any hesitation! <br /> <br /> In addition, the last part of the film consists of people trying to kill Max and his father. I know that the boy was annoyed, but that was a baby movie! What portion of "I'm trying to kill" did not understand the writers? Then, perhaps, Kazaam, who has finished the worst child film, has become a god or something and has become a hallucinatory drug! This last was even dark and strange ... and boy, it damaged my brain! Uggghh - this was terrible information! <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, it is a terrible film that is mostly written to writers. Yes, folks, messed up message, non-kid-friendly material and terrifying characters strange, this is an unhappy movie. Unfortunately, it is difficult to imagine that the final product is getting worse as ideas and actors are taken into account! <br /> <br /> By the way, if you see a Genie in a good modern world movie, try it out for the Britons to begin with for the film "Bernard and Gin" for a very nice and well-written movie.
