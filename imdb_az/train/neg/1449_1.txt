First, before you read more, you must understand that I'm not a neo-Nazis, and I try to understand that only Hitler has no power to repeat. <br /> <br /> I saw this series and found it horrible. I mean, OK, it's interesting to look at, but is it real? The answer was sought and I found: not entirely. First, Hitler was not angry for his whole life, but a series of hits, even though he was a child. Secondly, Hitler never ever wanted to abuse her daughter; in fact, Hitler was really gay and fought all his life to strangle the mystery. Third, people will hate me, but it is true: Hitler was attractive. If he were so hateful and ugly, how powerful was he? Because it was attractive. <br /> <br /> This series was terrible because you think Hitler is just an angry boss, because this is the point that I have found in interviews with people living near or far. Ugly, of course, not attractive, you're wrong. If you think, you can give power to countries like him and you do not want it. You can really find out how dangerous Hitler is and how he thinks he's going to be in power, and you'll find it as dangerous politicians (of course), and stop the topic without being too late. /> <br /> It is important to protect life, if this series continues to see Hitler in a similar way, this series is a terrible thing to show us the truth.
