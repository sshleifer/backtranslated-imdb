Strummer's hippie past was a revelation, but in general, it felt like a wake-up call. Campfire stories work best on a campfire. Only a few semi-boring old friends had anecdotes and images made of many fillers. I love Clash and Joe, and now I'm not re-combining and selling their songs (FU Mick Jones), but this doc wanted to give me more information. Using a storytelling story without telling the correct explanation of what the survey was describing, it blew the audience at some extent. They should have been interviewed. Using Strummer's 'radio DJ voice', she stuck the film together. And can anyone explain all the flags flying behind the campfire? Hoping to deliver the awesome "Temple of Filth" after the Temple. A Joe Strummer is worth the doc.
