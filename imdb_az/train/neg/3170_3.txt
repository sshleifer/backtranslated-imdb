There are some comic movies related to spirits to get out of Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel at Bishop's Wife (1947). Of course, the best were the Topper films in '30s-early '40s. And recently, Warren Beatty's book "Heaven Can Wait" (1978) was published in 1941 "Here comes Mr. Jordan." <br /> <br /> Now, writer director Jeff Lowell was a well-written, funny, entertaining comedy while preparing his own feature film with an unexpected story. , Kate (Eva Longoria Parker) returned to renew his newborn, Ashley (Lake Bell), who was killed on his wedding day and then falling for Kate's fianc√© Henry (Paul Rudd). What is clear at the outset: Longoria Parker is Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the top two "Topper"), which is the standard that is measured by the spirits of all women. <br /> <br /> Henry's sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) tells Henry, "Do not smile," a line right at the top. <br /> <br /> The main problem of the film, the script is not just funny. But this has worsened with the participation of Longoria Parker, but when I saw it on the screen, I was caught in the wrong way. Combine the lack of comedic talent alone, to start with, is covered with many pancake makeup that knows what she really looks like? Kate is killed when filling her wedding with frozen statue. It is so unsuccessful that the angel who gave instructions about life after it (it is best to run away), as Kate finds it as a ghost on earth without knowing what his mission is <br /> < br /> Kloe Henry wants to get out of focus after Kate's death (which I felt was a great deal of comfort), so she introduced him to Ashley, and see Henry could not contact Kate a morale (which is also a thing to end). <br /> <br /> The film's significance is epitomized by the story of B, returning from Ashley's assistant Dan (Jason Biggs). This is thrown to the end, but it shows that Ashley works as a bull like Kate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> it's not, and it's not a pity. Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray and Co, must pass through their graves to see the glimpse they see in the first two "Topper" films.
