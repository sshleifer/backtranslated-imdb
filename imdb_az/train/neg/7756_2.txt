When I go out for the first time, I watch ATTACK and remember it recently. The Sci channel has deteriorated, but not much. A shameless crash of Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. And they are empty, eating as much as possible. CGI is pretty bad, and prostate cats are laughing. It helps us a little, it helps a little. Wait for the magician, who started this turmoil, to earn it. Very few, Robert Carradine, is able to remain, except for doing so. Apparently this was shot in Fiji. Nice job if you can get it. All the low-budget monster popular in the 80s and 90s reminds STVs.
