(Of 278 out of 278 this idea should be considered useful and calculated ...) People seem to be "idealism" with intellectual space hidden behind the communism, such as silence for appearance and appearance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Chen's mix and appearance are incorrect information that has been spread by soloist propaganda (such as this movie), as it relates to its iconic length. <br /> <br /> In one of Kane's murder or the typical Soderberghian garbage was forced to sit at 4 o'clock. The question is why this pet draft is not prepared, but how long it took. Of course, I'm referring to the "secret" love of Hollywood's soloist and Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro ... your choice). I'm surprised that one of Tinseltown's most talented liberal filmmakers has been for decades to finally get a biased propaganda project without such a claim. Where is Oliver Stone in all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Even Barbra Streisand? This is a mystery. All of these precious "artists" frequently engage themselves in direct, politically single-sided projects, but still the most famous and well-known communist, Che Guevara, is still a filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Guerrilla has all the signs of America's truth bending story on an epic scale; where there are factual details available in almost all of the other major Hollywood budgetary political fairy tales, such as Malcolm X or Gandhi. The film, Del Toro stars as the famous Argentine revolutionary. Nevertheless, it could have been controversial and offensive to the man's actions, and nobody could take it: he was a clever manipulator who left a rich family. For this reason, Del Toro only adjusts the bill to his vision. Del Toro can be an exciting, charismatic actor and physically resembles Guevara, but he does not remove any intellectual quality, so he builds Guevara as a very primitive. <br /> <br /> Bratt, Philips and Franco Incompetente emphasize that the director has no silent decision. <br /> <br /> Most part of the film is quite slow (there is no surprise) and is unable to see. Even a brilliant filmmaker like Kubrick would carefully watch a movie that went beyond the 3-hour mark, as Soderbergh, who created only one or two solid movies and was in his career, was up to the challenge of His Ocean Pride. If the length of the movie shows that part of Che's life is being shown, re-think. Soderbergh draws attention to the latest stage of Che, and many of the film is tedious jungle that is full of Guevara's ambitious idealism. (Psychopaths have no ideals). I'm surprised at how cleverly this highly regarded director really is to choose not to see Che's previous life. Was he really not interested? 600 people are not interested in a massacre watch, huh? Amazing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Soderbergh has for a long time said that a better director than a highly valuable charlatan would fit into a four-hour movie, not two, but two complete translations. <br /> <br /> Soderbergh in a sense, on the dark side - more than 90% - Guevara. Soderbergh is not a humanist - a fake image, which makes the whole of Hollywood and most pop music hard to expose such ugly truths (forbidding God's sacred rebellion), instead of just thinking about ideas, testing these ideas never (about guinea pigs) passed on to people. Soderbergh and others are the elite of the worst species; <br /> <br /> Half of all students in the world are wearing Che's looks on red and orange shirts, because these people often do not know "proletariat" (foolish terms), but without knowing why. He thought that he thought the face of this person was "gorgeous", intellectual, hip, or interesting, and that clowns were often non-informative, often becoming a symbolic figure for young people. In fact, wearing a Che-shirt alone emphasizes that it is a common harshness in education and is not entirely interested in it. (You do not want to learn more about a person before you start advertising her world?) Che's now stereo appearance has become common as Bart Simpson coffee cup. <br /> <br /> More about Marx's blue hair, they will begin to read about Fidel Castro's dead ally. <br /> <br /> After everything that was called Marx, I thought that the mongrel "ideals" would finally be rested. Humanity will never learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Paul Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, Iron Curtain, more than one hundred million dead, over one million physical and / or mentally destroyed through this system ... so nothing? <br /> <br /> Del Toro's Cannes Prize is just astonishing to those who are completely clueless about how Cannes and other European festivals work and vote. Silk: Sean Penn long ago led the jury. <br /> <br /> For my music related titles: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/
