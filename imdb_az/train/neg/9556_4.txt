This movie is mostly sad scenes and special effects. The area is very weak. The majority of computer discussions were just mumbo jumbo. I was watching it because it was a great admirer of original war movies based mainly on computer reality and real computer terminology. There was no such thing in this movie. The majority of computer scenes were just unreal and non-realistic from real computers and networks, but only bare. <br /> <br /> The ripley game was naked and was actually an arcade game. No real hacking, but what was it? The film was boring. Lame later.
