In such a weak and boring movie, there is a waist to entertain such great actors. Besides all the unanswered questions in other comments, how difficult is it to keep robbery? Only remove bank employees, see what's happening in the bank - all the cameras' boots - before the entrance of the bandits and there are four additional rabbits among hostages. What is the place of every body talk? The moment when the hostages demanded that they change this form, it would seem that they were all coming out of the front door ... many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have filmed good music points and artistic shooting. The film is not for that. Pronto!
