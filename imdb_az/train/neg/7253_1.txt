We hope for a good western DVD. The movie was pretty nice and the scenes were reasonable, but the ideas were very bad. I have problems in the film. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why a bad man killed a mine? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> At least we're guessing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> the group admitted to killing laws. He will not listen to a more absurd sheriff boy than he admits to the judge and the judge. Even more funny is that Martin has hung his rope and the sheriff finally headed back to his city and takes him to a gun with a bad bank worker to save his wife. Will not he return after his immediate release to save his wife and arrest a bad bank guy? Send the judge a note he confessed before he was killed by the bell. In general, it is very sad and there is no point in the film.
