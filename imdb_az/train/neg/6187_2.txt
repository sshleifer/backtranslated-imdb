It was a terrible disappointment. The worst adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The dialogue was terrible; I do not feel any sense behind words expressed by heroes. The lines were delivered very hastily and took more space. They were also celebrated by statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York was unusual and the American Rochester seemed strange. At least one British might have been trying to make an emphasis. I like George C. Scot as an actor, but it just did not work. Jane Eyre, I watched where the main pieces of the story were put in a place that had nothing to do with the stream of casual stories. Decoration and music were very pleasant, but I did not feel the passion and love between Jane and Rochester, and the film did not leave me completely. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Now these two brilliant adaptations.
