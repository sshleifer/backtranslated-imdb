... It's a bad thing to be bad about deliberately ... <br /> <br /> This small ship hit straight on MST3k's big screen. As you can see, the film does not want to be seriously considered (hopefully their target, anyway ...), the film is still bad. Hell, it looks at the huge budget of Leprechaun Space ... <br /> In short, paint the color of my muscle car!
