This movie is in error. It starts with a few random blasts, and then draws a T-Rex bag to the audience (!). Boots between the puppet and the animation go back and forth because filmmakers can not afford live performers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of my friends found a rare video in one of the hobby stores somewhere that sells. b-films and bought it for a single purpose, but as we did, our intervention was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I thought Ed Wood was the poorest film of the "outfit 9 plan", but I thought it would be left to Japan / Lego car / Sock puppets. Remove it. If you see this movie anywhere, buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and valuable, very good laughs.
