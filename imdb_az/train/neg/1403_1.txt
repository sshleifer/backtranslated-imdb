The film is definitely a bad thing! Nothing happens. No ghost, a tough train, mystery, no interest. Comedy is stable and BRUTAL attempts are painful. Everything else is miserable. It is a late mistake: a trapped group in the middle of the ground, because their train is less than 3 minutes long. Yes? And does not the railway make them a place to stay in a heavy storm? I do not think so. Oh, they can go 4 miles across dead black areas. umm, yes. Of course. Otherwise, they can force themselves to the railroad hospitality and stay at the 'haunted' train station. <br /> <br /> So it's a very unusual situation that's terrible. <br /> This should be added to the LOST FILMS list! aargh !!
