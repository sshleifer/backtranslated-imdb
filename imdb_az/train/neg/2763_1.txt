I went to see the D-war with an error and with little expectations. The film did not respond to them. <br /> <br /> I do not believe in stories that extend my devotion; - but I'm expecting them to be complicated. <br /> <br /> This film was unable to breathe without peeling, all of which were integrated with the special effects that LOTR or even Godzilla's love. <br /> <br /> A mysterious warrior from Korea is a deus ex machina, a bold, metamorphosed Caucasian dealer, and the latest heroes of his latest heritage. Due to the excellent "paranormal division" of the Fed, a special agent from the FBI, which has been reinforced in ancient Korean folklore, has not been registered until this point. The lovers kissed the deserts that come from one place, "I have never said it happened". Long-lasting dead Koreans, a "reincarnated" couple who died as "passing through the stars". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mystic necklaces, robotic soldiers' faceless hordes (much to Peter Jackson's orcs owed), and each time you spend a warmer time, you can get something predatory, the dialogue is horrible, moving wooden and all the effects were honest, exhausting. Nevertheless, after finishing for me, he ended up finishing for me. Arirang! Instead, as Akira Kurosawa's "Ran" links My Way with karaoke, I understand that I do not compare to director Cynthia Kurosawa. In short, there is no collection of clich√©s and non-narrative tables that can hurt the interest of classical popular melodrama, but it should not be worthy of a ticket to any serious film or even a serious movie. I would recommend going straight to the video, skipping the cinemas completely, but I'm sure it's so valuable.
