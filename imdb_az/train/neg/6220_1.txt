This movie was a disappointment for me. For a long time I've been an admirer of Gram Parsons and I've seen a movie about them, so I went out and when I got out, I took the VHS movie and became ill because of what I saw. The film was not about his life, but after his death. I thought it would be a real movie about Grammar Life and Music, but they had to shoot a film in my life. I was tired of hearing about the deaths in his books and films, and wanted a movie about his life, not his death. I'm so glad. I wish people to look after his life and then to his death. One good thing about this movie was its soundtrack. This film is a disappointment for any Gram Parsons Fan.
