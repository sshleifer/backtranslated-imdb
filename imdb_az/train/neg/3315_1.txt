Bah. <br /> <br /> Tony Collette is always the perfect thing (as you are a true actress), and some effortless capture efforts. <br /> <br /> But he has only a few really comical lines, and it's enough for filmmaking, accounts, and editorials to go through a strange transition and chat with the camera. Almost all of the rundowns appear in the autopilot and almost all of the ages they announce are quite old (and in a little too young). The worse, it all speaks of "Austinians," so a specific falsetto sings with pleasure, so people are talking on Austrian day (I think Yosemite Sam). <br /> <br /> This is especially sad when we consider that Olivier and his cronies love the feelings of the lung, which leads to the death of "Fakespearan". <br /> <br /> All Gwyneth Paltrow. He played only one character in his films, and he stayed right for the first ten minutes, flipping through the whole range (smilingly), then repeating himself for the rest of the film, only for the film. <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry between himself and his admirers, and it is clear that he is not interested in separately. <br /> In short, there are very few reasons to meet Emma. Once you're packing anacronisms enough, this is not enough adaptation, you'll pack up a movie (ie, a bow or an appalingly thin lead that manages a period of accuracy), and you're also pretty superior as the "Clueless".
