When I write it, I'm actually watching this movie. . . The following comments are as follows: "If my development evidently proves my failure as a true, feature film maker." . <br /> <br /> But that's it. . . I thought this movie was still looking at me. . . Gently put, very, very overrated. Still more. <br /> <br /> This is really a really bad student film, made by a person with a very limited resources. . . <br /> <br /> I do not want to go through this movie in different ways, though. . . good . . I just can not get it (I remember, maybe, this is not the "genius piece of this creation", but the producer of the film). . . I had a lot of these estimates, because it was very promising because it was a hacker. . <br /> <br /> Sheikh. . .
