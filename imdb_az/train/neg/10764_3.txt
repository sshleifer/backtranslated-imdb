I will give the writer / director William Gove's credit to find someone to fund this nonsensical "thriller". Do not let the HBO receive a good argument, do not waste money on subscription, DVDs based on lid art and blurbs. One pedestrian, Dennis Hopper, and Richard Grieco, half the art line, are not bad, but do not add anything to their own pressure. Dialogue will leave you with a marvelous miracle; This is the worst stories. There is no tension, no tension, no fear, no fear, no empathy, no cataract, nothing. A few attractive and often naked women adorn this boredom, but this is definitely a movie that is best viewed as a trailer. I'm sorry for the person who lightens this thing. It is good only for day and night, zonal look. You have been warned.
