Oh, where should I start ... this movie was just terrible. The writing was bad, the move was bad, the special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! I was in a mood for a scary movie, but of course I did not! I'm not picky because I thought it would be fair enough. I watched a few awesome movies. In fact, seeing all the horror movies is my point, and it can be horrible. At one point in the film, I made a statement about "corn syrup blood", and especially in the film, Karo syrup (especially the corn syrup brand), the film had everything needed for a film of fear (blood, nudity, barefoot, stupid action) There was absolutely nothing to do really good. The writer should take a few lessons or simply refuse!
