This movie is the worst of the series. New Line can only look at the sale, although they all know the only reason they have more money because of the end of 3D. The 3-D was also good because it had more than 50 3D with red and blue lenses (anaglyph.). The truth was what people wanted to see. Besides, this movie was very bad! Bad stuff, bad characters, bad behavior, bad management. This film tries to push the camp factor to a point like the Looney Tunes episode. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it's not for the scary audience, because it's not dark and scary, funny or funny for funny crowds. <br /> <br /> They are still trying to play as camp, and they will probably not be able to escape what they want. <br /> <br /> I've long remembered that this series has just come to an end because it's so bad. This is one of the movies that helps to frighten the popularity and comes from a good and scary horror film, with a very few comedy and a convincing ride that the audience really wants to laugh.
