Ladies Man is a funny movie. There is not much thought behind, but what do you expect from the SNL movie? Tim Miedows and Will Ferrell were also very funny from many SNL films (ie Superstar or Roxbury one night). Kris Parnell was funny on the short scene (one of the fun movies). Apart from this, the remainder of the remains is only average and there is only support for Meadows. I have definitely seen funnier movies, but I have seen many. It's still not a deep film, but it's a good laugh. It was funnier like a sketch. But still, if you are looking for a very funny movie, I recommend this one. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
