STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday night ** Sunday night * Monday Marshall Lawson (Steven Seagal) France's re-establishment mission is a direct directive above three new youth strikes along with a non-follow-up. But before the night before the strike, everyone was found to be killed by an inhumane force seen by a funny killer. The French police are continuing to search for those who carry responsibility for their own investigation, only to reveal a military unit that deals with a deadly new drug, which changes only one person's DNA and causes new horror. <br /> Old coating. Bad title. Bad post production distortion. And bad trailer. Very bad movie. But I want to say that the offensive attack is pretty bad. As far as I know, it will not dislike me with other reviewers (possibly Steveday). But I think most of the criticisms are caused by all the bad news that happened before the film, not the previous quality. <br /> <br /> I believe it was not nearly as close as dubbing or rope. There was a dubbing there (it was called Martin Sheen, like a scalpel!) It was quite terrible and quite often, but I thought it was not used as a major part of the film. Although the plot was unobtrusively flowing despite all the confusion associated with the original film called the Harvester. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> "</ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; **
