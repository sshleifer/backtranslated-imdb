I get the same results when watching Sara Silverman. I love interesting, irreverent humor. But this woman, B-O-R-I-N-G, is frustrating and deserves to be washed. There is nothing absolutely nothing humorous about it. The unsuccessful way to deliver his lines is dead only during his arrival, because he is not only funny. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ font> I thought it was a compliment. One who says, "I will follow my poem or kill my dog" is actually convincing. I know he wants to be a comedienne. It just looks like rotten walnut shells. I just do not want to see my dog ​​around it.
