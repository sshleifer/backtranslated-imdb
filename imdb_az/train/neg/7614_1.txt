<br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films ever to be produced. <br /> <br /> 1. The most interesting part is the beginning, where the man is walking ... and walking and walking (spoiler). Only a 15-minute ride. How? <br /> <br /> 2. Do not say that there are many issues related to lighting and it is as if they were hit by night scenes at night. 3. Imagine that. <br /> <br /> I've found a public theater (Mexico) ... and then I took away those who turned away. <br /> Please do not rent this movie for the love of the holy thing. If you know that someone is the owner, apologize to them. The director must be punished by a war crimes tribunal so that it is publicly available.
