This movie is AWFUL! I will not even know how to get started, and I will not be able to describe the horrors. Blood is primarily flourescent and the actor is AWFUL! It was only a good day, the biker chick who survived the day. I have not seen this movie as exciting, and I do not see even one voice coming out of it. Developed by high school students.
