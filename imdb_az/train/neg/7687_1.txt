I started watching this movie with high expectations. But an hour later I refused this movie because I was asked many questions. <br /> <br /> Why did the Dutch bring a sculpture? Why is there an Italian comedian's presentation? Why did the farmer's wife save Dutchman? Why did not the farmer love his wife after the salvation of his wife? Why did the farmer's wife not save the Dutchman at a time when he would not be around the farmer? Why did those uneducated farmers understand Italy? Why did the Italian comedy know about Hollanders gold? Why did the villagers threw out of their property? This and many questions arose and seemed to be inaccessible to anyone. So I've completely lost the point of this movie, and I'm not in a story.
