Terrible use of scene pictures. All sustainability, either with terrible scripting or lethargic aspect. This foreign robot ... was jazz dancer? Also, one of the worst sound tracks I've heard (monologues usually drowned in music.) And ... where did you get the requisites? This vessel looks like a milk carton ... When I was 13, I had 8 mm special effects! <br /> <br /> I would recommend that any movie student watch this flick (5 minutes a minute) to learn how to make a movie. Or ... was the editor's defect? <br /> <br /> The scenario was really a good concept, because it's really bad ... it just did all the bad ways. (Forgive Malcom, you should have sent a "stunt pair") a very good player for such a sad bomb.)
