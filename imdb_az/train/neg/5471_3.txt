Typical Thrombasket, this ugly 80s flick, along with the "Toxic Avenger" one year ago, is one of the "spectacular" Lloyd Kaufman's famous production studio. If you ask me, "Toxic Avenger" is very good, but this demented jumping is also inconvenient; just make sure you leave the full brain capacity at the door. The events take place in a small town in Tromaville, proudly claiming to be the world's poisonous chemical capital, and they are certainly not a lie. Security measures at the local nuclear power plant are even the least likely (even Homer Simpson's inadequate) and toxic wastes entering nearby schools. The first compulsory victim is a stereotypic nerd that begins to spread green things out of the body, but his death is considered to be an accident because there are two microwave ovens at home! Oh, humanity! But shortly after, the nuclear leak is exposed to the wild vegetation of the school, and the thing really begins to deteriorate. After smokes with a party, the sweetest couples in the school produce nutritious worms, which are located in the basement. The "Nuke Classes High" class is a terrifying, horrible film structure, with dialogues that can damage your ears and makeup effects that give a new meaning to your words. If you melt your face, break down or divide it, it will definitely be a sight! Unlike the "Toxic Avenger," this film is exposed to a few really boring moments when something really does not matter, for example, Chrissy and Warren are trying to figure out what's wrong with their hormones. The raw humor is not as effective as the "Toxic Avenger", and it's too late to work. Continue only if you're a Troms fanatic.
