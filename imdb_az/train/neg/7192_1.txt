When I left this movie for 5 minutes, it was hyperventilation, shaking and pain. And not in the best way. The story is about a group of children who are always on the lookout for a psychiatrist who is a good idea. Psychologists do not like bare phone calls, because Williams kills her mother and her father in 2 minutes. Go back 15 years ago and what do you think? People who still call the phone. Yep, I thought, a terrible murder would have prevented them from doing so, but not. So about two hours later, and many screams, this film did not have a terrible taste in my mouth and brought a heavy argument for my life. Something similar to that, in the extreme production, the "moving" or Ruther Haurs is not worth the streets. I love horror movies, but this is the worst piece I've ever seen. Just do it.
