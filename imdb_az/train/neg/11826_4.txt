There is something that they are trying to do something different than seeing a good person doing something ... and ends mediocrely. <br /> <br /> Jordan was thinking of playing baseball, but it's also about Steve Martinez. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty good and directed, but the script is a stinker. Martin did a great job adapting a classic story to a comedy in Roxanne, but the effort to bring a Vikram drama to this modern area was put into a wall of flatness. If you want to see an old story renewed in a good way to rent "Great Probability".
