I felt that the movie was dry ... a very disappointing area ... something waiting for something waited and nothing was drying up like a bone ... spent a lot .. One of the worst films of Robins Williams month expectations will be on DVD because it looks like a model for movies that are not good for cinemas because it is leased before the end of the year ... What did I spend for my money? However, there were only 8 people looking at a new movie ... This was 9:50 on Friday night. I also felt that we needed something more to excite or awaken us. When they talked about the film, the sounds were too low, and you did not hear what they said.
