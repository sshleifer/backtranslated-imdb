If you really want to lose two hours of your life, do the following: <br /> 1) See the TV list. 2) Find the "White" movie. <br /> 3) Sit and watch when the "white men" arrive. <br /> <br /> And that's it. After having two hours of bad habits, exciting (or non-comical) movie references, you'll be wasting two hours of your life after having faced with something that you're experiencing in the nearest lowest-selling value, and you'll be surprised exactly. <br /> Why did you do it? It was a ridiculous idea to think that the film might actually be good. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you're old enough to remember Power Rangers, you can look at several familiar faces during the movie. Undoubtedly, to get rid of production costs, Saban (also called Power Rangers) decided to sprinkle the old monster dresses from your favorite toy-chicken warranty franchise throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I've seen a few old monsters from the episodes I have seen as a child, so we can at least say that it does not have a nostalgia value. <br /> <br /> But the actual force Rangers monsters go Power Rangers watch him. This is better than rubbish. (And he says something!)
