It was a frustration movie. The people seem to have no substance, the protagonist, Martin Cahil, has values ​​equal to zero, in fact epitomizes anyone with sleeze, including Jon Voight. I do not recommend this movie to everyone. Violence is an unpleasant thing, even though it is obvious. The film's filming is in black, at least I've seen this category fit. A disappointment.
