It's not a fright film, but a dull sex movie. A very bad film to avoid by any serious fan of fears. No area, terrible mood and boring music. You just know enough to watch the novel ... It's a shame that's happening in VHS or video, and there's not a lot of good movies. If you're looking at vampires, try Hammer Productions or Italian Gothic from Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti. These are masterpieces if you compare them with this trash. Rating = even more "1"! And believe me, I am alone with this idea.
