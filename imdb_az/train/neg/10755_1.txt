I do not think about the indisputable features of Asimov's very bad attitude towards this art. Do not lose product placements, Will Smith and thirst arguments. It's just ridiculous and painful to watch. Even the move was boring. <br /> <br /> It is a mixture of MTV's production values ​​and the inspiration of a totally unhealthy dialogue targeting very small children. <br /> <br /> The intelligence, minority report or less Dark City (by the same director). This really belongs to the bottom 100 lists. Really terrible.
