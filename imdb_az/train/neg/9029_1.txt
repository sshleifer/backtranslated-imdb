<br /> <br /> This movie assumes that every actor's talent is best described as "potatoes". <br /> <br /> Despite the opening of the 'Top Gun', there are plenty of stereotypes and inaccessible situations. <br /> <br /> There are many points in this movie, which, at one point, have united a television series that has not been dismantled. <br /> <br /> Quinn's Mexican drug lord was laughable and his 'hanging up' Quinn-Martin in 1970, Costner's character is a tree and gives no reason to believe that Mendez is in love with his wife. <br /> <br /> We were convinced that her husband was painful for companionship and that he would jump off his first body. <br /> <br /> Absolutely the best 'B' movie and great time for everyone.
