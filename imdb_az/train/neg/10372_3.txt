When I first saw the movie in the first 80s of the film, I received more comment at first glance. After the Tennion paintings, I was impressed by the care I had taken to produce such closely-made models. But for me, iron has been wasted, and their personalities have been softened by masks, and I have been in the darkness of photography in an unusual static sense. <br /> <br /> I still skip the chance to have a second look.
