This does not really blues justice. Probably the voyager prediction of talking about the outer space and the life stories of various blues musicians, and Blind Willie McTell (or Blind Lemon Jefferson!) May be the visually the most interesting part of this documentary. Black and white Beck and Shemeia Copeland, shot in the 20s, are the actors who perform the classic tunes in a very unusual way, describing the likes of a rifle with the same songs, which is a good device to show what is great for adults, but this is for compulsory review It's not a movie, it's a radio station, it's a hard thing to justify, and no one should be forced to ignore these bad things, which is a shame for the Wenders, Scorsese and Blues.
