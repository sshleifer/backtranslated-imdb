When the word of the amendment ended so much;) When the five girls were in a store to find their way, they left a friend when they left a car parked in the direction they were heading for. <br /> <br /> Because of this missing person while trying to get away, everything shouts, cries, shows violence. film shoots, filmmaking, "real" or "shocking" with a cheap camera are just as shameful and useless. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing to compare with Blair's Witch Style. <br /> <br /> We're sorry, but it's not terrible, it's just a painful painful excuse. <br /> <br /> Unhappy with the whole movie, it's screaming and crying, there's a headache, movie.
