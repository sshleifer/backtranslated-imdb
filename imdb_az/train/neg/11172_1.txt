The movie I Love 80, which was not popular in 2002, was a boring, ironic pop-culture blur of a show that was the first in a long line television programming program, showing the end of VH1. once the only true music channel was on TV! I lived up to VH1 spring or winter, but now forgot about who was in 2002, so the garbage did not appear in such a way for absolutely no reason. It's a very sad thing to say (I said that's what you said). Although I looked at the ads completely, I started looking at the first night I went. At least I'm honest, I can not say a bit surprised, because my expectations were at the top level. The highlight of this show that I saw during the first 5 minutes was less than every year of the 1980s and was of a culturally significant or non-popular (what I was expecting), but instead a more prominent platform is really comedy, with all the comic and comical comedians to show more of what they are thinking to be. * eyes. The reason why anyone does not hear any of these folks before appearing on this show is quite easy. Because I swear that all of them can feel my shout, and I swear that the so-called "humor" attempts are not very fearful and miserable. knot together with every single lined liner that they are following each other! Generally speaking, I have no problem saying that the least denominator I said is "I love 80" is a trash and one of the main reasons is not to follow VH1.
