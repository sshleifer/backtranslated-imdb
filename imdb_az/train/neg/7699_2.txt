I was expecting a comedy like "Big Mama" movies. The film was a strange blend of comedy, drama, and a love story. <br /> <br /> In this film there are three areas: First Madea and her guardian. Second, it covers a woman who deals with an abusive man. <br /> <br /> The third is a relationship between a mother and two children and one father. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are very few comedies in the film. The film has a lot of twisted messages. For example, Madea hits her child with a belt (comedic) to convince the child to be corrected. The child actually turns himself around. As you can see, it pays to beat children. <br /> <br /> There are areas where children are involved in aggression (with the consent of the mother). There are scenes with older men who transfer their young daughters. (Ogling occurs in a family reunion.) The film is thrown off the ground because you are always in balance. Is this a comedy, a love story, or a drama? In fact, it's nothing ... except the time and money loss.
