The words really can not describe how bad this film is. I thought Zandalee was bad, but at least there were good shots and sometimes good jaw strokes and stopped you from lying down. It just laughed! Horrible writing, poor direction, horrible action and what do you know? I do not think anything to give advice about something else, because it's not too long. If you have a 100-minute entertainment, enter yourself in the dentist's book and have some root canals - a more enjoyable and better value for money (given that you need!). By the way, I have to write a 10-line text to review - DO NOT FOLLOW THIS FILM. EVERYTHING!
