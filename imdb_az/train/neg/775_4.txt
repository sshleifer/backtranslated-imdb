John Candy. Is not it more? That's the main reason you see this movie. Many people do not understand how talented they are as an actor. It changes to a weak naked horny jerk. Only one simple (subtle) face change and we went. In this film there are many big bits and many really dumb bits. The best moments for me are how big a moment is the love of her and her genital organs when it comes to the scenes of KUNG FU U and how John (a trans) goes on stage and loves her lover. I'm sure you read that this sequence is really raw. This, however, is also very funny, basically, this is what John Candy works. Generally, the story is quite bare and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV graduates at Candy) are not given enough to make the film. Levy, while talking on his phone with his mother, has a great scene, especially at the end of a movie to shoot at the wedding (Roger Serling). Generally a good movie, if it is a difficult day, and you have to put your brain to silly. I give it to 10 to 4.
