The film starts slowly when we get to the movie, but after about 5 minutes we were caught in the mind and wondered what the movie was doing, I did not like this movie and we would not recommend it to anyone, the best part of the night was excitement and the lights were restarted, all of us broke down because we thought we could go home. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen, we've been bored with all the minds or minds, and most of the people in the movie actually took RAN ​​out of the doors because it was a lot of trash. I was surprised that no one had gone before. If you go and see, be sure to do something to deal with, do not go any further.
