Bad Actors, bad film shootings, mixed dialogue, simple heroes, but still bad place. Basically, an 11-year-old moronic criminals, who have been raped for being too little money, are given a blank check. Of course, he has enough technology and intelligence to buy a 11-year-old home, pulls over $ 1,000,000, and makes three bumling defects reminiscent of three stooges. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is an exciting, humble boy. He decides that when writing a blank article by a stranger, he may use the best of the situation. In other words, he goes to a bank, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> he writes a writer to a writer and walks a million dollars worth of miracles. Preston is able to reach an incredible speed by bicycle, because a man driving the Jaguar after Preston and his 10 speed, Preston, could not hold him while some cars splashed. <br /> Of course, every hockey adventure movie should be a hot hero. In this case, the hot hero is an FBI agent with a history of eleven years old Preston and another child who will be promising when he is 17. Nevertheless, the most noteworthy feature of this film is not its laying, or it's a flamboyant dialogue like, "I think it might think of a cat skin, another way is to wipe it off with a hose and then take a treasure." More precisely, in the whole film, the fact that the FBI does not perceive the censure of casual people. What I'm not telling is that Preston's "Macintosh" name is a masquerade of some entrepreneurship. Of course, the FBI finds it spectacular and sends her young hero after Preston. Her 11-year-old mind uses the lobsters to shake his face, then he treats hamburgers and ends with a cementy ridiculous scent. water jettison is out of place. Our heroine in this adventure does not succeed on the FBI's right to slide and slip behind the criminals, because they are never inexpensive, with a 1-dimensional driver, which does not provide a cheap third class, correcting the way to Preston Limousine. Generally: 1/10 it is extremely gracious for this movie. I'm just not looking at 4.4 / 10.
