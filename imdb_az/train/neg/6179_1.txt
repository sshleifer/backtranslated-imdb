This movie is the second worst movie I've ever seen (the first Ghost Rider). There is no plot, summit, conflict, or other essential detail to describe a story. This "movie" is basically an excuse for talking to Toby Keith. When I watched this movie I completely lost my time. The best part should be the ending loans. If I were Ebert or Roper, I cut my fingers and threw them into the manufacturers. Toby Keith, in their right mind, gave the chance to participate in an artistic film, perhaps with the same mental level. As a result, do not waste your time watching this movie, it can be the only thing you regret.
