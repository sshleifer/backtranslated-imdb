Like many other Bachchan fans, I was looking forward to the rebuilding of the Road. This is not a movie. Thankfully, they did not use the name "Sholay" in the movie title. Reconstruction of Ram Gopal is not a title. The camera business, places, suit, dance all over the place, and all the dialogue united to make the worst movie I've ever seen. You are surprised that actors have made money to earn money and that Ram Gopal has agreed to accept this film because of paying too much for the shooting. Only the non-paid actor, the ant, was the only one in the first movie. The role of the elderly was absolutely funny, did she need money to pay for Asha's wedding? Save your money, your mind, and your time, do not worry about this movie or DVD.
