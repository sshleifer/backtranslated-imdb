Cowboys can leave you a little wound in the saddle. Of course Johns is not one of the best films. Do not get me wrong, there is always some good spots with any John Wayne motion. And it has a fair share. However, it moves slowly over the entire picture and is not suitable for just the right desires. Bruce Dern still does a great job as a bad man. Roscoe Lee Brown is another brilliant place in the film. Children in the film were moderate, but could be thrown in a better way. It would be a good movie for filmmakers from eight to ten years. <br /> <br /> This is a good family move to watch with your kids. Just know that there are several scenes that young people can look at before you see this. But most children I know who saw the movie. Maybe children talk about their age.
