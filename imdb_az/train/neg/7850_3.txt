Alexandre Aja's revival of The Hills Eye Eyes has become one of the brightest spots of 2006. It was not only a classic horror film but also very good. So, about a year later, we are being treated for this remake later. When the original violinist Wes Craven returns with a producer and co scripted, this movie will not only be upgraded to original and remake-level levels. A group of military educators strive to test some scientists in the wilderness and find the first movie (at least some new ones) to find the profession of a mutant family. There is plenty to be here. What's bothering me about this movie is that it's not characterized. The followers will not curse what happened to one of these people because we did not join them. Even the mutants have some characteristics lately, and nothing happened at this time. Gore is so meaningless. For this to be interesting, this should be the case. Nothing here is interesting. What is recent in the movies with aggression scenes? Here we get someone else for the real reason. Hopefully this is still a set of hills that will not come to visit.
