At the Mar del Plata (Argentina), I went to see this movie (in fact I went to see Cutting Moments + 2 other family portraits of Douglas Buck) ... I could not just watch! After the first half of the cut period, I have to cover my eyes and have to look at them for a while. The dead end, my stomach was a kick and my head felt light. I just wanted to post a movie just a few minutes after the 2nd short (btw, of course, I'm not alone in the room). It was WAAAAY that was very frustrating and disgusting to me! I really regret that very courageous people who really love it. I can not just like these movies! The shock and bloody and horrific images I have seen have really crammed my head for two days! I also tried to analyze the story (my husband saw everything and told me that) and I just do not think it. I want to say that the amount of violence and things does not mean anything other than trying to shock. And that's not a good reason. There is nothing in this movie that I can say, "Well, at least x was good about something." But I think I will not understand such films.
