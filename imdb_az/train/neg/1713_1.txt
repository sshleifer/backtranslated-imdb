If ZOMBIE had not seen BLOODBATH, no. An event such as "Creating your own horror movie in one day" was an insult to the intelligence of any spectator who could not go beyond this anger. Mr. Sheets forgot a story, a plot, a proper dialogue, forgetting that some of the people needed BASIC acting talents and the emergence of the calculated lighting designer. Of course, it is mentioned among handmade workers and transferred to the worst equipment. Makeup effect, black mascara that is sprayed on men's heads for crustaceans and yoghurt, to simulate skin melting. This is a home movie and really bad thing. It's just fun to watch friends, family members and neighbors who just want to show for the shooting. I do not understand why a product is involved in any serious movie magazine or website - my husband's home movies are better and more interesting. Total loss of time, money and energy. Subsequently ZOMBIE BLOODBAT II is more of the same trash.
