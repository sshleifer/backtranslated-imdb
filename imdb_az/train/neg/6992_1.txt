The plot is in the midst of a world-wide chaos, because of a female nurse named Anna, because the zombies who eat meat begin to rise and seize the world and attack their lives. He runs to the streets and is rescued by a black police officer. So far so good! I usually enjoy the movies, but this part of the film is not worthy of fear. Even exciting, it's just ridiculous. "Flintstones" or "Puppet, Fran and Ollie" will give you more excitement. It's like watching a bunch of bloodless drunks who can not get into the mall with more drinks. Heroes who lock themselves to avoid eating at the hoodlums inside the shopping center are also not good. Though they are not drunk, they have the impression of being mentally disabled. Instead of safeguarding your money!
