I bought VHS in this movie for only two pounds, did I spend my money? Hey, I've got Adam's "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan Island" Louise, but hello! This third-degree production is a rehash of many other biker films; The cyclists were frustrated, the psychos go to a naked city, beat everyone and everything, and then they were defeated by a strange hero. The man sees the western part of the hero, but his dog is sharp and has lost his Batman form. Sorry, it's not just the same. Tina L. was really nervous and afraid of the entire show, but at least we know that Ginger is happening after being rescued from the island ... LOL! Bikers are a group, and those who talk about it should never have moved again or at least. Hell Fire Riders are Hell!
