I thought this movie would be a true football drama (Remember Titanic); But I felt as though I was participating in Ted Haggard's slogan about the competition. The only thing missing was a film titled at the end of the movie. In fact, it's more than just a funny excuse to use a slogan of a television slogan. At least with the slogan of the televisionist, the mass translator has not received quotes from the self-help pamphlet, but the Bible contains many words. The plot completely predicted the point that everyone who has enough attention has revealed the whole surface within the first 15 minutes of the film.
