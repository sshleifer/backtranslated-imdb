I'm gonna be honest. The only reason I'm watching this video on TV is that it is part of the 100th part of the IMDb. Now I am interested in whether or not half a half of my life is actually a "check" on the same list. Van Damme is the Luc Deveraux, who found himself in a major battle with Universal Soldiers after releasing a 'HAL' to protect himself from the main computer. And yes, after all the necessary explosions, the shooting and the end of the persecution stops. Combining with a terrific toy and a little winning structure, you can be sure that this is a nasty list of places. <br /> <br /> Only for those who like to watch the full list. 2/10.
