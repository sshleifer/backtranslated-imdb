I watched this movie a few years ago on the BBC. How? I do not know if it is so bad that Kidman, Baldwin and Pullman are now seeing their grief, I think I've been doing miracles with Woody Allen's cunning work and could play gusto by Baldwin part Leslie Nelson again. but the life was too short.For a few moments I watched, it was very hot for Nicole, but Baldwin did a good movie? "Pullman shares a" nice, but dim "character in the trade, and when F-word goes out of his mouth, a woman who claimed to have killed a murder mistakenly sits wrong.
