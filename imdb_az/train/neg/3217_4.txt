Open train. Invalid phone number. An extra cup of coffee. What is happening around you when you make a seemingly offensive one? <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" tells the story, as it relates to each other and the cause and effect of the world. Normal Parisian people group. <br /> <br /> His wife, an immigrant immigrant, classic pottery, an attractive grandmother, grandmother, a bored girl, an egoist roommate, and a homeless man. <br /> <br /> <p> Audrey Tautou acts as a previous hero (he is on the camera like everyone else and opens and closes the movie) and the normal girl who can not find the right rhythm in her life <br /> <br> In the beginning, he learns what a stranger holds for his horoscope on the train. What happens to him during the day? Is this forecast realistic? The concept is good, but talking to the story is very frustrating. An after-incident relationship is weak. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Audrey Tautou, there is a better expression in 15 seconds of the Liberty Mutual insurance business, if someone sees a good deal and goes over to another. Of course, you can sacrifice the time for this movie, but if you are a good producer and director, you will realize that this story is wondering and wondering.
