Like many Steven Seagal fans, I know well that I do not expect a movie princess every time, but I expect the movie to have at least one sort of budget. I know that I'm afraid of dubbing the main problem I'm watching, and that's what I need to do in some of the movies, and I accept it, but it's a magic that's been discovered when she's discovered with a completely different actor's voice. Also, in a gang of top-secret laboratory seems to be built without any care, such as a massive crack in a slippery glass. I'm really disappointed with this movie and will only finish Stevens before buying / renting the next draft movie. The story of this movie I was thinking of watching a fantastic movie, or some parts seemed to be alien, but I did not explain exactly what was happening, so I found it very strange.
