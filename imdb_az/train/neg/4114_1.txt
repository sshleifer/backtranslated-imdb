There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? WHY THESE THINGS THAT ARE ELDERLY? The gradation is absurd. Acting is a dimension. There are many special effects. The film is an eternal weapon battle between some of Hollywood's most terrifying shoots. But then, if it were a good shot, everyone would have died in the first five minutes, and there would be no movies. It did not happen so badly. When I had to overcome it several times, I could see how bad it was. (SPOILER?) The last line is glad to have all the dopey's awful foolishness. Anxiety scenario. The second feature status at the third speed is not worth even off season. Apart from the general fear of the film, I think deeply about the impact on the young audience. The Americans look like this, and then they are amazed at what happened like Columbine. This is really banal movie on the Brobdingnagian scale!
