This rarity, which I rarely encounter with a movie, is that destructive and irritating. Surely, it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The plot is ridiculous when it is not neglected without being embarrassed and brilliant. Why did Domino become such a bad contrast to fat? His golden fish was a child when he was a child and this "traumatic" event was an excitement and he hated everyone. When the dialogue is not clich√©d or banal, it is surrounded by such funny lines as: "There are three types of world: rich ... poor ... and everyone". At one point, there is a man on the back of a bus with a number of blacksmith hunters. Due to a confusing mobile phone call, instead of rolling his arm and reading the number, he turns his gun off with a shotgun. At another point, bountiful hunters take bombs at a meeting organized by the mafia and threaten to build a bomb until the mafia leaves them. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley would not be so easy to go into the ongoing meeting. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley was disassociated and disfigured. Mickey Rourke can save some of this confusion. <br /> <br /> I used to think that Tony Scott was a True Romance in one of his previous films, but all that I had to think of when making it difficult had to be a complete fool.
