I do not see enough television games to figure out the involvement of the POWERFUL SEND, but I'm punishing a thoughtless audience. Of course, a quiz show offers a great deal of money to competitors to answer a few simple questions. However, quiz elements only play a small part in the trial. For example, before answering a question, a participant chooses to ask what question should be asked randomly between "A", "B" or "C". Does it serve another purpose to slow down the game? It would be too quick to start with "A". The competitions can be questionable, but should answer one of the three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering a question, the answer to the competition is "to find a tactic to delay". The next task of the competition is to open a card showing how many questions a woman's dancer has been asking in the cage. The correct answer adds the dollar's figure to the sum of the contest; leads to the same amount of incorrect answer. This one-time step actually has some entertainment value because it allows viewers to look closely at the streets and equally beautiful dancers. However, the unlucky selection of the "killer card" to the contestant reminded the game to end immediately. This, of course, makes the contest swaddle and causes delays as it is thought by hundreds of thousands of participants in the nervous breakdown. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the main audience of the show is undoubtedly an unexpected disaster. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the whole process is slowly dwindling by the host, William Shatner, and many empty banners between the contestant. Sometimes routine by caged dancers. <br /> <br /> A typical 30-minute episode of YEOPARDY is often perceived because these delays can often cause the audience to forget what the true question is when the correct answer is answered. Most of the 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of my follow-up SMTM consisted of only six questions (most of which were related to other TV shows). No one in his right mind did not want to watch this show, because he enjoyed answering the questions in the house. <br /> <br /> Certainly, <br /> <br /> Do not lose everything in just one shot to see how a competition responds to a chance to earn a million dollars. <br /> <br /> C. Look at beautiful young women who practice sexual dance routines. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG>
