This movie did not lose half an hour of my time. I usually like the cheap horror monster type movies, but this movie was a disappointment. The main flaw is not to tell the creatures. When he entered the house, he explained to them that they could afford them. He did not say anything about them except the killing of his parents, and he did not say how he could save them ... I can not say that the truth has no clue and reason, it just survives and nourishes living things after its near death. It would be possible to leave after the "exciting incident".
