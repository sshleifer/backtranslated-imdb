I love special effects and I am witnessing new technologies that science fiction has made. The special effects of this movie are very good. I've seen most of this movie because it has been published in HBO for the last few months. I must admit that I missed a few scenes, but I usually shoot movies and have seen scenes several times. But every time I see 'Empty Man', I almost feel depressed as "movie noir". Why I'm not sure; Perhaps I do not want Kevin Bacon to be bad, so it's disappointing. But I think he's just a witness of a miserable evil. Nevertheless, I can recommend this movie excitement (though some parts move slowly), but I do not advise youngsters under the age of 14 (perhaps they are mature).
