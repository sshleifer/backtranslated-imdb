I'm an admirer of arty movies, but unfortunately, I have to make this movie an ambitious act. Based on an exciting structure, we are slowly developing, experiencing, telling, and working to develop an area that is not available. Even after bad movies, I'm learning something, or am pleased with some aspects, but nothing to evaluate. The release was not uninteresting, but the film begins and ends. Though your imagination was totally boring, the act was okay. Hero is in a very big gap to achieve such a bold goal. Open. I usually use non-formal movies, but the lack of formula should not be mixed with zero content.
