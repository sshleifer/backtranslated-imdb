This movie really has a good story kernel. Men and women of the Coast Guard, especially the heroes and legends of the North Pacific Ocean. This film covered a good story with two "romantic" sparks like three ends (do not like), a series of unnecessary and meaningless bar battles and dead dead shootings. Firefighting scenes are great - although the computer is a generation of hockey and scenarios are pretty unusual, it's bare and desperate on the back. Costner is good - especially in hand (see). Ashton Kutcher was not afraid, he was not. The main female characters are one-dimensional. The best woman is one of the Coast Guard sailors at the firefighting center and is about a two-minute camera in the entire movie. It could have been a perfect movie - and Costner needs someone!
