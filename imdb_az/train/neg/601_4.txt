!!!!! COURSE ON USER !!!!! I'm sure that this project started as a screenwriter to escape clichés in fright film: Hero hero - Bad things to do with drugs - Heorine disappeared and checked the evil - Check the hero To see the restoration of mourning we have seen that the heroine escaping behind the heroine - Unfortunately, someone has sent this clipboard to a movie studio instead of using it for the classifier list. Dear my darling, notwithstanding the regularity of London traffic here just like the clichés here. In fact, there are many clichés and somebody has ever seen moments before what the eponymous reptile is or how much it can not thoroughly perceive the underground people. I believe it is the result of some human experience, and maybe that night decided to take revenge on humanity, but it's unclear because all this is meaningless. I'm very skeptical of not being completely negative. producers think that this year they will do a movie to sweep Oscars and there is always a market for horror films. In the same way, I suspect that there is a lot of product development and DVD market. Since 1972, I will say that it is better than DEATH LINE. This shows that the fake firefighter hid in the London Underground. Only when you think that all the clichés are used in this movie, another cliché comes to remove his ugly head
