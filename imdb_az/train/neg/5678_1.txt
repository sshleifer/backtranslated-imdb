This is not the worst movie I ever saw. (I could not follow all the ways). Compassionate and simply for this purpose only the violent violence and the ridiculous storyline are added to unbreakable and inadequate shooting. Sick. And it's just for those who like manic bone. After killing several hundred men, women and children, the Seed was captured after killing several police officers who finally got a clue as it was in his place. He gave death to the electric chair and died miraculously! He is alive alive and leads his way, and prostrate in revenge against those who extinguish it and extinguish the passages. Certainly more horrible crimes are happening ...
