The original Lensman series series is a genre classic. There is a certain adventure with some items (here and there), and I always wondered why Hollywood did not shoot this movie because it's one of my favorite: mass explosions, super weapons, uber-heroes, heroine girls, aliens (major CGI potentials) good and bad in clean form and so on. Instead, (and I remember that Japanese-o-phillips and anime lover), we're taking sad movies into it, the mix of the story, Star-Wars, and the second thing to the 'Thundercats' level. Kimball Kinnison, the Galactic Patrol officer, and Lensman's second child, see a small child's picture (and so on). I do not understand why experts understood it, because they had a clear story and earned more money (FAR!). It does not matter.
