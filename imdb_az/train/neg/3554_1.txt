I leased it in the 80's and honestly do not remember anything special about the movie - the worst movie I've ever seen. It was not "it was so fun, it was funny". This is not one of the films "It was so strange that it leaves a bad feeling." Even this was "what was heck?" movies. I can not remember the performance of the players, but it was shot poorly, the story was divided and there was no certain style. <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: some of them became apparent. <br /> <br /> <strong> No media outlets. <br /> <br /> I really did not want to comment on this "piece", but I would have to warn anyone who appreciates the film to overcome this movie.
