Wargames: The Dead Code is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, but I can easily say that it is the most transparent film I've ever seen. Once a plotter did not set me up to 10 + minutes without me. The film is sensitive to anything and there is no intelligence behind the scenes. The intent of each line of spoken or written was that it was not possible to "enter" into the film. <br /> <br /> I was laughing in my crafty scheme and tried to get the audience back.
