I'm my personal mission to go after those responsible for this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a p.o. but it was not enough, but the coating art sold me. I bought a rental company to pay for me. I gave Better makeup effects on Halloween. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will not spend more time with full details, but the main character of the film was born and raised in Alabama - but there is a German accent! This is not insulting.
