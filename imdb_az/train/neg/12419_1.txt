<br /> <br /> This film is less than a cultural story about a boy's life in the kibbutz, but is usually deliberately spreading the life of the kibbutz. In the first two minutes of the film, milkman, who is responsible for cows, is forced to hit one of his calves. And in terms of characters that are typically called "kibbutznikim", they are not so low. In addition to the two main characters, a woman and her smaller son of a clinical hell, everyone in kibbutz is a bad cartoon. <br /> <br /> The arrest is related to the fact that Kibbutz, as a kind of religion, gradually drags his mother and son into desperation and follows inevitably. There is no happiness, joy, no laughter in this kibbutz. Each character / situation is misogyny, hypocrisy, violence, cultism, repression and so on. It's a different terrifying human definition. For example, the hero is a stunning charming Europe that sees a 12-year-old boy. his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth whose "Jewish" physical appearance and terrifying personality are. He thinks more about tearing out foreign volunteers rather than the health of a dead mother. It sees volunteers as trash. When he does not want his younger brother to visit his dead mother, who has not been seen for a long time by his military service, he orders. "Linda, take a shower and cum in two minutes." <br /> <br /> Does this movie have a "good" character? a European foreigner playing his mother's wife. When the animal rapper tries to hit the mother's son, the boy is friendly, breaking the armor's arm and defending him. He was generally removed from the kibbutz for "violent" behavior against one of the members of the kibbutz. More hypocrisy: The fraudulent annoying French woman playing with a schoolmate gives the sex of a French woman before the age of 18, or gives her an exciting account of the propagandist, but it's really stupid. Certainly, of course, he closes Kibbutz's head in the spleen and then closes the little boy's mother in a time when mental health becomes worse. <br /> <br /> The film describes kibbutzes as a kind of religion. The children are back in the middle of the night and lie in the fields controlled by the kibbutz elders. Although her mother really does come as everyone chooses, she really can not make a kibbutz "run". The boy's father is a mystery, but you can be sure that kibbutz "took him away" and his surviving parents are a double heart, unhappy character who gives birth to his mother and son. <br /> <br /> This movie has the essence. One-dimensional characters, dramatization, dry speeches, and an insidious message trying to draw yourself to the audience? that the kibbutz life was bad, furious, and even fatal to "inappropriate" people. Sorry for the guy who made this movie? Undoubtedly, a kibbutz was a bad experience. But I feel that the kibbutz takes on a few core truths and turns into big atomic stereotype bombs.
