Is there anything else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, then look at Phat Beach. Nevertheless, do not rent it and do not buy it. This would be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I watched it on television and laugh at certain points. I'm not laughing too much and I'm not laughing too much. However, I had the subtle jokes and comments that I laughed. If you're looking for a very funny "hood" movie, see it on Friday. If you're looking for a powerful emotional movie (something that's taken from this movie) look at something like ring dreams or something like Jason Lyric. If you search for some good black "predators," watch Dominique Simone's pornography because nudity is almost non-existent in this film. But if there is nothing better, if you have these cables, go ahead and watch. <br /> <br /> 10 *** 3 out of 10
