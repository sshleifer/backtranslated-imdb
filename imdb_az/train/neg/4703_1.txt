"Show me some boobies!" is not ridiculous, and of course, if you understand where I am, it's not a cartoon channel. I do not want my six and seven year old daughters to think or hear. I was sorry that Nick would be very unhappy and then we act like stupid adults as little fools. I know it's gonna be humorous, but K. and grade 1 have cute little innocent girls, so it's impossible to see them there. When I see, I must explain how disappointed I am. My daughters will not watch it. I do not want to avoid Nick, but at this point there is no heart, but if Nick looks the same, I need it.
