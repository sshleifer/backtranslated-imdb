I think this is one of the worst animated films ever I've ever seen. I would recommend this animated movie for those under 5 years of age. They used it as a show in the 4th and 5th classes, and I was watching it when nothing else happened. Now I am 5 years old and it would be better than watching my homework. The cartoon was used to be a little funny, but it was not enough to make me laugh. Now, we have not evaluated the fact that the show witch is older than I am interested in. I started watching Doctor Kim (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in what I'm dealing with, so I'm not interested in a 5 year old cartoon. This animated film was only 6 seasons, because it was canceled because of the small number of viewers, but some people were disappointed with the writer's opinion, and most of them had at least eight seasons.
