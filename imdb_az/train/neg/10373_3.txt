This is just one of my favorite movies. Charlotte Henry is good - in fact, all the actors were good. The problem was in script, dialog, direction, editing, set, and special effects. It was given, it was 1933, but it really wounded. Part of the problem is Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognized (weeping for a notable encounter). The film just gathered together with the merger. Most of Lewis Carrol's soul, humor, and sustainability are missing. What a pity! This is a great book. I suggest Disney 1951.
