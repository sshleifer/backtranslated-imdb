It was interesting to see how accurately the texts were on the geek buzz, but very loyal in the corporate world. The Department of Justice, if it did not do such na√Øve things to win, would have kept most of the big giant giants. The real corporate world is more subtle and interesting, but every bit bad. I doubt that the real corpse will really kill it directly; Even in these days, the mode is more relevant. In the real world, nicotine, contamination, additives, poison, etc. They kill people with it. Some garage geeks need to develop this movie and do not know the difference in studios. They just wanted something in Microsoft's antitrust case.
