I love the show that has grown up with millions of others. <br /> <br /> I shaded this movie, I think at least a little shiny and entertaining. <br /> <br /> WRONG! I just have to worry that at the end, Charlie's Angels were really boring? I do not remember it. But this movie can be as bad as those films, but it is less like the excitement and demonstration of that era. I had seen it all, though the negatives were invisible. But it was very gentle that I did not blame any executors, especially women who perform the angels, just like them. The film was not just interesting. Every angel tried to make a "character". (An angel feisty, one for "good girl", one for his spouse ....), all characters describe a key characteristic that identifies them and have been depicted with a small depth beyond the stereotypes. The excitement of the show was missing and dialogue was a dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's not a small thing. Not the worst TV movie ever. But missible.
