Previously, there were a few flaws in this film. The main character played by Hayden Christensen is a rich young boy who has inherited his father's great wealth and power and struggles to fill his father's shoes and cut the apron strings home (and co-play), very close. It also has a heart condition and a problem with waiting for the organ donor registry. Your first instinct is of little importance then, in order not to become a significant factor like the friendship friendship (Terrence Howard) and middle class girlfriend (Jessica Alba). Undefeated story lines, but not bad enough to destroy the movie. Only the real "vote or what!" An, Lena was the name of Ol's character. The woman who named Lilith ... delicate! <br /> <br /> Surgical scenes are never censored. Thank you so much that there are no people who can scare the surgical scene. The horror of awakening during anesthesia was good at first. Kristensen, you are in a sensual affliction as you call the chest cuts and ribs. <br /> <br /> In the event that one of the few unsuccessful to be awakened during anesthesia, the mood has come to an end, and he is lucky enough to learn that his surgical team plans to kill him. <br /> <br /> But the big bumps are predictable, and as long as we miss the movie, we are looking forward to the composition and memories of the smaller characters we have. <br /> <br /> There are two more folds in the end involving his relationship with his mother. One is an effective gesture by Olin, which comes as unimpressive for poor writings. <br /> <br /> A mystery about the family's past seemed strange and meaningless. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> Anesthesia warning drama has lost drama in the well-written consonant at the beginning. Taking the entire movie, there's a final attempt to bring a decent fall back.
