While watching a movie, I know it's only a movie, but I still want to make sure that I'm as much as possible. I think it's a movie that we're crying, screaming, laughing, or reacting in a different way, with feelings like audience members, although it's deeply down. I do not want the movie to be a movie for me, and I will not be able to get into the taste of the film, regardless of the quality of the film. The film director often chose to use the polygon camera shots at the same time. Maybe it's just me, but it's something that terrifies me and terribly disturbs me. Also, while reading at the bottom of the screen, a continuous banner can be opened: 'Caution: This is just a movie. Do Not Motivate or Encourage Yourself. ' If I do not want the 'picture-in-picture' I want to remove it from the TV, but I never enjoyed a movie I wanted.
