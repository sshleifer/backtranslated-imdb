The first one was the best. Secondly, the conversation was terrible. Although the story was not very bad (in fact, all story lines are good and bad). During the film, I dosed several times. I know that Jackie Chan's a great martial arts experience, but not a good actor at Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker was not good too. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, terrifying toy (But this is based on his script). All the characters were good. But what I love at Rush Hour 2 is always action and less sex scenes. I know that Jackie Chan does not do good for her.
