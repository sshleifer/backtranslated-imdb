Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in English, and this script should be read. I hate the writers when using Spark notes for a novel. <br /> <br /> If you read this movie it is indispensable. <br /> <br /> All the "red rooms" have played and played so why are they worried about putting it down? The book is intended for the "red room" for the World Story and the rest of Jenny's life. Helen Burns is being treated so badly in the film that I'm sure he is happy to die and get up early. It is one of the most attractive characters in the book and it is not a red one. <br /> <br /> Be kind to yourself, and miss this movie and talk to Charlotte Bronte with chess.
