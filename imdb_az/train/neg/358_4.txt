Paul Armstrong, a Scottish, liberal, professor in Harvard, is a hired man in the case of Bobby Earl, a young black man from Florida, known for his opposition to the death penalty. rape and murdered Joanie Shriver, 11-year-old white girl. Earl argues that the protest against the crime was forcibly taken by a sadist police officer and a serial killer, Blair Sullivan, who is now a real killer and a few other offenders. Armstrong, Sallivani, visited the attack on the death column, saving Earl from the electrical chair, hoping to convince Joanie to confess. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's good. Sullivan admits and Earl is released from prison when the court of appeal reverses his sentence. Since this development takes place less than half the time, the alarm will begin to sound in the mind of the audience. "Attention! Great plans ahead!" And so. Expected twist will soon perform. Earl, he transpires, is guilty of genuinely acquitted, and possibly a few other guilty, but a diabolical plan limit combined with Sullivan to ensure freedom; If Earl kills his family, Sullivan will confess with Joanie's murder. (It just does not exactly describe Sullivan's parents wanting to die). Armstrong now finds that he is in danger of being saved by his life; Earl was accused of being a lawyer, Armstrong's husband, who served as a judicial advisor in the previous case, accusing Earl of raping. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just Cause, Hollywood, The first half is owed to open films, such as "Smoking in the Smoke" and "Murdering a Mocking Mouse"; The only difference is that the sheriff who confessed to Bobby Earl was black, in the previous films he would be white. (Police brutality is now an equal opportunity activity). The center twist in this area has been taken from the Costa Rican Music Bureau, though it does not happen until the end of the movie. A financier, a financier of a lawyer, spouse and younger daughter, is in danger of being an open plagiarism of two versions of the "Cape Fear" in the American winters. Sullivan is a direct imitation of Robert De Niro's character in the Scorsese version of Cape Fear four years before describing Ed Harris as a religious place referring to the Bible. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The problem with this style of filmmaking is that the resulting films are less distinctive than the ones inspired by them, Just Cause is a film that cannibalised to do this, but Harris is usually a talented player, but this is one of his weakest performances because he is not playing a game like playing Max Cady playing with Niro Blair Underwood, early stage scenes Bobby Earl allegedly as innocent young man, but Bobby Earl is unconvincing, as rogue psychopath.Which Armstrong and Laurence Fishburne, like Sean Connery, are Black Sheriff, but how good is it to save the movie? (Connery and Harris are talking to each other in a better movie move together next year, The Rock). <br /> <br /> There's another problem with Just Cause. The first half of the film is a standard liberal "issue" movie, a death penalty, anti-racist and heavy-minded police criticism. Secondly, all the criminals are badly whispered, that the only way to fight them is to bring them to the chair, and that liberal lawyers think it's a useful foolishness of society. offending brotherhood and beaten police officers of the suspects should be described as a hero. Cinematographers did not know that the twisted-up twist in the middle of the film had a repercussion of its political position (or, undesirable), or they were aware of the problem they did not consider. Accordingly, a particular area was considered more important than a political sequence. 4/10
