This movie is like many things like Cinema Hostel, excepting * BAD * acting and not too long. There are elements of Gore, but you really do not feel anything for the characters, the violence is not very effective. Some of the parts are strange ... like someone burned a snake in his throat. What is this? Should this be terrible or protected? It's just stupid. As for torture, there is really nothing (except for the boy who initially hit him). The main bad guy keeps saying, "Kill them slowly", but the butcher still kills them very quickly. Deaths are relatively quick. Yes, I watched the "unrated" version. That is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not all good. If you skip someone, you will not miss anything.
