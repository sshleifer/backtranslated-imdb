I grew up watching the original television series in the 1960s, and there is something I can tell you right now, there is no comparison. This film was totally funny with a flying suit that was alive. A martian of different shapes. Special effects similar to something that a child can create. Instead, in fact, the characters were developed and the audience developed a feeling for Tim and Uncle Martin. When Raydale Walston eventually came to an end, the only recording in this movie was, in fact, one. She was wearing black glasses for 30 years and viewed the planet as a respect for the television series. But the real American Martin could not even save Turkey.
