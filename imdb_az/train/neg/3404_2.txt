I'm going to bag this movie for a great number of technical philosophy, and I'll take two days to describe everything is not even remotely available. <br /> <br /> In some cases, given all of this, I still have the same accusation as the "real" astronaut, all the hooliganes, gastric nausea, frightening, exaggerated, "crew" was. they put all kinds of foolish nonsense in front of everything. <br /> <br /> NASA has left this trash, surprising that many people will receive a lot of information about something very important to them. Irritate yourself if you have not yet seen it. Follow Apollo 13 again. At least this one tried to be real.
