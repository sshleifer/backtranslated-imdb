I read all the comments of this movie. I'm a great admirer of Dalai Lama. So, I've read a book based on this movie. The film is an ugly and effortless act of true truth. <br /> <br /> I do not criticize small details or events for dramatic purposes; <br /> <br /> Not a documentary. But the script changes the effect, the reaction, changes the truths and changes in each of the main characters. <br /> <br /> The long-running relationship between the Dalai Lama and the young Dalai Lama varies greatly. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is wrong - for a nice photography, for Harra's change from a ridiculous competition for a Tibetan woman (who denies Tibetan culture), gifted to Harra's music box. I understand that Potala's palace has been smuggling out of Tibet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> /> movie star is sad
