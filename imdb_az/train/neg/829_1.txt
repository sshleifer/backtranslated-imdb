I've heard about this movie and knew that you knew it well. But I started watching the movie (in my movie channel) and was interested. This can be a great black confusion in the press today's morals. The small description of each opponent was good. It builds something that I do not want to miss. But when the show starts, everything is incredible, cheap, and very stupid. The writer should add something that people can think about. <br /> <br /> This is extremely bad. Even if I had hoped for the movie.
