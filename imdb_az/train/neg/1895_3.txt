THE BEGINNING OF THE FUTURE INFLUENCES IN 1975 is a beautiful and beautiful film to watch. This battle is not particularly about inspiration or the fact that the film does not give any meaning. Because the film is very bad, because a camp is classic - bad, but pretty bad. The film recognizes a blind guy with a device such as Frisbee on a chain of punches. To anyone who thinks that physics is impossible or that a film is a 12-meter-long papier-mache weapon, or a person's blind! <br /> <br /> I wanted to see FILT FILIPY GUILLOTINS, who loved me for this movie. It was a ball to watch from beginning to end, and my most favorite "bad" (1977), although it was not just a little later, but a bit less direct, but it was indifferent to the movie being watched or watched not left. Of course, this is fun fun, but it is close to the Magic Guillotine's MASTER, which is worth the fun. Like the original film, there are these strange flying devices that drown their heads, but they are quite different - with circular knives and almost with their own minds. There are no blind guys, but instead there are a group of baddies who have no depth and the audience understands exactly what happened in this English-language version because it's incomprehensible. But, at the same time, some of the movements of martial arts are very good. <br /> <br /> Although most of Bruce Lee's or Sonny Chiba's films do not fit in, this move is worth the effort, despite the ridiculous and often tricky tricks. <br /> <br /> In general, fans of this martial art are the most, many, many flaws in the film, and others will probably hysterically or laugh instead of enjoying the movie. BUT, however, is not as close as the head of the picnic, the most important of which is never funny or laughable. Very bad.
