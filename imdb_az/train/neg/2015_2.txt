I really expected this program for two reasons; I like Jan Michael Vincent and I'm an aviation boat and has a serious love relationship with helicopters. I do not like this program, because it is incredibly fantasy. A few years ago, Westland Lynx recorded world speeds for 249-mile helicopters. The only helicopter that was the faster that was the experienced Lockheed AH56A in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> In fact, no helicopter can handle more than 275 flights. Because the principle of rotation is the wing flight. And the "actor" Bell 222 describing Airwolf is not too fast with even the helicopter standards. <br /> <br /> During this time, a film called Blue Thunder was more realistic.
