About black comedian Lance Barton who hit a truck down the road. He goes to heaven and gets another body. Lance takes Charles Wellington's corpse, a white man. So, there are several things in Lans Charles's body. The film has a few laughs, but it's not something special. If you're an admirer of Chris Rock, it's a good movie. In 2005, animation comedy Madagascar is better. It's a good movie, but Chris Rock has done better than that. Only about 4 times will laugh at the whole movie. And this is really funny-loud silent. You will laugh and giggle, but you will not be able to roll down without laughing.
