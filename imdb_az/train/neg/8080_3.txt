There was so much great hope for this movie because it's Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. However, these hopes fell to the ground in the first 20 minutes. Palance was ridiculous. Heston's move or the beauty of Annabel Schofield (or shorter nuclear scenes) could not save this movie. Some cosmos effects were good, but some were cheese. The area was ridiculous. Even the fantastic fans must pass to any one of them. Class F
