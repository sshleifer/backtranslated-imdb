I must admit that I love the first half of the sweets. It looked good, the player was better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. Beautiful Hollywood movie. But nobody has ever said so far (at least in the last 20 comments), when it comes to scenes in the courtroom and followed the plan to rescue Brat Pittin's character, two of his friends accused of killing. This film has offended my intelligence. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> If these two boys were with her, do not talk Amnesia? If you were a judge and jury member, would you believe it? <br /> <br /> Is it wise to give up the motives of those who are sad? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but in the end, this story is too weak and it bother me. This movie had great potential. 4/10
