Pokemon movie was a terrible film. Unlike the first, this is not a good movie. The graphs were good, but the story was flat and no real drama was set up. First, the interaction between the characters was effective. It was a bad idea to remove the brock and add tracey. Tracey really does say or do not, and unlike Brock, it offers no comic comfort. It's just as good points to get really jelous on the ash and get his entertaining early brooding look at his girlfriend is fun. in general, this movie is not worth the rent and the previous short film did nothing for me or my spouse. and we think ourselves pokemon fans.oh, maybe next one will be better
