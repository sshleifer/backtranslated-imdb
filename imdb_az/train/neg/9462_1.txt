Inappropriate. The PG rating of this movie is another big mistake by MPAA. Whale Rider takes a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Do not be fooled by parents, this is a big mistake taking an elementary school child. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I am very happy that humor is not suitable for children, but also completely blue and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> But on the one hand, it's still a terrible film. Casting and overall look of the movie are just savings gurus. Though Preston is pretty nice for a role, it's great for Kelly Preston and Alice Baldwin, who is always unpleasant (or hating it), in their role as well. Children are conditioned by actors and especially with Dakota Fanning. <br /> <br /> It is the only human aspect of the film that lets me shoot and shoot movies on the screen. <br /> <br /> Does this movie have a big chat cat? Mike Myers is completely miserable. I have never liked it as a voice of Shrek, and now it's really a must-have now that Myers's children's films are never allowed. <br /> <br /> Cats' illustrations are slightly sounded by Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. <br /> <br /> The cat did not come in the end, it was left, but it's just <br /> <br /> The cats in the cats can be the worst children movie.
