I can say that this movie is awakening after about 15 miles from Texas, and after helping Gilley. Most Texans do not live like this movie. The area is weak and fake habits are entertaining and reinforces the stereotypical appearance of all Texans as to drink beer, tall, rednecks. This terrifying Texas counterfeits kill me for me. True, most Texans have a certain Texas twang, but these people enjoy it. You will not be able to get Texas's accents from New Jersey and Ohio. This does not just work. John Travolta remained in the disco or in the '50s. Debra Winger was more convincing than Texan, as Wonder Girl.
