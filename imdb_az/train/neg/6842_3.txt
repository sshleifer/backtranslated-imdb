"Paula, I'm a bitch, but I'm never a scarecrow!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stacey Walker This time, she is a real player who brings her beloved, her colleagues and even her lesbian room into the bedroom of Paula, but then cries for "aggression" and becomes a police challenge! <br /> <br /> The schizophrenic identity that confirms this document is perhaps a little interesting, but this story is eventually a recurring single-case job. At least, it is worth the wait for those who will continue until this end.
