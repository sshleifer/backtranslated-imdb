Perhaps there are endless scenes of people who do not have this dubbing, or maybe crying, drowning or otherwise, but Europa '51 was one of the most developed (and therefore annoying) movies I've ever seen. Since the movie is very busy with a terrible baby (Sandro Franchina) of Inggris Bergman's son, the movie starts with kindness. Mummy and Dad (Mild Alexander Knox) ​​invite their guests to dinner, trying to kill himself, creating a life that transforms a series of events that make Bergman a little bit of compassion for the poor and needy. Rapidly accelerated by the editor of the Communist newspaper Andrea (Ettore Giannini), she soon spent more time running away from her troublesome situation. Bergman plays the sacred role of geometry, reflecting his role as Joan of Arc in 1948, and filming Rossellini's work for a beautiful work and the best effect. Unfortunately, as Andrea and Anam return to the Marxist and Christian platitudes, the violin smoothes the house with a smooth, gentle tenderness. The last teardrop scene was more than just filling up these tiring characters. A real step for Rossellini, who drew the mythical and mystical issues of St. Francis Flowers in the 1950s to further neo-realism.
