As a general rule, they finished 60 years, 10 years, radically changing our country in the fourth hour. And how painful it was for four hours. They were trivilized by the main events and events and they were "two claims" but you just saw the African-American family. If I were NBC, I was embarrassed to emit a garbage and embarrassed. It was fun to be happy that this happy, happy family you've seen in many ways has been tortured, but has been able to take part in almost 60 activities of the country. The second family was non-existent. Perhaps this family was dedicated to five or six scenes. This poor boy ... NBC, do not shoot any movies about other episodes .... Leave on PBS and History Channel
