If I had heard many people shouting about this movie, I'd give it a try. Apart from being incredibly slow, I do not think you're worth as much as you expect, but that's not alone. As many people say, there are numerous inconsistencies, and most of this film is simply not true. The reaction of 4 people transforms shock and horror into the body when they have fish. Without doubt, if they were the kind of people to be happy, they would only tell the body and say that they discovered it after their fishing trip ... why they were tied to a tree and fishing? then tell everyone that you found the body two days ago? It is difficult to watch a movie that is aware of the behavior of the main characters, which is very tough. As for the rest of the city, at least one of them may show some interest in the person who killed the woman. What kind of scenario does the body have except for the naked pants? If she had been raped, why not still pants? If he is harassed by the dress, then why not remove the pants? If he has not been harassed, why should he put all his clothes out of the rod? I really do not think of any real scenario that can lead to something else but to kill someone to steal their clothes, as if you're selling the sales spot! Well expected, but only and only because of poor scripts, the player is stronger.
