There were many really great horror films produced in the seventies, but this movie, of course, is not one of them! It's a shame. The child sometimes works with a good idea of ​​a successful horror issue. We also have the idea of ​​a vengeful kid who works well in classic films such as Bad Seed and then has a central zombie theme, which is, of course, the basis of a very successful horror movie. The field is basically the same: a young girl blames the burden of the mother for the death of her mother, she goes to the cemetery and revives the dead to take revenge. This is all good and good, except it is boring! Nothing happens to the majority of the film, and although it has a very good disaster; it is not a finale enough to sit and justify it with the rest of it. The movies are inexpensive and the film is clearly budgeted as all actors are trash. I really can not say a lot about the movie, it's not so much. The kid's lover's lover is terrified and I, of course, do not recommend it.
