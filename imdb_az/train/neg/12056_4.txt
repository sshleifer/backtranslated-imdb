This film is a good example of how to manipulate media to sell another movie from a very inadequate TV site. The daily newspaper, the largest circulation in Puerto Rico, wrote about the miracles of this movie, almost silenced all others. By accident, the newspaper, the second largest circulation, belongs to the same owners. CLARIDAD is the only newspaper that analyzes the film's content and content on the island every week, pointing to all its shortcomings, clich√©s, and bad writings. <br /> <br /> Just because a single movie is part of the audience, it does not make it an acceptable movie to laugh with easy and clear jokes and recognize actors and scenes.
