This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I am learning French in college and understand all the dialogues, so language barrier is not a problem. It is indeed difficult to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the film. <br /> <br /> There is only one professional actor, and I have not guessed professional directors or writers. <br /> <br /> Even though I gave her 1 out of 10, she does not deserve such a bad rating. This is simply an impossibility of putting the overall rating of 7.3 more realistically. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it would be a better rating of 4.3 because the movie is a real phenomenon. <br /> <br /> The real shame is that some college students take twice as good a half a dozen films a day. However, if you want to join a group that looks like rolling around the IMDb, you can also say "Lost in translation" at 10.
