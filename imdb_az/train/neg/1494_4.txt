Well, Death Tunnel is better than my review. In fact, some deaths were quite original and worthy of it. <br /> <br /> Here's what: 1. When discussing horror films in the kitchen, "Children" (high school or college), Shae says that Scream (1996) was given an accurate assessment. <br /> 2) Steve, Randy is not a REDDÄ° from Scream? 3. What was the film's connection with Samhain except in October? If you ask me it is very unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 4) Wow, despite the fact that you have referred to Sam Raimi, when I see these 80 thrills movies, I saw these horrible movies. 5. Why was Gary and his sister in the movie? They have nothing to do with characters. And Hiss was so bad that he did not even see his death? 6.) How did Gary notify her when she was killed in the bathroom (at this point, the deaths just turned into a Troma-tasting), but when she was standing outside the door? 7.) Gary's sister Haggis - this is an Irish commentary, basically a Scottish flavor. <br /> <br /> So, if you're like Shae, and if you're not entertaining any movie, will you live? 9. The mutants were quite cool, but they seemed like Chili con carne cooking dishes. <br /> 10.) When they brought Gary's sister, they strapped Steve HAD out there and forgot about it? 11. Did not there be more than one killer? <br /> <br /> Saudi Arabia, Shaia, Half of them did not know that Shae was dead or alive, so what was it? 13.) Why did not Gary and her sister ever die before? 14.) Why did no one call the police? Perhaps everyone did not live in the woods, why did not they raid them? 15.) As we know, they were not zombies or vampires, so how could it have turned into a "end"? In the giant "huh" I met everyone. <br /> <br /> A better way than killing tunnel, but still very important. Given that Samanna has nothing to do with the plot, I still do not understand why I'm still in Ireland.
