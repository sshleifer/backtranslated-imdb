After reading a positive review in New York Times, I tried to see this movie. In addition, I am also Shanghainese, so there was only a past interest in the subject. <br /> <br /> The speed of the movie was extremely slow and monotonous. The director stayed in certain scenes for a long time. There is no passion or chemistry among lovers. There was no dialogue. Dialogue was a hurry to replace the lack of actorship. At the end of the movie you did not feel any sympathy for the characters. This movie was missing in everything. The scenario was weak, the player was poor and the editing was non-existent. The director tried to imitate unusual movie styles, but failed. A good movie is a place that does not feel as time passes, without notice, preservation, and success. He thought that this movie would never end. Do not waste your money in this movie.
