Dysfunctional family goes home for strikes and murder and mayhem. Violent made a very sexy Milligan home. Less than a home-made movie (like most of Millennium films), it's becoming a catastrophe of the 1960s. For very ugliness and sex, this movie is neither sexy nor awful, and now it's strange. The film suffers from uneven casting and low cost of production (no one has always been sure where it was pulled out of money). Its a bad bad movie thats worth seeing because it has some good looking people who are a Milligan spectator or cheating around her.
