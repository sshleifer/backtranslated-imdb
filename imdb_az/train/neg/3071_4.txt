I found the characters to be mediocre and unfamiliar to the story. I would not have read this book (gratitude) or it would be a painful experience. I bought free preview tickets, but I still did not have time, or dude. I think it's not worth telling this story. Older people have a past history (not a rumor). The life of the main characters was painful, and a generation was no better than the elimination of foolish mistakes. But I think the actors do the best they can do with a tree story. I've always been a great admirer of Ellen Burstyn. Unfortunately, I am writing this review to counter positive reviews that please me about trying this movie.
