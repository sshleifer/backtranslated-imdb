I do not understand that everyone will take such a movie for my life. It's in a difficult situation, the player's tense, the language is unstoppable, and sometimes it seems like there is no use of the word "F" because "some other" F "people want to announce it." Gossett was particularly bad and seemed to enjoy his part. Forget this c__p, 'Shrek' has to rent and have a good laugh.
