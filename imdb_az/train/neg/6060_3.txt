She has this girl and she runs through the woods, but she ends up in that woman's clinic and wants abortion. His father is outdoors in a valve and is angry about it all. The entire episode occurs in and out of the abortion clinic. I'm not really the wrong choice, but I wanted to kill this episode. When I saw the baby coming out, I laughed and entered the corner. The part of the ultra-sounding voice was quite funny. In this episode I was really sorry for the poor father. She just wanted to protect her, and I did not really blame her. At the end, I do not know what happened or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room. I just laughed very much and I'm watching "Buy me" instead of this episode. The worst episode was, but it was not so beautiful.
