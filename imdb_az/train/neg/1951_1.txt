Scooby Doo is undoubtedly one of the simplest, most successful and popular cartoon characters in the world. So, what happens when you are everywhere and everything is done with the formula? Did you correct it? It's wrong. You can stop production and re-run it for ten years or for the rest, and then maintain the foundation of your success success. So almost a fraction of the formula is thick, but add a specific taste. They gave me the "New Scooby Doo", they just wanted to return to the classic Scooby Doo formula, which was a decade-long "A Pup Named Scooby Doo," but most of them were originally from "Where's Scooby Doo?" <br /> <br /> The first sign of a weak proposal is that I'm entering strangers; There may be a few memorable memories of past iterations, but generally you do not think of Scooby Doo movie-Flam, Scrappy Doo, or Scooby Dum. Even worse, the removal of other key members of Mystery Inc. shows a production group that generally does not understand the way the show works. <br /> <br /> In the first part, they have come together and have been a group of mutual people with their own people. <br /> <br /> This next paragraph is just my theory, so if you like: I hope that I contend with the main elements of the show, why I think that I have to master what my network represents and how they have helped them in whole; Fred represents the Drivers, generally Fred aims to give the direction, organization and sub-tasks of the group. Fred is a happy lucky teenager, he is your patron, teacher, father, and art man. Fred moves without hesitation and focuses on the tasks (the problem is always the same for Fred). Fred is an antithesis for Shaggy in many ways. Shaggy is your best friend, the one who is less afraid of you will not be behind you, and will make you brave. Shaggy reflects the emotion and often reduces the fear of fear. Velma represents a rational idea, she is applying logic, but it requires some time in the show and clues collected by other show members for most parts, as we have seen. Can Velma leave him a mystery? The group often finds truths inaccessible and is simply represented by Daphne when it comes to accidentally to get the necessary information to accomplish the tasks. At one point (I think it was the first Scooby Doo series), it was known as "dangerous prone". Writers used Daphne to connect events to one another. It's the one who often finds other details that can bring together a secret door, a set of objects, or network connectivity tips. Finally, Scooby represents himself. He is always in the center of events, as he is capable of the rest of the network, but not because he is disabled, and that the television viewer can not really participate. Scooby Doo works because these individualized elements are instantly identified and entertaining to solve problems. <br /> <br /> Maybe I think, but in my life, many Scooby Doo (a nerd, a 30-year-old self declared, with such areas). <br /> <br /> For me, there is a magic that should not be combined with the classic "Scooby Doo" formula. <br /> <br /> Many people say; Scooby Doo is not a great job of art, nor is it totally hesitant, it falls into a programming category that can be traced to the taste of breakfast with young eyes. The simplicity warning makes it another thing, and less.
