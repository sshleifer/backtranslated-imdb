My dear Lord, what a movie! First, let's talk about "special effects". Do not get me wrong here, I'm not an effective fanatic, but I really think that the superimposition of the past has a 60-plus experience. For a while, they could have written this movie long ago and took it forever to cut it off and release it. But as I know they did not have cell phones in the 1960s ... <br /> <br /> What I'm looking for in a movie is a good story with a good message. Acting is secondary, effects are secondary, and I do not even think of a few minor discrepancies. <br /> <br /> My husband said that this book is a true fact. But this is a bad game, the movie is incredible, and so on. A bad film has been added to further worsen - it has been with Celestine Prophecy for me. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: . If you really like cheese movies, this will be right for you. <br /> <br /> If IMDb's stars are not of good quality quality, they should have a star rating of this film. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are three stars there are bad movies, "Critical Mass" (look for comments on this one). The Celestine Prophecy is somewhat entertaining.
