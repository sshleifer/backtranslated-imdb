This movie was simply guaranteed by MST3K and was a good reason. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, this is the "police" movie starring Joe Don Baker. Because we are all a good police actor. Michael Jackson is a western singer in a country. <br /> <br /> All the typical police film-makers take their ugly heads, bar-wars, kidnapped hostages, bad players, blatant police officers, bad behavior, revenge, justice, infinite connections and, of course, bad behavior. Doing so without MST3K filters.
