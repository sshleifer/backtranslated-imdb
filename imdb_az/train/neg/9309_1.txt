Hey everyone ... <br /> <br /> It really does not say much to this movie. The main plot is to make a couple of friends in a wooden cabin for a week-long vacation away from work (Brandon). <br /> <br /> After getting her husband's wife, bad things start to get started. <br /> <br /> Only one storyline (written by the actor playing Brandon) is difficult and unsatisfactory and is implemented accordingly. "Clown Clay" itself is a pretty sad excuse for a psychotic assassin. Dark, mysterious, but most importantly, we offer an angel who is a stranger, very flawless, kind of seeming to be passing through a small average life crisis because of being smart predators. The only thing that provided this comment was sex scene, and whatever the movie was (the quality of the film brought me to use this kind of thing). <br /> This film falls below a certain standard. Undoubtedly, when I watched this movie, I shared some ideas with my close friend, so we were able to collect some relative entertainment values ​​from this movie, and therefore it is fair to say that S.I.C. was only shy of two ratings. But in fact (and with the benefit of hindsight) a star rating is much more legitimate for this movie. <br /> <br /> The eighth star.
