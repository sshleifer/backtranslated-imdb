Unlike many other commentators, I really hate this series. <br /> <br /> This is interesting with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I keep hoping for the last episode. As a result, I still did not understand what alien attacks were (maybe I missed one thing?) And I realized that I was sitting from the 26 episodes I hate from the beginnings, selfishness and self-praise. In fact, there are alien and robot battles that can overlap 10 to 12 times in one or more characters, or "I hate you", and these dark, strikingly blinking scenes. /> <br /> I am not really able to see Shinji or Asukani (two of the main symbols) showing growth or change. (I do not see one of the other characters learning or growing on this subject). In the first episodes, the feelings in the last episodes have not changed, saying they want a bloody life. Shinji is not really philanthropic, but anxious to help miserable people, and Asuka has always wanted to punish whenever the television screen appears to be such an embarrassment. <br /> <br /> I'm a great admirer of animation and mango, and I've never loved anything before. I read that when the creator / writer wrote a depression, I believe it; Watching me was depressed. Is the purpose of this array? I'm asking honestly. Is it designed to mock and disturb the viewer? And if it suffers from depression, why not write a book or a biography instead of mixing with aliens and mecha? <br /> <br /> Finally, I can say that this is a foreign war structure, as many people are really admired by claiming that they love this window of deadly areas. It is only known to have helped them, though, that most of them see that they are really good and how much they say because they said that.
