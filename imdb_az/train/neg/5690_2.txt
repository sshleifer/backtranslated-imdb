The first one ... I did not think of myself as a Uwe Boll Hater, but I did not see any of his films, but after seeing this cheap excuse for a film called "Seeds" (this is the name of this series)) I'm close to the hate club. This movie does not give any meaning ... the plot is a joke, and although Boll tries to draw the attention of those who shocked openly, 90% of this film is simply boredom. You can characterize this film as follows: 1. The killer is watching clips of torture on television. It's a ridiculous reason to give real-life images of rotten farms and make a statement about the film "making a humanity" and "Peta". <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Since this movie has no message and the worst torture is pornography abuse of the film from the beginning hate There is one reason for that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This film causes death by electrifying with an excuse that causes subsequent events. The cops watch videos of animals, babies and women flying in death and starvation in the Seed cellar, because they have a fierce horror and a whiskey cry because Sibin is a bad mofo. Although the act is okay, the movie always takes a diver when he tries to combine any sense ... <br /> <br /> 4. Busts of the cops in the house Seeds, stupid moves and pushes in the dark. This sequence reminds me of a video game, you see something outside the flashlights. <br /> <br /> The seed is somewhere in the same place, somewhere, a super-killer who is quite foolish to kill all the cops ... <br /> <br /> The seed is in the cafe, and we are in every "movie" as long as we see the electrode for a long time ... it will not die and we recall the opening statement that it should be released if it survives on 3 electric lines. <br /> <br /> Whatever ... they put it alive to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> 6. The seed comes out of his grave, killing everyone in another violent part, and then tries to take revenge from the main police. <br /> <br /> 7. A woman puts her head in an infinite sequence with a hammer and is just about a fun and shocking point of view. <br /> <br /> 8. Seeds police take the family, instigate her to her home, threaten to kill her husband and daughter. After killing his wife with a nail weapon, the police are hitting his head, taking into account what Toxun wants (he only keeps his mask even in prison, and it's hard to get these people to say a word) ... <br /> <br /> 9. <br /> <br /> Your baby resembles a nihilist shock that connects the dead father and the daughter to rot, like the people we see in the third sequence. <br /> <br /> This is no message, <br /> <br /> This movie is based solely on a few key scenes and their shocking value. I remember any emotion or an empty movie from the message or entertainment. Like watching the Metro in August, it's fine with me, and some of them will enjoy this foolish soul. But it's not really hard to stand on this subject, it's a mistake in the beginning, and the fact that the film's camera work, effects, and even the toy makes it a lot better for this casualty. <br /> <br /> So how does Boll make money for "films" made by thousands of talented filmmakers on crossovers? "Seed" is not just ridiculous, but a proof of life, which proves that the free market is defective ... happy Uwe, the German taxpayer paying more than that out of this.
