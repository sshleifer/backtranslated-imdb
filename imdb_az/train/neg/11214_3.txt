I also saw this movie about a year ago at a local show. First, I'm going to say it looks nice. Cassella is a very talented and fantastic filmmaker. I just want the movie to be as good as it seems. I say this is a horror film. Putting a few shots of a rotten ghost is not a horror movie. There is no mystery, no tension. <br /> <br /> This drama. You know what the film is all about. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Their ass, I also give honest opinion.
