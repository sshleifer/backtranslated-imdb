This is really one of the worst films ever made. I think of myself as a great zombie movie fan, and I usually tolerate anything that is bad in the film, a nasty "special effects" and a second-rate movie, which is a good atmosphere / story / suspension or what it offers. This is basically a positive one and maybe a third or fourth degree. <br /> <br /> Some of my friends and I took a small movie during my one-week vacation and did a really good job (although there was no zombie movie). <br /> <br /> This flick is not funny even talking about something. Indeed, bad and unnecessary special effects, like zombies (except for an extra white skin on the faces), seeming to be normal people, I love realism, I want realism and Zombie movies to be controversial, presented simply silly. The camera has long been with nutrition scenes, it is elegant and has used ARMED FORCES (!) To kill the zombies' hunts. I will not go to the details of the trailer (others did it). Although I'm from Germany, I am at least as interested in the original version, and I will not spend more time with this movie. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it.
