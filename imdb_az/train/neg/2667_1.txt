California is worried. I think there is no reason to explain this story. This is neither fun nor socially significant. Technically, the film is very good, the performances are of the highest degree and the first class. The story is interesting in an interesting way. But in the end, this movie gets worse and deserves dignity. I do not advise anyone in California.
