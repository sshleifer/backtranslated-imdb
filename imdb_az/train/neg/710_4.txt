<br /> <br /> I read Rice's novel with enthusiasm and was proud of a heartwarming story based on its symbols and historical truths. <br /> <br /> However, I'm just APPALLED in this catastrophic adaptation. Casting was not only talented, based solely on the physical appearance (except for Peter Gallagher, who had no yellow hair or could not get out of the old paper bag). Embarrassing and unpleasant attempts to influence a shedding French accent were unpleasant, but not fun. <br /> <br /> I found myself faded by this dark and melodramatic ride and was surprised to put an end to it. <br /> <br /> A warning for romantic fans - stay away from this.
