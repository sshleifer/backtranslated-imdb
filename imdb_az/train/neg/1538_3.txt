How shameful a really talented director like Andre de Toth, who prefers slippery, changing alliances, did not have this concept. He revealed the real potential, especially with an interesting character played by William Bishop. As the film stands, it's a mess (as claimed by many reviewers Chipe). The main challenges are direction, cheap budget, and poor script. A powerful castle and an interesting concept - the heroes were drawn by forces that collide in different directions. What was needed was not an attractive, unusual mixture (instead of understanding motivation and putting it together), it was a person who had enough vision to pull the positive elements together, transforming the scenario into a whole. Additionally, a larger budget can fit in with contrasted space and studio shooting, and all have gained a lot of space around LA. The real embarrassment loses a great spark: Hayden, Taylor (before closing the teeth), Dehner, Reeves, James Millican and William Bishop shortly before their timeless deaths. Several films show the importance of a more visually visceral system than this dark, darker West, which can be much more in the right hand.
