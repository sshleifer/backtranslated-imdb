Casual movie fans love deep and eternal love for those who want to scare the day. THE Texas ChainSaw MASSACRE can give us nightmares, but we did not feel a lot of love for Gunnar Hansen in BUTAL MASSACRE (Loyal) among us, or the hero of the eternal and real hero of Ken Foree. Dead? The cleansing congregation wanted to raise me and hesitate (like Tom Savini's bucket); I do not know you. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, get my creepy (if not just fall down ...). These are Heroes Heroes. Almost nothing to see that most of them are gathered together in a movie (at least this degree, I know). Only the writers had come to such a monumental mission. Maybe someone else will try again along one line somewhere. However, this is not another half-effort (such as BLACK SEA).
