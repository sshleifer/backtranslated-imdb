I have the opportunity to see this film uninterrupted and uninterrupted, and to remember its dreams and dreams. But everywhere he really thinks of being scared, he supported him and went somewhere else. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment that the dripping water inside the house, black rain, dreams of prophecy, and the wrong turn of the crude was not betrayed. The exposed masseuse of Chamberlain presented a small, but mixed blasphemy, and I found something that I reflected on the film. There could have been an indefinitely Aboriginal sound and background in the background, instead of a cacophony designed to get the head of terror. Ideas that modern human beings can embody, believe that the Aboriginal peoples believe that white-headed white men are the first monks, and many other opportunities have come up with a tip similar to a shopping list (Dream Time). <br /> <br /> [SPOILER] On the final stage, the director did not tell me what he meant. Is there a big wave? So what? How big is it? Tsunami? Yes, okay. It's not devastating, it's not apocalyptic. Is this the end of the world? Wave? Last wave? It was supposed to be a pretty darn big wave. Why? Was the world a bad place? It did not seem so terrible in this movie. In fact, I did not think that the wave came out because the shadow of the wave left Burton's face thrown by Dalton. Was Burton just apocalypse? Heck happens to people who lose it every day. <br /> <br /> One of the most terrifying scenes and the best indication of the Weir potential was Burton's wife who was scared of Charlie's apartment to go into the old building of Charto. Charlie said to her, "Who are you?" She asks. and after some time really worrying. Unfortunately, the film has never been followed.
