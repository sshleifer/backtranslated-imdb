In the first few moments of the Dutch tension, Krabbe is trying to steal a magazine from a newsletter, who thinks he's killing the guest room while lying in his underwear, and he comes together and learns that a young man is a gay spy writer learning dreams. . And he is the protagonist of this unusual movie, all dressed up without a costume (except at least one scene in Krabbe), but there is no place to go. The main area is very simple, but drags to a pointless conclusion for about two hours. Verhoev√© has beautiful visual dreams, but flawless eyes when they escape from tempting situations, open-minded scenes, and thoughts.
