Writing is pretty bad for college movies. <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's very important for me. <br /> <br /> It is very important for me. attractive girl, little town girl and so on. A prominent teacher is about what you expect ... a middle-aged man with ease. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to see a college flick, stay clean from one another. Not too bad, not funny.
