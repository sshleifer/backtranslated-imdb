I read all the reviews here and am amazed at the imagination of those who love this film. I can not say I have found a lot to recommend. Leonard Cohen's soundtrack is not too heavy, but it's beyond the scope of the event. The film looks fairly original, but there is nothing to be done to do it, and there is not much: a sensible area (not a real problem for me), character development, nothing. It just slips. Cimino's "The Gate of Heaven" is just a few minutes of flawed, real miracles, and a movie that I want to watch again. For a brilliant reconstruction of the West, HBO's Deadwood is far superior to McCabe.
