Look, I liked the PROPER Anchorman, but it was a bad thing. I want you to take a 50 minute walk into the kitchen to get a snack in the movie, a bad sort of fun that creates a funny look, and it's a bad sort of thinking that you can get back to life in a bad way and think "the things on earth are primarily thinking of it" you think you rent a Pauly Shore movie instead ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's very important for me. In my opinion, of course, they tried to do something entertaining and entertaining, but the subtotal of Anchorman really had a good reason ... even a little better. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a favor (or a grace in the United States) and do not follow this DVD ... Do not mock Anchorman's good movie and do it. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'm fine now.
