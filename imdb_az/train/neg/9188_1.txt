This is the only film made by Uwe Boll that I always knew was the worst film maker ever filming the "Videos" and making the "House of the Dead" one of the sixth IMDb. Since I'm still a big fan of the game, I wanted to watch it and I wanted to declare how bad the movie was. After watching it, I accept that there is no story in the film. The first 15-20 minutes did not go with any brains (plus there were awesome brain dead or girls?) Then there was nothing but teenage girls who did not overlap, and then at night zombies did not go anywhere. The woman started shooting at them. Almost somewhere, it takes place every 5 minutes. Should it be a comedy or horror? or both? I knew that in the second half I fell asleep and woke up during the last loans, but it was a good thing, though, that I could not watch all that! Film is a genuine insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll, do not shoot more movies. Thank you very much!
