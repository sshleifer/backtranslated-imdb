It's brilliant in the 30th Anniversary DVD for The False Saddles, but it's not. Here, I have never seen Mel Brook's name, and I can say why it has to do with this pilot. Who can find this smile? Of course it could be a race issue, but it was not only funny for me, it's not just funny. Writers do not even try to be funny, just to make money to be associated with Blazing Saddles. When they prepared this pilot, did this show wait for a few seasons? They pulled it straight, they did not care. It was a rapid cow that blessed God for blessing. I think it is only useful for historical purposes or just to show how Hollywood writers will be.
