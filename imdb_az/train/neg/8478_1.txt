This movie was the biggest loss of my life. The act was miserable. Jordan Hinson could not show any disappointment. At the start of the film, he had to be brave. Instead, he had his head down with his lips. He cried without tears for the crying scene. I had to shut her out of all the girls who wanted to be a actress. Everyone was very impressed with everyone. It was a decent thing. It was also an insult to skateboards. Jordan pulled out for a month and raised him as an Olympic team. In fact, it is practically poured into the efforts of real murderers. A miserable attempt to combine a pesky excuse and hockey and skate for a movie. Do not lose your life. Not even a star deserves it.
