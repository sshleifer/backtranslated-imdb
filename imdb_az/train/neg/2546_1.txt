This film is a mistake in the excitement of moving a kind. A tour bus to Las Vegas is attacked by a buggies driver packed by a group of white garbage chases. He brings them out of the wilderness and then stole all their valuable things. The field is constantly changing. One-minute rich ranchers are looking for a stamp in the next $ 90,000 looking to kidnap her daughter. Dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie.
