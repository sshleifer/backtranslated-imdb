I bought this movie for $ 5 at the discount book store, Adam Sandler was an excellent player and I thought it would be a good movie, it was not good. There was no story line yet, no crazy jokes and other comedian words, "F-Word," generally do not worry me, but it's over. Worse than the alarm line, Sandler was part of the movie's casual parts of the movie, which, when they looked at the screen and asked, was reminiscent of the Explorer named Dora. Finally, when the movie accidentally caused girls to wear bikini at random. In my opinion, do not buy this movie
