Of course, I think Al Pacino is a guilty pleasure. She was a beautiful actor, she was overreoted already, as it seems to a woman fragrance. I did not hear anything that grew up, so hopefully, it would be a nice little gem. A fleeting, advanced, intelligent and attractive city-political tension. It is not. <br /> <br /> The city square is a film full of many films, many characters, names and problems in the "realist" city, and if you immediately learn the truth, it will blow your mind. However, these subplots and digressions, ultimately, lead to corruption, the two interacting politicians, the mafia with police ties, and so on. Some very popular city stories result in trademarks. And, in theory, this installation has some exciting tension, none of the characters are safe and everything can happen! <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Policy and an example of the moral uncertainty of society in the "real world". Only 110 minutes after the spelling of the names and missing reports and lies and covers, the audience was usually pleased with it. Although I do not think we are staying in the City Hall and it's a full movie, I'm not really rich.
