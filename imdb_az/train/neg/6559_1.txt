My daughter chose this one; As an African American born and raised in Paradise, I discovered the plot and structure of this film completely unreliable. Believing that class and racist attitudes are easily and comfortably based on someone who is totally unaware of the south of the ante-bell. Completely absurd! I'm surprised that Harvey Keitel and a good actress have a good player, Andie McDowell (better to the south)
