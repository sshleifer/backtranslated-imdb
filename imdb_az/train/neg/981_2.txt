Since Marlene Dietrich is a great admirer, I (and finally) have to draw a very boring picture. Miss Dietrich's first color film and the most beautiful blonde in the world are in red! Bad start. The story is a great hole covering a subject that makes itself very difficult: religious perseverance. Perhaps it is enough to say that Dietrich's all movies (and most of all I've seen, including Pittsburgh), have to even follow a small number of his performance. Colorful photography is ok (this is very early Technicolor's freedom), but there is no purpose. Funny casting: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (not enough?). The only purpose of anything is the performance of John Carradine's "The Sand Diviner" cartoon. The alleged "happy ending" is one of the never thought-provoking. Another example of David O. Selznick's great reputation (he made a really good movie?) - and MGM DVD's sound program for the latter concern, Randomized. Very unrecommended.
