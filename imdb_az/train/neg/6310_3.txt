Yesterday I watched this movie and was a little disappointed. "Time Facts" was a lot. At the beginning of the film, Father commented on how he felt when hitting his granddaughter and friends 9-11 times. It was planned to be held in 1994. One of his grandchildren also weared the Eagles Donovan McNabb shirt. Not even prepared yet. The storyline was good, but the facts and the actuality of the time had revealed that the movie was a cat. My wife is a reader dedicated to World War II books and memories. I hope this movie will be fine. The player was like that. It's lost. But it was a pleasure for me to realize that this movie was worth $ 4, which I had to pay for it, and I had to watch it in the theater. I hope this one understands that there is no dissatisfaction with the warriors, but the facts and the time frame should be closely followed.
