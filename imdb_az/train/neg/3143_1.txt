The tragedy of the Titanic convoy boat inspired many books and movies. The battle between nature and technology has always been a dream. The latest film about this tragedy in the Atlantic Ocean was written and directed by the famous actor James Cameron. The story of the "Titanic" is related to the two main characters (Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) from various origins (one of the hobo-artists and the other aristocrat) and their love for public obstacles and the tragedy of the sinking ship. <br /> <br /> First of all, though, using a historic name, this movie has little to date. The site was built around two so-called lovers, French diamonds and treasure hunters. The death of more than a thousand people on the largest luxury ship of the modern era was simply a backdrop. Many historical facts were simply forgotten. Where's the radio operator, who does not have a refrigerator warning? Why was not there a word about the ship just 5 miles from the Titanic, but did not come to the rescue because the captain was unable to identify the alarm signal? Throwing these facts is an insult to tragedy. <br /> <br /> This event was the point of enjoying the sad romanticism of this historic disaster. rich envy and corruption, poverty equals compassion and heroism. It's ridiculous to spend $ 200 million to make a movie about how the money is infringed. Anti-heroes have not shown any human side. Billy Zane was part of the devil. Casting was also very weak. If DiCaprio is 2 inches shorter than Winslet, you can promise her baby's seat. The length of the film lasts about 3 hours. Before going to the first half hour of the theater, the audience was wasted to establish connections between the characters they knew and the dialogue that was used for that was even worse. Listening to lines like "I see you" and "This is my side of the boat" creates more pain than people's drowning. <br /> <br /> "Titanic" had a number of moving scenes while musicians sang while the boat sank, but did not approach the original. The best thing about this film was its special effect, and that's the only thing that really deserves a prize. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was not worth the overall sense of the public, Romeo (DiCaprio) could not resist a sentimental story that played a leading role in the public, and the film succeeded. Now it is safe to say that the industry will less hesitate to invest large amounts of money in a single movie, so the "Titanic" has achieved something.
