* Spoiler and extreme bashing lay ahead * <br /> <br /> When this show started, I found it enduring and entertaining. The children and adults loved the animated film was quite Oddparents. He had high ratings with SpongeBob. <br /> <br /> Butch Hartman and his team have demonstrated. <br /> <br /> First of all, the toilet humor is not funny. Challenging can kick a quick laugh with a little kiddie, but it's pretty much just the audience that laugh so much like a clich√©. Then there are kiddie jokes. Lol, we can see people inside our underwear, and we can see people in confusion. LOLOLOL !!! I just can not stop laughing in this happiness! Let someone help me! Of course, this show would not hurt this evil if it were not for stereotypes. How did you describe Australia in the team? They did not see anything except the simpletons who loved kangaroo, living in a warm, out-of-the-way boomerang. But now ... Why the gate of this show gate is really the most severe ... JOKES USED FOR !!! The show is always the same as the biggest thing, thinking that it's always the same jokes (most of them are useless). Cosmo is basically to blame. I also said "Super Toilet" (which just has a combination of hilarious humor) and Cosmo's anger. Who can forget about the nickname of each nickname in Dimmsdale in an email episode, as if the battery juggle joke? Do you know that every parent (s) talking about the other parent will be reading the same penalty before entering the children's room? Yes, for some people it may be first-class humor, but it's clean for others <br /> <br /> Butch Hartman said something about the end of the show, if I did not make a mistake. Thank God! Everyone in our region says it's the most funny Nickelodeon show. Do not I agree with that? I think every day there is another horse bullet we throw at our cartoon stations, it's just bad.
