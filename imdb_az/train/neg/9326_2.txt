Me and a group of my friends gave horrible videos to laugh at me, and they relied on me to have a little money, as well as some great laughs. S.I.C.K. It's a good afternoon, but it's a funny movie. The plot is over, take all your friends in the woods, and never go back. The most spectacular part of the movie is your visit to a butcher shop, besides a little dirty and brown-looking game dough. Everyone should always adhere to the Cartoon Network for the rest of his life when he is afraid of this movie, which is sad. The good qualities of the movie are that the two girls inside are very hot, better than one, and then naked in the movie. Another good thing is that this movie is as bad as it begins to laugh until it cries sometimes. I do not like horrifying videos or horrible videos, I do not find this entertainment, but when they see the amount of effort they make, they still get worse, enthusiastic, and hired. <br /> <br /> If you laugh at your hire, I'd give it 8.5.
