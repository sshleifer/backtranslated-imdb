Cinema critics around the world do not apologize. It is your job to advise the perfect community that they choose to spend money wisely. But I have not seen your advice, and I have been profoundly damaged. But he did not decide to see "the cat in the hat". As you can see, three years ago, all of you were criticized as saying that we should avoid the "disaster" known as the "Grinch Christmas". Some of my friends took me to see it and became a colorful, funny, and almost hypnotic yuletide treatment. Thus, critics, when they miss the "Cat in the Hat," Seuss, a major star in the lead role, would think that I should have the same old song. <br /> <br /> For 5 minutes I thought I was clear. Opening credits are smart, children are attractive and the top values ​​of production values. Then the cat came. There are many problems at this point, but the biggest one was Mike Myers's angry misbecin. "The Grinch" was rescued by Jim Carrey's inspired cast, "The Cat" was destroyed by Myers. Comic sketches can be quite laughable when their energies are applied wherever they are. Every really laughable movie is actually a long comedy sketch from the "Wayne World" to "Austin Powers". So, it's just not funny, it's just painful, just as the comedy sketches do not end at the end of the SNL, trying to do the same thing here. The writers did not help him with anything. After a pleasant prologue, the film is about an hour's creepy body dreams, weaker pratfalls, and unforgivable attempts at hip humor. This movie was the most terrifying movie I've ever seen. Period. So much talent and work turned into something bad. I know that the great stars of this movie will not be worthy of any damage, just because I believe that Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fan will have more chances to show their films in better films. If you are a parent, avoid it as a pandemonium. At the moment, you have better choices in the theaters with "Elf" and "Brothers Bey".
