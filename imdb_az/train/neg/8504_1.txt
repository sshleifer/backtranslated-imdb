Semana Santa is paralyzed with paradise. Why is it wrong to start with many ways? So look ... Mira Sorvino was shot while guarding her husband, and from police to police went to Seville. During the sacred week (Semana santa, see ... everyone starts to fall asleep, and even says that he was bad at the very beginning,) executing his bull like a bull in a dead bull. He groups with chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and beautiful Feodor Atkin. Soon he will be the next target of the killer (wearing red clothes). <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> I love Mira Sorvino (even for her, first of all). <br /> <br /> Why were we only eight people at the end of the first week of release this Saturday? A: ah-ah-ah. Spider-man was released on the same day. <br /> <br /> Question: What is this film prepared for? A: I think the money. <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> First of all, there is something wrong with European colleagues. here is a French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. yi-ha. <br /> <br /> Then the US thriller / slasher / whodunit / secrets / whatever it wants to play in the same game. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he wanted to add some political views to the scenario story to give some credits to the story. . Wrong: Trapped in photography, flash-backs, of course, is the most interesting thing in the film. It may be that the whole movie would not be sitting. <br /> <br /> Then homophobia. Go straight to Guillermo del Tros at DEVIL'S BACKBONE (El espinazo del diablo). Bullseye! The first victims, S & M drug addicts, twin twins, were stabbed to death. The annoying olive oil Martinez is going to a dating agency held by a shabby overweight transvestite with a dark platinum wig. The nature of Mira Sorvin always calls for a big dye. Do we need such things? Nah. <br /> <br /> That's why, of course. Yipee. There is no real motive. Because of being a representative of a famous picture, the first crimes are a plain dream. But no. As it turned out at the end of the film, the murder of the murderer (of course, terrible fascist) could have begun from the beginning, and I think it's time to finish the director's "nakedness". Then he thinks the director is his director. It's wrong: there's no point in saying anything in the sense of moving the actors, there is no information on changing the speed. Giant, mega-bore. The scenes of the sacred week are indispensable (maybe fought in Seville, but show this beautiful and historic city's Easter celebrations): there we are: a mystery movie for tourists!) Then actors. All errors. Mira Sorvino is dying to death: There is nothing else stabbed in her right hand. The best things (Swap Killers, Mighty Aphrodite ...) were as if they were not. Olivier Martinez ... hello, who is here? When the manufacturers will learn that it is not an actor, but a model that does not have a speech or sensation? Feodor Atkin, soft and transparent. Are Alida Valliya, one of the greatest actresses of the last century, highly respected? (And I hope for a number of roles today). He is the only person to give life to his poor lines. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to mention other actors because they are already one-sided characters, unobtrusive and deserted. <br /> <br /> Successful direction, non-actor actors, inaccessible areas. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1
