The Russian movie, "4", is watching the lives of three (four) adults who meet one night at a local bar. <br /> <br /> First, a musician, a frozen meat vendor and a call girl. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "4," I collect, the post-Soviet is to demonstrate the taste and despair of life in Russia. Making stories to make their lives more realistic), but the film is very profitable and boring, and I doubt that a large number of people can go along with it. The film looks like a shadowy proposal from the Russian government to some shady jobs behind the scenes - old frozen meat and so on. Satan works secretly cloning devices - but the movie is undoubtedly unofficially and unclear. <br /> <br /> 4 is a movement of both sides and a it's a two-hour long-term competition, despite its subtle-drawn scenes.
