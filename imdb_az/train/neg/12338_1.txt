When I was 10, I saw this movie in the theater. Even at this age, 'humor' was slightly insulted on my teenage intelligence. <br /> <br /> In the past, Ed Begley Jr. or Jeff Goldblum I feel very sad and very uncomfortable and even feeling somewhat sad. Why did I feel like I was reminded of the existence of this movie today? As you can see, I've shut down the movie, but I have negative feelings for both of these criminals. As you can see, I forgot about watching this movie, but it is part of my soul, which is not eaten unconsciously by the creators of this unusual work. <br /> <br /> I'm not brave enough to watch it as adults. Imagine, as part of the treatment process, I have to face the fear of childhood, so that I can become a reality behind me. Some regression therapy and / or hypnosis can not be a bad idea either.
