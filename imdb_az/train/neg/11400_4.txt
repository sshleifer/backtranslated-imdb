The Hazing is a mumbo-jumbo mistake that wants to be very difficult as The Evil Dead, who repeatedly addresses Bruce Campbell. The problem is that it's not just in the same league as this horrible film. This movie is not genuine anywhere. The site was previously used by Kevin Tenney at the Demons night and was more entertaining. <br /> <br /> Brad Dourif has never been given much of the work here, but he must be released. he puts another high-level game that can meet Christopher Walken with jealousy. As for the movement of children, it is unpleasant, but good. The shaky camera work is clever or more intense than the atmosphere. The first good man only lived a few minutes and sent a deadly liner while sending his victims, but was not afraid for a second. Gore is at a moderate level, but the director wants to make the actress several times unobtrusive. In general, if you spend 87 minutes, okay.
