How can I watch a movie that is soon to be recognized as the worst movie of all time by the worst director of all time? <br /> <br /> An analytical approach that criticizes the film seems to be a part of both sense and bandwagon syndrome. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film's universal quality says: "Alcohol's 16th Anniversary" is not a competition for the name of the worst movie, so it's going to be too low to win the title and catch it, but I believe this movie can go away. does not give enough words to show his failure, and it is much easier to place Elements of Six Alcohol Alcohol., Unfortunately, these fame moments have been buried in the shadows reflecting the strangeness of this film so far. <br /> What is my impression? I knew that I was aware of having a few cups of coffee and I sat down to watch (I want the offer to be Vodka trophies). "Despite my expectations," Six Years Alcohol "did not enjoy me at the" bad film "level, amnoxiously bad Jobson deliberately a poem but rarely tried to wash but went overkill and his poetry was deep but funny, he threw our throats down ... and Jobson sincerely tried to shoot a good movie? I believe in Jobson's sincerity, even when looking at the six-year Alcohol campaign literature. After longing for the film, I was convinced that in a few sequences and screaming moments (I was not intentional), it was extremely senseless and exciting, and these few elements left me on the DVD. Is it so bad that it is bad? <br /> <br /> They do not want to shoot a movie to watch an absolute film. <br /> <br /> Because of the movie artists. Get your own comment. This experience has improved significantly for me. Mike Myers is so surprising that Mike Myers, writing "The Scarlet Scoop Accent", to turn this whole piece of mud into a comic puzzle. "Ok dare ma man, get me annoyer gliss of dat wiskey".
