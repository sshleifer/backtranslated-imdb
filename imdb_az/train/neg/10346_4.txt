Ingrid Bergman and Warner Baxter thought that this movie would be better. Unfortunately, the film suffers from the difficulty of believing in characters, and is a big plot problem that some of the characters seem to be brainwashed. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Ingrid Bergman, who came to work for Stoddard's family. Everything is very healing and fat - the family loves Bergman and everything can not be more perfect. However, before the mother (Fay Wray) died, in 1907 the stock market collapsed (to erase the family's wealth) and Bergman had to return to France. This part of the film is a bit sticky, but not bad. <br /> <br /> Then Bergman returns after the family's activity has improved. Four boys are already growing, and there is really no reason why they actually hire her as a helper. But, in short, everything is inflated once. But when the WWI came out, all four were fighting! In the middle of this, one of his sons (David) brings his new wife Susan Hayward home. The character of Miss Hayward was as black and white as others, though they were all good and inflated, and he was obviously a tempting devil. <br /> <br /> <strong> While David is in a state of war, he comes to live in the family home. <br /> <br /> Now the film here really is silence - the painful voice of the brain. Hayward begins to associate with one of David's brothers, but when he sees the silhouette of his father, Bergman enters another room into the room, not Hayward and Jack, but he talks about it! WHY?! Why can not any whore's head do that to save a foolish woman and a lady's lid? It was a kind of excuse for Bergman to get rid of the last spark once and for all! <br /> <br /> The rest of the film follows an unsuccessful opportunity after Hayward's opposite. to be exposed to evil. It just stands in the face of dishonesty and made the film a frustrated melodramatic turmoil. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Life" is about filming. Hayward's job did not make sense - at least how it worked. And the film, which is so old, with good or bad (with nothing), drowns this film into the second level of soap. The only thing that does not save anything is not a player - of course, with a turbulent scenario. It is enough to say that the writers of Columbia Pictures, who shot this film, had to deal with a dead chicken!
