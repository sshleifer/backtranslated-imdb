...... This movie is terrible, and the only thing that refuses to give me a rating is, unfortunately, I have seen worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jungle music, fluorescent UV style, more. It can be predicted, but not in a good way. Nothing in this movie is a good way. I watched it 10 minutes ago and thought it was a little rent for you to be there. (oh and actor does not release the movie, which is terrible)
