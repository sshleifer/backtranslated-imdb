In this film, old Amitabh Bachchan is still in love with a younger woman. She talks to her restaurant. Young woman, Taboo, flirting with her. He does not know what to do and asks him. The response to his invitation is very strange. <br /> <br /> And this makes me worry about this whole movie. It was not funny. Sugars and posters were terrible! <br /> <br /> Amitabh, a sexy girl called sexy. The only jokes that loved me were the teeth of a waiter. It was a strange contact! A little girl with an old woman's mind! It was scared! I know someone may be next to a child, but this guy has a conversation with adults. <br /> <br /> The father of the medicine is Paresh Raval. He should give Amitabh a difficult time, but we all know Paresh, he can not do it. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, it is very interesting. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, I will probably not watch this movie again.
