"The Hills Have Eyes 2", as many times as in the mid-1980s, is not an update to Wes Craven's original 1977 original. However, to reduce this postmodern postmodern sustainability, Craven is a film of the same quality - in English as HORRIBLE (with his son Jonathan's double risk). Former music and video director Martin Weisz, heading from Alexandre Aja, appears to be clear on his head - yet how everyone creates a film that Cravens wrote 101 of Screenwriting. Only symbols (in this case the original remake goofball National Guard (wo) men's network to investigate the ruined hills) is inclined to traps of genuinely immoral and really boring genre (without losing laughter), but they are constantly making funny jokes. While watching the total inconvenience during a workout, their fate is a painful way of pushing, fierce cannibals. Only this time - just like the original '80s, the script gets ante accumulated in any subtext substitute shock (it's a combo birthday), plus a free aggression for those who did not pull the DVD out of the middle! . Even those mutants who have access to it are the heroine of a memorable neck - a seamless, rubber-looking makeup tries to hide her face without shame as the rest of the FX movie. At the end of Aja's legendary film, I'm in a "surprise" for the truth, and the producers are almost at the stage of the Hills 2 - to build the scene at the highest level - three times for Cravens and Weisz, 1977/2006, having difficulty finding the audience after this insult This is a ridiculous outburst of work.
