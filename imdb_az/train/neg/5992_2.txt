The most embarrassing moment in this film, Brady Corbet, says, "You are blooming," near the end of the film. I'm practically dead. I still do not believe what the scenarioists put in this line. Was forced to create romance? Because it nearly made me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the scenario was not bad. <br /> <br /> I never liked the original Thunderbirds, but the Thunderbirds movie did not do much. This is not a movie. The Thunderbirds brand would have to make the television even if it did not have a big shooting card, and it would have kept post-production. Maybe even earlier. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits are spread and they play the Busted song 'Thunderbirds'. I did not expect that I would look at $ 7 so I watched it through paying for it.
