If you have ever seen this movie, you know it! If you do not, and want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest to see this movie because it's in the worst case. So, if you are really bored, rent it. If you want to know what's going on, my little summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work with a few universe models and five people on a giant shipboat. The man does not like how a passenger gets all the fathers, and he tries to cross the cheezy jokes. WAIT FOR ALL! Only bad! You will need to rent yourself to see how bad the movie is.
