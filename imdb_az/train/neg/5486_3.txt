Initially, this movie really begins to make a dumb one: a 10-year-old girl is in a moving car, decides to be laughable to cover her mother's eyes with her hands and then causing a terrible accident. kills her mother .... duh .... sorry, there is nothing dying about 10-year-old. The rest of the movie is not the best. After the death of a 10 year old mother in the world, she directed her father to Genoa, Italy, to teach her a local university, but we're here: the Italian word! After that, the little girl's mother ("killing") and most of them have "visions" of night and day fear, always keeps the father and makes him coddling. Then we will force this family to lose all the time, and then, then I embrace, and then weep and loose, and then I wipe off all those vapidas, the ignorant people from the planet, to the point where I really want to some sort of natural disaster I find (more hugging and crying). Do not get me wrong because I like people, but an indie (and really dumb) about the chewing gum is simply ridiculous and meaningless. This film was based on these insipid characters, which caused horror in such delayed scenarios.
