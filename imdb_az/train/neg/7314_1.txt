In Uwe Boll's "Only in the Dark" everyone who reads my review will recall that he compared the task that could not prevent a person from living with a piece of human waste so that you have every hair cut from your arm. Well, this comparison is one step further, with this irresistible garbage dump and trying to imagine the pain of removing teeth without novacaine. <br /> <br /> At a time when she meets her spouse, you will find out what Eli Roth is doing with Cabin Fever. <br /> <br /> No movie was considered the worst movie of Uwe Boll. But in all honesty, I say "Cabin Fever" is very close. This is another gloomy excuse for a film that has no good reason to meet any form of theater freedom. For someone who claims to love horror genre like Eli Roth, he has created the most animated and rude window of a movie I've seen in my life. How do you smell a story? Without a bad writing of potential, without writing badly and without all this unnecessary and naughty comedy, he thought of this scenario. A film that deals with a strange meat-eating virus could have been better and better than Roth left for us. This script has failed me at a very high level. <br /> <br /> I do not doubt the direct talent of this filmmaker, but I know that he prefers an idea that can re-define the horror genre. <br /> <br /> This is the production of missed opportunities that will really be a general game on words. It does not worry about blood and special effects in large quantities, and can not save it, and it's an element I normally go. Indeed, there was nothing about Cabin Fever that I could easily recommend to anyone. When the three thirds of the student goes out of the theater half an hour, the film is known to be faster. My best recommendation for those who read this is simply to rent before buying. One review was something more than I need to know, more likely I will not be worried yet.
