When I was a young man, I watched this movie and remember it, but I can not remember the head of that movie, then I can pass through horror movies and think myself that it's a title. "This movie is part of a little disaster film / insect attack movie, but it's also a little bit boring because you have a movie watch for the movie, and there's a television vibe that I've got this kind of structure occupied by the site blocks, or something around me a bit uncomfortable, but I do not have any quotes about it.The most memorable ant attack for all my nakedness was for the first time in the pool, falling into the pool for the first time, and falling into the pool after the Sumers attack scene, of course, something else. the survivors began to breathe cardboard tubes, and in the end, as in most television films, this film is very dark and not afraid of panic in front of ants.
