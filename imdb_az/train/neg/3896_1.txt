Yes. Astronaut Steve Barber sits in a plastic capsule and says, "You do not live until you see the sun in Saturn's rings", and the sunlight comes out of the window during the day and suddenly there is Nose bleeding. After that, he returns home from a secret hospital, leaves a melted gelatine mass and passes through a fake glass door to an ugly nurse. As it is seen, the West "is getting stronger and more melancholy", this hopeless step, adle-brained moovie makes a lot of sense. It then tries to cover the dopey's "Army Brass" information, which looks like Coleman Francis (very bad moovies director), but the goo man runs around to kill anyone he sees because it melts. It melts, because a couple are attacking a couple. He is screaming for a terrifying actress and melts down for about 10 minutes, though it is desperate. It melts because it melts. Rik Baker's liars are supposed to be fx stars here, but they look at the hockey. The film is scarce and everything is so dark and dark that it can be difficult - it will not help. MooCow says who cut it with cheese? : = 8P ps - "Did you ever get a cracker?"
