This 2 point is dedicated to Akshay Kumar's clever performance. I know that Bollywood films do not really work to be realistic, but think that Walt Disney production is more realistic than this one. Father will die, and what a good parent does ... he has raised his son with his son's son. A few things that are very difficult to wash. 1. Can you go here to go when Priyanka's hungry life in the 'cool-seated pool' and in her garden garden? ????????? 2. Akshay suddenly took the job as a dubbed, drowned by lost dogs, and then went alone. This film is an INSUL to our intelligence. I really do not believe that when I looked at my family, I gave financial support to the people who filmed this movie, we left the film with a spoon. this takes my advice and does not waste 'time'.
