Good earth life is followed by a slave girl and a poor farmer in China. The film was developed by Pearl S. Buck. The story is great, but I hated that Anglos decided to take on leading roles. Walter Connolly laughs like the father of the farmer. <br /> <br /> Most Americans, like leading actors, have so much American emphasis that I have not heard his word. <br /> <br /> Hollywood's racist beliefs are not a shame for the Asians, leading roles. Anglo-American look and look like Chinese are Anglo-African shoes put on their faces to play African-Americans.
