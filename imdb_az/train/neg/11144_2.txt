This flick reminded me of the "shady" erotic thrillers I used to stay tuned and watched at Cinemax at the age of 13. Since this string is dark and soft, this flicker touches a softer core. But there is a tone of nakedness - the opening scene is a striptease club, Kane Hodder's keester (or at least one stunt), and then a 10-minute lesbian dance scene and a nude Mundster costume. <br /> The 13 year old boy is happy. <br /> <br /> Besides the werewolf transformation scenes, I have the worst CGI I've ever seen. The quality of the shots appears from FMV's "Resident Evil" video game. <br /> <br /> This worm is very bad to be disclosed, and despite the poor quality of the suit, it is often shown way. <br /> <br /> There is no cunning and acting meaning. There are some oddball stories about werewolves and hybrid worms - Darkwolf is the end, but hybrids say that all wolves see people and change people to kill a monster. Darkwolf is trying to find his wife, but he does not find it strange, but smells everyone who touches it. Once again, these skills are useful, as Darkwolf has led to the killing of several nations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;">. If you're a good low end werewolf-name, go want to have a ton of soldier T & A on the go, this is your flick.
