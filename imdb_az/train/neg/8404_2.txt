I have three comments to talk about this movie. I have decided to postpone this movie on the Blockbuster board. First of all, it is interesting for cinematographers to try to film the wrong thing. Someone, like Kubrick's "Lolita," won the original essay for writing a scenario like the original work. Of course it can not be here; Kraft Ebing is long dead. Some use their original workplace as a starting point for a completely new, inconspicuous route (here's the latest version of Tristram Shandy's coming up here). You can mute it - The "Five Saps" is an example for me. Or you can just take the original format and try to show it on cinematic vignettes. It's Woody Allen's "Everything you want to know about sex," and, of course, it would be the approach of this movie. On the contrary, there may be something that can be involved in a scientific work like Psychopathia Sexualis. The potential loss was darkness or destruction regardless of the cumulative point of the original work. And that's why it's here. <br /> <br /> Second, kinematic style. Some of them are Murnau, Pabst, Carl Dreyer, and others. He called it "respect", but I think it is much more important. Very heavy and inaccessible for a long time. <br /> <br /> Three points are perhaps less intellectual observations. How could those responsible for this make a film about unified sexual changes and such an incredibly boring deviation? I find that it is impossible to draw attention to the movie, and anyone who does not automatically withdraw from the sexually explicit images will find it. I do not want to be totally unpleasant, and we can say that the movie is meaningless, but any source of filmmakers is the character of the welding material, the clear reproduction of the film's style and the stubborn refusal. <br /> <br /> The film is a suspicious exercise from the start and does not really work for me, I apologize. I say.
