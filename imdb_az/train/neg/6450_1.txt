Well this movie is incredibly terrible. I did not apologize for the actors participating in this project because I'm sure they did not write their lines. Sometimes those who surrendered lightly to the film, which they believe to be incapable of taking this film, have also destroyed everybody who has been following this disobedience. While watching this creature, he could not help, but I thought most crew was not a budget or an authoritative writer. But if you look at this for a laugh, you're happy that the movie is not as embarrassing as it's because I'm not proud of everyone's discretion and that the DVDs are straightforward. lightweight filmmaking.
