It really surprised me. The director / writer / actor must actually be charismatic. I do not think any other way to staged scenario authors. This is what I need to consider ... while watching movies I'm sorry for actors. It felt like it was in a comedy club that did not like to die on the person's footsteps and did not like to sit there, feeling worse for himself than feeling uneasy. Id wants to know what the budget is, because the quality of the film is really poor, it should be low. I want to write that "jokes did not appeal to me". but the truth is to turn to them, you have to be the person who writes them. or a retard. Imagine that in the form of a script ... and this person is burned. Is not it impressive?
