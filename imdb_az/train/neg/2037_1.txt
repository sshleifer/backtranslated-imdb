If I could give it zero, I would change my mind and instead give it an -10. The absolutely terrifying movie with no movie area does not mean what's happening. Just get out of the pyramid. Please do not lose your money. Please! If this film really describes the story of the real Burc, it could have done a great job, but nopes, I did not hate it while watching it. Give yourself a blessing and instead rent a classic movies, to watch a movie you've seen 3-4 times better than watching this crap! I do not know why people are worried about producing such films when they do not know if they will not go to a good movie. Instead of the zodiac killer, it should be called the Boriac Killer!
