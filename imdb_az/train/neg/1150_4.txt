In this 4-part documentary, there are some pieces that point to the need for reconstruction drugs, although it does not develop very well, in contrast to many parts of the belief that it is currently part of the drug that is taking place in the wrong place. <br /> <br /> This program usually leaves the impression that the viewer is a drug war, though it's mostly a useless life and money loss and deserves some definitions for it. Almost nothing in this documentary is that it causes a total war against those who have an illegal drug, saying that the very real problems - drug warriors themselves say they are thinking of solving the drug war. For example, while spending several minutes of increasing violence on the rise in cocaine growth in the 1980s, this program shows that it is not possible to apply laws to prevent cocaine cracking at any point in the practice of drug dealers, court cases and business regulations, violence to stay in business forced to apply. But instead of seeing the law as a major cause of violence, the drugs themselves are the cause of sin. Undoubtedly, the prohibition of alcohol, the violence and the subsequent ban on the prohibition are not completely ignored by this program. <br /> <br /> This program will help to keep up with the ridiculous stereotypes of drug users, and they are the key to making a very expensive and highly problematic drug war. Apart from alcohol, the possibility of a successful and successful life of drug addicts does not really work. <br /> <br /> Any use of drugs is likely to cause personal problems, but all users do not use drugs, but all alcohol users are alcoholized. <br /> <br /> Believes that someone can not be abolished by the criminal justice system of the elderly and actually destroys lives for the use of drugs for more Christian political reasons than just because of just social policy and legal science. do not forget when completely banned users decide to interact metaphorically. None of these are here. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this is not difficult in the category of propaganda against drugs. This is the history of non-neutralized drugs, mostly marijuana, LSD, heroine, cocaine, MDMA and Oxycontin, in the 20th century. But there is an important element in the opinion of various people regarding drug laws and most (but not all), very thoughtful or well-informed, and other than drug narcotics, except for marijuana. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> a disease that is not known as an irresponsible attitude to people, a prejudice against those who use unapproved medicines is of interest to the growth of the penitentiary and is a heartwarming apathy in terms of human dignity. If there is no reason to do so, it is a moral mistake to abduct or detain people, and there is simply no such reason for choosing a pharmacist. <br /> <br /> Because parts of the program, which naturally present nostalgic stereotypes of drug users, the heart of the Narcotics War is quite good and exciting and entertaining. However, when giving a radical view of illicit drug policies and not being drug addicts, it is quite hopeless to give trainees a lot of people who are successful in their successful and successful lives.
