CLAIMS: I was always amazed at how many people gave this game good reviews. It was horrible. The scenario and the voice of her only violated her. Gabriel and Grace are the most different characters in the game. You are praying for your death right away. <br /> <br /> The lack of these vampires has been extremely disappointing. If you're expecting some sort of vampire story of Anne Rice's style, forget it. The story of this game is very small with vampires. <br /> <br /> Wisdom has radical and very dishonest, Christian views. I'm surprised that I left the drawing board. I'm not even a Christian and I found it offensive. Basically, the story searches for Holy Kalbajar and buried the treasure. The royal kidnapping, which must be focused, really pushes aside. Jabr√¢il does not have an immediate feeling to find a baby. In fact, for the first time, he does not want anything about the baby after the block several times. <br /> <br /> Graphs are pretty bad. Rapid movement of snails even in systems with the best of heroes. They are ugly and outdated. <br /> <br /> It's hard to walk away from the fearsome gaming engine The Beast Within, FMV. <br /> <br /> Relations between Jabrayil and Grace are a great turn. I really do not know how hard it is, but they lie together. And that's not fun. Gabriel holds most of the game, telling his best friend Mosely that he thinks Grace is more like a sister and that she does not care for her. It's like what he's actually sleeping with. But it is not very different throughout the game, so do not even wait for it at this point. In his dialogue, the game was the worst. And she was always stupid sex ladies in the whole game. Until the end of the game, Grace leaves her with something seemingly like the John's letter. <br /> <br /> My life was very unsettling and boring. I was expecting to play a story about a baby kidnapped by vampires. And I was expecting to see and fight vampires, perhaps Gabriel or Grace. But no. Instead, the story focused on the author's view of Christianity. What a shame. <br /> <br /> For me the only interesting part of the game was really in the end. At the end, we get a few action style puzzles. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it was not worth the effort through all the games. <br /> <br /> I really can not recommend this game. A few years ago, I came back and I hated the game engine for a long time, and I bend it for years. I just cleared it up to see what I've lost a while ago. Now I'm so sorry I did. My favorite characters were harsh. Now, I hope, it will be the fourth game to pay for the series. And I hope they will be right next time. She was afraid to end with this part of the series.
