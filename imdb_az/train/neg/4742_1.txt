Amazing! Wow. This was the worst DCOM anyway. I watched the first half hour and laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, a celebrated girl, with a hot-haired male lover, compressed her friends with Homecoming Queen. She comes to help her save the world as a fighter and help Tin with her Martial Arts. Tin had a snake, a tiger, and so on. He teaches his skills and learns some of the world's earnings. <br /> <br /> This movie is great for children who want to learn about Martial Arts and Chinese culture <br /> <br /> Brenda Song is a comedian actress and I do not see her playing a serious role. A loud laugh followed his tears on the tire. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and tried to think something similar, and it was the Power Rangers that came to me. This movie was very fake and the stunts were so Power Ranger - it was just corny and stupid. The heroes were unpleasant and I just could not stop watching her. Disney should take time to make really good movies. <br /> <br /> "High School Musical" is the only film shot on the Disney Channel in Suburbs, along with "Jumping Ship", "Friendship Color", "Go Fig", "Reading" and "Aglama" . If you love action-adventure and dark jokes, you'll love this movie.
