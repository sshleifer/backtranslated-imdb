There was nothing in this movie: story, action, surprise, ingenuity, and a soul. Within fifteen minutes, I was looking at the screen: "How can all these guys come together and consider themselves friends (even without a girl)?" In another fifteen minutes, I prayed for as many Amanda Peet as possible. When a bad film gently takes your ugly head, eye candy is a great comfort. But there was not much! Deceived on all fronts!
