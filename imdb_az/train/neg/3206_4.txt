I was thrilled to announce that Cesar Montan decided to make a movie in Cebuano. (The French and the Spaniards, such as Cebuano and Tagalog, who are misinterpreted by the majority of the Philippines, are not interconnected, as "dialects"). But when I saw this movie, I regretted it. When I was a Canadian, Cebuano parents, about the movie, I was optimistic about the revival of Visayan movie industry. I'm even more excited to hear if the Philippines likes this kind of movie, not just another stupid movie or melodrama. But, unfortunately, I was briefly changed. <br /> <br /> Panagoy travels to an ego on Cesar Montanho. Of course Montano plays the protagonist. When I say "hero", I say in the most stereotypical behavior; its function is to win a girl's heart and to win the Bolo-Anons victory over Japan. His character has no depth or complexity. It only matches the hero's mold. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional; <br /> <br /> In some movies, it's very important for me. He really did not think about anything. <br /> <br /> A movie is a historical theme, a drama and slow-moving movie is a well-prepared movie. <br /> <br /> Especially teasing American actor Philip Anthony. <br /> <br /> If Montanos wanted to revive the film industry, Visay needed to think this truth. He said he wanted to create a Visayan cinema that could compete in Cannes and Toronto, but it was really possible for this movie to join the festival. Visayan had to prepare a movie that would attract audiences, even if at least to sacrifice quality for entering the core of his films. Carefully, he did not think about winning movies in Cannes and did not get any information as the audience was attractive at least at the door. <br /> <br /> I am afraid that the Visayan films will not be prepared for a long time. I never said to a Filippi that I would like to see more Visayan films, "Viswanians do not have a good movie, did not you see Panagoy Sa Suba?" Of course it's proud because it's an example of the Visayan movie, and maybe it's an example everybody can see in these days. <br /> <br /> An example of just meditative films is not just slow motion, but the Tagalog movie Blackout or David Lynch's Straight Story. I hate to propagate the Tagalogian language, which says that it is progressing in infinite and unfair and undermining the Filipinos' throats of Tagalog, but I call Blackout a very good film to call a castle. These films are very difficult to describe Hitchcock as "pure film". Images without words are used to convey the story. But for some of these films, I imagine that these films use pictures without words to reflect the mood of the film. and they do it very well. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> According to Panakoy, but they have created a mood, even though the landscape is rapidly drawn. <br /> <br /> And what are many Philippine films with and without an immortal mother or grandmother?
