How could this film ever be distributed for all those who are holy? It looks like someone is shot on his mobile phone and the screaming girl sacrifice scenario is going to be all new. They scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie. And all this. There is no plot, no tension, no characters, and many do not work. Just shouting and shouting more. <br /> <br /> I gave up after fifteen minutes and ran fast to find out if something went wrong. Of course, except for screaming. Odlly enough, the forward-looking move emphasizes another problem - no camera work to talk about. <br /> <br /> Each stroke looks like every shooting - medium distance, an angle, dart, lug, DÃœLL. <br /> This is just bad.
