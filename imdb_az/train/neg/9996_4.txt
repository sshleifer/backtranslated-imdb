Although the direction of Production and Jerry Jameson is precise, "The airport '77 'is not better than the airport' s 1975: slick, commercial rubbish (this time literally) is a good cast.Jack Lemmon kidnapped by art thieves and crashed into the sea is a full-fledged airplane pilot (the whole presentation was claimed to be near the Bermuda Triangle, but the film itself is not related to it.) As firefighters come to lift the plane over the water, we see that all of their cranes are on the ocean and it is not difficult to make a laugh (airplane, passengers and baggage) ) NBC was injecting in procedures with all sorts of episodes of "Gilligan Island" - at least one hour's footage - used by the majority of flashbacks to be seen as "cutting off the director." The most exciting moment was a plane crash and some players they have a little fun: Lee Grant, an immoral drunk, Brenda Vaccaro, a stupid stewardess, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland dating the elderly. Until now, personality conflicts and sensitive military traits are more likely to endure. ** from ****
