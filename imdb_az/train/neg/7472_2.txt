This show was very good. Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress and I love the police series, but somewhere in the production this software is very wrong. <br /> <br /> First of all, writers should be more suspicious, knowing who did it ANYWHERE !!!!! It recommends drilling it. The main character is incredibly annoying and in no way convincing. I know they want it to be difficult, but say shes, a fool and a bad chef. Murders are unimportant and gentle and just unfair. <br /> <br /> Generally, it was a big disappointment and it was very bad.
