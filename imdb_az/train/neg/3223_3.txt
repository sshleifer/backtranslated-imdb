LOL! Not a bad way to get started. I thought it was genuine, but then I found out that KING KONG was a clone of the 1976 anniversary. When I was 15, I did not see KING KONG. I've seen this movie at the age of 9. The movie's funky disco music is stuck on your head! Adults will not talk about the film's theme. This is the worst vitality I've ever seen. At the same time, this film remains a sacred piece of B-films. Unforgettable quotes: "Take a calm and go to bed." "Put the Yeti in your tank and you have the power of Yeti." I remember watching the movie MOVIE MACRABE hosted by Elvira. There is a scene in the way KING KONG is! KING KONG takes his daughter and climbs the building, but in this movie she falls and her daughter falls (falling)! Another KONG clone coming from Hong Kong around that year was MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977). There are many traveling matte scenes and motorized body parts. This movie will make you laugh. I said that another KING KONG clone. PG was given for violence, language, thematic elements, and some of the fear scenes.
