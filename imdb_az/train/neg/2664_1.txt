Distressive, cliched thriller, young couples are conducting a cross-examination on America's worst criminal websites, becoming a true psychologist, a spotless young woman and her husband's companion partner. Arty and alienation, the sound of the movie varies between pouty pseudo-irony and silly flamboyance. Handsomely maybe maybe, but ultimately laughable. The performance of Brad Pitt's tenant killer is divine. * from ****
