It was a classic event that never happened. Gloria was now a single mother and her husband left her because she did not live with her (Reagan was chosen and wanted to return to society). Right then, I've had a series of problems here - let's say to myself that the same noble Michael Stivic, who is against the right-wing philosophies of Archie Bunker? The series continued, but there was no pizazz. Sally Struthers has been a long time since the entire family has gained momentum. Maybe the series was given another name and if it was presented entirely within the family, it would have worked. Well, the show business.
