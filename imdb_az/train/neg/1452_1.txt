In 1919-1933 Germany was seen as the post of the captain of the Second World War in Czechia. Unfortunately, the Czech Republic is capitol and how funny it is in 2003. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most horrific history films in the recent past. Röhm has a higher leadership than Adolf and seems so damned that he is only 40 years old at the age of 23, and Führer always looks like 56. And buildings, nations, and even buildings are sometimes young. Especially in 1919 there were many new homes in Germany (WWI is not enough for German cities!). There is no unlucky gypsum! Then Reichstagsbuilding. There were never city canyons around this building. All of this may sound like a miracle: In 1933, many vehicles with the Big Berlin fire brigade engine, some with turntable ladders, but with no manual pumps. <br /> <br /> Last but not least: What is the PLAYMOBIL castle? For me, this is some sort of "Wonderland Adventures in Adolf"
