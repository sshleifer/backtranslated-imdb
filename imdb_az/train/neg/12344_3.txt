A bicameral comedy has been a sketch-like revue, once for the first time ever seen by a radio star, Jack Pearl, but remembers America's entry into The Three Stooges at its best. In fact, Larry, along with Curly and Moe comedy Ted Healy, are billed as Ted Healy and Three Stooges. Although supportive Jimmy Durante (spending entirely of poor material) and ZaSu Pitts, the film's only audience is Stooges-addicts and can not even find much to applaud here. Incredible loud sounds and extreme empathy show that Hollywood has gone to a certain level. * From 1/2
