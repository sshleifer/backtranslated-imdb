This film is responsible for public commentary, in fact it is ridiculous as irritating irritation as any excuse. The premiere of this movie: Africa-America = Strong ... any other race = weak. The worst part is Rapaport's Omar Epps and a Jewish boy. The Jewish man is stereotypically scared and begins to plead for his life ... but great, strong, flawless Omar Epps does not grow strong with no fear. We condemn any member of our brother as an arrogant alcoholic or a vacationer. The aggressive white girl, of course, takes care of her lesbianism after she is just a weak white girl. When Nerdy's white boy is rejected by fraternity members, he must be with the incredibly cowardly skinheads; a great muscle boy, who is often beaten by strong black men especially. Wait ... BUSTA RHYMES A GUY TO TWO TWO YEARS? Yes, thank you. <br /> <br /> Of course, black guys never give up their people, and Omar Epps moves them easily. The scenes of the Ice Cube that threaten their cousins ​​are simply foolish - of course, he is dominant, weaker siblings sit in his fears and eventually act. This movie was just terrible and the last one laughs really loudly. Epps and Banks are strikingly surprised by the faces that move quite fast - watching my nephew and my brothers face each other (and less than 5). Give yourself a blessing and skip this crapfest.
