If this film is a fictional character, the film itself will stop and can be judged objectively. Unfortunately, according to the audience, the film is based on "facts" that are very shady in the face of Ruben Karter. Most of the little truths were ignored (Carter did not have the number one claimant at the time of the murder, there was no evidence that a friend of a young child had been kidnapped), when it came to deciding to Joey Giardello for the "racist" judges, we did not oppose those who fight the tape and those who are totally disrespectful of Giardello does not bear responsibility. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero from a normal man more than a person who is more concerned with and more than surrounding problems (several times to be beaten to beat women). Ruben Carter has never been seen at the age of 60 and even now when he refuses to speak to his son, seeing a man he can look at. Everyone knows that the Jewish organization can handle it and that Washington can act, but why they chose this event because their means were beyond me. Do you need a strange hero in Hollywood so you have to bend the truth in all their bio pics to convince them? (Heres is playing a movie about Denzel himself?) Now, based on all the inaccuracies in the film, I would suggest to pass on this.
