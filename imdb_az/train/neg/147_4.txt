"Valentine" is another fright film to add to the stick and add it to the movie list (Halloween, "Friday 13", "Scream" and "Know My Last Writing"). Of course, the movies on the list are not as good as the first, but better than many films that appeared after the first "Friday 13th Film". One of these films was the Canadian "My Bloody Valentine" album in 1981. "Valentine" is a better movie than this movie, but it does not say much. Area: At the beginning of the film is a nerdy young man threatened and pranked by several classmates. Once the classmates get up, then the film is taken over as they progress. The murderer is now considered a young man growing up despite suicide. But what is it? Or maybe another one? "Valentine" includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do their best with the materials they have, but an unstable script really does not justify them. But there are many moments of fear. <br /> <br /> ** (Four)
