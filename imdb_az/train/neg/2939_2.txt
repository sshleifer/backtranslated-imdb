According to others, "No, Luciano" is a better response or response to the title of this movie. For fun, a great opera singer should shout to sing ..... he is not a terrible actor. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were nice - it was a nice family movie, but after that, it's nothing more than a dull soap opera. <br /> <br /> Temporarily, Pavarotti sounds like "Giorgio Fini", loses his voice several times, and comes to rescue her doctor, "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; Harrold is a predator and I'm not surprised to see him staring at him." <br /> <br /> In the first half of the film, at least there is a beautiful scene that delights San Francisco and Italy I'm divorced and do not remember the second half.
