So far, the Nightmare and Dreamscapes have been mistaken and disappointing. The first segment managed by Brian Henson could have been a little bit of a strange storyline or a real fright, but at least a well-directed, decline and vision; A mini series that moves by William Hurt and has a very impressive special effects. <br /> <br /> However, the second story in the series was not good, it was just terrible. The scenario is bad, requires unreasonable action to move surfaces, difficult characters, and adds tougher symbols to strange, unnecessary exposure goals. Acting is long and impartial and in the first part, I feel more empathy for a bloody killer. The director used a million tricks to make the narrative spooky, but with the amateur player and writing, the final result seems to be a first-rate movie school project, the camera moves behind it and is in a tiny way or tension. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the series continues, I would run away from here. We look forward to William H. Macy's payment and I hope he will be a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far, quality is too intolerable to predict both ways.
