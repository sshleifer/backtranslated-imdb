- Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to keep an orphanage or something - <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie because it was WWF's wrestling and could therefore be funny. It was not. It's heartwarming. Shameful. Every opportunity for the comedy was ruthlessly frustrated. <br /> <br /> I do not like Jack Black. After that, I suffer from thinking about a good role for my brain. It's the only thing I can get where I am. John Cusack looked like "High Fidelity" as a necessary foil. Jack Black should not be said to be the same thing that is terribly relentless straight-out ham-it-up knockabout guys (Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis, who are unhappy with being a little fat). <br /> <br /> This is not even a rifle. This is just anxiety. <br /> <br /> I've heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite, but if it's anything, I will not hurry to find it on the DVD.
