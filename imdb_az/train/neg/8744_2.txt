I accidentally watched this movie. I'm still sorry, but I'm not sure. I feel like watching the movie of a group of filmmakers. Every Hollywood clich√© is able to imagine, hitting us with the message "Corporations last bad." Subtlety does not support this movie. <br /> <br /> The government looks like a computer in which the fantasy world is realized. The character of the lead, a girlfriend and an attractive teenage boy, is a genius and clear hacker among many other nerd-fantasy-coming elements that you will still have to see yourself. <br /> <br /> When I saw Ned Bellamy, I knew he'd be a z-movie ... he's a good discount. <br /> <br /> One, I'm scared.
