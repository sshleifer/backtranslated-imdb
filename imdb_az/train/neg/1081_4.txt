All this film has no sympathetic character. Was Kenneth Branak a lawyer to play for us? We know that he is a sleazebaq advocate who is technically abusive. He sees his colleagues as animals, deals with his own personal crisis (killing one of them in this process), endangers his children, threatens his ex-wife's new spouse, tries to strengthen the police, and school administrators - why? Because she wants PEOPLE FOR PEOPLE! I really want to beat my father and his body to beat the beating and to drown in the swamp ... that could have ended a more satisfying end.
