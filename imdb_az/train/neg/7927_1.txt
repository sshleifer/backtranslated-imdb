This movie is AWESOME. Today I watched with my cousin Jay-Jay. He was good, but I think it is RULEZZZ! I want to say that it is so cool. Ted V. Mikels is very brave and intelligent. As a Matrix and Stop or a mom, I made a completely different movie on Hollywood movies. But it would be better. I like ninja and pirates. I also love a great talon that wears a funny man. He thinks that Domino Pizza claymation is the best man ever since. Not only does this movie really look nice when I'm just 6 years old than my films. It talks a complex fairy tale with many characters that are completely incompatible with it, but they all answer each other. This is how the web touches everything to adapt. I wish Ted V. Mikel's to continue. But more foreigners are needed. And a pirate.
