I've seen this movie in the "sneak preview" and I must admit that I do not like movies with Meryl Streep. This picture was the worst. Almost half of them did not go back in the middle of the film. I could not blame them, unless this was a real event, they did not need the second half of the picture. Before the movie went about ten years, I was looking forward to seeing credits.
