Cedric Kahn's films are not action-driven (I think of L'Ennui and Feux rouges), so it's really hard to see interspersed with some plodding attempts to give Succo character in this series of expert car series. I do not want Stefano Cassettini to be an interesting actor; Bret Favre reminds pro-athletes coaxed in the film. This looks blank, looks like a really bad deer caught on the lanterns. A real actor would have forced us to reflect Succo's identity. <br /> <br /> A small thing comes from Isild le Besco, a needy schoolgirl from Succo's storm. The interview in the police office is a surprise of a mild friar with little bit of fear in the future. Apart from Le Besco, it is very small to offer this movie.
