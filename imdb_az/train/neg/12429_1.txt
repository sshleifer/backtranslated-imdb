Recalling the dirty data of this bizarre vapid film, it's like drilling into a chest cavity with a rusty, salty spoon. Perhaps, "Home Only 2: Lost in New York" (1992) was in anticipation, but these horrible excuses for the film have never heard that one of the most shameless offers of commercialization. A boy fights against spies / terrorists when he's alone with a floral flower in Chicago alone? It's funny! Why was this movie to be done? I believe that even terrifying films will learn not the waste of time, but the experience. But this is actually a waste of time. Avoid all costs.
