The area is not so original. There was nothing new if someone had seen L'ultimo Bacio. A rich family living on the Roman agenda is boring and wrong when asking what everyone thinks about themselves. Where the story ends is simple, because it's really half an hour later. It's simple to see the morale of the Muccino movie in this movie, so the hardest parts look normal. It is enough to summarize the first two minutes of the film, and the film's purpose was not over. I saw a 30-year-old family, but I do not want to see a film that wants to show the reality, but to be able to fit into their thinking is to push more than normal ones. The Muccino is the only reason for me not to go to movies, even though the movie is moving in the right place and how it is screaming at the start of the movie. Perhaps it would be good to see the family in the truth and to put away the guilty. Morante is as intense and as usual, but unfortunately in a bad movie!
