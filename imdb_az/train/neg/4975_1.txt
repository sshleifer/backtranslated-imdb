I saw the product of Canadian / Icelandic / British 2004 "Beowulf & Grendel" and I thought it was striking and surprising - this year with 3 new Beowulf films - with excitement. We cried after hearing Viking and seeing horned helmets. They were Migration Era Swedes and Denmark, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never wear horns on their helmets (horns beat your helmet for your enemy and then facilitated your brain). There is then the 6th century Danish, but there is a Hrolfgar palace, prepared for a film about Greece or Rome. Swords and armor appear as props from the previous films shot in different historical periods. The Kingdom of Heaven had weapons that could be used by Crusaders and a character used a Windlass Steelcraft reproductive sword from Beowulf & Grendel! Outside the corner of the original epic poem, the writing was sad and completely wooden and impartial. The biggest load was a cross-armed cross, complete with vision and missile bombings, resembling something taken from Iraqi soldiers. Special effects were like a monster and mother in steroids that never broke a leaf like the Beowulf poem. Thank gods for bazooka crossbows! I can continue, but I will not.
