Amazing! Wow! I looked at the trailer for it and said "no, this is not for me". They watched my wife and friend's face on the trailer and knew it was a "child's movie". say, hallo! <br /> <br /> Then, I started watching him, I did not see all the bad guys. I was watching. I watched it until the end. what a great movie. If anything, this is a chick pee. These girls have an attitude. It's a really good movie and a bit of a love story. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Here are some of them, say can be a legend of a new city. but also of his life and works. well, to me anyway. I think that working in a bar scenario is not for me but for many people. Do not rely on trailers for this purpose - to bring these men inside.
