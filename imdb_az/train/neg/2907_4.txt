Often, Chinese critics have voted for China's biggest movie as well as Chinese movie enthusiasts from outside, and frankly I can not afford it. What I saw was one of the most common melodramas in a motionless, gentle way, with a complete kick for the hero. Wei Wei (laugh) is a young married woman who has been in the tuberculosis (Yu Åži) for the last few years. This is the Second World War era and does not make much money in a home with a wife living in Hongmei Zhang (men were rich when they married). In the past, his best friend (Wei Li) came in, and he had been his wife's spouse when he was a teenager. She thinks her husband has escaped with her, but she thinks that her husband can attract her brother. It did not expect the establishment and this would not go anywhere. I really saw the remake managed by Blue Kite Director Zhuangzhuang Tian. It takes half an hour and is actually very boring, but at least it was pretty. This is supposedly classic quite unbearable.
