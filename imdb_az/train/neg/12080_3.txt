I'm both an admirer of Shakespeare and MST3K, so I waited anxiously to see this episode. I will comment on the first film, then the MST3K episode. The recipe of this film: talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare materials and $ 1.25 budget. Mix them all, then drain all their lives and movements and not die. Serve in large, flat stone crunchy cold. I give a film of 10 to 3 because the actors are deserving to get at least a bit of credit. Ok, now the MST3K episode. I'll admit it, I saw it for the first time, and I got up and down. I understand that the reaction of many other grandchildren. But for the second time, I had many clever references and good lines that I had missed for the first time. The plot of this episode: Listen carefully! There are several reviews for each sale. Give me a second chance, and what would I say? MST3K Episode: 10 to 7 1/2.
