When I saw the cover of the video library, I thought it was a tension. Author: As an author, did I think of a 'food' as I tried to do so? Not really. What was it? It was a very medium-sized film with a great potential and a very good orientation, but it dropped off from a stunning story, without the mid-level and endless strengths, and seemed decisive for a number of points but delivered the best performance of the overall cast. Good colors, beautiful hi-tech materials, beautiful cinematography with beautiful scenes, but flee from where he was and where he was. And quickly tweak it quickly with a feeling. OK to watch if there is anything else on the TV.
