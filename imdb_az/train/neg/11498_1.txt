Gadar is an example of Bollywood's oldest overrated film. Anil Sharman gives the film a garbage movie for the filmmaking period. Songs are missed and are not the songs you do not want to hear in your car with a full voice. Sunny Deol is famous for preparing daft movies, which burns about 100 bad guys. He even opens a metal prison door (India) and begins a moving move (Teesri Aankh). Sunny Deol can make about 50 acts of betrayal. But I'm sure most people already know it. The sun gives a repetitive miserable performance of the same kind. A person who claims to be fighting against his country by applying violence. Amisha Patel is dead sex hands with an incredible body that I can love for my bone. But the film was not able to escape the disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes, she is not in this movie. Maybe a Muslim was playing, but he did not behave in the same way. In general, this is a poor show all the way, I'm sure that Bollywood actor will appeal to some people who love to beat 100 kids. Give me some time.
