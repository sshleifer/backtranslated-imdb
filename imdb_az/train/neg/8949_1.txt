A few weeks ago, I read the classic George Orwell novel in 1984. I was interested in it and thought it was one of the best books I recently read. When I rented a DVD, this compatibility was measured. Unfortunately, the film did not come close to the creation of the air or to the development of the characters in the book by Orwell's masterpiece. The director thinks that everybody watching the film is reading a book because he does not try to show how characters operate and how they feel. John Hurt, who plays the main role, can not go anywhere and can not function anymore. We can not really find out what he is doing or what he forbids, or what the political climate is and why he does not want the rebellion of the main character. This book can not be justified in a film format without a proper narration, and the explanation of the political system that dominates the characters and the shortcomings of those who are missing are the biggest drawbacks of this film. In addition, John Hurt won a 15-year-old look at the prediction that 39-year-old Winston would describe. In addition, the remainder of the remainder was well-chosen in a more positive note. It's pretty badly put on a horrificly adapted movie with the wrong actor. -Brian O.
