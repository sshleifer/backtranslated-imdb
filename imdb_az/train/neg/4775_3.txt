How full of wasting your time. The film starts as a clone of the Saw series, but with a worse player. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely terrible. The latter is ridiculous and the story is no twist, not surprises and just a bad worse ending. I liked some of the symbols and hoped to eventually integrate into everything. It just does not happen. This is a general "Wrestler" ending with none of the best players. I do not believe it's time I spent watching. Some people are not "fun" as they put it. A person in a mask abducts and hinders the affiliated people. The connection stretches and he was hit primarily by the main actress.
