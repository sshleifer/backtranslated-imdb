In order to avoid mixing with Lewis Teague's film "Alligator" (1980), this "Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano", an exotic trilogy around Sergio Martino ("L 'Isola degli uomini pesce" not "La Montagna del dio cannibale"). When watching "Jaws" without a doubt, the script does not make any use. The creature is laughable and the victim is simply cunning. The bloody tone of Stelvio Cipriani shows that these reptile tourists exhibit the adventures presented by the reindeer as an open item. It's not really exciting, but actually saddened! If the racism is not inspired by the local people's dialogues and looks, we can find this kind of flicker very funny. Soon giggling stands in favor of a sense of concern that witnessed such a patronage. We can give excuses for bad movies and poor currencies, but it's not a mentality. Never!
