This is the worst I've seen in the last 5 years. It is surprising that the two major characters in this film are admirable for brilliant actresses to behave in a worthless peace of mind in the trash can. The film is aggression / beating and revenge genre. The couple went to the party and shot a deer on the road and went to finish it when a jeep full of evil men came. He did not go to his car, but instead tried to control the engine of the car that betrayed him and he was thrown out of the network for aggression and was beaten well. Once he was in the house of his ancestors, and one of the bad guys took so many rifles and wanted to kill him ... Such a fool scenario! Bellow Hollywood! He was opposed to revenge, but he had "raped him" and killed them all, saying, "They laughed at him." But once he was glad to pounce on the rifle in the minds of the bad guys inside the house, and foolish, and executed the wicked man. Personally, I think the filmmaker thinks the money will be exhausted before finishing it, because the film's sponsor obviously seeks to repay the money, even though it is not a big surprise to anyone who has been harassed by the film. LoL This film is not for people who are harassing them because they will not see what they are looking for ... This director should be forbidden ... This is the reason I love personally and because of the fact that the trash is prepared by the British cinema. Do not do yourself, there are better things to watch in a foolish scenario ...
