I do not want to comment on many movies under the Command of the Universe .. I still do not want to comment on a movie I will not talk about for a minute .. This movie basically takes two hours of Dafo's character - almost exactly to die. The only surprise in this movie is that you do not have enough tips or character knowledge to surprise. <br /> <br /> Willem Dafoe is the perfect actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent player. But this movie just sucked. Slow film was not bad, just bad. The sketchy plot, mixed with the ramblings of the anamorphic details, is not drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot, except that it emphasizes a number of similarities from the perspective. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but it has forced me to sleep as fun. (Seriously, I fell asleep and had to watch the movie again - it was even more heartwarming). In general, I do not want negative comments or commentaries on others' works, but this film guarantees each other. . It is very bad that these great players are embarrassed with this final result.
