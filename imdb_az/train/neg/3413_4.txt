1-nd Watch 12/26/2008 - Dir-Eugene Levy: Sparkling comedy laughs little at the mystery of crime. The film appears based on the previous Italian movie, but was rewritten by two famous American romantic comedy writers. But Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers did not compare this with any other effort. This story is about some of the few Americans traveling abroad and traveling by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who are pushing for a lost dog and hoping to make a donation on a premium after seeing an ad for the return of the dachsund. After trying to repatriate her, they saw that she was holding her hand at the garage door in her living room and added to the rest of the body of the woman who intended to give them money. They are saddened and await the murder, by telling the truth that they are resorting to the police and escaping from the scene. The other characters in the film will be welcomed on a train and Monte Carlo will hang around the gambling tour and do different things for the story. Other cast members include John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After receiving information about the death of the police, they start to ask the main symbols and, of course, try to understand what is happening. None of the actors mentioned earlier, despite some fun moments given by the Belushi / Shepherd couple, can not take this movie out of the country. This is not a terrible movie, it's just not good. There are many average movies and just one other for this heap. Try it out, you probably will not be.
