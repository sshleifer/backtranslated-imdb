This film is intended to be a demographic character. Some reviewers assume that the film is psychologically deep because this distortion is described; In fact, taking into consideration the righteous materials, it is staggeringly tedious and slippery without any motive. What is the main character? You will not find the script. Try the Bunel's Belle de Jour (and a fun movie) for a better treatment of the same subject.
