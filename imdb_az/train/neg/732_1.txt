A young boy kills his mother and his father hangs himself. After 20 years, he comes together to betray him and does not come out as his father. All the stock symbols are: beautiful pair; "funny" man; harsh (sensitive) header; smart girl (she wears goggles - we know how to do it); nerd and two non-personal blondes. All these are stupid wooden statues that kill life (not asking) and people. <br /> <br /> Some bad scenes can do that! <br /> <br /> Dialogue is very strange, the player is bad (except Betsy) Palmer - why Betsy?) And the murders are not foolish and / or imagined. My favorite scene is to beat the boy in the bed to show that the two men are sexually active and that the statue is fully dressed. A real, dirty, horrible film of horror. Avoid all costs.
