<br /> <br /> A young teacher in a Catholic school following the RAWANDAN genocide around the film is explained. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a brief explanation of past history and competition. Rawanda. Then, a young teacher jumps to the story as he says in the eyes of a young idealist, "NEW COMER" who does not accept the life or situation very seriously. As he and his driver approached a road block, his driver, I.D. This is a momentous moment and the driver will be killed without knowing that he is not able to identify him as a tribe. And that's how it looks at the story of chaos and goes around it. Suddenly every Rawandan (including his driver) was involved and understood that European soldiers and tourists were unable to help. Mass cameras can not stop the machete and hit many machete wielding militias. The captain comes out of the captain of the army, who will go to shoot dogs who are eating dead bodies around the compound, but will not shoot the Militia-men who kill the people around him. In fact, they did not shoot at soldiers yet. Finally, he did not face the imminent death of the boy who said that he was desperate for the situation and the evacuation team, who said he wanted to give up a seat for one of the intended victims <br /> <br /> This is a characteristic of more character investigations and it is more than just a story about the genocide of RAWANDA to come to Jesus for another character. This film should not have been involved in RAWANDA, which could happen at any time in any of the Genocidal hell holes in the world.
