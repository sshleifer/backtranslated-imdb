This is a typical example of technically high-level directors of video clips / ads trying to capture the full feature length movie. On the one hand, the image, camera, lighting, CGI and even the sound are highly polished and have a really "expensive" look and feel. Even actors can show some potential - even to the point where the best player can not hide a bad field. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad structure, not even something. <br /> <br /> Thus, 50% of the dialogue was "What was hell?", "What was it?" and "What was hell?". Even though there are no characters or viewers, an answer is provided with the slightest tip. In most other dialogues, the dialogue feels that there is no form of dialogue and that actors should freely sign up for a surface that has never been explained to them. <br /> <br /> Only one reason for Skye Bennett's performance could be so good that her character as an autistic girl did not allow the tragic terrible dialogue lines that she was dealing with with other actresses. So he was able to simply show players' talent, and the rest could not move. I want to say that there is no actor in the world that can be prepared for such a dialogue: <br /> I: Is it true, huh? Emily: stop. I: A mass psychosis, huh? Jon: Someone should control this situation. Ben: This situation can not be controlled. Not you, but nobody. Emily: No, you do not. I: No. <br /> <br /> The walnut boom came to me. But not horrific, it's a terrible attempt. In some moments, I was ashamed to add actors to this vita. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for the perfect technical work.
