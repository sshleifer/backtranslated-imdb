I'm the director's nephew. It's been a few years to get a copy of this movie, and I can confirm that this is really one of the worst films of all time. My uncle did not have a copy anymore (I asked). <br /> <br /> At present the film's average rating is 1.9 / 10. <strong> <p> <p> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Back to top <br /> <br /> Even respecting 100 headers at the bottom of the movie does not come. <br /> In any case, this year I give a copy of the movie to family members for holiday gifts. Best / Worst Gift?
