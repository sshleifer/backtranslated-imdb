After seeing Versus before, Alive had great expectations. The film behind the DVD pocket was promising. Alive was not enough. Very slow development. Potentially loaded with cast and cool imagery. Stage was interesting, but costs were not eliminated. In the end, we can do a lot more. Most of the film is just "around it". To be honest, the three of us started watching this movie and watching for 50 minutes, so we struggled to finish it. It really needed more shock elements. If you are looking for Ichi the Killer or Versus-type battles, save yourself a bit of defeat and save a bit.
