I've always thought of having the largest box office usually flops, but after 80 days and after a remake of the Thunderbirds world, I'm starting to doubt. Based on a puppet show about a family of astronauts using space art missiles, space art, and state-of-the-art rescue for people who are unaware of various disasters (falling bridges, buried buildings, etc.) every week. Yes, the puppets went to replace Spy Kids (replacing them with more lifeless teenagers) and without such signs - just a nice rescue and shameless imagination, no signs of entertainment or fun. Young Tracey feels leaving all the prosperity that we never see in what other Traceys do, because we do not let him play with real rocket until he passes the exam. a ghost neo-Nazi band looks like a band with a bit of characteristic among them - the rest of the family, when it comes to its lucidity, brightly grounded on a beautiful tropical island (! a torment), closed in a bunch of identikit bleach-blondes and a phone running around the jungle The rage, nephew-comedy relief is the day by day, erasing the villains, dousing them in a hose and dousing them for the evil action. <br /> <br / Good spots are far less. One of them is the main focus of the film. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Ben Kingsley's career is down performance show? The above-mentioned intimate comedy aid sidekicks to win the sympathy of the Children's Film Foundation in the worst case? Is there a complete lack of action and impression in the fantastic movie about $ 70 million? Horrible writing, lifeless direction, angry immorality? But most importantly, it is a fact that protects the film. Do not forget about life lessons and remember the sense of peg, talking to the target audience, knowing that a child's movie is doing and throwing it to fifth jokes and routines. Children who have mastered the art of speech will offend only recently. <br /> <br /> The biggest flop in the history of English movie (not even pressure and marketing costs), this movie could be sent to an early bed without food as a favorite punishment for the children. can only be watched if there is an object lesson to avoid just a summer movie.
