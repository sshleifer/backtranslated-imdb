I was only watching the Amazing Melody for the second time and even worse than the first watcher. I do not understand why it has become such a "cult classic". The opening scene looks promising, the fat nurse works for blood drops and dear life. One of the things that happens after this is the moth erupting around some of the forests and houses, despite the slowing down of their life as astronauts. Make-up is pretty good, and its mellow face looks quite real. When a person in a river throws his head, there is a cool scene and it slips until the rocks fall and reach a waterfall where it is opened. Many scenes are shot in the dark and you will not really see what is happening. At least I did not have much to look at at the Vipco DVD. <br /> No, the Incredible Melancholy Man is not that big. I'll give it a brand name for the cheese, but it's about it. If you want a TRUE fantastic / horror religious classic, watch The Deadly Spawn instead!
