this film resembles the Dark Waterfall and Boogeyman (2005), and is graphic than either of them, or is not as good as either slow or sufficiently predictable. But also in the shadows of the Savior and Amityville Horror.plus, we get some fresh wet flavors thrown into the mix and some of these scenes are a hodgepodge of almost every thing motivational / inspirational sermon.really, this movie. Although the makeup effects, the makeup effects are not very realistic. In fact, they all seem to be kinase cheap.aside, some really terrifying clich√© dialogues. And when I can not say, but there are points that are not true or convincing, given the circumstances of the actions of several characters. Indeed, nobody will act in this way. You watch this movie, you know what I mean. There are also some illegal nudity for sake.it of nudity. It was not just a good thing. In fact, this film was very worthy, though, after attentively following the arguments, despite the allegation, the claim is not good. Judgment for the fairy fairy: 4/10
