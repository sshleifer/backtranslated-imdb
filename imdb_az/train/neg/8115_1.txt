This movie watched the most terrible film I never had, and I had to watch it and because it was for the school, there was no way to stop it! Of course, the story was good ... but I found the terrible player! Marianne Jean-Baptiste was an exception, and I thought her performance was wonderful. Without it, I'm not sure that he can watch the movie. Every time I heard I heard someone say "do not worry"! One day they attacked the client because they said "they". <br /> <br /> I remember one of the worst half hours of my life. <br /> <br /> (This is my opinion, apologies for not betraying anyone)
