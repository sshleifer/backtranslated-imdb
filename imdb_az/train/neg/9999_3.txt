This is the kind of movie that I have always looked at my enemies, but it's not bloody. <br /> <br /> Some militants have fled Boeing-747. (At least at least, Boeing missed a good portion of the Pentagon.) The plane landed in the Bermuda triangle and buried in the bottom of the post-actual submarine suddenly. <br /> <br /> This is one of all the stars <br /> <br /> "We are in our own!" says pilot Jack Lemon. That's right. Except George Kennedy. <br /> <br /> So watch another movie. Oh, the "airport" is not original. This is not good either. Instead, watch a good flick about jammed airplanes like "Phoenix Flight".
