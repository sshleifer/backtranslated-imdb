I sat down to watch this movie with my little friends. My expectations are quite low. If I had honestly been able to watch the genre of this movie and have a comedy, humor had been completely abandoned. The field was not available and the player was heartfelt. My friends and we were able to watch this movie about 30-40 minutes, we begged him to take the video store back immediately. I do not recommend this movie to anyone until I try to watch the worst movies of all time. Honestly, I do not know how this movie happened in theaters for more than a day, and I'm not interested in anymore, and I do not understand that everyone wants to watch it, not interested in the famous actresses / players. This research is not a joke, and I honestly may have been perhaps the worst movie ever. This is, of course, the worst movie to sit.
