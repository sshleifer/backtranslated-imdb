Over time, the DVD version of this forgotten 1976 music melodrama, as well as the Supremes inspiration, has been instrumental in capitalizing on the long-awaited Dreamgirls movie version. Broadway was released five years before the Dreamgirls and was partly built at the same time, it is mostly black, and there is a story that reverberates around a dream and coming girl band, and here's the similarity ends. Joel Schumacher appears grittier on the surface of this movie before he became a major director of the main studio product ("Batman Forever", "The Phantom of the Opera"). However, Schumacher weakens the story and character development by placing clich√©s in abundance and with an eye liner. <br /> <br /> The story is as follows: <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < With little interest to set up musical numbers, Sam O'Steen, a high-class movie editor, produces a non-founder director, a low-budget television movie with an episodic epizodic structure. three Harlem sisters - sexy sisters, self-righteous Delores and sweet Sparkle - they sing in the church chorus, speak well, but good-natured boys get acquainted with Stix and Levi, and then find their first success as a group of first - after having called their hearts a cardinal quintet and then Sister and Like a weird trio known as Sisters. But naturally, there are unusual problems for the group - Brother is dealing with Satin Struthers, the worst drug dealer who eats and smokes it with cocaine; Levin went to the prison to get a drug addict for Satin; Stix was frustrated by failure and uncertainly turned into some Jewish ships for financial aid; Delores are just flattened; and the poor little Sparkle should decide what the future wants. R & B has written a great Curtis Mayfield atmosphere songs, a great attractive, first and foremost R & B, "Seeing the Heart," a real winner. <br /> <br /> Strong casting does its best in flawless conditions. Lonette McKee's sister's attempt to have a tragic figure, turns into a hamburger sidewalk, including the sad merry Billie Holliday. Philip Michael Thomas and Dorian Harewood, before drawing a major hit on primitive television, Stix and Levi describe themselves as long as they are not very reliable. The best job comes from a relatively silent era, like Irene Cara, who has been "fame" from the start, despite the unwavering shock of the girl's ill-fated mother and her head role (although her hairstyle and hair stylist will be on the final stage). The DVD was completed with a noisy noise from the original theater novel by Dj Casey Kasem and not from the original filming, but in 1976, Soundtrack comes with a bonus CD of five of the film featured by Aretha Franklin in 1976. It's not a terrible film, but the curio shortage that is taking place to cover the same places as "Dreamgirls" is quite interesting.
