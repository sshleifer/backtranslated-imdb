"Everything can be a great documentary"? One is deaf, dumb, and cordial. Everything is just the meaning, the mind, the visual style and the interesting subject. Besides. . <br /> Seriously, volken. This is a totally unfounded movie. An adventure doctrine that has no adventure, a warlike warrant without a warlike sentiment, a meeting without a mind-boggling. It does not mean nothing, it does not feel like anything and has a secret message that is totally unimportant. Not many IMDb fans! Of course, there will not be any movie that plays a major role in the big Skip Lipman, no culture, no intelligence, no intelligence (no corrosive adolescent emotions), and no known human emotions? just adrenaline. "Darkon" is not a movie - it's a panic attack! Avoid it. There are so many real documentary films and there is very little time to spend on life in the bathroom like "Darkon".
