What was the cure? All of these were wearing something in the late 70's in the early 80's. Cars were even outdated. The school was obsolete. The dance clothes were outdated, and the hospital resembled one of the 40's, dresses and wooden ladders and items. Nothing in the whole film took place in 1991. My mother laughs, "Geeeee od, was this film MADE?" When we pressed the "INFO BUTTON" button remotely, I was convinced that in 1991, the font should be! Did not anyone notice it? FAVORI tells me, my wife, when she tells her uppity muck on the phone about the reverse cross on the mirror, and only says, "Well, look, I have a congressional meeting, then this topic." This line was just classic. CONTACTS! The favorite part of my mother was when she gave her book "The Devil's Sons" to her Rottweiler. My mother said, "What a Rottweiler of what Satan needs Spawn" He clutching their chests of people who collapsed in all the churches as well. Another favorite part was a boy in a school park, moving 5km / hour to the garbage truck / dump truck / preloader. It only took about 20 seconds to stop the car ... but it just continued with a hollow look. So how fast can you go to school park?!?! Whatever!
