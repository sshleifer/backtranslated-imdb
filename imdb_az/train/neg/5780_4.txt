I really like this movie and I've been following all the ways I'm thinking of getting better. Do not take me wrong, it's not the worst flicker, but it did not fit into its potential. The stage is good, the cast is huge (I'm pumped to witness the return of David Naughton, especially) and God can love them and tell everyone what he's trying to do. It is back again and again many times. "Brutal Massacre" reminded only that Christopher Guest could do Christopher Guest films and should not forget that he tried to do the same thing even though he appeared to be easy. Naughton and Brian O'Halloran are fantastic in this regard and more often ... they get 4 stars from me. I suspect that horror will be a "Spinal Tap" that you can control a boy named Spinal Tap.
