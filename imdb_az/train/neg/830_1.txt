I really do not understand all these positive reviews. This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen and I do not want to be pessimistic. <br /> <br /> Eva Mendez is hot, but terribly in this movie. But I do not think it's his fault, but the directors. For some reason, everything was able to appear artificial; <br /> <br /> The star I give is just a bad idea for the idea behind the movie. <br /> <br /> Check out Fallini, Woody Allen, or some David Lynch.
