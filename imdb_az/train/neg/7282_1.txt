The National Lamp was once a magical magazine. The hippie's days of the 60s or the Valentine's Day and the Valentine's Day (when enriched with plenty of naked fathers) have a lot to do with your date of birth, but everybody was killed in the early eighties at the place where they had escaped the sparks of anarchic humor, and this film has drawn more spaces on the trunk than victims and increasingly terrible spin-off notes. On the edge of a beautiful illustrated headlamp range, there is nothing to offer this single-stubborn stinkbug. From the amazing opening segments, if you hope that everything in the "My Growth" section will achieve better, more challenging success - they do not. A woman who was brutally aggressively harassed by a woman's oil was a comedian whose golden head was worthy of a dog cat with an accusation. If there are no continental ghost blows, the ragbag, which does not fit into the negatives, strange ideas and strange speeches, can serve some purpose.
