This movie sounded as a good organization: 9 people were scared to win one million dollars. Unfortunately, this is not a good movie. There are many scenes, such as the dance scene, which are very long and really meaningless. Several scenes are an excuse to show the camera in the body of the woman. Acting is bad, but some lines are entertaining in their horror. It's really odd that it's a 5-minute west to the end of the film and, in the end, it's not logical for the corners of the movie to the rest of the film. The director simply added the film to the crew because he thought he would look cool and did not ignore the film until this point. It just did not mean much. The only creepy thing was the old people dancing in the hall, but it did not go up to the rest of the confusion.
