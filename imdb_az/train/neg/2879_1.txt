This was the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of bad movies. First, I'm from Kansas, this movie is not part of the truth. He called it BTK and organized the rest. Also, I look at someone like that, I just bought $ 20, and here's a movie, yes, do not worry about exploring btk, just create something. No serious clean dookie should not see this movie. BTK did not do any of these things to sacrifice the cows' scenes and sacrifices to describe the animal slaughter, but not the movie, but this God does not see the terrible movie for love of God. Those made for television are better and more accurate
