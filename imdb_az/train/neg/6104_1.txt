"Fungicide" is probably the most inadequate, embarrassing, pessimistic "film" I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid to drown creativity I, in fact, believe in such things. I'm sure that the producers of "film", yes, the "movie" (which is not in the budget) blocked the budget, but in this case they were not really concerned. <br /> <br /> "The film was not like me, it was not." "Citizen Kane" or something we look forward to. Perhaps, I was expecting a bit of budget, perhaps an invention of modesty, a fun sign, and even some energy. <br /> <br /> Yes, our antihero scientist, working in the basement of our parents, mixes some goo in a bowl. As you can see, this is the ultimate result of a high-level science research year. His parents send him to a strange hotel type outside to relax. There are many terrible people to write there. In any case, the scientist throws the test tube to some fungus - soon grow fungi and kill some people. (Wow, I commit suicide while writing the artistic summary). Our heroes keep one day burning a barrel of balsamic vinegar (adding a "fuse" - really a string piece - to him). The Barrels will inevitably explode all mushrooms, with the power of a small nuclear weapon. Last. <br /> <br /> This summary is as good as the "movie" (actually, it's more interesting). It really did not have this stage of development (for me, a plot line written behind the envelope inside the shell). One should go to the truth and shake a strong shaking and say "No". <br /> <br /> And these "special" effects. Yes, they're not "special". This CGI was crazy. And I believe only a bicycle pump will be the summit of modern technologies. And the mushroom monsters are not in the style of home computer graphic package in 1984, they are represented by coloring actors throughout the coverage of a layer (I'm a kid). <br /> <br /> One of the most baseless things is his laziness about the movie. This can be summed up by a scene that spins the hero weapons (a la Clint Eastwood) and then fails to rush into the pockets. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, there would be a few retreats and retreats, but it could be left out - it's really weak. <br /> <br /> I do not believe the money spent on garbage thrown into this camera is spent. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers hang on their heads ashamed and should avoid going fifty meters away from any movie device. <br /> <br /> I also mistakenly think that the friends and family of the producers are cunning high rated user ratings that give IMDb and "sensitive" assessments and "incomplete" images of the movie. "Fungicide" is definitely a transvestite film. Mr. Vaskavaj is too, too stupid or too, very keen.
