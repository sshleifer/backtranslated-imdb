This is one of the B minus films, labeled as a movie core, with the hope of creating something that is not deprived of something. All aspects of the film - scenario, actor, direction - are in the middle. Throne with three potential movements. I think John Dall is about to be in the movie business, but someone understands that sometimes she has little talent, and that's why she's done a television job. Generally horrible, Lee J Cobb can not rise above the poor script and the poorer direction. Jane Wyatt should be femme fatale, but the audience does not come to a convincing place. There are two delicate cars in the movie. John Dallin is going to John Dallin for being particularly strange. DVD transmission is typical Alpha.
