I launched the weekend Hybrid. What a disappointment! A stupid attempt at a tele-movie. The guy they bought for the apparatus was absolutely weak and he looked like it had eaten the mint cups (did so much) ... on the back! He had a lot of players, but I feel that the actor trusts so much because his work is in no danger. The wise Indian American Chicken must be one of the obstacles facing the worst floods we can see. Talk about a rare cow! She had smiled once for the entire movie, and I think she was in a sexual relationship. Sex scene was also clever. <br /> <br /> The end of everything, and it's a big hate, on the coating and in the DVD menu, the victims are digitally drawn. The sharp teeth on the boy. They will not be able to see the movie. :(
