or: this bird? Is this an airplane? No, look ... This is a disaster! or: There is no need to look at the sky. <br /> <br /> Or: (... OK, that's enough.) If the singer tries to get a romantic title like a film to break the box office record, The SR structure can not do this, the dark and limited color scheme (I would say "wishi-washi"), dull ordinary dialogues, clown with cutting-edge technology, missing entertainment and magic, and so on. <br /> <br /> Generally, the main thing in a character as a national leader is that he is a super hero. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <i> Love problem and sorry sad depressive Supersoftie can be maximal only 2:40 length is a Superman movie all the time, because it is no longer superman or super hero movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a big difference. <br /> <br /> This film, on the other hand, looks like a public research (and very bad and boring) in every 30 minutes it flies around. <br /> <br /> A joke. Holy skyscrapers, this Superman, so give Supervillains, Superaction and most importantly Superfun. <br /> <br /> We do not want LIFE! Singer, if you lose your soul until 2:40 and you unfortunately want to love the drama of anxiety about people? <br /> <br /> They say: Superman returns. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the singer tried to kill the legend without kryptonite, but a bad movie can not do it. <br /> <br /> Next singer (and Warner Brothers), make a superhero movie, whether it's a depressive superlam soap, or not. A superhero movie is a very entertaining and magical fantasy fantasy. <br /> <br /> This film looks like a cheaper box with a super cap. Yes, there are all kinds of technics, yes, there are many small talks, some jokes, one-touch movement scenes, and so on. There are, however, all those bad numbers, which are similar to each other, are their poor quality. <br /> <br /> This is not a lot of boring patchwork and worst movies I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> The fun casting strategy can last for the next 25 years). Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old star reporter, looks like 19. Superman was just five years away, lying six years ago, so 16 years old (looks like 13) and daily planet reporter "I'm going through a night with a superman". Warner Brothers, there's a lot. <br /> <br /> Routh is not too bad, he plays a little wooden, but the whole film is wooden, so ...? Temporary goodness is Martian and sometimes poseydi. Remaining, do not forget. <br /> <br /> It was easily moving with Reeve / Hackman / Kidder entertainment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What should be the hell out of the Caucasus? The problem here is not a joke, it's serious. The next time the Spiderman or Batman or Ironman falls and rises as Jesus or the angels? Otherwise, they speak directly to God. Why not ? They are heroic every day, saving lives. So every week, at least one conversation with God should be possible ... Oh, my God. <br /> <br /> Maybe this is not a reality film, but a weird parallel universe. <br /> <br /> The depressive flicker of this evidence for the warlords is likely to be the greatest disaster in history. <br /> <br /> I understand how difficult it is to create and carry some messages or feelings, but just missing and unfortunately the people are new and thousands of movies or TV shows are better, too old or magnolia new ones. And the flying frogs, of course, were more effective than the supermen, of course, from this flying super-woman. <br /> Singer and WB, this is simply nothing. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it's more than anything, which (comic / super heroism) resembles a black hole that destroys passions for movies and takes three hours of our lives. Smilla's younger brother. (Hulk is very angry and green as well).
