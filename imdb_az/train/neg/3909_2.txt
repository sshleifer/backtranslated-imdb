In my movie, I had a movie with my favorite actresses, Meryl Streep, and Wynona Ryder, and I went through the roof! But after watching this stupid movie I've had a severe fall and still has a bruise. Jeremy Irons (an actor I am still amazed at after this disappointment) was simply terrible. His family, like a sibling played by Glenn Close, was like a shit. I have not been closely acquainted with any characters and I'm not prude, but sex scenes were really unnecessary, or they might have been similar to each other. The characters of Wynona and Antonio were more developed and romanticism could have been more passionate. What was Meryl's character and his "mystic powers"? Why did not they go so far? There are many dead in this movie, and the bottom line is a really bad movie, and here's a lot of talent.
