Finally, last night in London, it was necessary to be vigilant, cheerful, sexless and deprived of any real humor. I do not really know where to begin with when I'm entertained with this strange respect, it really did not move me. The player is shocking hammy, there is no original music, most of the suits are a "ridiculous" after six months after Nic Cage (which will not come to my lover enough) at Disney, as the spectator on the island with Cage and the 'baddies' out of comedy, was ridiculous suppression. I do not believe I was seeing such a strange remake that reminded me of something strange as the Clarion Strike commentary of Hollywood in the eighties of the Comic Strip!
