I mixed all the ways through this movie. Above all, the ironic field is very small with Parson's story. Hollywood tried to create a comedy trailer for the movie. <br /> <br /> Do nothing to make this movie clear. In his head and kidnapping, his name is used as a tram to just a little budget surveillance film, Parsons is an open attempt to capture a few dollars from his Parsons heritage and his fan base. <br /> <br /> Gram's father died in 1973 and was the protagonist of other global heroes, none of which has anything to do with the Grams' death or death. <br /> <br /> If you are a Gramian fan, watch this movie. I wish it was not. It is grieved that something like a shameful fodder is seen. I have heard that the hero returned to his grave playing the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are not familiar with Gram's life and heritage, do not see anything like Gram's representative in this movie. <br /> I can not say enough bad things about this movie. Gram was alive and would have killed himself if he saw this movie. He may have been afraid if he knew he was the result of this film.
