Hi, I'm a friend of the heart attack movies and when I hit Darkwolf's head on the shelves, I noticed that at least hmm was a simple and beautiful name. Althou ... why did not I hear it? <br /> <br /> First of all, the film begins with greens. There are many breasts. Busts went pretty much to this movie budget. <br /> <br /> So the mysterious dandelion character (a little spoiler ahead, but really kind ...) is your daily routine biker. It is not even super-difficult, but as an old-fashioned woman says in the film, "she is stronger and more dangerous than you ever had before." Describing only one type of tattoo biker type. Pretty original. I first appeared twice when using "red glowing eyes" SPECIAL EFFECT! That is, my God, "from the seventies, uses the effect of" plant-red-dot-eyes-computer ", here it looks ugly ... And do not start with deceit 3D-CGI As it was said before, bad and old video game. <br /> <br /> Finally, I look at similar movies, and they often create a werewolf - DarkWolf also builds werewolfworld on the legends of hybrid worms and ancient bloody legends. immediately after the "dark camp kills someone who touches the girl" starts with a violent attack, which does not give any meaning, even why they even have difficulty telling us the rules of killing, even when they do not play ... Aplus, handycam or something, mostly floors and walls It's a bit terrible, but it's partly okay but when the worm is open to everyone, basically putting his hand on the victims, this is not a trick for me ... <br /> <br /> Of course, WHAT does the money gives you A small plain-to-video horrortitles make these heaps, they are not even sad, even funny-bad filthy movies.
