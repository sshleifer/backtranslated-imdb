This is a terrible film, not a scene, but a sense of reality. <br /> <br /> William Holden (in this role was very sad to see it) in the filmmaking was 55, but he plays in the 40s and looks like it was in the 1960s. Kay Lenz was 20 years old and was written to find him strangely attractive. Holden's character is the same age as Clint Eastwood, the dog at the edge of the road, by accidentally - from the early 60's to the hippie cold peaks: the bachelor's pace, the hi-fi Dinner in Yamashira. Unlike some movies, the film is heroically discharged and hopes to find the jackpots of old rats, the free souls of the Sun and Laurel Canyon, and the vulgar and sensitive cars. <br /> <br /> Ugh. Youth culture was so hopeless. Bill Holden was very hopeless for the youth, and he took that embarrassing part.
