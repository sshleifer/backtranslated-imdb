My comment refers to the Russian version of Space Race, SpaceShip, shown on April 10-13, 2006 on the First Channel of Russia. Bad translation has broken some details, but I'm not sure. The number of actual errors is that it is impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of the first rockets). The US half of the film contains such errors and gaps. The audience has not started from the US V-2 / A-4. Three different Jupiter C missiles have the same serial number 'UE'. Apollo 1 month and so on. It will start up. Everyone in Russia half is laughable. Korolev is afraid of NKVD, Qlushko is a saboteur and a traitor, a Mischi alcoholic and so on. There is no motivation, no life. Uniforms and ornaments are terrifying. Gagarin sings a charming song waiting for it to begin (I think this is specifically for the Russian version).
