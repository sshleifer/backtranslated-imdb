This starred British / Spanish joint venture looks great, we can see it. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all of them are quite broken, so it seems like talking to each other. The author, Robert Parrish, is surprised by the widescreen process that he uses both sides of the screen, as it is seen that several films are filmed poorly and are scanned like this. Another user says that we see all the residents of a church that was murdered first; not one of my copies. The villagers who shot down a rifle have some cuts, a Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau point out. We do not know what happens with Don Kardes (Savalas) if we find no evidence that the show is really a priest, even though I suspect that Kojak is being called to the star's house because the course seems to be self-evident. And Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is a strange flashback sequence dancing around a bowler hat and a bad costume in the tradition of some great English music hall, not just by Johnny Horton, here's the NEW ORLEANS BATTLE, in the 1960s, previously unseen words. There is now a great place, a great old castle, a Escher-type staircase, a beautiful scene by Robert Shaw, and a great performance like Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savalas's Telly Savalas. I really did not like this movie, but I did not see it exactly. Look for the widescreen version and I'll give you my decision later.
