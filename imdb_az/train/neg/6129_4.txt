While talking about this movie and POWER MAN, I would not have put Harry Langdon in the list of great comedians in the same year. There simply is not enough there. Perhaps he set out to develop his style, but his first big successes were taken seriously and sabotaged himself. Anyway, her advice reminds more funny men, but Keaton's acrobatic skills and Lloyd's true inventions are not. It also violates its identity as it tends to be a tramp character and goes on walking. Its trademarks tend to react to disaster, touching the tip of its finger, touching the tip of his finger, touching his childhood with innocence, courage and striking looks, touching his lips or touching his lips. The comedy in Langdon leads to the fate of various obstacles in his path that he tries to overcome with a little physicism, such as in an unhappy or naive manner, or with an upcoming hurricane, raising one foot to four or dodging a rock on both sides. In this story, he is succeeded by a shoemaker who is involved in a crossover racing race to promote his company's shoes. There is nothing better than the Big Three here.
