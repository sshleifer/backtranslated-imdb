The story is so clear that Netflix sent my DVDs late, so they went to the analogue rental, known as "Blockbuster Video". True bad, they have 150 copies of the latest topical movies, but I do not want to see any of them. That's why I saw it on the shelter of the BTK Killer. I love watching movies based on serial killings. Just because I understand only a portion of humanity, I would like to see such things. Anyway, when I put it on DVD and suddenly I sipped it first. I am b.f. I sat down with him and we asked, "What's this?" We are not like. Unusual camera work, horrible action, the first scene where a woman killed, is surprising that she can calm down instead of calmness. Does the director have a shortage for this crap? There is nothing decent about this "movie." Does the director say "you have a freakin" triangle? "Every single hit was somewhat unstable, and music was terrible, and they decided to make a movie one day, and they probably gathered WalMart to collect people and make" move. "It's just horrific. your leadership hobby - do not do what you have to live, do not give DVD kidney stores for movie buffs like myself.If you are a party, it is better at home for your friends and avoid anything interesting to entertain them ... Then BTK Killers will release your movie and " Would you like to see it? "
