As usual, most of the IMDb is a more significant indicator of the value of the movie, instead of the "weighted average". In this case, most people give him "one". How true are they! To begin with, I will first admit that this film is completely clueless to why it is called "Alien Intruder". It contains a space and even an "alien", but for a long time there is nothing strange or justifiable (at least I can not go anywhere). /> <br /> There are many scenes (both lines, time, and how to talk about) that get strange feeling when you watch so bad movies. <br /> <br /> The "Solution" covers only one area known as G-Spot, apologizes to the G-Sector ... and is a virtual reality program infected with some kind of external (?) virus. <br /> <br /> For most of the film, people are shot with space weapons, pulling out of the bucket, seemingly infinite, look at it as a normal Ariel's description. , "Where is Ariel?", "I do not find Ariel" (not logical, because most of the other shootings reflecting the interaction with Ariel) is a senseless close-up on any computer monitor. Commander Skyler (Billy Dee) sits in and sees every fantasy of the prisoner's VR programs who want to find and join the Alien virus ... ??? Or maybe we missed something. <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams took a few lessons on how to behave in despair before filming this. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, she knows that she often spends her finger down and looks terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> it's dying in the movie, why worry about it? <br /> <br /> In some cases, it even means something that would result in the death of each one, even the VR women are murdered ... it's over-extreme. <br /> <br /> I'm not a prostitute because I've been earning groceries about those who want my money back for DVDs. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "font-size: </ a> <br /> 1/10
