Ok, in this story, the images of 'stereotypical' Hindus are ONLY ONLY. I do not accept that Elvis looks good here, but yes, it changes the color of her skin. I thought, well, he was never in the real world. Some of my most obvious brown 'indian' makeups. <br /> <br /> This movie is complete, but it's not generally naked. <br /> <br /> F-Troop and Jewish and Italian American actors, but stories and heartbreaking songs, just like in elvisin's later films. Colonel Parker just made her stay in Elvis for long-term relationships to earn as much money as possible. I think Elvis stopped filming for a long time after this film was released. Cartoon players Joan Blondell, Katy Jurado, L.Q. Though Jones, Henry Jones and Burgess Meredith in this film. <br /> <br /> Burgess Meredithin 'indian' makeup is completely AWFUL. The worst of this gang. What did filmmakers think? Mr. Meredith did this job only for money or for what? Of course I love Elvis movies. For example: 'Love Me Tender', 'Jailhouse Rock', 'Viva Las Vegas'. <br /> <br /> Alvice's future television co-stars, Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner, can watch the film 'Life Changing' by Elvis's inner city doctor. <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <STRONG> Thank you, thank you very much!
