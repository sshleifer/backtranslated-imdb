Yes, these guys go to the cosmic camp and the kids begin well enough to meet each other and learn ropes. They introduced Jinx, a robot that could not exist in 1986, because they do not have such an artificial intelligence now. Kid is friendly with the robot, and the robot pays off the child's kindness by shooting a limited number of oxygen supplies and radios that do not have signals to reach him and some other children in space. This camp is not as entertaining as these children are given for real education, and they are overwhelmed by instructors for failing missions or doing things right. Give him a rest, have fun, not just to be an astronaut, but to give them space flight experience, not as a military camp. But you want to see Joaquin Phoenix in an early role. So, he is trying to be realistic in some areas, but one of the other factors of Cinx's application is that he could be the aliens of the battlefield for children above everything in the film. at least for me at least a bit unpleasant for the movie. Perhaps for a few others, someone wants to see Kate Capshaw's face separate from some strange alien creatures.
