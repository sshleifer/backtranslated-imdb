When I started watching this movie, I saw how beautiful Buffy, Xander, and his elderly man, still live in the movie. Now David Lynch films, twin peaks, lost cars and so on. Given that it's a strange good dose, I can take a strange movie. And you must be in a state of mood. Nevertheless, they forced me to recall the flawless sites of conspiracy theories. What is the meaning of the conversation with the American to compare with the Jewish states? In this film, I was surprised that Hitler did not talk with flying saucers and lizards. Perhaps, if you want 60 grams of heroin in this movie, it would mean something like that, but seriously I do not accept medicine as long as I take this movie. Burned, shattered and should not be forgotten 'Xander' can take on another task. It did not work, but it was good, but the scenario did not mean just one. Sorry.
