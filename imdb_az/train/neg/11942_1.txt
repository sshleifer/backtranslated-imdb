Definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen! It started badly and just got worse. Katherine Heigl, a Lolita Role and Leo Grillo are struggling to fight the character of a cardboard cutting flawlessly. With a single enthusiasm, single player, Tomy Sizemore, keeps it as a villain and goes full of its role. There are quite a lot of gaps in the scenario to reach a horrible, moving horrible and double-decker bus driver! This is the sexist movie I've ever seen! Katherine Heigl's character is not entirely indifferent. It looks like a bad, reluctant charmer who wants to deceive a poor, innocent married man's wife. He is in the missing movie, and the message accompanying these arguments simply believes in beggars! Finally, he could not save himself by shooting a man who was hit by anger and guilt, but the script allowed him to kill himself and saved himself everywhere in the eyes of men. Terrible. Do not waste your time.
