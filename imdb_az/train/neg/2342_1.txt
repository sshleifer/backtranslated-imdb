I do not know how nice this movie is. Even worse, why should not someone see it? First of all there is no story. You might even be able to watch a movie, even if it is not a movie, because it's a kind of feeling (laughter, crying, fear, ...), but this is not the case. <br /> You only watch +/- 2 hours pictures. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Do you see 2 hours of your valuable time and 7 euros worth your money? The answer to me is: no.
