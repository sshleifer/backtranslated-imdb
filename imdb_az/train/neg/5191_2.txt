Ahh, boring t.v. In the 1970s, t.v. movies! Some examples include the Riding of Death (most hysterical cheese), Space (Rude and Uninterested), San Francisco International (terribly boring and incredibly embarrassing) and this is a similar bit of Quinn Martin charm. <br /> <br /> Firefighting in Hawaii (though you want to be driven out of the country) is probably a failed pilot for the naked spy show. The real problem is that you love the majority of the characters, including the Diamond Head, the main character of the drab, which is half asleep in the movie; the "Aunt Meryem" boss, who has a really strange delivery of her lines and a body that looks like she's bent over her white hair and looks bent over her; Diamnd is a sexy, wooden woman, who is not just a girlfriend / comrade agent (hell, I can not even remember her name), is just sexy and exciting; and sidekick Zulu who sang Zulu (still remember the name of his character), which is not so bad. The most interesting person in all production is Ian McShane, who sucked as a bad man, but still proved his acting knife. Alothugh laughed at this so-called "chameleon" used to hide the makeup work. I have no idea what he is doing or that he is trying to steal from the lab that is causing his South American Dictator and American General to wear it. I also do not care. It is only half a mile or a half so it's just not enough to attract your attention for just a minute or ten minutes. Only one camel - Hawaii Five No!
