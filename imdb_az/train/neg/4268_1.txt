I remembered this show because I was a kid. I could not remember much about it, a few small things about the character. I remembered for some reason that it was really tight. And it was really early in the morning at PA. Finally, after looking up the internet for a long time, I found an episode. The first episode is small. Criminey! This show was terrible. obviously children were prepared to play laser tag and show a great deal of time. The show opens with bhodi li when explaining his mother "My names are not Christopher, I am bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR !!!!!" we are forced to watch the children playing the laser tag after the song "loose". not just a little, all the song. Ahhhhhhhhh my brain thinks about it. oh yeah, and as long as it does not deteriorate, laser beams can not be seen from their weapons. as if they were flying to the whole "footless" song. then, after bhodi goes out of space or everywhere, fights Phil Collins with a malignant laser gun for "su-su-sudio". Ah, I trust, I do not want to know the rest. what can I say ...... LIGHT SHINES !!!!!!!!!!!
