An anthology is always a risky business, and I think it is necessary to praise this work. There are many talents here. A very talented actor, director and writer. Unfortunately, I did not like this movie depending on three issues. <br /> <br /> First of all, the segments are incredibly different in tone and quality. And, unfortunately, some people are fighting with others. <br /> <br /> Secondly, several segments do not develop at all. Like the seeds of good stories that should come to perfection. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I did not feel New York and its residents were properly described. <br /> <br /> The separated ones are still short short films that can be some of the stakeholders, but they will be dissatisfied with the average audience.
