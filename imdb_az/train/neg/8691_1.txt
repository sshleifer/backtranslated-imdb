If I had a ZERO rating, I'd give it to this movie. Today, I tried to watch for the second time and still could not do it from the beginning to the end. I can not believe many stars given by others, and I can only accept a statement to recognize or disguise actors! Everything around the player is miserable, the scenario is blurred, Nichol plays a zero emotion, though the child is in danger. The actor's "south" accent is amusing - I am Georgia and Texas from Texas - I believe there is nothing like that! At any stage, none of his emotions were real. The subject is a very serious and very good treatment taste.
