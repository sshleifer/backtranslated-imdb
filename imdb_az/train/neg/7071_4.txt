When this film was released in 1997, some "special effects" such as poor were poor. They were even in history for the 1980s, and some of the films shot in the 1970s and 1960s had the same or better SFX work. Certainly, nobody who is involved in the filming is looking for Oscar. Fred Olen is one of the most common things of Rey's ("Bikini Pirates", "Bikini chain band", "Lost Planet" from Bikini girls and so on) and less than "T & A", where "U" and we are facing a movie that targets children. You must lend to diversify it! It was a small direct-to-video religious hits that led to a few subsequent conclusions that resulted in the apparent Mom 2 and the Invisible Father. Dee Wallace-Stone (Dee Wallace-Stone, the fastest growing band since 1982) plays the role of 'invisible mom' in the headline and will come back later. Dr. Russell Tamblyn (Death of 1961), Dr. Woorter, says that most of the pumps are ready to be ready for almost everything to pay for the monthly payments, even though young Trenton Knight Josh has worked before this movie, this child actor did not work after the movie "Invisible Mom 2." Perhaps the film was curse - for a child player he is quite good - better or worse than his more experienced co-stars. <br /> <br /> Above As noted, the "invisibility" effect is naff, the direction is weak, the writing is open and there is nothing to write home. There are films there, but for everyone, this movie will not wait for anybody to doubt, although they want to do something that they do not want to do away with, and I blame them a little ram!
