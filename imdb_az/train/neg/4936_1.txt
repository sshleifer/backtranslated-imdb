I spent my time and gave this show a chance. This should be one of the worst new shows. If they give a reward to show that they have to swallow it. The player is poor and the story line is drawn. Now Dinosaurs was a bit strange but at least fun. This show continued for three seasons and finally won. This new show, based on insurance companies' ads, is not funny and really does not have anything to do with it. Perhaps the original amount of ads and times has been repeated, and this show is incorrect. Television just came and I'm tired of seeing the characters "caveman" already.
