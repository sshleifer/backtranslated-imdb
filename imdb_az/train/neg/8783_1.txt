I do not think I'm overwhelmed by the fact that this film is a real absurd, because it's when I came out of this crazy. There is no point in this. None of them were intelligent or well thought out. In the absence of actually suspenseful moments, they often use a common cop-out trick that will set up a trail or pushed aside a curtain and then build music before doing anything before anything else. Maybe I will do it once, but three times. There are things to do for obvious reasons, characters, half of story lines ... ALL symptoms were not well developed in ALL. the last one was .. bad. bad, bad, bad, everything, every component is afraid of this movie. and I'm here to warn them all.
