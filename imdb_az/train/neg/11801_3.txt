As a great fan of the original film, it's hard to watch this show. Attractive decor decor and rigid lights have robbed any style from this remake. The spirit is never there. Instead, many television channels have seventy-seven appearances and feelings. Crenna is not a bad choice, like Walter Neff, but her strange wardrobe and "swank" apartment do not fit the mood of the original or give it an interesting character. Samantha Egger is really doing his best to work bad choices. The British accent and the California look Barbara Stanwickin can not afford the velvet voice and sexual appeal. <br /> <br /> According to some movies, Lee J. Cobb is working hard to get Barton Keys to fashion. <br /> <br /> It feels like a television movie and is still reminded: that's it.
