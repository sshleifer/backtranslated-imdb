Back in 1985, I caught the thing about the cable (I can not name a movie). I've been to college and have been a high school companion kidnapped by hormones. I thought in advance that it was hopeless. Stupid script (a group to show some young children to take into account with women), bad action (with one exception) and miserable jokes. There was plenty of feminine nakedness here for a while, but after 30 minutes she was squeezed. Remember - it was a high school girl! Nudity is back to the internet and it's as easy as it is. We hope for something interesting or fun, but never happened. An entertaining event on this subject was the original advertising campaign claiming that the studio was drowning in this movie! (A poster, "This is the best movie I've ever seen in the afternoon!") Made a fictional review. Only Grant Cramer showed any talent in management and actually went on career in a business. Out-of-budget and drilling t & a. Jump.
