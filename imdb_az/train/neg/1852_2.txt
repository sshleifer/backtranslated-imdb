Who made this movie a joke. I would say this was the most delicate film I've ever seen! A killer snowman gives terror to a small town? Give me some time. I love her while driving a police car. It's more like a comedy than a scary movie. If you want a laugh, do it for rent. If you really want a movie movie, stay away from hell!
