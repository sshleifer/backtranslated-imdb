It's not a good thing to be exposed to my first Templars. I was thrilled to find this headline among the suggestions from Anchor Bay Video, which brought me to other religious classics like "Spider Baby". The print quality is perfect, but it does not conceal that the film is fatal. The villagers have a thrilling sequence of excitement at the Templars (and they have acted all their actions), but everything in the film is slow, complicated, and finally not fulfilled. Injury insult: The film is called subtitled, as promised in the video pocket.
