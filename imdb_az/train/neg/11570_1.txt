The directors' intentions for these films are quite dignified, but the history of production knew that he could not remember me as he would be the other filmmakers. Taking into account the big 30-day television series, MTV, who thinks it's a pleasure for me in any of its papers to be serious about the seriousness of the "me replacing", is a great hope for "I bet". In a sad way, this film did not make me a little ghost. After a while, I asked myself, "supersize", that all of them were clear. the basic statement is understood in half an hour later, but the rest of the game is already filled with things that have been repeated in this way or in the movie repeatedly and repeating what is recurring, so it turns out to be very successful.
