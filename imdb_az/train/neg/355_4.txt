Just Cause is, first of all, very angry when it's pretty rare - not just something special, but mature enough and one of the movies that started with a perfect supportive performance from Ed Harris. After hitting in the last 3, everything is getting more and more silly as long as there is a killer with a bulb wrapped around his forehead, which is threatened by Sean Connery's wife (usually sensitive and impartial Kate Capshaw) and child (many young Scarlet Johannsen) alligator skinner's sack. <br /> <br /> Probably the type of movie on an airplane and even just once.
