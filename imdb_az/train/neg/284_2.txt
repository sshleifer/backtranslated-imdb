I just chose today at this 99 cents store today, and I think I'm still dead. "The Dream of Belief" is a pretty dull and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $ 1 is very expensive. This movie is probably noteworthy for 2 things: 1. Young Keanu Reeves. And 2. Paul Lynch, directed by the person who made the Promo Night. Now film. <br /> <br /> This is a girl named Robin (played by Olivia D'Abo) who was seriously injured as a result of an accident that hurt her father's life. Accident prevented him from competing in gymnastics tournaments, often selected during his class, and eventually he meets a shepherd named Tommy (played by Keanu). Robin is in the Laundromat, where his father's son owns his part-time, mother and banners when he is not in training. As a result, he was selected to compete. <br /> <br /> Generally, Keanu's melody of the 80s you and your 80s have prevented me from giving this one star, and this is not one of the worst films but still good. The DVD itself is also an old VHS and can not receive any medals, as it seems, the sound goes off without synchronization, and when the last credit ends, the black sounds, even the sound may still be. I heard. So, it's likely to be accepted as a bundle. The DVD artwork does not have anything to do with the film because it looks like the latest photos of Keanu and Olivia, and since the movie itself is not there, there is no point in the background, so the cover is clearly photoshopped. Anyway, if you are not a Keanu fanatic, avoid all expenses. Probably will not depend on it. Probably I'll give Cinema Snob, a great YT critic, btw. Hey, if any of you have bad movies in your eyes now, give him a gift to continue the show.
