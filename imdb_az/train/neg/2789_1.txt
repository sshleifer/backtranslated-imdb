Savage Island (2003) is a clever movie. Very little lighting and a funny home video shot. Not only is the story and scenario furious. I do not know why this movie was made. I've seen many flicks in my time, and those who really hate me are furious. It was my blood source. The situation was good. If I shoot such a movie, it would be short. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the "idle" of this backbone would not be in the picture. <br /> <br /> D.V.D. I am the guardian of the bad cinema. But this movie is inevitable. I do not care about shooting movies in D.V. <br /> <br /> I'm going to make this movie unpleasant, it's a bit of a tired passage of superficial films (sans Wrong Turn). <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size:
