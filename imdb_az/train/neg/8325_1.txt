I saw this movie yesterday and it was still disappointing to have one of the most anticipated ones. One of the most obvious mistakes in this nonsense of a film is that the key point (the person who wakes up during the operation) is related to the result. It would have been done in the same way regardless of it. So what is this? Who knows. Also, if the surgeon had 4 malpractice costumes against him and he did not think of people asking questions if a patient died at his desk? Give me some time. Jessica Alba is completely unlucky and Christiansen is almost as bad. All this was just laughable from beginning to end. I doubt that if you could feel the cut from the chest with a scalpel, you would be more painful than that.
