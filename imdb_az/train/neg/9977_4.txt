This child is pretty bad, but in no way creates a type that can isolate adults and break the experienced thieves at every turn. No, she is not so brave because she is a child with very strong emotional problems. A couple of good couples wanting to accept me do all they can to get her, and she wants a little more than she wants to give her a chance without her mother. Surprisingly Michael Richards's character and always frustrating Gilbert Gottfried and you have a very bad movie with yourself here and there a few laughs. I, in fact, prefer this movie to the poster as I love Amy Yasbeck as a kind of a better character. Because there are many characters in this movie that are astonishing. Even the child in this situation is first of all frustrating and then cold. The area is sufficiently simple enough for parents to adopt this child because they think as good as they are thrown into the orphanage, and soon they have little hell. Of course, this little hell keeps in touch with some kind of prisoner. I'm not sure of this character, but first I thought it should be his real father or something. All this is not good, but I'll choose a baby boy before any day of the day.
