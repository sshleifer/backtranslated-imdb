This is a creepy appearance of any Santa Claus loyal to any environment, whether it's a book, a picture, or a movie. Santa looks like a perv, looking at children, and a story twisted to bring Merlin to shatter one of Satan's shadows, one of Pitch, does not do anything better. Despite the standards of 1959, it is fun to say the least harmful effects. If a child watched this movie, he had nightmares and would never want Santa's visit. They would be a wound to life. Imagine children as "A Christmas Story" when they start screaming after putting them on the lap of the coat. If the child saw this movie, that would be the case.
