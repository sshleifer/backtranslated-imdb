In the 1960s and 1970s I saw this movie exactly, it was terrible and predictable by the well-known series of Death Tragedies in the 80s and 90s. Taking into account the "driving training" of the aforesaid, it should be considered for everyone who is preparing to drive today. When you see all the protection and horror of a violent death, of course, see what responsibilities are required for safe driving (if there is no sensitivity), what can be thoughtless or intolerable on the wheel. In the 1970s and 1980s, I worked on Bell Phone and was assigned to carry a security class at some point. I found this movie in the company's library, showed it at the meeting, many people were physically ill and had to leave the room! An incredible part later said, "I did not know that no car accident could be so terrible!" He said. This film and another "RED ASPHALT" is, of course, the most graphic form of reality. I will never forget it, if only I had a copy of my children's "driving" in high school!
