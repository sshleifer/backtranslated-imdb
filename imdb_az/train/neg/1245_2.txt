Undoubtedly Burton worsens every film that is the worst movie in the film. An angry script loaded with the clicks is the first of numerous protests of this movie. Every time something is happening in the movie, someone has "lost his gun!" You will hear that sound. or to know everyone knows. Carter is really awful, and this is Wahlberg, who can not play smoothly and convincingly. Very nice effects and photography, but moldy music at John Williams by Burton crony Elfman. Heston appeared on the wrong scene to get the most out of the first episode of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the films in Burton's films can lead to lower quality. I heard that this special project was prepared by others and that Burton was brought as director, in which case his decision should be questioned. But I think he has the ability to visually move in his previous career. There is evidence in films. In Sleepy Hollow, he is a comedy or a real horror movie, British actors (Chris Lee, etc.), some kind of monster rally film (fearful fans know they are never afraid) for the film, or for a frustration or comedy. could not be because it was schizophrenia and no styles were set up to match each other. "The Planet of the Monkeys" is very similar, and ultimately comes more like a fiction like Total Recall or Tango and Cash. "Burton's Word", if you're there - pick something and do it straight or combine everything (like "Mars Attacks" or "Beetlejuice") and or you may be eligible for retirement, because people's movies will not stop me.
