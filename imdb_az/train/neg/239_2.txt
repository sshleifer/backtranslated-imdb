I can not say that this movie is bad, but it was not good. I expected something good, but I think hum Aapke Hain Kaun is better than that. It was completely old fashioned. At each stage of this film, I hoped for a few twists, and what did I earn? The girl is burnt and she gets the love of aunt. <br /> <br /> Being busy, they should get permission for every small move they do. This is so shameful after the meeting. I expected the aunt to be more violent than this. All he did was crazy. <br /> Hey, we have children, but we do not watch them, and we always have tears in our eyes. This movie is a dream. A happy family, a brutal woman, good marriage, and a man who loves her. At HAMK, Anupam Kher was the father of a poor bride, and now she is opposite. I knew that this film would be Mohnish Behl. Anyway, I believe you have spent my time. I give it 2/10.
