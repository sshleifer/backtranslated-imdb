I can not help but be scary and just look like bad movies. I personally scored the worst 10 films on top of the cliff under the creatures of the cliff! Follow this movie and you have a laugh, do not wait for any academy award for acting. More luck than the movie itself. In all honesty, however, I've seen a lot worse. Moreover, along with deleting people living in the wilderness, some maniacs also appeared to be incredible when it was not genuine. I think of one of these love or hate films. you can enrich yourself yes it is terrible, but for some reason I love it in a way
