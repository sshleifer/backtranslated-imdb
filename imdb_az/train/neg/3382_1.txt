This is one of the worst movie adaptations of any musician. The scenic version of the A Horn Line is beautiful. This movie almost always leaves any trace. Even casting is striking. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 is Visible 3" is a Valin song. Valin's story is that he is a great dancer, but in the apparition division 3. Yes, he finds a solution, but in the end he is a good dancer. What are the brilliant directors doing? They hire an actress who can not dance and seek great. <br /> <br /> That's why there's choreography. I am sure that Michael Bennett has returned to his grave. Why did not use choreography? This can not be really developed.
