Though this is a "favorite" movie, you need serious help. There is nothing funny or smart about this crapfest. <br /> <br /> I have not seen a movie of this movie (some 1950s), but it should be better than this new whisper. <br /> <br /> Firstly, it creates the fringe element and the teaching of children at the ROTC school. Unfortunately, the main Daman Wayans ... children are in a heartfelt, immaculate world of speed. Will Wayans shape the victims? Can they turn it into a little more people? Film bombs like most Wayans movies, with just a few bright moments. William Hickey takes about a minute of screen time, very few exhibits. This charming old man (known to me as "The Cryptan tales", the best known to you on the occasion of the "Christmas Feast", is here every moment on the screen. <br /> Bam Bam Bigelow is a perfect fit for a biker as well. Bam Bam a little bit more crying, but I think he was carrying as much a role as a biker for a military movie. <br /> And then there is an attractive teacher, someone drops for Payne, and children are bad, but there is no public ability and it's not possible to become one of those who want to spend time. He must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly hopeless. Wayans had a brilliant moment: her dance series features a series of movements (including a very nice "robot") and with 2 live band music. <br /> <br /> This movie appeared on the stage, but it was hard for everything that the movie was about to disappear. <br /> Seriously, avoid this movie. Wanting to lose a movie, you want to see a footballer who has become a hero, a "hire" or a nickname called "Ernest Goes To Camp". At least she lost her boyfriend and is actually laughable. Perhaps Major Payne fights a badger, and I feel better, but not. Forget about payne, forget Waya ... you can do better.
