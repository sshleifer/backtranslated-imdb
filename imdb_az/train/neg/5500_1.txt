This movie works hard, but there is no entertainment of the 1960s television series, but I am sure that people remember with joy. Although I was 17, I watched some of YouTube's long ago and it was fun and fun. Unfortunately, this film brings less justice to the series. <br /> <br /> Special effects are fairly non-standard, and this is not a flat camera. The scenario was also elegant and had no sense in miracles and humor. <br /> <br /> Now I like the idea of ​​the story but, unfortunately, this was actually bad, and could run out of steam very early and I'm not sure it was something to make the family enjoy. <br /> <br /> But most of all, the most frustrating thing about this movie, has frustrated Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah's talents. all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels pulled out good performances before, but he did not have a clue what he needed to do, and Elizabeth Hurley's character was, unfortunately, useless. Daryl Hannah is a wonderful actress and I have never seen it, and I liked the idea of ​​having her love interest, but unfortunately, you see her very small (even more likely to be scared to scare her monster offense), such as Wallace Shawn acting as a kind of government. Christopher Lloyd loves himself and loves Lloyd as an actor (he is one of my favorite films, Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I'm Coming to the Future), but he's been very busy <br /> <br / > Generally, I do not want to love this movie very much, it has neutralized me. Instead of having fun, it has come to terms in a meaningless manner, and it has a lot of potential talent and a good idea, but it's a shame as a sad execution. 1/10 Bethany Cox
