"Cement" is a bad movie about a bad cop (Penn) and has a bad structure in a bad way with a bad guy badly bad. While waiting for cement to clear up and understand what the film is, we often run back to time without any reason or no reason, so we can follow up on the cement thing. Generally, "Cement" lacks a story, an unusual execution, and most of the errors in the film; There is no reason. Time killer for the best-looking board potatoes. (D +)
