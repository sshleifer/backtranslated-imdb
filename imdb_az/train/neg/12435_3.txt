Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as a central figure in the third film in the Home Alone Empire. Four industry spy missile guidance systems get a computer chip and abduct an airplane inside a remote control toy. Due to luggage confusion, angry Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) receives a car. She gives her neighbor Alex (Linz) before the spies are opened. Spyers rent a house to steal every home in the neighborhood until the car's location is located. With the house only chicken pox, Alex every 911 calls a spot on stealing spots, but the police always manage to knock down while Alex is accused of making spy calls. The spies eventually paid attention to Alex, and they did not know that he had a fake device to carry his entire home intelligently. Home Alone 3 was not terrible, but probably not, you just can not substitute Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern. Home Alone had some funny parts of 3, but I like to change the characters in a movie series, at my own risk.
