I was rarely dissatisfied with a leading performance because I was by Ali McGraw in this movie. Is God disturbed or upset? He says everything in the same tone and is horrible, on the contrary, Ryan O'Neal is brilliant. <br /> <br /> There are not many stories. He must offer a lot of things to love, rich, wood, and love. His father, Stonewall Jackson, was called by his name, and they did not realize the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> Oscar nomination for this film shows that it should be a bad year. John Marley is as beautiful as Wooden's father, but is a supporting candidate? At least Ali did not win. <br /> <br /> I think Katharine Ross may have played Jennifer, but if it were up to me, Katharine Ross would have been in more films. Certainly a better actress than McGraw. <br /> <br /> He did not cry when he was ill, and he never even felt sorry for me. <br /> <br /> Tommy Lee Jones looked at the age of 15, and the score was good. But it is so ancient, and now a beard lasts longer and its fault is not so old, but it feels.
