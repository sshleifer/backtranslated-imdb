* Spoiler warning * <br /> <br /> First of all, I have evaluated this movie from 10 to 2. <br /> <br /> This is a good idea, but there are many foolish mistakes in the film, which may be a psychological drama. First of all, he does not fight alone. After a very unusual suspicion from the mother (the non-convincing evidence that the mother is so supportive and loving in the film), the victims of aggression are not alone. <br /> <br /> He is also incredibly naive into Crew's strange traps. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> Ethan's crew is a lot of people (even if they say) and people another guy thinks it is terrible, but when Ethan changes his mind, he does not believe in a single person, he said he was alive and that his old friend was wrong. Everyone just hates ... why? The film does not give any explanation. <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> to get viewers?
