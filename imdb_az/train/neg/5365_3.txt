"Personal Experience" is erased from a very successful and well written "Gray Anatomy". Casting is incredible. Stage can even work. But the writing is just horror. <br /> <br /> Like the Gray's Anatomy Episode, the hidden pilot must be my first warning. The area was just one thing. Maybe I thought it was a whisper. So we put the DVR pilot and all the other episodes in the show. <br /> <br /> While watching the pilot, I just wondered how he could make a dull pilot with the appearance of such a great player. The pilot wants to suck people and retrieve them more. The rest of the season is likely to be an exciting, exciting, big story, an interesting story to answer. <br /> <br /> This was part of the consciousness. <br /> <br /> It was a shout, and I watched the second episode hoping for the best. Although marginally good, it does not come close to anything that might be interesting and will not miss the TV. <br /> <br /> I just dropped off my show list to watch these shows. IMO is not worth the effort and I would be surprised at this show even during the middle season. It passes through one nation.
