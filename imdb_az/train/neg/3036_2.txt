This movie was absolutely strange! I do not understand how it goes to the production of this movie. Nothing against the filmmaking is, of course, the whole band of the writing team. If you take the old middle ground - let's dance to be poor and poor in this situation - or step in this case. But it does not have any look of the actual plot - or at least one of them is interested. Canadian-speaking actors are likely to be an American venue - this film is very straightforward. In a positive note, the director was pretty good, and cinematography was also quite decent. The production budget was also very generous. My only requirement is to find the original screenwriters to help keep this team's recordings alive and bring the lyrics in the movie. Net result - How it moves.
