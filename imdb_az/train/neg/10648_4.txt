The finals of Weissmuller Tarzan are very weak. There are a few things about this movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, Tarzan spends most of the movie on the floppy sandals. In my opinion, Tarzan falls away from the character that is meant to be anti-culture and pro-jungle, whether it is shoes or shoes, sometimes referred to as shoes. <br /> The latter, as shown in the previous article, leaves Benji's film as funny foil. <br /> <br /> Veysissmuller, though still in command of Tarzan, clearly shows that he is not in the best shape. <br /> <br /> The Octopus war is a great idea, but I think it should have been pre-made in the Weissmuller movie because it was a physical jump in some of the previous Jungle Jim films. <br /> <br /> At the same time, if the Tarzan and his Mate had a classic gigantic crocodile fight, from 90 to 2 minutes, the battle would have been much more exciting than just the top 30 seconds. Like Mara, Jane and Linda Christian, Brenda Joyce, is very pleased with her eyes, and she has been unable to save the last Weissmuller movie - a fictional fantasy.
