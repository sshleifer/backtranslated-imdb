This film is a clear attempt to describe the Reagan administration as inadequate and dark on the left side of Hollywood. Some mistakes occurred during the crisis but I'm sure that this stupid movie is not described. My first reaction was to be directed by Oliver Stone, but this time I made a mistake. As you can see, there are many.
