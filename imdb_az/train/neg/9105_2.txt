What can I say about cruel intentions? Robin Dunne ("No, I did not hear it in this movie") filmed the "stars" of the film, barking on me that Ryan Phillipe gave me a lot of regret ... In a terrible cast, Dunne plays a beautiful and charismatic, charming game Amy Adams, once a buffy episode, has stayed in Sarah Michelle Gellar and trying to get out where Catherine is planning to go out ... But Adams is a good guy (and is unsuccessful), because the actor is not charming, charismatic, or charming. he is not an actress and his performance is straight and does not include any real emotion, he often looked just like his signature cards off the camera.There were two good players in the film, but Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Kensington in Austin Powers), Sebastian and Katherine's parents made very good and entertaining speeches, and the only reason was the film was rated as 2, not 2. a poor version of the original, not the carbon copy of the old film's originality as scenes of dialogue and mimicked. <br /> <br /> I can work as a television show, but in reality it is rebuilt with people who can act in major parts.
