In 1966, Antonioni in the "Blow Up" film asked the heroism question in the background of the British youth protesters. Asking such questions against part of the Hippie youth movement Antonioni deliberately or questioned the effectiveness of these institutions. What you are actually doing can actually lie, and how can you fight it? At the flip side, the film said we need to fight exactly what we see clearly and fight actively because we can be cheating on others with fake pictures and false truths. Hippie aspects, despite the most sensitive parts of the Blow Up, have created a good texture and have given more meaning than the film might have. <br /> <br /> With Zabriskie Point Antonioni throws all the uncertainties and subtlety of the "Blow Up" and goes full hippie. As a result, a film is shot with bad metaphors, stupid thoughts and heavy-handed stories. How could someone with such a limitation and intelligence throughout his career be somewhat foolish? <br /> <br /> The film begins with a nice lineup when watching the radical group discussing the meaning of the revolution. Suddenly a man (Mark) stands up and leaves. He hates the harsh and ordered nature of the revolution. It is to give your freedom freely to attract such a courageous work, despite the revolutionary struggle for freedom. So, like "Passenger" like Jack Nicholson, Mark just wants to be released. <br /> <br /> So Mark takes guns and gets solo. He does not order anybody. Mark raped a boy who raided the university campus. He then runs to a nearby airport, stole a small private plane and goes out. Antonioni acts as a peaceful utopia in the wilderness, and contradicts it with capitalist cities, ad panoramas and hollow modern techniques. <br /> <br /> Mark meets Daria in the desert and soon falls in love. Antonioni gives us a ridiculous sex scene where hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand. These tree-huggers and student radics, free of the constraints of modern life, can now record their individuality by humming in the sun. <br /> <br /> The film is ending with fantasy about Mark and Daria Castles and a fierce explosion, the homes of rich capitalists who killed him. This is Antonioni's opposition to the audience. Take weapons, pickets and explosives, he says. <br /> Of course, it did not affect the audience. They considered the "Zabriskie Point" to be radical in their own right as a commercial attempt. A radical radicalism. <br /> <br /> The motionless movie is pretty stupid. Antonioni says that if you are dissatisfied with the modern world and the fat cats you exploit, or if you run to the desert (Daria) or you are actively fighting the system (Daria). All is good and good. Although artists constantly warn us of such dystopian fears, they show how effective we can manage change. Like the end of the "Club of Struggle," nihilism and violence have nothing to do with it. In the real world, social change tends to be driven by humble inventors, highlighted by small technological advances. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - a very bad movie. The problem really does not really believe the Antonioni rebellion. He is a quiet and surprising person. An introvert that has been extradited to be able to praise her earlier film, "Blow Up," to be more praiseworthy than the counter-culture. So, Zabrinskie Point comes as a very ambitious and stupid movie. <br /> <br /> There are many films that have been encouraged by the audience to fight the "system," but it all falls. has been included in one of four categories. The first category includes films such as "Network", "Hard El Luka", "Puppet Slot" and "Spartak". All this shows that the life of liberty warriors ends with failure, but the "revolutionary spirit" remains. The message can not affect change, but the diminution or failure, the optimistic conception of change does not live through martyrdom. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there are films such as Fight Club, Zabriskie Point, and Falling Down, which encourages you to explode. Destroy them all. Blow up all of them. Everything is a lie, so you can shoot your weapons in a burning way. <br /> <br /> Therefore, these films are far from any ill-thought, frustrating, reactionary. Terrence Malick and Antonioni are the masters of this genre. "Passenger", "Red Desert" and "Badlands" run away from the worlds of people who do not love themselves and create for themselves islands or peaceful inhabitants. Both the filmmakers are pessimists because Malik's islands have been destroyed and Antonioni's traditions do not offer happiness and solutions. <br /> <br /> Then there is a fourth category. Donnersmarck's "The Others' Life", Ashby's "Glory for Glory" and Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" act as artists to change and rebel. In these dystopic worlds, where everybody is enslaved to the state, there is an unreasonable creativity and will of the artistic / criminal control of the system. Simply create waves that are outside the flock. Your comments, actions, and critical eyes call the status quo. Thus, Donnersmarck is home to novelists and artisans who violate Nazi Germany, while Kubrick is an artist / criminal with Nazi droogles, shaping blood and sperm into the city.
