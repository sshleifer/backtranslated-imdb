I am very happy that I do not spend money to go to cinema :-). The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss and so on. It's not just a compilation of many other classic names, but rather a dull and meaningless scenario. I really do not understand what the purpose of this film is - there is nothing new to suggest on the storyline, and it is also meaningless. Moreover, there is nothing to watch - FXs appear to have been taken from a second store, but you've seen them all in other films. But this is definitely the best lullaby.
