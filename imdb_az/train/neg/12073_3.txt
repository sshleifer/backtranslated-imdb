*** CLAIMS *** Former Christopher Dean's family members and servants, John Carradine, bring together about $ 140 million to the dean's wealth to bring together their last will and promise. The money should be split between them, but only after they have spent a week in Dean's home. Later, when we realized that everyone was not really a night-time sleep at a home for a week's vacation, so everyone was in the Dean's money since the end of the sun, and there was a mess in the story. <br /> <br /> The first victim of the Dean's curse, the abandoned Christopher Dean property, is bought by local Sheriff Dan Garsia, Rodolfo Acosta, and has nothing to do with money. Acosta cut her head off and then shocked a group of guests on a plate. <br /> <br /> This movie was found dead day and night outside of the lovely little Chin Greg and Laura, Jeff Morrow and Marry Anders, floating in the lake in the small mushroom lake. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Dean Mansion is one-to-one until the killer really knows who it is. Then, in the story where the original killer was suddenly killed with two of the last remaining guests, there is something in the double twist. The real murderer ends up getting all the loots with only $ 140 million, but by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him and ends up sharing him with the helper. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, his mother, the lesser audience, liked the problem and likened it to the making of such immoral and difficult characters. Of course, there is everything you can think of in the action involving selective guests who repeat S & M simulation and, of course, repeating that the murder is not counted. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of life is even the ultimate surprise. It is really surprising that the filmmaker who talked about the identity of the murderer is forgetting to keep his face in his shadows, so he sees who is real before revealing himself! Then there is an excuse to eliminate the killer together with a visitor who is a little bit more confused with the film. The last excuse you can see for more than 10 kilometers is the twist to show just how clever he was to watch the movie.
