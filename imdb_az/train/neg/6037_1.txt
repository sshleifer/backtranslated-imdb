Moron and his girlfriend spend some rituals to resurrect the dead to prove that the dead can not make dead. Not surprisingly, they resurrect a dead creature that starts to chop off with an ax and the next day some college aged people explain the story around a bull. The ax is coming out and begins to attack the heroes who tell the story. The band calls the police, the police splashes blood everywhere, and thinks that it is a mountain lion (!?) And soon runs by a murderer who can be or may be in a state of mood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Small splatter film, One person has one weapon and one other bullet in his hands, but there are several opportunities to kill after loading, but it is not too early to bother to finish the movie. Then he throws the weapon! It is also a faces that do not show a dangerous feeling and their friends are helping with terrible dialogue and some really ugly women's nakedness, and their nasty effect (human carrot looks like a piece of chicken meat, eventually cut off as a piece of car blown car) does not. And in the end, at the very beginning of this film, he was trying to get out of this inaccuracies by saying that the elderly people of the college were all inventions, explaining strange stories of the camp. <br /> <br /> The last man who was subsequently murdered is the last person on stage, making them fragmented. <br /> <br /> <strong>
