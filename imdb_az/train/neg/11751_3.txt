HEY ARNOLD! I came to the air in 1996 and looked. It was one of my favorite shows. Later, the same episodes began to show again, so I was tired of waiting for new episodes and did not watch it. I was amazed when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! FILM is not as popular as some of the other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. Nevertheless, I did not do anything better, I went to see the movie anyway. We go to the theater and did not expect much. I was only expecting to be a mute movie version of a child cartoon like RECESS. I bought what I expected. It was a mute kiddie movie and nothing more. There were some good parts here and there, but most of the film was stinker. Only for children.
