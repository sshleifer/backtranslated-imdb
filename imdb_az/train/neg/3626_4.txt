I do not know what Oscar voters see in this movie, but they need to see a lot of difficult things to see in order to reward Oscar with the best picture. I know that fortunately, Gene Kelly was there to play, or I believe it would be bad twice. Above all, I do not think Leslie Caron really can play that role. She is not talented, she is not a good dancer and she does not look good. It is a shame that an actor or actress can destroy a movie because Leslie Caron could have shot a very beautiful movie if she had not been. The story was clever, the management was not bad, and as I said, Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now, I do not want to say all about Leslie Caron just to criticize him, just saying this because I think it's the worst part of the movie. He is probably a good actress, but I can not say because I have not seen him in anything else, but I think he is pretty bad at an "American in Paris". If you want to see it, keep going, but I'm telling you is a better way than watching "Singin in the Rain".
