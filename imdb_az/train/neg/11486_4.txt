Some people, like me, want to know everything about a movie, because they plan to do it, including the end. Anyway, I remember it, because I could not be over 8 because I saw it on TV the first and only time. But I will say that I was scared of the little boy I was, and after a few days I thought and still has some details, but it is still unclear. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I do not remember it! I did not even remember that Barnabus was in this movie and I liked the Dark Shadows. So, in the end, the leading character (Belinda Montgomery?) Judge (Joseph Cotton, I remember it, remember him as an old family physician or something instead of something fades?) Has a cavern of some sort, instead of a wedding ? Maybe this was wrong; and Shelley Winters laughs and Judge has a purple and looks like this camera angle, and she's throwing her backyard and goat's legs and declares her to be the devil who is really her father (of course, that Robert Foxworth) "Demon" with Yellow Eyes and devil, enough sure, they show Robert Foxworth and his eyes are yellowish, because Satan has become a man who wants to marry her. In the last few minutes of the film there are many close people. Everyone is laughing and happy, except Belinda Montgomery, is very happy and crying or screaming or something, and this is the end. Bad guys win.
