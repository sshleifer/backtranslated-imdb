Although this movie has a sad film, it may be surprisingly seen at several levels. First, it is interesting to see the leading role played by Dean Jagger for the fans of the old film (nothing to do with Mick). Later, Jagger played a very respected role as a supporting actor (even collecting Oscar for 12 O'Clock), where his performance is really unique, because his hair has a full head before) and because he is the worst actor in the film. This film is going to show that only one actor can not move in his previous films and eventually can not learn to become a great actor. A good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, his first film (SILVER SHALIE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The second reason to watch the movie is all. Writing is bad, the player is bad and special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and his unnamed Cambodian pass through the water, they actually walk around and the background is poorly predicted. Moreover, after leaving the water, their clothing is about 100% dry! The film has a sincere and fierce bad dialogue, so it's hard to imagine why Bela Lugosi or George Zucco did not betray the film - both in classroom movies. <br /> <br /> Thus, while giving 3 films, it's probably too generous, and laugh is fun. a value for fans of short and bad movies.
