I saw the original non-German version, and I was surprised at how bad this movie really was. I think Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake, and so my bad movies have been, so he has prepared nothing for me! Indeed, it was a pain to sit through the flick, because there is no plot, it does not move well, and it is not convincing that even special effects, especially those of the zombies, are far more than the white make-up and old-fashioned clothes. their good set will not be destroyed by ketchup and marmalade blemishes. <br /> <br /> Explain if you want to spend 90 minutes of your life, do not do it for others, because you will regret it!
