So Angela grew up and earned an operation to make therapy and her son a real-life girl, and now she has a job - a guard camp! How fit? I know, I love it. In any case, the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise is to follow all the rules of fear sequels - more blood, more creative killings (not creative, but more original), more nudity, a more sophisticated area and generally worse than the original. <br /> <br /> He was as entertaining as the original, because characters and cabinets are likely to not help to get a good laugh. At one point, a man asks Angela and says, "I call you," and then he goes quickly. The boy tells himself: "How will he call me? I do not have a phone!" <br /> <br /> It is an event known to have been used more frequently than teenagers killed in slide films in the 1980s. Usually it is not punishable by killers for a very bad behavior, usually a very stupid indicator. For the first time I entered the movies of fear and in the mid 90s I saw the 13th class, and I did not realize it. A year later I learned in two classes and was surprised that they were a method of madness. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie, but it's not just a movie, it's just a movie, though it's a patient, but there are really some thoughts. Angela says at one point before her death: "This is a lesson for you, do not tell the drugs!" The true subtle screen is written there, children. Again, dialogue is the most fun thing in the film. Angela says (at the same time, all this therapy changed from Angela's name, Angel, to Angela, after cleansing these operations and past, and re-creating himself as a normal and well-developed person): "I do not like to be a bad witch of the West, I know what happens when you leave. " (People are killing ... with me!) <br /> <br /> Then, one of the counselor, Mare, apologized, demanding the girl's response: Die! "Of course, Mare, but you've come into the truth ... Two years ago, I was a camp counselor in a dream camp (except for the camp I learned above). There were more than three or four children in the movie, there were some rules) <br /> <br /> Even though there are children between the ages of 10 and 11 in this movie, we can shoot a similar movie with many of the 9 year olds I did not see anything like this at first. <br /> <br /> A sad bad taste, even for the seventies 80s slasher movie.
