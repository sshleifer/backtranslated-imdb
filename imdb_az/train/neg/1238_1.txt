This Tim Burton revives the original "Planet of the Monkeys" (and Charlton Hester's role) since 1968, far from the original quality and plan. <br /> <br /> Certainly, special effects are 1968, but there is no writing. Heroes were very disappointed and the dialogue was terrible. <br /> <br /> I sat together with my friend (thankfully I've just rented it), and they were in the space bar all the targets of the Target Planet before Christmas. <br /> <br /> Everyone is advised to follow the original 1968 Planet of the Monkeys.
