The first one. The first thing that is needed in this genre is good music, and the place where Mr Chankar and his party have failed. <br /> <br /> Music is completely faded and ineffective. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, AJAY DEVGAN, 'A' from a post he wrote, has done a good job but has never benefited from such a dirty film. <br /> ASIN, a puppet is used to make fun of the public though, though I do not think that dancing in the film is actually a member of a rock band, and I do not think any rock band is a dancer as a member of the band. <br /> <br /> This film is part of a piece of hazelnuts *** t part. If you want to be deceived, you can watch it.
