talk about the loss of money. Im just wondering why Michael would be a star in a single movie in Turkey ... Michael is a great actor in a film starring a man who is not particularly mortal from cancer ... it was beautiful. as he touches his son to see him after he grows up .. Michael is such a talented actor .. so why did not he do it? I was watching it and I thought it was really dumb ... I think there are stumbling films at one time .. In particular, "The Squeeze" did not understand that its best performance was "Pacific Heights", its character really pulled me off .. and I really enjoyed it for a long time ... One was so hilarious and just perfect for the role of "Batman" ... and I also liked "Night Shift" and I also love "Johnny Dangerously" ... some of them are bad movies. ...
