I'm a Jan Harlow fan, because he has a star quality. I do not think his movies are good, and I do not think he is a good actress, but he was great in comedy. The girl from the mission is very good at every comedy. But this movie is perhaps a love story. Jan Harlow is beautiful and you can forget the rest of the rest - their performances do not bring anything new. Always wonder why Harlow's beautiful body is a sick woman. Well, it looks nice in this movie.
