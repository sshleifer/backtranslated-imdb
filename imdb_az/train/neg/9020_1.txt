When watching this thing last night, I can not really blame myself. It can be used by movie schools to show how a film is not about a movie about something I can say good about this horrible movie. It does not expect a proper character development, and I am not convinced that these are symbols. The set-ups were hockey and hopefully split screens were wasted because sometimes they could not synchronize with alternate shots. I can give it a zero or negative rating. Unfortunately, you do not need to laugh a few times. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is a loyal example of a waste of money, and now I think that's what I think about it.
