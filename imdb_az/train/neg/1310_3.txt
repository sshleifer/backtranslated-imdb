The field is open to an old man living in the woods one day, and one day he sees a witness who killed a child in the woods. Drilling for a soft, tried to convince and convince that the old man did not have an imagination. However, there is always a problem where the elderly man is headed by a police officer, where there is no corpse. There is street dialogue reflecting an old man living in a house, reflecting the majority of the scenes of the movie Soft For Digging. When I saw the kid in the movie appearing in front of an old man, I saw twice scaring. The rest of the movie I had to accept did not attract me; The film's pace was a bit slow. Limited dialogue is not a problem. However, after the film was watched, the development of the story and the development of its results lasted a long time. I could have had more relationships, anxiety, and encounter with a child and an older person. At night you are not alone in the tree, you can make some exciting situations, children are always afraid of ghosts, look at the darkness.
