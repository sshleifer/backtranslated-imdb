Discovery Channel / Animal Planet should be ashamed of themselves. This fantasy is modeled after a series of "Walking with Dinosaurs". Although it is 100% fantasy, it is presented in the same actual and archaeological way. Mix even with fantastic dragons T-rexs and dinos and exhaustion. <br /> <br /> It does not mean sci-fi, but when it is featured on an educational channel, it gives the show a sense of true reality. <br /> <br /> The entertainment itself is 7.5 but the way I have to give is 1/10. Do not get me wrong, I have no problem with fantasy, but it's wrong to put them in the way. <br /> <br /> I think that's a great deal of "Walking with Dinosaurs", because now you have to see how foolish the mini-series is.
