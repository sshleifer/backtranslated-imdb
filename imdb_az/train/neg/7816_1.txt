Moreover, Superman's funny books are incredibly naive and targets ten years old. What's important is the movie "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, a question for you, esteemed readers, how much would you really believe that Superman will be defeated by Kevin Spacey? Everyone? As I thought. There are no spoilers here. <br /> <br /> First, this movie looks like a commercial (Superman / Clark Kent is a scene in the bar with Budweiser drinking). Think of the Superman trade, take two and a half hours. Let's be serious, it's not "Amadeus" or "Running". In fact, you feel that this movie is a very long way. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the scenario is foolishness. Sometimes, even if it's funny, it's just stupid in the movie. And in this case. Of course, dialogue is shameful. I do not believe to write someone else's money. How many times can you talk to unhappy people? How many times will the physical law be subjected to aggression? (Jesus, not only the power of Superman, but also the resistance of the material he deals with.) How many times will Lois Lane be misled by Kent? How many times are Hollywood producers looking for a story in poor comic books? Since it's hard to make a good story, why is there a weak story for the start? This does not just work. Children, take a hold. Please try again, please. Or simply wanting to stay on vacation. I feel WGA is on vacation. No crime. People destroy the dirty money paid, but I'm asking for the quality of the product. In this case there is no quality. <br /> <br /> I hope that I will not comment on this issue. <br /> <br /> Some of the issues are related to this issue. Kevin Spacey is fun, but he is alone. Audience is not enough for jokes. Without a doubt, the heroine of a comic book can be turned into a realistic person with a clear motive, as well as doubts, fears, and depth. <br /> <br /> Finally, all the creators' efforts make this movie a parody. The second one is very bad, because it's all about the screen. <br /> <br /> What is the final result? One word: shame. <br /> <br /> This special movie, women and girls, is a camp. Do not waste your time and do not waste your money. Stay home, read the book.
