First of all, it is interesting. A naive caretaker (Colin Firth) is married to a very mysterious woman (Lisa Zane), but she is only known as soon as possible. They look happy, then disappear without warning. She searches for her and after a few dead, she can cause some of her abusive childhood and some past conspiracy. And then, the filmmakers did not know what to do with the story. The start is as suspenseful as it is called, at least it is possible to wait. Then it can be interesting or even more meaningful. And the latter was so bare, so boring and deprived of any excitement or intelligence, the screenwriters did not know what to do with it and they were tired. How disappointing is a good idea!
