A few months ago, I was discussing this movie with another IMDb post (Hey, Kmadden). Poster would like it if I gave 'Flushed Away' chance. <br /> <br /> The "open association" has good intentions (at least part of Aardman), but there is no power to pull it together. His best asset, instead of the IMO movie Roddy (Hugh Jackman), was the main character of the film, the sailing rattan / boat captain, Rita (played by Kate Winselt). <br /> <br /> Rita's cool, tough and interesting, Roddy spends most of her time on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of the things that worries me most is because the 'FA' is not the beginning, but the repetition of jokes. When shot at Roddy Crouch, the film is sure to hit five more times. "My name is Shocky," says one of Rita's brothers, then Roddy electrocutes at least three times. <br /> <br /> Ketzenberg's kleptomaniak tendencies are Pixar (a similar movie, coincidentally, five looks like one.) The cheap gags that contain a bit of pain, my tolerance is not always low. but I'll say I'm disappointed in Aardman. They can do it (and have done) better. Try the next time, guys.
