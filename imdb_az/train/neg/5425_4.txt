As I was inside Yvonne De Carlo, I bought the Mirror Mirror (but I thought it was very good in American Gothic), but unfortunately it did not play a big role in this movie. Starts OK and moves fast ... but at the end it gets a bit tedious and boring. This can not be said to be a boring film, but this is not very average and spectacular. I did not like the "posession" side and there were no decent gore scenes. Moreover, the 'essential' story was very mixed and the end is not entirely significant. I learned the story about the Gothic girl and how she got revenge on her torturers. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to invite Horror fans to Mirror Mirror - it's not something to moan.
