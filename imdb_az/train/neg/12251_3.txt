Oh, CGI. A blessing when used correctly. At the same time, sinners do not know what they are doing. Unfortunately, this is not the only thing that is poorly used in the rip-off of all these paradises. <br /> Ok, I read any number I read in any number, probably noticed two things. 1: I love budget horrible movies. And 2: If you are a lovely guy in a low budget movie, I'll often see them. So now let's get out of this way. This is a horrible movie that does not like me. Very effective player, terribly, laughs effects and scripts are the competitors with the worst of Battlefield this year. Until the perfect sweet boy ... Dax Miller (Goku) earns this award down his hands. This guy is hot! And not surprisingly, she's just a toned body with beautiful eyes and a cute butt ... she can actually move (well, as you can do in this irritable movie). <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < ... <br /> <br /> A film crew travels to a remote island to shoot a documentary about two surfers (rooted child and her friend) who are surfing with sharks. A large saltwater crocodile hiding around the unknown island. Croc shows show mayhem and people are eating. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this film is a hit. It started very well, but soon he was foolish and foolish. One main character is lunch (quite humorous), and our remaining heroes say loners are against the cost of the victims. Also, if this croc is on top of the ground and in the water chain, what is the whole shark in the surrounding area? If this thing can eat a 40-foot boat, I do not think they will be around a few missing sharks. The FX is the worst part of my dissatisfaction. CGI has been able to shut down extremely awkward and even animatronic crocs. Attention. National Geographic. Discovery Shop. Croc Hunter. They know how the crocodile is. Undoubtedly, the monsters that were seen toward the end of the film did not refer to any of these provisions. And what is with the pirate / narcotics gang? Did you ever need another reason to knock on a woman? <br /> <br /> It's funny how we get small sub-genres in the movie world. Alligator and his album, Lake Placid, Crocodile and Now Blood Surf, now "multi-dimensional crocodile / crocodile" films should now get their category in Blockbuster. The alligator was good. Lake Placid was good. I thought Toba Hooper's crocodile was good. Blood Surf, sucked. <br /> <br /> My price: D-
