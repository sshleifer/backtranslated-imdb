Let me begin by saying that this film is not watching before you can expect it. The movie was recommended by a friend with an inadequate taste, and MTV was stuck in the front cover, so I did not expect much. <br /> <br /> First of all, I have never read that I have never read a book. nor did I watch other versions of the film. <br /> <br /> The player was my main focus with my movie. According to God AWFUL. The mother is pretty mediocre, but she is Maryl Streep compared to the rest of the castle. The main "Hero", Heath, is simply a terrible thing. He can read the well-known klichel songs, but it's about it. His hero, just laughing at the points I drowned, broke 'sad' moments. The Isabelle girl was also teary, and her brother was a plain character played by an actor who could not only express his impressions. And when it tried, it failed to fail. Neil Patrick Harris was the only actor to play, though the direction was bad, even though he did not live up to what I was seeing. But my dad was not half bad in my memory, but I could not remember the movie at least. <br /> <br /> The story itself was not very good. Imagine more breakups. Predictable story (until I understand it). In general, it's not just interesting or compulsory but nothing we've never seen before, and nothing to watch right here. <br /> <br /> Being the last tearjerker. He did not do anything like this. The final end is nothing but almost the next. In fact, I have to ask my friends to tell me what happened after the end, "Wait, when did they say?" I say. No good sign. <br /> <br /> "I'm really no excuse because the correction was the worst I've ever seen, although it's made for the startup TV because it's fade-ins-fade-out. a sensitive man, I cried in two episodes of Simpsons, and I have never cried or even approached during this twist, because this movie is not worth your time, a tearjerker who really wants to look elsewhere.
