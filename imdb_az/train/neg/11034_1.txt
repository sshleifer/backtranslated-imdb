I think the New Yorker is a big fake, that's all his instructions are foolish. I like being better, he acts as a prostitute and is put together. His mother came out of this world, and I think he is the daughter of the devils. That is, he thinks these men have already daughters, and I believe you're with her, and you'll be ashamed to return to her. He is evil, spoiled, and a great fraud. It is very interesting to watch the show, how much money you have to make this horrible show, and I talked to her with her mother, and now she looks like a crazy girl, and she says, she will not be found anywhere, Do not be with them.
