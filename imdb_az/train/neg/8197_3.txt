I have seen this movie this evening and have to say that this is a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but he ends the funny and more animated film here, and the film is rebuilding the classic "Santa Claus movie" of the 80s, but at the end of the camp with or worse Sheena Easton song. The story is a runaway black sheep runaway in the family with a North Pole, despite something like a holiday in your family. Of course, when Fred (Vince Vaughn) brings together his girlfriend (including Rachel Weisz in a roles), she sparks the family coming home, so her parents and her more successful brother, Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) it's like a fraternal rivalry that threatens all Christmas and a bit of anarchy. Now, if you think you know the end of this movie, I think it will be right for me to be modest. Vince Vaughn plays the same lover all the time she plays, but this time she is more livid, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Klaus, but the role is less than that, Elizabeth Banks plays Santana's assistant, but she's not a neurotic joke and poor Kevin Spacey is another guy who plays the same man playing mostly in the film "Glengarry Glen Ross", but a bit more anal. Only two actors, Paul Giamatti, are really proud of his role as Santa Claus, but I'm somewhat embarrassed to be in the movie and can not blame him, and Weisz plays a smaller role than most of Rachel's major players, including Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti is a shame that the script is worth more than what he has given them. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, it's a big disappointment.
