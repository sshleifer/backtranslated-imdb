### Spoilers! ### <br /> <br /> What does this movie offer? Except control and cinematography they encounter with a terrible plot. Denzel Washington's talent is saddened by the fact that it's going to be a waste of money. We are skeptical that the Mexicans themselves, their forces, militarists, and the American need can not escape the needs of others. And we know that the father has a shadowless character, but it's Mexican rather than Mexico. He killed all that he thought he was dead. And he? Of course, it will not hurt the sensitivity of Hollywood fans, not a young child. The commercial scene was the only thing that hindered the rating under the "Taken" (like some critics) to me "disadvantageous". It's time to get some sort of movies. In the rating of such films, we have to doubt the reliability of the IMDb for 7.7 such a movie and 7.0 for my own private Idaho. Go to the number! The mine will be in the range of 3.5-4.0
