Escaping the success of the Cube 2: Hypercube (2003) and the original Cube (1998) claim, Director Ernie Barbaras takes us to the third, with Cube Zero the third installment in advance. <br /> <br /> Wynn (Zachary Bennett) and Dodd (David Huband), two low-ranking operators, are sitting in the depths of the giant and random organization, the time and place, and watching the behavior of the observing people, the giant placed in a cubicle network. They have been convicted felons who chose this terrible and deadly test on the deadly injection of the people we observe, and the observers have nothing to do with it, since Wynn, a mathematical genius, did not agree to put Cube in Cassandra, a woman named Cassandra . Suddenly I realized that their "job" was not what they seemed to be and they could be part of a deeply ill and wounded thing ... <br /> <br /> For those who have seen and loved the Original Cube, this is probably Prequel, you will not like it. The story does not have the potential; it's simple that you just do not need to expand the first Cube movie. Stand alone, very interesting concepts and a little bit of psychological tension with precision on his message. He was also satisfied with himself. <br /> <br /> The Cub Zero problem is to destroy the original mystery, to try to ask more questions, but to create a confusion that really does not need any idea. Of course, good questions should be raised, but not as a continuation of a film but according to their essence <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By saying these words, other features of the film, such as motion, direction and writing, are not. The film has a unique look of cinema like The Matrix and Dark City, and they have been able to recover the claustrophobic feeling of the first cube. Unfortunately, Barbarash does not have enough positive qualities for this savings.
