Unfortunately, having a lot of my "a" list, and the actors of the good b list are happy to accept this movie, but they did it, and it made me drink water to watch. I have never heard of this movie, but in the DVD coverage was Cuba Gooding Jr right, and how bad can James Woods be in the background? In a word too! This movie begins. There are some twists and turns, then puts only one egg. The latter was weak, the writer called her, and her 4-year-old son sat down on the writer and broke the end. How awful a film is for such a weak person for a film named "Last Game". These are the types of movies that can move the actors to the "a" list in a hurry "b" list. I hope Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods do not do this habit.
