I just signed up for IMDb to comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> I was sitting in this movie and the only thing that surprised me was that I wanted to stop him in some way. <br /> <br /> I've seen many action movies and not what, but Princess Blade has some of the worst battles I've seen in a movie. Most of the sword fight is to turn the swords back and forth and to encourage the opponent not to act the same way. <br /> <br /> So now we have a "futuristic" action movie and there is almost no sign in the future. <br /> <br /> Most of the film does not even work, and shows the development relationship of the Princess and the farmer / terrorist and her troubled sister. The film has many areas, and none of them should value anything. <br /> <br /> I can see some of the bad guys who are very bad. All the shooting charmed all the lines, so it was difficult to watch what had happened. But I have a general idea. (I did not keep the movie in my eyes) <br /> <br /> If you heard about this as a futuristic action / ninja flick, you have heard wrong. What I did when I heard about it, and now I lost 90 minutes of my life. Do not let this happen. Speak well of him.
