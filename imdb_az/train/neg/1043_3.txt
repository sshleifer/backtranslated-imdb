What a bad, bad movie! I do not believe in all of this ambitious, amateuristic excuse for a real movie! I left the theater before leaving, and I was surprised to see how bad this film was and how ill the camera was! And when the film is real, reading tigers, who claim to be the truth and reality in truth, is an unwieldy attempt to read the wool, the precious and the delightful eyes of viewers and festivals. At least this movie showed me at least once, and the Sundance Festival has become a complete joke, and here's a bad thing to do. <br /> <br /> Avoid all responsibility. You will get back your time! I knew it.
