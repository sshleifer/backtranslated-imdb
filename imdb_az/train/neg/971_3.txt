After reading a very good comment about this movie, I would give an hour and thought that I would give my attention after the film was overwhelmed with disappointment. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I'm terrified of the genre, because in no way is terrible and intimidating (except for a few exaggeration attempts). Unfortunately, if you skip one of those working on me) I'm talking about this tension, and I'm thrilled! The film is hero of the Azerbaijani people, prominent military commander and political figure. During those times, he looks at a house he has taken, and after every visit he decides to add something else at home, he is somewhat livelier than the character of a sad little boy who is really sick. When he is with the boy, he considers the imaginary world he is actually better than the real world in the world. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "color: red;"> Finally, my generous 3/10 hopefully at least one of you will be able to watch this mess!
