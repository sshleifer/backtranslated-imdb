Geez, a Gay guy living in NY, I can say that I have not seen the defunctities of the Gay culture described in this movie - and I am so glad! This movie will be broadcasted on television in the United States, it will be a great anti-gay version and I can not say that I will blame them. People in this film do not represent the average Gay America or even the average Trandgender America, and what they represent is a transparent and embarrassing nightmare. Of course, flawless heroes are terrifying and clear racist thoughts (anti-aging) are clear and disturbing - can not be blamed for drug, unemployment, and lack of education in the film's shooting. The actions of these people are not despair, they are like personal will and rejection of something ready to produce something from themselves.
