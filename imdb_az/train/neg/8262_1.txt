This is really a terrible thing: no purpose, stylist performers in strange, mid-or recent seemingly strange scenes are embarrassed and strangely annoyed, cut off without any obvious artistic or even cognitive intent, completely irrational and say can not be understood as the "story." What's similar to the "style" of the film is that the whole "style" simply serves to magnify itself, because suddenly a tap with a downward spiral and without suddenly a combination of pan or unexpected sections, the project is almost incredibly large misconception and the almost negative attack of the material. He has been nominated for the worst movie ever.
