Have you heard people say "their intentions"? Well in this film, the actions of the characters are more on future telegraph plans - they are at home drunken and show up on the buffet. This can be forgiven when the setting is better used or symbols are more charismatic or nuanced. The character of Embeth Davidtzin is not mystery, it is not just wooden, and Kenneth Branag has probably failed to convey the character of his sadness as it is written. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: an open plot, a recorded speeches, strange "South" words that do not work by English actors.
