I see that many people like this movie. It was a movie that I was given 101, and the person class failed. Lindsey Price indicates that the movie is much anticipated until the end of the video. <br /> <br /> First, we have a widow's younger father. Cliché # 1 films / TV is always a child of a child, killing their parent, or drifting onto a single son's son and leaving the child to care for the child. From my 3 sons 2 1/2 from my dad. <br /> <br /> Crisis # 2 The attacker will play a big role in the movie when she has a video camera in her hands. It will always be decisive, or even if that person is in the air <br /> <br /> Cliché # 3 The danger must be Latino origins. And they should be illegal. <br /> <br /> The Latino 4 Latino should receive a high-level education in its native country. In this case, he was a professor of 200 people per month. <br /> <br /> <strong> Cliché # 5 There was not a single person who had committed a crime. not a crime, an accident. But in this case, he now has lost all meaning in his passage when crossing the border, as it now feels a bitter annoyance, and now his daughter brings herself into a dangerous situation. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 6 Works on a hoodlum that does not commit any crime, but some poor little cute kids. Because the child's parents should play a large part of the movie, and a person who accidentally kills a child may be ridiculous with the parents. <br /> <br /> Klique # 7 is a movie that a police officer is not angry veterinary and she is pairing with a shepherd. Even if there were murderers who were the most experienced police officers on a police force. Sev7n and Copy Cats and Law and Order immediately come to mind. <br /> <br /> Go Cliché # 8 and some unemployed roll the Soap Stars. I love the Lindsey Price now. But Susan Haskell can not escape from the paper bag and splits from right to left each time he opens his mouth while using Marty to survive. It uses me to be a seafarer. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> <br /> <br /> The film's do not think it's costly or cerebral to be good. But it was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I'm going to end it. I'm going to be a story because I feel it's going to harm humanity, and never will a human being go back in spite of this movie. Includes Clice # 6 and # 7. Unless you have seen a movie before you see what's going on. The father finally sends a dumber mistake from the police and is thrown out by an angry veteran, suddenly angry. He used to think that the poor man was innocent through the movie and mistakenly hit him. He did not. For a little girl who now brings her father together. What happened to him? Over time, the family lives with a family killed by his father! Come on! He knew that it would happen because he was a replacement child! So Lindey did not go through the Price character and did not live. <br /> <br /> This film was unfair to me. Because this film has many areas and could be explored and dropped down, but it chose the cliché. 2 stars, 2 stars, my little daughter, I thought very well and Lindsay Price was characteristic, but what could she do. My advice is a headache, and it squeezes your head despite this speed
