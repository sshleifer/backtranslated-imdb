I rent this movie for a few laughs. I never saw the SNL skate, but could not it be bad with hits like Tommy Boy and Waynes World? Answer: That was it. This film was a relief tool after a difficult day. I was expecting a plot line and a funny part, but nothing was missing. Tiffany amber was thieson and just about that.
