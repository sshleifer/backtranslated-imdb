The writer and filmmaker, Hopkins, succeeds in making this a meaning that no one knows in the film. But perhaps there is a problem. His film has a lot of ambitions and his intentions were obviously complicated and so deep, but he was very upset. There are no characters. <br /> <br /> We do not know anyone who is my wife. <br /> <br /> This can be a mix of the script and the scenario with each other. Is that what? Can be. So I do not mean that Slipstream is unambiguous; I want to say that there is no explanation. Hopkins movie is a trial. At the moment of a fateful meeting with a man, he can claim that life was shot and missed and / or that it was a blind chance that success was blind. time, dreams, thoughts, and reality points are thrown into the slipstream. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it does not place space for such an emotion mark on a small, rather complicated level, that allows us not only to symbolize, but even to communicate with its symbols. <br /> <br /> Nippy and crushing, entertaining, frequent camera work and editing school has left me, but I have a lot to do with the movie. Over the last decade, there are many films that have a film cut or camera drift and technical dodices that damage the atmosphere and other atmosphere. I guess that was the purpose of dreams to create an impression of impression. But I understood everything I was watching about Slipstream and went out the same way. And I just do not care because Hopkins has been trying to take care of us. There are interactive movies and you are unaware of your existence, sitting on a rocking chair and watching movies. Slipstream last.
