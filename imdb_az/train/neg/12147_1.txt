This is probably the worst attempt in a Zombie movie I've seen so much happiness. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Any review found on this site is, of course, directed by the directors, directors of the filmmaker or the director. How is this film sucked? <br /> <br /> Is it your wife? Incoherent. Dialog? Ugly. As I understand that the budget is budget, I will not shake the impacts. But is it a non-obese zombie? C'mon! And for a film taken on Rhode Island, why did this truck make a Massachusetts plate sports? Find some, of durability. <br /> <br /> "Causes" dance during a soldier. Please do not put your old girlfriend or friend's brother naked in your movie. It was an ugly film filled with ugly people and no work has to be mentioned on the Romero cover. The next time you decided to make a movie.
