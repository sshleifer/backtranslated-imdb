The Hood of the Living Dead and these men are like other similar movies, and they are filmed with friends with zero talent in a day (the lines are totally unresponsive and unconvincing). 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home videos are better than this movie (although the similarities between them are comparable). "Hey, let's see if we have enough of our movies to buy!" Hopefully nobody was ELSE. Although this research was a bit tough, I was dumping your fake reviews and buying the movie.
