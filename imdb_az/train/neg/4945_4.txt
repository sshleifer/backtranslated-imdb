Of course, this is not really a blockbuster and it is targeting such a position. "Dieter" is the first name of a very popular German musician, who hates for his or her likes or activities, and exactly what this film is about. Based on the biography of Dieter Bohlen a few years ago, it does not mean that it is accurate. The film is full of entertaining (not for other actors, of course) or a mysterious sexual assault content (at least the American standard) - it depends on the individual humor type or "Bohlen" -Fan or not. Technically, there is not much to criticize. When I'm talking about this movie, I find an OK movie.
