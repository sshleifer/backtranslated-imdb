<br /> <br /> Carlo Verdone once managed to combine the perfect comedy with intelligent and stubborn social analysis and criticism. <br /> <br /> Then something happened and he is another spectacular "holier-than-thou" <br /> <br /> Il Mio Miglior Nemico is a line of "working class = good and warm , upper-level = snob and unusual, but at the end of love "can be summarized. <br /> <br /> There's really nothing to talk about in this movie. Each character is a privileged stereotype: a person who forgets his own roots, but who wants to be "good" again, a disobedient rich girl who is an honest and poor poor person. <br /> <br /> In every respect, there is a serious disappointment.
