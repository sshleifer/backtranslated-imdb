It was a bad thing to say at least in this movie! A great number of perfect cars are the disgrace of this LAME movie. Ferrari F430 starts at Las Vegas with a race from LA to finish 1 hour and 45 minutes. I was in it for a 50 minute small four-cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously ... this movie does not justify these cars. Obviously, these writers are only and, of course, with their hands swiveling @ 10 & 2 hours with clock speed. Remember how Eddie Griffin has been fired by Ferrari Enzo, $ 1.5 million: 30-40MPH >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> And ... the biggest SELLOUT Director Andy CHENG !! !! It brings embarrassment to your race. I'm surprised at how many people are convinced that he or she is just going to Hollywood. He took part in a film that describes the Asian Americans in such a negative and false manner. Asian women >> prostitutes prostitutes cheap. Asian men lose their compulsory gamblers and coins that are always defeated. What is all the fear about Asians? Why should such a negative connotation always show them? I am very disturbed by the way I describe the Hollywood opera as a real and negative excuse.
