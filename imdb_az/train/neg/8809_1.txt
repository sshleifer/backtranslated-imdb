A group of women who want to sit around, talk, smoke. They have another woman in the wheelchair because they are deformed and sometimes they are like a baked piece of meat from a few stores adorned with a few fingers. We do not see anybody killing anyone, suddenly there is a body covered in blood. That's why I can not eat spam from a layer now. The idea of ​​spam covering by only one layer is enough to cause the same narcoleptic compatibility as they try to get all of this movie. Sometimes, in a cafe, the scene where a man who "hunts" by torture is accidentally placed is his cellar. Why does he not tell us how this man is captured and how he is bound to Sit-on-The-Couch sisters? There are scenes of some "superhuman" man's confusion. <br /> <br /> He blows blood and blows through a wall, but he does not disclose who he is or what it is about, nor even link it to the story. <br /> <br /> There is no action, there is no special effect, no story. If you want to watch some dull people, do not want to talk about anything while sitting around and smoking and smoking, it's here for about 90 minutes because a dwarf is sitting in a street corner and the above scenes are totally CONCLUSION. (YAWN) Oh, almost forgot, when you go to their new apartment, you see some things moving, including a deformed sister. Several times they do not sit in bed and sleep on the bed.
