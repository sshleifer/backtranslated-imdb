"54" is a film based on the "Studio 54", which speaks of the 1970s. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the main character based on the true workman of the Studio since 1977 - 1982. <br /> <br /> The film's problem is all glitter and style and matter. It's like a "Boogie Nights", trying to be a really terrible and neat satire, but ultimately it is found as low-level wannabe. Mike Myers has been stubbornly charged by Steve Rubell, the owner of the cocaine snorting club. <br /> <br /> This is just a little comedy, and if this is the best attempt to migrate to Myers as Lemmon and other comedians, it is a total failure. <br /> <br /> "54" is a young flick of a fray that is understandable and interesting, but instead of entertaining or even distant. Review your own danger.
