Today is a kind of manifestation of all the shows starting with the classics of the 90s (people are easily blinded by nostalgia today), and some of these shows are undoubtedly good, and this is just a clean bull. In those days, I watched a lot of movies on this show, as I have come back a few times on TV and have never loved it as a child. Even before the age of 8, the Power Rangers see how far they are and especially when the FX is withdrawn. If the show has not started the worst "fight" scenes, the audience is surrounded by a few teenagers and these unnecessary soap operas associated with any minor social problems these days and after. I know you, but I have not given any pig set about anything, and it's a fireworks or a toy that's basically a fugitive fighter to fight again with a cunning man. <br /> <br /> You will not feel the same "part" with this show, although there is really no interest in the actors' actions but on the contrary, the wallet just increases the feeling. <br /> <br /> There is nothing memorable about this show and it was so stunning that it was so spin-off (a good example of Beetleborgs). All this is a quick way to earn some money. I challenge any "admirer" to think exactly how good it is in episodes, because I could not find anything attractive for the kids. I guess that the Power Ranger's most 'admirer' can say 'I can not just get it' or something along that line. In spite of me, I really do not care; Now it's bent and it's still bent.
