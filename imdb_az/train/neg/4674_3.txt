I do not know who was blamed, Miss Leigh or director, but it was not possible to watch his performance like Catherine. On the other hand, Ben Chaplin is doing a great job - against everything I'm interested in. His character is absolutely attractive and attractive. but, of course, he was not greedy enough to reach the tranquility of Leigh's character. Chaplin is not like Leigh's shame and grace, but rather the things that can be understood as his orthopedic endurance. He must have an element of incredible interest in his interest, but it is as incomprehensible as he plays. Spectacles are not pocket. Maggie Smith and Albert Finney, of course, despite all the efforts to throw them. The player on the side is nice to watch. Unfortunately, the products are not like each other because production is very nice.
