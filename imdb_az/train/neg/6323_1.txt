This movie is a bad memory from my childhood. One of these films is to show children when they can not go on vacation on a rainy day and better than watching something else. At least I was in primary school. I just remember this movie. Undoubtedly, I have not seen him for more than 15 years and probably not use it in the rainy days, but I would like to warn everyone that you will do better than sleeping more than having fun. Make me, pick something else. Although the subject is controversial, the assassination is so generous and slow that I can not remember anything about it, and I do not exclude that 15 years later I must warn everyone.
