Before I started to work, I drew this movie on Sci-Fi. This movie is for you if you have seen Dean Cain diving and at least ten times flammable. If this is not yours, I'm afraid you'll be covered with applause, because this movie is pretty bad. Starting from the beginning is a terrible, terrible situation. Heroes are completely immoral, and dialogue is worse than your typical Z-class, Sci-Fi movie. To the end, the film began to remind me of the "Hollow Man" (no gravel, invisible man, but with an excercise dragon, except with a dragon). Unlike other flips, this is not even awesome bad ... it was just bad.
