Without a doubt, it's one of the most horrible movies I've ever had with me. In fact, I never took the time to write one of these, but I felt that I was being wound up in this kind of time to testify to this sadness and to be honest to the victim. There were a large number of parts that made me angry at all with the most casual and disadvantages (eg, when the police hit people with infectious diseases?) When did the patients not treat such people? Is his spouse spying around his outer garment while carrying his weapon when rolled into his bed?). Also, characterized - almost as if we were watching in such films - was terrible (for example, the blonde boy's way - I do not remember his frickin name and did not sound his voice - he totally opposed his girlfriend and escaped to leave) and I screamed them all I wanted to finish! The production was heartbroken and there was nothing to write home in cinematography.
