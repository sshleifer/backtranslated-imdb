I'm not a great Freddy Krueger admirer, but I do not like the other nightmare in Robert Englund and Elm Street. I think Robert Robert is a very good player. No one plays better than Freddy Krueger It's not a crime Robert, it's just a part of cast that sucked.The player is terribly scary, the plot is really weak and Freddy Krueger can even be watching.Sometimes the sequels are even better. On Friday, the 13th franchise (I thought the update was the best in the array). But it's not one of those films. The original was good, in my opinion, the 2nd was better, the third was good, but I did the others. Whatever you do, I do not make the same mistake by following a similar pretext.
