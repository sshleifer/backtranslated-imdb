The Dewaana movie goes through ordinary clich√©s. Men and women fall in love and marry, killing a family friend who wants her husband's fate, recurrence of women, and surprise surprise one number one. The film is reminiscent of Yand Chopra's Chandni and many others. Divya Bharti and Shah Ruk Khan give good speeches. Amrish Puri acts like a villain and is nothing but a standard Bollywood ghost. Nadeem Shravan's music is perfect, all songs are brilliant. My favorites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye. Dewanna is an ordinary film that moves.
