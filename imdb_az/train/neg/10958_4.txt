After watching the DVD for Christmas in 2005, I watched this, but I did not have a heart after reading other comments. Obviously, this is a well-functioning movie for children of a certain age. Yes, do not be a full Blackberry. still can work for some children - they are watching the whole LOTR and Harry Potter, for example, if they are unsatisfied and visually impaired. But if you are older, keep away from it; <br /> <br /> Good bits: Barbara Kellerman, like the Witch, especially in early stages with Edmund, simply limits charismatic evil and madness. Mr. Tumnus's funeral, as well as the ability to act as the best of the BBC, as Prof. Michael Aldridge plays a role of Professor's role and Jeffrey S. Perry. dramas The lion suit works very well, it is incredibly considerable. <br /> <br /> Poor bits: almost everything, especially two areas. First, casting. English is full of good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive English school children. How can it be that these four stiffs ended? They act and speak like wooden soldiers. Peter has no gravity or charisma (and seems to be shorter than his younger brother); Edmund is simply miserable; and Lucy ... Sophie Wilcox is a very dramatic, dramatic look like Lucy, and I can not imagine how he understood the job. <br /> Two, animal suits. Again, it seems that they are working for some children. Kids can still enter the movie if they are at a level where Big Bird and Elmo have exciting, convincing characters. But an experienced spectator, seeing the 12-year-old Azkaban prisoner? When Mr. Beaver leaves this tree, he will be the shoelace of a cruel, terrible laugh. Costumes do not just work - I could not and I think that any adult or modern teenager could not stop her while looking at Mr. Beaver. <br /> <br /> Thus, the ten stars and souls of the soul for the youth; everybody read or read the book again and watched a better movie that opens your imagination.
