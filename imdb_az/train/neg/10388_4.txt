After reading all of the IMDb comments here, this movie appears to be torn in many ways, but that's not bad. <br /> <br /> "Home at home" is a dream story about a husband and wife Ted and Laura Fletcher and their daughter Amy. Old house in Japan. They know very little, a Japanese ninja kills a brutal friend and lover, and then 100 years ago, a samurai killed himself with a sword. As the strange events happen in the home, the lives of the previous residents carry out the reconstruction of the bloody crime that took place 100 years ago and began to have the bodies of life. <br /> <br /> When I decided to give it a movie and a chance I saw it, it looked like a ghost story. It was coming up on the agenda and it was dark, but in my day it got worse. The imagination sequence was slightly more developed, and we were able to randomly open transparent blue colored figures around random families and take their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts in this film reminded me of my ghosts at the Haunted Mansion on Disneyland. I could be wrong, but after watching it, it turned out to me that Japan's "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the correction of this movie by America were so mysterious. <br /> <br /> In an ancient Japanese house, a brutal murderous act, a blatant act, a blasphemous home, and so on. But I can be wrong. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty dark ghost story to sum up. Do not go out of your way to see this, but if you want something like it and you come to the TV, you can give it a shot. 4/10.
