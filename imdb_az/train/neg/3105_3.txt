I do not believe everyone can do a comedy about homelessness. Of course, Brooks did not give a comedy about the _real_ homeless people. There is no information on drug, prostitution or violence in these streets. What we have discussed in this film is homeless in the Fantasy Land, and the only difference between them and us is not to eat quite often. Brooks's films have been worsening over the years. This is another nail in the coffin.
