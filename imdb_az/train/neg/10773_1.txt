I watched this horrible thing on TV. Of course, one of these films is to see how bad you are. Undoubtedly, I do not know how much your bar is going down. <br /> <br /> The heroes are stereo-shaped, and at least an attempt to create another Bad News Bears is embarrassing. <br /> <br /> In my time, I have seen a number of spider webs, but there is no reason to mention one of them. Because it's "Numero Uno". <br /> <br /> Let me put it this way, watched the Vanilla Ice movie because it was so fun that it was funny. It's ... this is not so good.
