Directional Just horrible. The scenario is confused, it's a painful move, and the story just drags. No doubt, Sally Potter and a little other holiday. It would not have been so bad, but it was the director, writer and star of the film, and it only honors himself. I found myself in spite of the romanticism that developed between the two main characters of my own, and soon came a moment. There are two firefighting features. First, many of the shooting, especially in Paris, is really beautiful and looks good on black and white. Secondly, whether you are a fan of tango, music is great and perfect (except for singing Sally). You can watch this movie at your own risk, or if you need an unwanted laugh. I'm sure someone is applying. Statistically, it is necessary to do so.
