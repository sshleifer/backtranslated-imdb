This movie is massively boring and ambitious. There is only one good moment to squeeze a sailor Mr. Barney (thinking of purple dinosaurs). The music sounds great - fortunately, Bjork, a person with a very beautiful interior beauty, has been fraudulent in his art. The tea service pump looks like a beautiful ritual vapid. mythology and culture are not respected in this film. Not just a Japanese culture but also from another filmmaker ... Keep in mind that a perfect "art lifestyle simulates" - the crew is a huge thing. What is the audience in the theater? <br /> <br /> Emperor has no dresses! <br /> <br /> Emperor has no clothes. Dear Barney! I saw Jodorowsky's HOLY MOUNTAIN. BS, the fake cover has been removed. You have stolen your pictures and all your art cats from this person. HALI MOUNTAIN HAS BEEN HAS BEEN RELEASED STILL FINANCING YOU FINALLY TO GET THE STRUCTURES OF THE CULTURAL COUNSELS OF THE WORLD! Poor Jodorowsky, lost in a financial battle with Beatles Lawyer, became filmmaker Lennon / McCartney. And Jodorowsky while Beatle-BTW is MONKE! The cheaply subtle mysterious rubbish just liked by the first-year students of the easy kitschy college. And BTW is a filmmaker. If you are interested in filming a reality, I will legally defend you with a summit that you have protected Jodorowsky, defending true theft.
