Paula's "brain of the brain" come to Verhofen with a delicate and delicate version of INVISIBLE MAN story. If he turned to a Pokemon movie, I'm sure he would turn into some massive orgy. I'm not sexually explicit or even sleaze (not my other reviews), but obviously, the director has a mind and has not seen interesting images on the story line of an invisible man. It would be good if the film did not spend a lot of time with an invisible Kevin Bacon woman from Europe. <br /> <br /> The actors can play their own game in a single copy of the cheese scenario, but I feel bad for some of them, including William Devane, who was completely wasted here. <br /> <br /> But what can I expect from the director of SHOWGIRLS that BTW is more entertaining than this stilted and worse movie?
