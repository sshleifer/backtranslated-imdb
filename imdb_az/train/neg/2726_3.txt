Given his pedigree, this movie should be a more unpleasant film. Even with a collection of lively eccentrics with a lipstick, what exciting awaiting movie Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingoldu did not expect? <br /> <br /> It is not really funny as Kim Novak's gifts have been approved by Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a wonderful comedian as he demonstrated in films from Philadelphia Story to Harvey. I think it is better than anyone else. Perhaps except cats.
