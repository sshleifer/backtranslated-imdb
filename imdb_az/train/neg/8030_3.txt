I do not pay much attention to this fact. The story is quite terrible and not convincing. I was pleased with the first 10 minutes, the bill was good. It was then terribly terrible. Tim does not fit into his role, he is confused as an exaggerated donkey, and Pruitt Taylor vince is totally unconvincing as a gambler player. This is an idealistic film and as a musician, I feel a bit frustrated after watching him. Since 1900 there are no scenes playing or playing with friends, it is totally self-interested. It's hard to get in touch with this character, maybe watching the wrong movie. If you do not have any real passion for life or the feelings of music, then you are happy in stopping kufr and watch it.
