This movie is not worth the movie. The dialogue is packed with straight, sticky lines and is given by amateur actors who like to sing for the first time. The choppy, shaky, movie style "The Ring" style is an inexpensive imitation of visual effects. Heroes do not act as normal people. For example, a hero looking for his twin brother in the house reinforces his way inside the front door, drags all the fears and tricks around the house, and does not call his sister's name to see if she is home. Yes? She replaced her only to look after her sister. It has led to his childhood. Many unnecessary flashbacks are a typical sign of amateur director. Indeed, it's a funny thing to watch a lot of women shooting the driver into the drive to drive the car around the corner, here's a side view, now watching the front look. It's enough. You believe you're watching television ads for Solaris! Horrible movie. More than 0 to 100. I'm really sorry for anyone who has spent money to shoot or watch this movie.
