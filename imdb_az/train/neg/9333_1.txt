Terrible !!! I do not want to be very negative, but this film's foolish monkey has an IQ. What is a disaster. I just can not believe how bad this movie is. Dialogs are just a very strange and off topic, when the camera works just like a soundtrack for Saudi Arabia's Lawrence, just horrible, when I watched this movie to see how bad it is to get this movie. Yan frikik "actor" is some common disaster.Sorry falls to the ground where all the thumbs and legs and anything can hang on my body. Harvey Keitle is a great actor, but maybe he knows that he is in a financial crisis to take part in a fiasco film. . . . . this film should be presented to teach all the students in all movie schools how to film a single movie
