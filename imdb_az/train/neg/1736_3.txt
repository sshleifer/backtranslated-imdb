Especially liked by Betty Grable, now "The Argentina Way", but when it comes to disaster he also had a "round" and obviously the whole movie was a shame. The story with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (pretty despicable) was bad, the colors were good and the film was too long. There were old postures that tested and promoted interests like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner, but had no success. The music was unhappy and, in a word, I was not in any way memorable .... I've never seen this because I'm such an admirer of Miss Grapel!
