This film had the potential to be a worthy horror film. The main character was deserved and I apologized to him and had a decent amount. But everything else is something else. Director Emmanuel is not quite flawed in filmmaking. <br /> <br /> In the film there are some random occasions that are randomly encountered. He does not know that he is trying to be profound and intelligent and poetic, but he is not. He was stupid. Basbra's random shots were on the main character, in casual buildings, casual panels of buildings, and in a distant random cats. WTF? And the clouds. <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> EX: Guy, the lawn and camera circles around tries to burn. Instead of just one shot, he corrects it as EDGY so 10 different shots! and HIP! and SMART! dishonesty. <br /> <br /> The player's horror shows that the film is so funny. It causes a cowardly gymnast and turns and turns every time. And some deaths could have been better. You do not expect the main bull to result in a long-lasting death. A simple corncob in the ear. The love interests were warm. Magnificent. That's why this movie was 2.
