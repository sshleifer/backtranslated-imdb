When I wake up suddenly, I'm beaten on a plastic sofa and I know it's a hot Saturday afternoon. Why did I sleep? Did I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all of my grandma's muscle relaxers? Can Adult be the startup narcolepsy? <br /> <br /> No, I was sitting in the back while surfing the channel, and the lack of humor and talent quickly leaked into my life. <br /> <br /> Headaches, mouth-agape, shoulder-to-wards deteriorate. But I have to give these moronic and boring twins to sell these ideas. Perhaps they had the same effect on my ESPN programming executors, and when he woke up a few terrible episodes were boring and he hoped that all viewers would be asleep, and nobody would. <br /> <br /> <strong>
