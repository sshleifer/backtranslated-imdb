It was a decent movie, I really liked it. But the latter is so sharp! There is absolutely no closure and the tone is empty. What happens after the concert? What happens to her lover? Is Grant Connected? Is this coming here in the next period? And what is Angela? Obviously, Holly's performance brings Angela under a few bars, but does not show anything to react. He stayed in the air for a long time and was very dissatisfied. I do not know if it tries to put a space for the next or something, but it ends extremely, and the film really makes a joke. I'm very upset.
