This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. And I do not say good. We had to see a terrifying fear / tension, we chose one of the most terrible in the store. Once in the movie, we had everything expected. And more! (or less?) <br /> <br /> Actors seem to read lines of posters behind the camera. Special effects are created by putting a red-looking plastic on the front of the camera, giving us the impression we see from the eyes of the killer rats. And the scenario? <br /> <br /> Take me away, this movie is a sad horror film, but if you want a good movie, look. This is not for you.
