Normally a very powerful player, Robert Forster, lost his son in the sea as a New York family man who killed his son and took revenge on thieves who attacked his wife in a home invasion. The horrific topic was exploited for the excitement of cheap ride in the "Destiny of Death" vessel. In these horrific processes, it is not difficult to frustrate: dialogue is full of betrayers, crime statistics can not be undone, and the supporting signals are ridiculously written (in the courtroom, especially in a negative judge who allows a guilty guilty guilty). Low rent production, especially in urban areas, only increases the fear of self-righteousness. * from ****
