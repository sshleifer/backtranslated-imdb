I feel like a genius; I feel like I'm the only person I've seen this fake movie. I have repeatedly been watching with an explanation, and I've been flipping into the mouth of the screen every time I get in touch, and I've always believed that the film really does not solve anything. Yes, a priest dies, but he did not seem to be in peace with the city he was very sad or about to give. It was and he was idiot. If Peter Cowie did not comment on the film, it would have given me no stomach. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> The scene is a scenario after the camera's disappointment is so close that the characters do not say anything. <br /> Yes, Claude Loudou's performance is sincere and thought-provoking, if you're sadistic, but it's a movie. I feel lonely because, in general, this is a poor impression of Catholic priests, an unusual and open institution of corruption. The young priest on the pride of the young man is a weak scene, but 90% of the film will drag you into the angels' thoughts of the young priests with their deep gaze and window. <br /> <br /> This priest is not simply dependent on humbling, just as sad. <br /> <br /> I did not talk or understand the French language and wanted to help understand English SUBTITLE. movie Yes, the English SUBTITLE is not able to read / read times and that the text was much more read-out (and I'm just a slow reader - I just finished Dostoevsky 3 days). <br /> <br /> I like this movie very much. I have tried everything I have chosen by Criterion Collection and I still can not see that it is so critical in many ways. However, this two-hour film is based on the main character, and we are sitting here to feel empathy, and this is not material. He seemed to be a victim, not a warrior. And for that, I say stunk it.
