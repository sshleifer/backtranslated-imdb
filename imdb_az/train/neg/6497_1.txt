I really had great hopes on this movie, so I took the stuffed salt and hoped for the best. Nearly one-third of the road had just been forced to give up the film, but the film was something that happened without any apparent reason, and all this was cut off. <br /> <br /> "I think you love films, but this is part of the ideas that are thrown into one another and really has nothing to do with it." <br /> <br /> Some do not think that David Lynch-esquire is like that. no trippy visuals nowhere near this area. In essence, an event or story called "hiding something hidden" justifies why it's only a matter of time or 1.5 hours in the movie. The player was good, but not the story. I agree with a previously sentence ... "To be at the head of someone else ... when entering the drug," there is no other meaning.
