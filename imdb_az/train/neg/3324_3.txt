I saw it with a lazy summer afternoon accident. He was playing HBO's family programming channel. From the beginning, I thought I was Disney animation. But in a few minutes I found myself looking for a remotely, so I found the 'INFO BUTTON' key to find out what's on the television in the world. I do not have anything against Harvey F. I love his many movies, but not something, an artist. Of course, he has one of the more unique voices in Hollywood, but works just as part of a wider visual package. A cute duck looked up to a bit of difficulty holding her voice. As for the rest of the shedding, it does not filter out. <br /> <br /> Who is this film that targets weak voice talent, strong animation ...? Gay teens duck? I can not get it. Are the role models for young people and homosexuals really the way they should go to the animated ducks? Like a favorite story and title, I made this movie look like an ugly duckling.
