This is the first episode of the new show today, and it was terrible. Only Shaggy does not have a noisy voice, listening to its own lines, but far from the original concept and animation style that can be understood as a Scooby-Doo show. <br /> <br /> While Fred and Velma were walking in the dark during the dark days, Scooby's nephew Scrappy was still there, but the group still solved their secrets. Instead, Shaggy and Scooby are struggling with a James Bond type super-villain and his merchants while living in a brother. There is even a van called "Mystery Machine" (and the teaser for the next episode, which promises no comfort for transformer-type robotic cars). How can anyone get Scooby Doo and do that? <br /> <br /> The show boasts two points for two Scooby Doo stages, all of which speak out loud with outside Shaggy, and even am very generous.
