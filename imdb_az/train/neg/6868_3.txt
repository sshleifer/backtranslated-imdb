Yes, like a Orthodox woman living in Boro Park, I'm a little biased about this movie. However, Boaz Yakin's only purpose was to make this movie Orthodox-bashing. With our wiggies, our modest dresses and separate seating places, we're now a pretty easy target. The neighbor had never been on the surface. As a result, there is more hawthorn than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia that she loves her more than G-D or their parents. He could not walk in the face of his weakness because of his father's command. 2. Sonia comes out of the sword of her son. Is there a Hasidian woman in Munseh? It is difficult to believe that he has never been involved before. Nevertheless, even this reform of Judaism is still being carried out by briss mood ceremonies. 3. Was Mendel lying in his late class? His spouse must stay in bed and avoid kissing on the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel should have been married for more than a year, and now they are not meant for each other? A little clue - a marriage has been set that the girl should take her first boy along with her parents. If marriage does not work, it will not depend on society. 5. If Sonia really wanted to enter the jewelry business, she did not have to go through her hot springs. There are Orthodox women's doctors, lawyers, teachers, and so on. There are. Sonia is smarter than sympathetic. Instead of controlling his life, he sat down and waited for everything to happen and then complained that he did not like the result. It does not remain around one; pour this stereotype. Certainly, he has taken what he deserves.
