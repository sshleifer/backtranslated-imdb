The Vietnamese vetas decide to seize a north-western city, and everyone who is on the road (including women) is abolished. This action-drama scandal, played by Kris Christofferson, was left in theaters before the "A Star was born" that turned around his career. The results in the Simi Valley, Ca, reflect the truth of the script, directed by George Armitage, inaccurate, resolute stereotypes and silly violence. The most interesting for the film, including Armitage, Jean-Michael Vincent, Victoria's Principle, Bernadette Peters and Loni Anderson, is the most interesting, but center of all this is Christofferson, a closed and rough place. It deserves the points that I think is an excuse for an absolutely unnecessary driver, but bad habits (and ridiculous climbing) all dress up as an ugly spot. * From 1/2
