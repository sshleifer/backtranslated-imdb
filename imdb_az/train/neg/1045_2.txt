The rise of Victor Vargas does not happen in what you do most - to be real. Unfortunately, this film has no realities. Heroes and situations are totally artificial and fake. <br /> <br /> Why? Bad routing. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong means in his arsenal. Apparently, Mr Sollett reads that he will not feel uneasy in a film. Wrong! It just gives a bad part. Similarly, shaking the camera does not give a documentary to your movie, it just gives the audience headaches, and it's sensitive to what's on the screen instead of boosting it. <br /> Of course, how miserable is the display on the screen, showing Mr. Sollett's screenplay for his Sundance friends trying to look like "hip" and showing how the "kin" film director is. <br /> <br /> Generally, the only impression is that this movie is leaving you, a bad director, Mr. Sollett. How can I take a few tutorials and guides next time?
