Terrible. I see a great deal of user comments on this show. It's really a Wanna-Be-Friends - Made a knockoff in Taiwan. It's bare like jokes ... and the scheme is ridiculous. Actors are fighting for obviously funny and hitting these horrible punch lines (probably you can tell them). The majority of other commenters are obviously from another planet (or at least one continent). There is no doubt that there are reasons why television companies have abolished ... and then there are no good indicators. Is it unreasonable? Anyway, calmness - if it rains and there is nothing on this planet ... keep in the rain - it's more fun.
