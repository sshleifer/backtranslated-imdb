Some time ago I was on a visit to one of my close friends and we were thrown by a theater, so we thought we would go to this movie. What a mistake! This movie is awesome in every department. I had never heard of the movie before and it was not exactly the case. Not surprisingly, this is the degree he has acquired. This is a comedy, so he says that the director's ability to make such a movie is only one thing. When it's close to Christmas, it's just about a half an hour to start a Turkish trip. At the end of the film, the patient resembles that of a poisoned turkey, and, unfortunately, you have spent time with this kind of dip. Who knows why such things have been obtained? Someone had come out of the theater before the movie went well, and I blamed myself for not having gone too far. It really worries me that you pay good money to see a decent thing, and everything you see and watch is a poor TV show that will be shown on the morning of 2 am, in fact, this should not be the case with the bad, afternoon television. There can be no other word ... Perhaps bad words could not justify it.
