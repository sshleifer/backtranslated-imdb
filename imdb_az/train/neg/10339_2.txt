How Mike Hammer lived - a penthouse with a GOLF bAG stashed in the corner beside a large screen cathode ray tube TV and snazzy fireplace? Nah, a bottle of strawberries and twenty unshaven Camelin collapsed on the wall in the office or in a corner of the LA flop house in a saddest city, dried red shells and oil from his face. Spillane really wrote trash, but how do you get worse? Any movie Noyir will sell in the cash register, add a hot hole to hot tomatoes, and give a blank check to some desperate regimen producer because he thinks it will just aggravate the story line. it is!
