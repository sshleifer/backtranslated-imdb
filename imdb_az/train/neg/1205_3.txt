What is this? Canadian zombie crash, which I've never heard before. One complication is working in the body of a dead body recently. This allows for a long flashback that shows how the boy is. He and his companions went to the cemetery Friday on Friday and raised their dead deadly. Return to our dead body and return to the morgue and the morgue that killed the owner (seeing his eyes). Last WTF? in the flat jacket of the funeral, hit the landlord and shouted, "I am not crazy!" Strangely enough, his eyes are back. <br /> <br /> 58 minutes could not escape that, of course, is a strange thing in the zombie movie. It feels a lot longer, but I put a kind of trance that can not keep watch. There is one of the words in the film, "If you see this image, move away from the screen." In a theater (prophecy) is an appearance of an old man entering the disease, and it starts only when the blood goes out (twice). The scenes are quite damn about the time. If a zombie throws a girl's right hand in the wind, she has a great opaque, but when she turns her fake hand on the left side.
