At first I just want to say that I love this show! But this episode ... this episode is a mockery of all the demonstrations. <br /> <br /> I did not know what they were trying to do with this episode, but they created the worst episode in the entire series successfully. <br /> <br /> There is no story line, everything is chaotic and jokes are ... shit. <br /> <br /> They tried to answer some of the questions in the game. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> outside of ideas and really Very bad.
