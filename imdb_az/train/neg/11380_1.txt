When I first saw Robotboy, I found him fresh and interesting, but then with each episode, this show is trying to teach you how good and bad you are. Episodes were predicted. And the main characters are not interesting. Again, we see parents and friends who are beaten up by their brother, who do not understand their children: a hyper-intelligent guy like a girl and an oily boy. And there is no logic in this show. A super-modern robot that can work on two AA batteries and use multiple weapons. However, the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-active modes. We see two different robots and reduce the idea of ​​the show: "Robot should learn how to behave in human society"
