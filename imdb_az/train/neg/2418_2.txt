The first mistake you have to film a movie is to really use the "dead dead" without a budget for real zombie FX. Of course, it was a low budget zombie squeak - a really low budget. I think it's a movie school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> Considering the above, it was not really too bad and presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre. If you intend to get "R" for violence, you can give a few good pictures of fathers exposed to attacks. Women were less used in this film, which can be classified as "gay interest". <br /> <br /> I'm out of Oakland. There was a heck that took many shots, and there was no police in the eye!
