I would like to say that I usually do not see horror films ... but it was a pity for my heroic taste. I'm used to the types of gastrointestinal acne ... but this particular movie was naked. The player was strange (still a lizard (no luggage) was a cute linen). And more, Korkmaz Slayer was worse! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a great narration about it and people loved it. But when films such as Ring and Emily Rose Exorcist come out, movies like these do not fall as though their children look like childhood. If you want a movie to be played, select it! Special effects are chees like heck. But I can see where this is a low-budget movie. It will be a reminder of the movie "Egyptian Children". Independent films rock time .... a lot. So, if you see a spoon, kill people with corncobs or later, if you go 2 smiling, then these movies will be for you.
