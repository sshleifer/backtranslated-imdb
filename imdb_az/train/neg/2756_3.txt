{rant start} I did not want to believe them at first, but that's what people are talking about when they say South Korea can reach the summit and even go downhill. In 2006, after an amazingly fun and moving monster movie called "Gwoemul" (aka "The Host"), he succeeded in winning a sharp satire from the B-movie genre - consistent Korean blockbusters, though their budgets (mostly for special effects) it has been fantastic. South Korean filmmakers have really wanted all listeners and investors to improve. After a 1999 Shiri / Swiri film, the development of industry, a series of massive budget media films such as China? (rant end) <br /> <br /> The only "reason" that can give me this movie is to spend the most comprehensive and fluid digital animation of a Korean / East Asian style dragon I've seen so far, for the ultimate scenes . Now they introduced the dragon at the start, and in 1996, the film had more personality and purpose than the Dragonheart, and the film could have a few more rescue qualities, except for a large number of digital animated dragons. Remember the Dungeons & Dragons in 2000? The cunning did not know the specific effects of the problem you are using, but how did you use it? I hope they have more (and better) Korean legends that they can use because they have denied many international interests by filming the legends of the Korean dragon. <br /> In short, I agree. with all the negative attitudes that they had gone through before, and that the Koreans felt their folk style "Arirang" at the very end. If the creature deserves special effects or layout schemes, you would give it at least 5 stars out of 10, but I've seen a lot of video games with better camera work and scripting (only little dragons).
