The area is quite interesting ... a scientist (Bateman) finds how to transport eyes and optic nerves like animals to other animals, such as humans. A young man (Monteith) is spoiled by rescuing his partner - a scientist calls a doctor saying that the young man is a good candidate for becoming the first human recipient. The buyer is becoming more and more like a worm, but the effect is nothing more than "strange eyes" and works with dogs at night! (For the whole film) The budget is very low, the dialogue is very stilted (I laughed at some laughing talk loudly) and acting very motionless. The longest part of the film is nothing but wild videos, worms, dreamers and wolves. <br /> <br /> The soldier wants to use eye transplant to restore the vision of the injured soldiers, and maybe he wants to militarize the technology. There is a deceptive subpoppy using India's wisdom about monsters who think that they are a good Indian girl (Korean). When you hit the lovers with heavy blows and hear Indian voices, it creates love - naked, man! It is happening immediately after a horrible crime that corrects this Turkey! <br /> <br /> There are some ridiculous scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <STRONG> A worker in a research lab came into the animal's room to find out that monkeys came out of the cage. He is afraid, remains in the monkey, turns to the left, turns to the left, turns right, turns to the left .. it goes on for some time. WORKING DAMN LAB! I was laughing so foolishly. Another funny scene - our hero is at home, because of the heavy armed soldiers coming out of a window - it opens the window open, military guys go through an open window, look at the window, say "looks like here", and LEAVE! He is out of the open window, guys! Crazy. <br /> <br /> Near the end of the film, military guys repeat machine guns in trees. They cut trees, but there are 6 machine guns to fight with one knife and hero! Shoot the boy! Who wrote it out of this world? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, everything comes from a tax report or a hurry. to use unused budget money left from some good movies.
