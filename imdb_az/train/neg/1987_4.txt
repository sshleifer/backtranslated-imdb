It was a wonderful idea and the decor was beautiful, but the place was over. He said he had met with the West. Deficiency did not make any sense. There were plenty of time and time to develop personalities. There were also unnecessary things that could not have happened and did not keep up the story. There were long spaces where the land was researched but used for silence or unnecessary conversations. In addition to the scenario management, it should be more logical. There was a big question in my head following this movie. But in my opinion, casting was great. If you only watch eye candy, this is a movie for you.
