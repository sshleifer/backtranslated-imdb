This movie was absolutly terrible. I do not think this is a good thing. Soil holes were so great that it would handle them through the Hummer. The player even said that Jean Claude was too stuningly worse and that many need to be ashamed! And dialogue, which dialogue? To think that I am an admirer of the first (I use it openly, I use it as a more sinful pleasure). This movie was Goldberg to cry aloud !!!! This movie can not be a good thing. No matter how bad it is to worsen this movie, you will not be able to watch a group of friends to have fun! It was supposed to be one of the five worst films of all time. 2/10 Because it is very difficult for me.
