This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen, everything is weak and incompatible. Acting is absurd, clothing is even wrinkled, and there is no story. This "poverty sequence" was intended to capture some of the sword and adventure successes of Beastmaster and Conan, but it does not give us any reason to follow. The nature of the lead is sincere and dull, and can not even fight a sword, and the sword is the 16th century. All activity segments, such as this, are slow and inaccurate, do not talk about the horribly dated music they play when their castle and horse ride. Do not even worry about this trouble.
