I totally agree with jamrom4 .. this is the most terrible movie I've ever seen .. sacred crap it was terrible .. warned me not to see .. I would be foolishly watching anyway .. about 10 minutes painful I know that our practice so far has been completely disrupted ... but I sat down till the end .. but when I see what I can do ... I did good things and now I did not want it ... it was disgusting ... nothing happened and the last is over all the preachy .. no movie right to live badly there are ... to beg yourself to keep the busy bus for fatty drivers .. just listen to the same warnings ... if you save yourself this movie .. those I have appreciated have taken part in the film and have to be erased from the whole planet.
