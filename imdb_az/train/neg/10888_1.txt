This movie is absolutely horrible. One of the worst films I've ever seen. The story is almost absent, the heroes are full of stereotypes and Special FX laughs only. <br /> <br /> If this movie was intended to be a comedy, I could not get this point. <br /> If you want to watch this movie: first drag yourself and then make some good laughs ... especially when it first appears on the Custom FX screen. <br /> <br /> But trash movies are cheap: this movie should be for you.
