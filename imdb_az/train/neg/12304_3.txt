I watched this movie for a while and spent the longest hours laughing. The plot of the film is mixed in a very generous and well-prepared way. Not only is Corey Savier effective in absentia anywhere in the film. Alexandra Paul (think of her name) is terrifying as the preacher's wife who has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is a tweet on the top and his character all over the top. As you think you have sex with your son forever, they throw at unnecessary solos at every opportunity! The end and castle of this film is absolutely terrible and laughable. Hell wants to take a girl who thinks her son is a child and who has a violent relationship with her.
