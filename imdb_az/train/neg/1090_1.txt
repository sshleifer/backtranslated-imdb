It was the most up-to-date movie I saw that there was no plot and it seemed the actors did not care. 90% of the film was completely empty, I laughed so much, my pain began. The elderly souls were ridiculous to seize Robert Duval. directing an unusual film on the directive level, does not cover a great deal of rainfall synthesis and meaningless proximity. this is a failed attempt to create a noise and laughs the audience with inaccurate scenes. this is based on 'manuscript' by john grisham, but this is not one of his books to adapt it, as it does not show any tension and attractive story, such as 'firm' or 'rainbow'.
