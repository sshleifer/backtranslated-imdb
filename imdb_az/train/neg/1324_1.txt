"The Second Coming of Suzanne" is one of those real catastrophic films that wants to come across in an extremely advanced way, but puts all of them into the sleeper's sleep. Like other types of movies, there is a limited dialogue. Everyone is more interested in the visual aesthetics of the shot. But cinematography is wrong, so there is nothing to keep your eye on. <br /> <br /> In the movie, this movie is said to be one of the most intriguing visual adventures you have ever seen in the film. Yes ... sure. It is there when you are watching incendiary events such as melting ice or a turtle for a mile. 1/10
