Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was small, and I was interested in her later. <br /> <br /> Small Mermaid is a classic animation feature with all the finest quality, great music, and aims at a general audience. On the contrary, Little Mermaid 2 is primarily targeted for small children because it shows itself, reflects the child's self-esteem, music is bouncier and less dramatic, and feels like the last indent. <br /> <br /> The Little Mermaid 2 begins when Ariel's family is presented to the baby's melody. Drama carries a giant pouch baby, sharply, without any apparent instruction to help. I was laughing, wait a minute, not funny, baby's attack! Okay, I'll stop laughing. <br /> <br /> In Perfection, Melody as I see as a lot of people imagines how many children are waiting for themselves. <br /> <br /> Like the first film, Melody has many other Ariel problems. In Melody, when it comes to Morgana, Melody's character has come to an end. Queen Ariel deprives the ocean of her father, and King Triton deprives Ariel of the surface. Ariel and Melody are rebelling against their parents. <br /> <br /> Music moves more emotionally in the first part. There are many songs from this post, but there is not much to do in the orchestra. <br /> <br /> <strong> It's great for the little ones because the orchestra will not be amazed at them. <br /> <br /> The ending of the first film was intense and invigorating. Later, everyone who plays bouncy song and water is ending. This is definitely more targeted to children, because if you do not want the end to be celebrated and quit, this ends you thinking: "It's time to vacate!" As a result, this movie is fun for children, so we have to enjoy them.
