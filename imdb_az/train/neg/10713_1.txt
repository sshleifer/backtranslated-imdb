Come on, let's be real. The Knights of Christ, the Ordo Temple, or the Knights Templar, were not existent until the beginning of the 12th century. The story is so miserable that it is miserable. Dolph Lundgren just looked positively. Moreover, if you wanted to become a real life Temp, why not use the Knights of Christ, which only exists in Portugal. At least they should consider their history. The only maturity that can be found in this film is that it seems to be enough to pass into the Middle Ages or the Gothic period. The player was bad, the story was excited, the move was horrible and the recordings were okay.
