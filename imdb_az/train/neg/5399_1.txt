CLAIMS Often Hollywood's Shakespeare adaptations have fun with movies. They are committed to a good way and text. Henri V's breed and "Things about Nothing" films since 1993 are a powerful work. That's why it's such a big disappointment for your expectation of being thrown in so ugly way by following the "Love Loss". Unfortunately, "No Love for Work" is horrible! The king of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) and his comrades left for three years to drink and to turn women into research. Plans begin to fall when the prince of the French camp (Alicia Silverstone) and his comrades come. Soon there is love in the air and philosophy is far from the mind of Prince. <br /> <br /> You know that this movie is not Shakespeare since the beginning.

Avoid this pest and never be. It is better than a poor, frustrating choice of branch and its future efforts.
