Caine, who re-constructed the perfect play of the 1972 scene of the stage game, made the first movie as a decent character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> The original setting is super-modern canceled. The subtle relationship between Oliver and Caine is replaced by a terrible, arrogant arrogance that instantly hates the audience, bringing the first film to a very prominent place. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> Sleuth is not really worth seeing, watching the original movie and the opening action is not glamorous.
