This film is just boring. <br /> <br /> In Am√©lie Poulain, a creative director like Jeunet tries to copy some of the effects of the owed, but much. Dialogs are very bad, Guillaume Canet, one of the worst of all I've ever heard, is not convincing (I'm not convinced of it), the father is playing very badly, the story is silent, ending. <br /> <br /> I think I did not like a movie very much, because "le pacte des loups" (Christophe Gans of Kurds Brotherhood) (and I'm watching about 80-100 films a year)), but at least there were some moves and very good actors in this movie. <br /> <br /> I have not commented on here (only rated), I'll write when I see ratings and comments <br /> <br /> We will not have to worry about not selling it to our proposed DVD: in our (large) bad movies do not exist! <br /> <br /> I was open-minded (I watched the SF, the West, the drama, the comedy, the silent, the horror, the fantasy ... movies), but it felt like I had lost an hour and a half.
