Is this a "bad" Star Trek TOS episode? Maybe at least it's like my voice. That is, this episode makes absolutely no freaking sense. Do you see something that leads to evidence? Give me some time. This episode also has a distinctive sense, the music rises and forces you to feel the burden of distress. Give some highlights such as some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romulans, Triskelion, or Medus - these are very boring strangers to make an episode around. McCoy reads the famous phrase, "He's Dead, Jim." Spock puts protective goggles on the move, but not Kirk. This is the third time I remember that a boring "barrier" passes. At least the next part of the season would be "The Specter of the Gun" and "The Dove of the Day" and others. Trek made a decent show to watch syndicate, which will choose enthusiastic fans like people like me. Private observations, Trek, wanted to use colored violet colors, for example, when they were in the corridor, without purple, purple purple. We have not seen any purple bridges, but have seen it interesting, in a few episodes I have seen a light filter and works very well, but in this episode it's pretty clever in the corridor of ships.
