If you value your mind, do not see this movie. At the end of our collective look, we thought that we and our comrades lost 5% of each of us in our brains. <br /> <br /> Most movies give a bad taste to your mouth. Now I realize that it has deep hatred within me. <br /> <br /> Some movies do not mean that this movie is taken seriously. Only he did not take seriously. But it does. The area is warmed over the Blade Runner-esque universe melded with cheap rubber suits spread over bad dinosaur movies. Dialogue is not only brave and meaningless, it is often not painful. Whoopee Goldberg even works, but like George Newbern's Theodore Rex's voice as the soul's nails. <br /> <br /> According to some statements, Culietta Landua again links the British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) to a team. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see the depth of human foolishness.
