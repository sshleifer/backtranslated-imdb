I went to see this movie yesterday and did not have great hopes for this movie, though I was still disappointed! Actually, I do not believe that I've taken 96 minutes of my life watching this movie ... it was bad! This story was treacherous and the player was terrifying (although great names like Uma Thurman). This film was based on very specific effects ... but it did not affect me personally. I have not been trained honestly and I warn everyone against seeing this movie. This is the total loss of money and you will only be disappointed later. My advice is to save your money, make a shopping, treat yourself, go alone and see this movie ... You will regret this lol!
