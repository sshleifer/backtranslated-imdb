What's in this movie? Too many. Editing works tremendously to look good and does nothing but mixing the viewer while maintaining it with a strong headache. The area is twisted and started for a short time (story or film). The site is only about ten minutes short of a good story, and it stretches painfully until it reaches the minimum length for an art movie. We all know what happens when we extend them. Indeed. They are exquisite. Finally, even if you are not watching this movie, you will not even pay attention to watching the movie. Acting is a little impressive. These characters are badly written and entertaining and uninteresting. One of the worst things to do with this movie is that someone who owns the account / soundtrack did not know what the movie was or what it was about (I do not blame or understand it). As a result, the music in the movie does not fit into the scenes. Also, what was all sexual intercourse between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Of course, it was the involvement of young men, but it was so cheap. And was the first scene involved with the rest of the film? At the desired level? All right? They did not seem to have anything to do with the two creepy children, but they were here to have some sad scenes. I really doubt that a movie that really looks like a film and a bit of an interesting one is like a shameless and horrible Hollywood actor. But I respect. When I do it is a bit of a gender and it's true (although I've seen that Killer Cut is true) is a really bad emotional tension - it's not the focus of the young people in mind. 1/10
