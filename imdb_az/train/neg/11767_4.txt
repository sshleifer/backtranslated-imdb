As I loved Tim Roth, I was so hopeful. I was not happy about this movie. I liked Ang Lee The Hulk a few years ago, so I thought it would be a bit more bang. First of all, I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. His eyebrows seem to have re-formed for this. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as expected. Tim Roth is always cool as it is here. Gamma was not loyal to the original story, which actually did not really matter. The best part of the film has come to an end. It was some cool work. The only problem with the original was too long. It's not so long, sometimes there is a bit boring. Some time ago Walmart remembered when this movie was really cheap for sale, and why did I always wonder why? Now I know. I hope to blast, but not.
