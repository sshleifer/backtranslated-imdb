I remember this action a few years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival, I remember. Welcome to me, showed great potential. The majority of people here are exploding this movie, as the film looks like each other (the film's official site is a short "rough"). <br /> <br /> However, it was an easy comedy. In my opinion, many people try to read a lot of comedy. All of them will be laughable - all this. When I showed it I did it, so it went to this level. Anyway, my 2 cents.
