<strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "<br /> I'm angry with Hell because I want to get my money back, so you walk Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) classically and then you'll get the same thing you're expecting and any garbage that's going on in the middle. "All the same, when HBK tapped, it was ruining me! HBK's losing that moment to John Cena !!!!!!!!!! John Cena Lost / Inactive Even though Triple H's Wrestlemania 22 was almost destroyed for me! After seeing Wrestlemania 23, I could not watch WWE, and I looked again (fortunately) I'm from Wrestlemania 24 (the biggest I've ever seen) I believe in WWE, a classic Wrestlemania, a pure classic. <br /> <br /> For Mania 23, of course, it has been prepared and made us memorable moments. <br /> <br /> If you are watching any of the Wrestlemanias in advance (like Wrestlemania 20 inside a fan), I did not make the same mistake and left WWE behind. And if you watch it and become angry, start watching again and watch Wrestlemania 24, which is completely classic.
