If I had not read Pat Barker's "Birlik Street" before seeing this movie, I love it. Unfortunately this is not the case. <br /> <br /> This is really my movie, well-prepared and I do not want to say anything in any other way, but in terms of compatibility, in every respect. <br /> <br /> The North England caught my heart of working class and refused to pass a few weeks after graduating. When I read Union Street women, I was touched by my tears, obedience, shock, anger, sympathy, and anger. Excellent. Sometimes it was a novel I thought I did not read, but my novel was simply not written. <br /> <br /> I do not know, but I'm totally grasping. My dear. Hollywood took the truth and the reality of Barker and showered a layer of sugar in the upper part of the shower. A beautiful movie, an inspiring soundtrack, excellent performances, hope and romantic tale ... yes. <br /> <br /> Women of Birlik street and their stories have become Fonda's character, their stories are touched, but many are thrown away. Some of Barker's tales admit that there are sensitive issues and are terribly terrifying for a massive look, and a movie with about seven leading characters is not just practical but the content is not my main concern. <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br/> If you love the movie for 'reality' and its positivity, I'm not going to write anything like 'Schindler's List' I advise you to read ... but before the happy ending.
