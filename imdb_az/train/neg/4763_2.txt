The main reason for this review is the "refreshing" of a great game of 1972 and the film "decent 1972", a "terrifying" film experience. <br /> <br /> If I save someone from watching it, I'll do a good job. <br /> <br /> This new version is loaded with talent and it's all wrong. Kenneth Branagh OK, an ugly, sterile, set of notes. We can shoot the film from every corner, it is possible from a self-centered point of view. Stainless steel reflects actors, security monitors, over 200 feet of their heads, eyes, jaws and ten and most of them. The scenario by the Nobel Prize laureate stretches long on the unpleasant homosexual joke falsified by both sides .... I think? How do I know the "twist" character? The artists themselves are originally richly laid, naked and non-sympathetic. The operating hours have been cut for an hour, or the director's problem is the real problem or the best thing. Actors perform their lines efficiently, but what they say or do is far-reaching. <br /> <br /> <strong> Jewish law is superior to Caine, but as a lender of credit, it should have been a blessing. <br /> <br /> All this is an old classic. Why so? The paid community has spent $ 4 million worldwide to see it! Every piece is a failing piece of work.
