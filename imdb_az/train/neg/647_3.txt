The player was also scary with scenario. He was in a weak spot and wanted to laugh at the scenes he had been murdered in a strange way. The end has worsened. Everyone was dying, but somehow the last thing seemed to be completely good! The teacher did not have enough history about the teacher's obsession, and so on. The film needed more time to develop a better storyline. One reason I gave this 3/10 is bad for young actors. Better training was needed. They could actually do this OK movie, but the script and player failed.
