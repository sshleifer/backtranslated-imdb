<br /> <br /> Thanks to this movie I can now answer the question. <br /> <br /> What is the worst movie you ever saw? bad movies. <br /> <br /> This film is absolutely nothing. Name an element of any fears movie and this movie will fail. Honestly, I've seen better on YouTube. <br /> <br /> "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, are you?" "Steve, I'm not kidding" "Steve, it's funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?" <br /> <br /> "Arggh !!!! Ahhhhhh !!!! Nooooooo!"
