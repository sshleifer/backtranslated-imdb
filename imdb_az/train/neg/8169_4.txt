The film begins with a few couples, one man and one woman, walking alone in the great wilderness. Surely, it is very intense that a person has heard something and goes to investigate it. Our murder greets him with a sting knife. She followed her daughter and cut her throat. In the opening scene, the camera looks like a camera killer. <br /> <br /> We meet in the next four main characters, two pairs, in one of the rocks. Women joke about the fact that women will never be able to deal with a single camp on a double-day basis, causing their desire for symptoms early in the week for a week. In an unexpected way, men leave the same day and their cars are broken. They come to an end. When it comes to men, it is warned about the people who have lost in the woods by a foolish Ralph doppleganger. The dark night and eighty songs play in the background in the darkness of the night. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we understand that this is not a clone, but a dream story! Frightened and single women are sitting with fire. Two children in shades appear and look at Tom. Of course, the ghosts, by echoing the voices really! The mothers are seen with dripping blood from a pit on their forehead and if they see their children before they lose, they will ask two ladies. <br /> <br /> Children flee from the pope to the house and talk to two beautiful ladies about tea. It causes a great deal of confusion, and it climbs up the blade of the fireplace. "Daddy hunts," the little girl is talking about bad things. <br /> <br /> It is said that my dad is not a dream. <br /> <br /> Something in the woods, yellow-colored pieces of sheets, run straight away by shouting at night. He will face the father who is describing the pain and will be quick. What we heard earlier (this is allergy, Panthers are even in the state of California) understand it as if it had been wounded before the head was stabbed. A thunderstorm is broken, and men seek shelter in the pope's residence. Undoubtedly, somebody lives together, because there is a fire and something strange. The pupils, who suddenly show the children in a moment, appear and warn them. <br /> <br /> For any reason, our murder goes only after women. He invites men to eat something and explains his story about his ex-spouse. The reason why the spouse is being deceived. The old man does not talk about killing himself and his lover, but about the daytime. Our children are not killed. People fall asleep and are not leaked. The following morning, men find their wives empty. They were split after a short argument. Someone is staying in the camp, the other goes and helps. The one who comes back to his car breaks his foot. We explained to the woman who did not apologize, as if they were facing mothers with dreams that killed them. <br /> <br /> The Prophet (peace be upon him) knew that she was either a blonde or a married man, and in any case she knew that she had killed her and talked about this woman. - Anyway, the guys stop him by threatening to leave forever. <br /> <br /> Generally, the film is worth four stars, and it's generous, and the music is good for all his sacrifices. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Alan says she has a camera angle and some sets are working well and the field is incredible - there's something like dissatisfiedness, but I can not imagine a frog with a 6-kilometer frog, Skip "Bannacheck
