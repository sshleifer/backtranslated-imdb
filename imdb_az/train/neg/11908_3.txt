The Reel turns an interesting left to the Indies. B & W is a 75-minute film from Minnesota, which has two TIMES, non-actors, and connects nearly two people's alien lives. When choosing this movie, I welcome the appeal of the Real 13 programmers. I wish I could have chosen a more powerful film to be thicker. In fact, I'm surprised that the film has more to do with the uniqueness of the film compared to its quality (TWO LANDS are not completely dishonest, but a little later). <br /> <br /> As with the independent films, TWO HARBOR is limited to the place. Are there only two real places? The middle-aged main character, played by Alex Cole, is Vicin's home. Writer / director James Vculek uses the market to expose Vic, one of the market makers. Different people are walking up to Vicar and very long conversations, giving only two pieces of information? Vic sells space toys (he says "space action figures") and he is a caustic shit. This is the emblem of one of the two main problems with TWO HARBORS - all talk. I said before and will repeat it again? we are dealing with a visual media and filmmakers should try to explain their story visually. Of course, there are exceptions, but in general, the infinite task does not involve the film? especially as dialogue is used as an exposition. All the conversations in the movie are lengthy and unnecessary. A prominent example will be a few scenes with Vicki who want to play a role as a Boy Scout leader in a shop. He claims back and forth with the writer, and these scenes do not even go directly to the area. <BR> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> As the movie comes out a bit I can be a critic, but I do not feel like a good excuse for not having good actors in your films. There are many good actors, many of whom are willing to work on low-budget projects? even Minnesota. Many filmmakers have missed the importance of acting as second-class visuals, but this is naive. In the movie, besides the story, in a feature film, nothing is more important than actors / speeches. <br /> <br /> I thought Vculek was using non-actors, but as the film continued, I was probably a theater-type actor. The camera was not disturbed. It was pretty theater (ie big). What if two of the actors were the two leaders? Cole and Catherie E. Johnson, Cassie, is a single young girl captured in Vic's extreme hunt. They seemed to have the most teachings, but they were still somewhat rough around the edges. The eccentrics they showed were just on the surface - they did not come from a real, organic place. Especially Mrs. Johnson is an interesting situation. Does he have an absolute presence? it's about the Midwestern charm, but this charisma denies the many issues that need to be his character. <br /> <br /> He struggles to stem from the lure of loneliness and (slavery) labor, based on actions like stockings, lips, lips, and grief to reveal his anxieties with the outside world. <br /> <br /> I mentioned in the first paragraph that TWO HARBOR is absolutely useless and I do not want to say. Without much distance, there is a fade in the movie up to an hour in white. After that, the story is a stunning turn that allows you to be evocative and obviously strong in the last fifteen minutes? It's like a piggy punch for the intestine, but in a good way. It's a great relief to feel something long after this symbol. In the last five minutes of the film, there is no dialogue and the result is the best part of the film. delicate, detailed (Cole is doing the best of the film) and, most importantly, kinematic. Then the final loans are all surprisingly reversed? based on a true story that has forced me to think. With all the dialogue, minimal places and lack of kinematic qualities, with two kick ass players for me and again with a burst of compression, TWO HARBOR can really make a kick-ass scene play? Perhaps even an action. If this is a charming theater producer that reads this chart, I strongly recommend seeing whether it can hold the film and Reel 13 who is filming. <br /> <br /> For more information about this or any other Reel 13 movie, visit www.reel13.org)
