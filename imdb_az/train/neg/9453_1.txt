Holy cow, what's a part of this movie. I did not know how these filmmakers took 250 word books and converted them into movies. I did not even know! <br /> <br /> Because it has always taken children's classics and added a few farting, belching and sex inuindo and turned it into a Kaka joke. This should give a good idea as Hollywood manufacturers think. I must say that it was visually interesting, but the brilliant visual story was destroyed by the humor of the toilet (even if you think it's funny) I do not want children I know to think about. <Br> Do not see your children, do not rent the DVD. I hope Dr. Suess's ghost comes in and insults the people who shoot this movie.
