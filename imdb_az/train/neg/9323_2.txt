What did I watch? I spent 90 minutes of precious life watching one of the most horrible movies I ever saw. The concept of a serial killer clown is actually quite awe-inspiring, so there are many people who fear the clowns .... but the killer who is unseen in the 300-pound nursery is a mockery of the genre of the clown. I'm still wondering if Mark can escape from the mud ... He must be tired at the end of 300 pounds. The whole thing lifted me and said, 'What have I just watched?' As it seems, Brandon is Denise's brother ... and his cousin is in the middle of the movie about having sex with her son ..... Yes, people want to see something like this * shivers *. Stabbed a woman with a smile and said, "What did you do?" It was a stage scene. Yes, what did he do? The last thing that was funny was that the last character of the main character slipped and called for pain, and then 5 minutes later violence did not help anything. The writer of the script is the wrong man? <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; <br /> <br /> <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG>
