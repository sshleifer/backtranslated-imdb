Hubert Selby Jr. gave us a "Requiem for a Dream" book and wrote his script for Aronofsky's film. This film succeeds at every level, delivering a sincere and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters and the evil things that destroy them. <br /> <br /> "The Last Spell in Brooklyn" still has many helpers and sad characters, but could not complicate the same justice as Aronofsky. <br /> <br /> The film seems funny, sometimes funny. Especially homosexuality in the film is equal to death. A gay character is flooded, an accelerating car opens up to the sky and dead on the sidewalk. Someone is crucified and still beating more. An exaggerated shocking price can be attractive if it really is good, with scenarios of striking cuts, as if it were the workers of the union. <br /> <br /> Director Ulli Edel has a level of skill as a television director, but he's under a cut for real. movies. The film is not something that can not be solved in a genre. The lake is given a useless role that can be filled with any manna, and Baldwin knows how foolish it is with just the opposite. And then our management, Jennifer Jason Leigh comes to a horrific brothel named Tralala (I believe or not, I'm not kidding). His performance is not a big deal, and the fate of his character is so small. The poor use of color and composition makes it less affordable and takes even more dangerous bits to the "real" edge. A failure.
