Kurosawa really bowed about it. Any genius is allowed for a failure. The concept is good, but execution is very bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fantasy fantasy, which is also an art movie. Poverty in Tokyo deserves a fairer and more realistic description. Many of them have interesting stories. A very thrilling film.
