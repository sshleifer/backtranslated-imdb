I did not think it was possible, but I found the film worse than Body Melt. This movie is really bad! And worse yet, it's another Australian movie ... <br /> As you can see from the VHS, the rock movie of the 80s continues to deteriorate and continue to deteriorate, with noise, simply hard to believe <br /> <br /> And why their attitudes continue to change? Bad New York shooting, prissy English, then pure Aussie! <br /> <br /> This film also claims that he won several film festivals in the film (this is the Utah Film Festival). <br /> <br /> This is a lie, because nobody in the right mind will give that suggestion (probably the Golden Painting, but I think it's too bad). <br /> <br /> Come to life! This movie should be number 100 below! <br /> <br /> There is one reason why this garbage does not have movies confirming good filmmakers ..... 0/10
