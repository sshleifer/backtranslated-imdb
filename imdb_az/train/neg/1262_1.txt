This movie has a weak background, weak character, and has really poor effects and I'm watching it and asking why I lost my precious life. There are occasional characters in the movie that do not add anything to the story and appear in the film's excuses to get a girlfriend in the movie. Robots are upset and the main "hero" boot opens with a big knife crossing. If this movie were not too bad, it would be funny, but there's nothing funny about it. The main antagonist is one of the only escaping characters and is killed. It is sad when you take the bad man's root, because he is the best to surprise. When all was said and done, this movie was better or never financed on the cutting room floor.
