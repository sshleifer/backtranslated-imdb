Although I should not be the biggest Blair Witch fan, I have appreciated these efforts, and, therefore, after reading the advantages around which I expect change, especially in various IMDb comments. <br /> <br /> "Unique", "smart", "future cult classic" and so on ... you need a place where people come with these products to make such a poor effort. <br /> A weak, weak film will not be able to come in any way and in any way. The crowd is not funny. Horror and fear are not scary. <br /> <br /> One of the modest aspects of this film is that some of the poor in this film have been severely insulted, because of this confusion, of course, nothing is profound or unreasonable. <br /> Okay, so he does not know anything. Is it at least decisive? Is the experience worthwhile in any way? Unfortunately, no. Too bad for beginners. Most B-films are not an extension to say that they are doing better today. Plot? Bump and confusion. Dialogs? <br /> <br /> This is really the direction of the puzzles. I did not expect great improvements on the Blair Witch, but at least in small steps. Instead, our director is getting worse over time, but not forgetting our past experiences. <br /> <br /> If there is a major flaw in the Altered, this is the main set. A large part of the site was somewhere in which the main characters were restricted, but Sanchez succeeded in not giving up any personality. If you think that Blair is a large part of the forest, and you have more than one character (an antagonist), you would think that the director would think the same thing. <br /> <br /> "This place has no identity, yet it is rapidly directed and the details are not paid attention. <br /> <br /> There's nothing that can be saved here." Blair Witch's favorite supporter, Daniel Myrickin is better than his predecessor, even though he is far from gold, showing a better structure than Sanchez, and some lessons from Blair Wadi's (unfortunately still in weaker stories).
