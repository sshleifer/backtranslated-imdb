"Heroic Masters" proved to be a poor area for "message episodes" and when a situation arose for Joe Dante's "Screwfly Solution" (one of the series's best episodes), anvil was heavy and unimpressive (nothing soap box is more likely to be frightened. And 'Pro-Life' simply protects the sources of extremely severe reactions; the young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), fleeing forests, was shot by two doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who were driving a local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a stone-cold, right-left sacred role that will do everything to protect his daughter from abortion. If nothing else, 'Pro-Life' has drawn a path to its controversial issue, but John Carpenter admits the whole thing astonishingly indifferent - as if he were less interested in the movie itself (this is, of course, poor); slow pacing does not create any tension and just leads to a creep dump. Even if Dwayne and his sons attacked the clinic, guns were a burning, confused event; Later, after a doctor has been tortured by a "male abortion," the scene is groundless and unnecessary - an attempt to shoot the film. Poor speeches (Perlman here is regrettable here) turn into the development of the scenario, and the Carpenter administration has been exhausted as the source of the next hot meal of Pro-Life. When you are driving a spider-colored corridor with a boy in a man's head and a latex wolf suit, you have to be surprised that they are thinking of their thoughts behind this confusion.
