It's not uncommon to see foreign films falling flat in the United States, but here's a flip side! <br /> <br /> The horrible reconstruction of the US film "Wide Awake" by the British! <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is strange, entertaining and funny! On the other hand, "Liam" is just strange. I'm going to give you a loan for Liam for something, and it's clear that I made the right choice to make a change in my religion!
