Scotty (Grant Cramer, "From Space to Killer Clowns" in the Big B-movie) helps three middle-aged kids star to learn how to do a "dialogue" in this evil 80's comedy. It's not as bad as in the 80's lingo. Bad as bad. A girl who heads the men after her 13th part 2 and then wants to touch her is a girl who is not fit for her when she wants to touch her, but not because of the fatty depression, because after all, the '80s sexual comedy Can a fat free swelling? Well, these are two people. This movie is below the barrel of more than 80 comedy comedies. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> D <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> I think "Bachlor Party", but not funny, is very worried. <br /> I saw it: Comcast Moviepass
