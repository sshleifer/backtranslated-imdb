Take My Take: A tired formula for Christmas comedy. <br /> <br /> I love the holidays as the next guy (despite the bad state of the holiday blues), but it seems that for a whole set of Holiday comedies that there will be bad movies for just one year damping, but this season is less painful to them. Like a wealthy SANTA CLAUSE movie (three and * gulp * is still counted), wants to see a movie about his brother? In a plot proving that Disney will be at home with the SANTA CLAUSE franchise, Fred CLAUS is a lucky lane of 116 minutes (sometimes with humor and Santa's "Little" Helper with a short skirt). Of course, Jolly Ol 'Saint Nick has a brother, but where does he go from there? <br /> <br /> It's really shameful. FRED CLAUS is probably blessed with a cast that can be a magnificent Christmastime comedy that will melt with snow, but it would be better. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but he is actually a long-time brother, Santa (Paul Giamatti), who never invites his brother to visit. Mrs. Claus (Miranda Richardson) was reluctant and a worse productivity expert (Kevin Spacey) came to pay attention to the Christmas Eve and approached her to close it. Hah! And who's playing Santa's mother! Of course, Kathy Bates. Elizabeth Banks Santana's Assistant Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves and Rachel Wiesz plays Fred's girlfriend! I do not know if I want to praise or bash. <br /> <br /> According to celebrities, the best of Fred CLAUS is Santa's brother. its just opposite and some jokes about a DJ elf. I have to admit that there were several giggles in which Fred joined the famous brothers (where he joined Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but the giggles begin and end there. Even worse yet, the movie succumbs into the sentimentality that teaches us a lesson about "good feelings" and "what really means Christmas." As it turns out, Christmas for Hollywood means that most of our remaining Christmas shopping money can get. <br /> 5.
