The "Black Angel" is a minor charge of June, with Vincent, a woman trying to save her husband from the power department after she was found guilty of killing an elderly brother. Dan Duryea (husband of the murdered woman) helps Vincent find real criminals. Peter Lorre has an unpleasant role as a suspect. This movie plays and plays noir, a cheap programmer, and does not do anything special. It is pleasant enough, but then at some point, it is of importance, and the solution to the mystery leads to this great "give me a break" reactions. The only ending film could have been sinking, but when it comes to the conclusion, it's not too good. Vincent was a good heroine and Duryea was no good at playing good guys. I love the love of movies, but it was a real disappointment.
