There is no clue about it being hit on it, but you can say that it does not have a budget. Bad fun, terrible cinematography, naked area and some special effects are not a good movie. WWF style cinematography will make you cry ... almost tripod! The filmmakers performed at a high level, but their attempts were abruptly missed.
