The Pallbearer is very disappointing, with a frustration and a love story that sometimes does not work partially with just Gwyneth Paltrow (Julie) casting. Gwyneth Paltrow, with a mixed appearance on his entire film, said David Schwimmer had difficulty seeing him. But Pallbearer is sometimes funny, especially in the church scene and group scenes but it's actually a laugh with your friends. Just look at the Pallbearer for those scenes and pull the rest fast. Do not trust me too much.
