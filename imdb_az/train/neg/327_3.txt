Even if you're a big fan of Sandler, do not worry about this very freaking comedy! I bought this movie for $ 7.99 because I bought Sandler because I was my man and that at least half had to be honored and that some women would accept the nudity (R-rated and pen-lined women's cover). Yes, there are very few women, but no one is naked. I'm not sure what this is in Sandler's career, but I think it's like before SNL days. I can be wrong. Watching one of these home movies. He can look at this kind of movie and remembers good times ... but we (the audience) have dried up. This is a difficult "movie"! Sandler is talking to the camera and even acknowledges that this is a "non-budget" movie (not a usual, low-budget, NO-budget movie). So, our job is to laugh in very strange characters. There is no permanent structure, not a remote sketch comedy show - one bad and badly written one. The man who played the hateful comedians was completely heartfelt and incredible that he would first of all take such a mass audience. And Sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying a "classic" Henny Youngman line "Take my wife" and have the audience floor? I will not even logic here. Undoubtedly, Sandler's current and latest films are not known for the comedy, but many feelings (not the penguin in the "Happy Place" of "Happy Gilmore" in Billy Madison). It's a sensitive job, and you will not be interested if you are wondering about Adam's early days in the film. SNL's start-ups or perhaps "Mixed Nuts," Sandman, of course, is the only actor left in this ungrateful car, Billy Bob Thornton also gives a brief look, a supporting role of Billy Zane ("Titanic") and a great Burt Young (From Rocky). <br /> <br /> This horrible comedy will probably collect dust on your 99% rental listing on your local video store. <br /> <br /> My account: 3 (10 from)
