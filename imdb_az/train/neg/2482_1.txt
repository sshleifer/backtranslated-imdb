(Spoilers abundant) This is a totally horrible movie. First and foremost, he's a middle-aged man. In my opinion, he made a career in playing super doting dads. He tried to scare his son for the first time, acting like a monster ... but ten minutes later, they again confused it! And that's why this film is moving in the nervous real-life. At one point, I started to look a few days later, just as I remembered the story line just the next day ... still in the afternoon! I'm not really sure who these couples will be in real life. At first they are presented as a Manhattan yuppie pair, which is growing up and has a child. However, they manage an old Volvo. This species stopped the Volvos speed decades ago. Today they drive Priuses. But in 2002, I'm still convinced that they did not manage Volvos. <br /> OK, then there's Wendigo. A "mysterious Indian man" gives the boy a statue of a magical Wendigo and tells him his powerful magic. C'mon ... still making ancient Indian secrets. Just to control their house, each of them sculptures are taken up to New York City in their tourist traps. The American Indians are depicted in this movie for decades invisible! Oh, and about Wendigo. In fact, it is not the cause of horror. It does not kill the child's father, who is the most terrible thing in the film ... He is angrily killed with a rage and a high-powered rifle. Wendigo just comes out late to take revenge on the man who killed his father ... oh, but wait, as Wendigo is a skin hero, as it was seen before, maybe a deer killed ... then Wendigo <br /> <br /> Therefore, , that could have been happy with the death of your father ... <br /> <br /> And therefore ... it's offensive, boring and unusual. There is no reason to watch this movie full.
