Wow, this was a very bad movie ... As it has been mentioned in another movie, there is not a feature of this movie, there is no feature development, there are some possible scripts, but it is difficult to say the real final result. <br /> </ span> </ span> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> The editing of this film is really inaccurate, and it tends to throw off the field without any connection or anything to assist the audience in identifying what really happened. <br /> <br /> All that's all <br /> <br /> The only thing that this movie holds from 1 or 2 is that nothing is thought of, thoughtless, bad, <br /> <br <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> <strong> this. Period.
