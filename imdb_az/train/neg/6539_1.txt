That would be if it was 0. From horrible woodworking, dull, to sliding speed, childhood talking angle and simply watching sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation, this is a disaster movie. <br /> <br /> As you know, all the characters are sure to happen and how the plot will begin. From the beginning to the desperate and pitiful end, every single participant in this film is wasted, and all kinds of unusual talent are broken to win this turkey. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch something, look at one of the Ilsa movies in a very miserable way with the same childhood circulation. At least they are unapologetic and up-front about what they are trying to do. <br /> <br /> This terrifying thing, which is over 5 years of age, is that people who do not have tasty or sensitive standards can sometimes come together for the most sophisticated purposes. <br /> <br /> It is not frightening, it is interesting, and above all, it does not wake up in any part of the word. This is a crime in my opinion; <br /> <br /> Elvira's cheerful identity and jokes have even softened the coup with the horrible transgression of the film. . Avoid all kinds of pricing.
