I've been almost forever against singing songs in a movie. I believe that the quality of the movie will only be upgraded automatically if it performs only extremely boring songs. However, this terrible Black (no song) and things have changed quickly after watching this movie (many songs). Despite the extreme weakness of the black, it offers some powerful, functional and captivating story. Songs were almost unusual and mixed with the movie. <br /> <br /> Last night, when there was a horrific shooting in the streets, there was no woman who was rushing with mysterious water without any reason. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the bold and unabashed approach used by the director. <br /> <br /> I will recommend these films to Indian-speaking people who have the slightest insight into Mumbai's life. Old English subtitles remained parallel and occasionally caused many errors that completely reflect the meaning of the actual expression. <br /> <br /> I think this is definitely a job worthy of international regulation. The scenes with the gossiping drivers were a pleasant touch, and at the same time, it served as a source of humor and was a different perspective service to all rumors. <br /> <br /> I also thought there were some negligent scenes, but the most unexplained things depicted by the film's overall position. very well done. It was an entertaining touch to watch, but on the contrary, it touched the sense of any sadness and the whole scene was a little foolish. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about some films that the film's rarities are rare. <br /> <br /> In general, this is a ridiculous, pessimistic look and refreshing thing! Actors are not 'heroes', but basics. Believers are an opportunity to see people in an unusual situation - in everyday life. <br /> <br /> <strong>
