This is a movie I have ever tried to write to a criticism on any website and this is an important comment by someone who loves the Monolithic Monsters Attack. This movie is perfect for anyone who wants a non-Muslim film. For example, it is deprived of gender and violence. I believe that this movie is safe for children of all ages. This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to entertain, challeng or stimulate in any way. While watching this movie, adults can easily fall asleep on television. But do not be surprised if they quit television after leaving for the kids and start a board game. Like all those who love everything from the sea to realism, drama, comedy and everything that's fantastic in the movement, this film, which has everything, has nothing to do with all those adults who reflect on real life and / or imagine on earth. offer.
