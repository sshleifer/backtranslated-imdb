The first two films were very disappointing, the prequel was transformed into either of the second or the second. Concentrating on the cube-taking guys, it's mostly tense within the cube because we simply do not care about the characters inside. Most of the film is simply boring and really horrible with the use of glass-eyed and green-eyed bare sea. After that, though, only the top becomes unwelcome surprise. The latter, though, directly links it directly. Scenario is terrible, best-working mediocre and direction is unimpressive. Very few followers.
