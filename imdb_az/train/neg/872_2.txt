Above all, I was expecting Caged Heat to be on the same line as Ilsa, Ancient Watcher. My son, I made a mistake! The film does not exploit any of the 70s, "chain chains" or "women in prison." <br /> <br /> There is a bunch of prisoners in prisons. They wear street clothes (pretty funny). <br /> <br /> No strong competition, no one is trying to humiliate or control others. do not pass any convictions to try and escape from a physician. There are 2 shower scenes that I suspect that there are recycled images, but if there is no battle / no one here - or for any matter! <br /> <br /> What can prisoners do to free their convicts from prison, helping them to return to prison, apart from non-sincere, non-sympathetic and straightforward symbols? <br /> <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE has come to an end with the sunset running ... it is against the continuation of the confusion! <br /> <br /> I feel cunning.
