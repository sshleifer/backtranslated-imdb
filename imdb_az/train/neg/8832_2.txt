I had a really hard time doing this with this action. <br /> <br /> This movie appeared to be slow, and I wondered when it was over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> They tried to make a lot of this movie. At one point, it turned me into politics, with no great admirer of the film. If you're looking for a slow-moving film that has no area, it's the right movie for you. As for me, I felt that I spent 2 hours when I did something else.
