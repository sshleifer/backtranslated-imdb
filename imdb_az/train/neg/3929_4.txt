All of this is more than just questioning the claims of all fans who think that Watchowski should submit a story back to the Matrix, and that the films will be recorded at a much deeper level. Although the second renaissance is visually impressive and beautiful, the story writer is cliched & ridiculous. How many times have we heard the story of a man who is extremely enthusiastic about technology and who relies on technology to destroy people? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Given the scheme of the second renaissance, the machines do not make good children? Machines are oppressive to generations by brutal human overmasters. They fight, gain their freedom, and try to live in harmony with peace with the people who dismiss them for all the war that will make them smart. If this is a back story, then we should not be tuned for Neo, and we need to be rooted in machines! People were cruel and oppressive, and the machine was courageous and compassionate. I have to believe that the second Renaissance is an incorrect attempt to create a backyard story since Watchowski did not believe that people were going to make the cars a blessing.
