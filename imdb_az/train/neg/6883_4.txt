Since I was a Puertorican origin, it was a mixed stuff about the "documentary". First, Mrs. Perez compared the Senor Campo with Che Guevarra. And just a point, sir. John Leguzaimo not from Puertorik but his parents came from Colombia. Anyone doing research on this subject was not very right. I think that our future is based on education. This film should be sounded throughout this film, Education is our freedom and power, and I think that any future work of this production group should be in the spotlight. In my opinion, this film focuses on the anti-American encounter.
