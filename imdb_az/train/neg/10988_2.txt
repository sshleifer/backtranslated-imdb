If I never read my book, I would say that it was a good movie. BUT I read the book. The story of anyone who has never written on the screen has been destroyed. There are many changes that are not worth the truth. Character changes, consistent changes, time line changes ... <br /> <br /> Who is Henry and the investigator first? They were not in the story. Although Henry Mitch's identity was a little bit, Mitch was not a police officer. No, it was Roz, "sank into his body" and used it as blackmail to Roz against Zenia. Roz, who slept with his son and left him away, called the blackmail a real one. Her son also blackmailed him, because his mother was Gay. It did not really say in his son's story. <br /> <br /> Tony and the West have not been together before. She was with Zenia at the college for the first time. Black painted apartment was their idea, Tony just went to visit. Meet Zenia and Tony, become fast friends. Tony hides his love for the West. Then Zenia from the West, Tony's money, then the West and Tony met. Finally, getting married, after a while, the West leaves Tony Zenia for a short time. Only the heart will be broken again. Then go back to Tony. Zenia's blackmail for Tony wrote a test record for Tony Zenia. Now, being a professor at the college, I did not want to leave her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong > The character of Charis was a blonde. When Augusta was alive, Zenia did not deceive her about being cancerous. There was no Charis when she was her boyfriend Billy. Augusta's father was a dodger in the Vietnam War. Finally, Charis Zenia maintains how to keep medication for months. Zenia and Billy have a brotherhood under Charis's nose, both of them care for them. Then Zenia returns to Billy and leaves the ship with her. Not with Augusta, Charis was pregnant with her tho. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR STRONG> and a fountain land. He had a pure purifying heroine in his blood, and he probably did not know that he could not get some and fell asleep in the OD. <br /> <br /> This is cancerous. <br /> <br /> It does not show anything that loves childhood memories and readers' characters. The book was sent off to the lantern bones. Then it's done again in someone else's vision. Why did not you write your own line on the film? It was quite different, and I'm sure more could be done.
