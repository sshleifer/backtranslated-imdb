You just read the novel of Stephen King, the creepy cities, hotels, houses, states (ala eagles "Hotel California") and so on. If you want something like "disappearance", start by reading "The Despair" of the King, and also review The Shining, Salem's Lot, and "Required Things." <br /> <br /> The black motif, the desert, the family leading to desperation to flee or escape. Why did not they just release the film from "Ceyrakk"? Maybe they approached the King and confused? <br /> <br /> Susan Dey and Harry Hamlin are happy to get together, and both have been dressed well over the years, but they are still actors, unlike television and DVDs.
