As you know, sometimes you can watch a malevolent movie with your friends and laugh at all the drawbacks of the movie? That is beyond that. I bought a DVD at Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I laughed at this movie. There is nothing really sad. When I stayed for about 30 minutes, my friends wanted to extinguish me. They begged me for about 45 minutes. An hour later, we were threatened with rapid progress until the end. So we could see how the conflict was resolved (and we were watching for Matt Walsh all the time). Seriously, do not watch this movie. It's not painful.
