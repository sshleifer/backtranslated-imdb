Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was adopted in clear distinct ways: Some were thrilled, some were shocked, some boldly applauded. <br /> <br /> What was this film actually? <br /> <br /> What is this movie really? </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;" "Sex is growing in one woman?" I saw big films on this subject, but not one of them, at least as an animal, not just an imagination but a girl How can she imagine growing sex? There is no character research in the absence of any symbols. * The oppressor is not a female adolescent, but a girl with a black bull (also characterized as a beast) has grown up to sexuality, so where is coherence? <br /> <br /> Yes, we'll need less material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire for two young boys. <br /> <br /> The metaphorical feelings of the movie, for example, require realistic characterization in the real examination, to check for any realization of animals There is no real vitality here, some mythical animals and two priests talk about the sin of loyalty to each other. Is it enough for a college construction on the subject? <br /> Does sex talk about sex? About something? I dont know. I only know that filming a firearm does not make a war movie. <br /> <br /> Being engaged in a topic is more than just showing your own circle of topics. <br /> <br /> So look at the controversy. Do not be afraid of trivia, nudity, divorce, masturbation or anything else. It is not me. See if you look at any other story and think that it's poorly prepared, poorly adjusted, poorly moving, and really badly written (okay, some of the pictures are pretty nice and the main character is really a good-looking girl) Hypnosis slowly tries to beat around the tuff The director's cerebral masturbation is a story clever. It does not do that. This makes him drill.
