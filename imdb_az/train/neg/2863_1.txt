I enjoyed watching this movie free while working in the hotel industry, and this movie has recently come to our movie library. There is nothing against low budget movies, but this movie has terrifying action and leadership. How to make a movie like this movie. The director should be blacklisted and not for all poor actors, a jump-off fee. Make sure you watch this movie, the player is naked, the camera and the management are terrifying. There are several films worthy of being called "LOW 10". Another example will be "Dracula 3000". Those who earn money with this movie should do it with charity, and at least for a good reason. <br /> <br /> In this case, I would have watched him 10 (or at least once).
