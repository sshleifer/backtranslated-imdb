this movie was not strange, but it was pretty bad. it was pretty good on the move! If Jeffrey Crawlers do not know such things, I've done a very good job as a magician scientist, a kind of specialty: D. bill forsythe .. well, I'm not exactly sure what's in this movie. it was a very good way for things to do and its role was not exactly demanded. I leased it for the strength of these two potentials, and I'm not really disappointed. That is, a movie about heck, half man / half shark. This is not Shakespeare people. Apart from the hack-filled and poor dialogue, I would also like to note that cinematography also wanted much to be desired. There were shots for trying to look cool, but it ended up stirring up the scene or just plain cheezy. when they deserved a dialogue, and the person exploded repeatedly when they went ahead of time to draw even a line. it was pretty bad. but if you have a Jeffrey Combs fan, this is worth checking out. he gives a great performance and can do with his character. Forsythe is neither bad nor woman leading. Even if I remember his name, heck. bottom line, I do not spend any other time.
