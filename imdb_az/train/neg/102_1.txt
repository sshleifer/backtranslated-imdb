My daughter once brought around Zombie Chronicles to watch as a joke. We know that there is a joke to pay 1 manat. While watching this movie, I will do more than watch Zombie Chronicles. These include: 1) Drinking bleacher 2) Flaming sand in my eyes 3) Writing to Brad Sykes and Garret Clancy 4) Restart American civil war 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with old lady contact. <br /> <br /> Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Did Draper write this? The boy could not even earn a right excavation. His best part hit a door (the best part of the film). This was the worst movie I've ever seen and I saw white noise: Light. There were so many mistakes in any movie. <br /> <br /> Owen Wilson watched this movie and tried to kill himself. Fact. <br /> Do not WATCH
