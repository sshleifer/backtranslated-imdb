I love watching Thunderbirds (1965). All my friends at school also watched. We played Thunderbirds before school, at school and after school. We all want to be Virgil or Scott. No one wants to be Alan. There was a computation art form less than 5. I took the children to see my children hoping they would get something that I loved as a child. How disappointing is it. The only high point was the fast theme tune. Thunderbirds' original account will not be compared. Fortunately, tomorrow morning, a television channel has been created by Gerry Anderson and his wife, who have come out of the series. Jonatha Frakes should have been in charge of the directors department, the version was completely hopeless. Loss of film. Yeah. A CGI remake may be accepted, but may be substituted by marionettes with Homo sapiens subsp. sapiens is a great mistake of the sentence.
