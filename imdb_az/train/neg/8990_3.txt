Steven Vasquez, writer and writer James Townsend, was horrified by this strange little drama that, with obviously very good ideas and intentions, made a story different from the usual tariff and made it a thrilling work. Why not work? For starters, the movie loses its orientation to the opening frame and flies through the film in a way that does not reach an agreement with a viewer who wants to see a bunch of ghosts to create a thrilling tension. This is not a bad thing: Of course, some of Hollywood's success stories can be increased. The film also tries to talk about young men and women, relationships, parents' concerns, and all honest antiques that accompany such incidents on the club scene - and what happened in the murder. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Devon level Devon can offer help. They bond, Devon goes out and secrets begin: Boys are missing in the neighborhood, Devon's curator psychologist Dr. Kirk Tyler (Dan Swett) is not as visible and Devon's comforting mother Donna (Sonja Fisher) is thrown into the streets for a new relationship with Devon. As you can imagine, Dr. Tyler, in a dark job, with watchman Cunningham (Earl McDougle), looks at missing guys ... Devon collects resources from his companion girlfriend Jenna and her cronies and brings together the group, Dr. Tyler and his detective sidekick. And thanks to all this, he spreads the warmth and understanding of Donna, the perfect mother of an ardent boy, and so on. <br /> <br /> Some actors make eye contact (but not very frequently, but the level of functioning is always low) is something that we forgive (and in some cases it is poor, too) is a commitment of everyone involved. Yes, it's a low-budget movie and yes, the director needs time to study his trade, but in order to try to draw a gay movie at a different level, one must say something, maybe the next one will be polished.
