From the perspective of the Afro-Caribbean community in the UK, there is a film about the inner-city life that I often remember that the last example was the Babylon way back in 1980. After hearing, I've had high expectations about Bullet Boy, a movie that's seen as an English version of La Haine! Well La Haine is not! I agree that the use of dialogue and the environment is a fact that this film was quickly abducted in other British films, but my concern is the sadness of this film. <br /> <br /> The film agrees with the film I'm sorry for everyone who has a common problem with black violence in London, but I'm concerned that film makers use pitch-type casting, as opposed to the same characteristic characters. Sharif Dibb had a great opportunity to create a fun and enjoyable movie, but we just missed and created a film that reinforces the idea of ​​becoming a young black man in London, the only future violence and tragedy
