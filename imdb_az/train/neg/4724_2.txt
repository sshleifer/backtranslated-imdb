This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I was at the premiere at SXSW and was very disappointed. Director John Lennon knew very little about it and even said at the premiere. It was a drama, but people were laughing at how cute the movie was. This is not a good sign. Only savings legends were Livien's roommates / bandmates, such as Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard. The rest of the film took it seriously. The disgusting release of the Beatles was absurd. The soundtrack was excellent and it was the best part of the movie. Do not worry if you're not one of these naked, rabid Dominic Monaghan fans.
