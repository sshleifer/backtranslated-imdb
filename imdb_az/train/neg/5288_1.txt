My God, was this "Running, Lola, Running" to Persuasion? It was horrible. The "screenwriter" (and I'm using it in a very empty word) is bad enough that it cuts off character and cuts out a character similar to one another, often out of context and hurts the story. Anne Elliott Wentworth was an abomination close to the end of the piece! Austen must bend in his grave. No dishonest young woman could have acted so violently. The actress playing Mary? Horrors. <br /> <br /> If the rest of the Austen rems are bad, they will leave a new generation of guardians. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a flawless version of this amazing novel, get Amanda Root (directed by Roger Michell) in 1995 and play Ciaran Hinds. Perfect.
