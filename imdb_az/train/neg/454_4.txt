Generally a powerful pencil and some clever dialogue and, of course, on a film that is worthy of Dean Martin songs. The problem is Nicholas Cage, he and Cher do not have chemistry and they are a central love story. Cher says that with Cage's constant emphasis and control over the body language, she solves this problem. Cage simply does not solve his role. He tries to do everything possible to think and is a real person, not as an actor, but as a love story. Cage has had similar performance issues with other roles that require more than Jimmy Stewart character. Cage continues to take these roles as he likes these films, but he does not lend himself, even though he has taken a better look at his energy as an actor. He must put such roles to the less-interested actors, who make a full contribution to the film and spend more of their fascinant role and movies, their energy and vitality in the film, which can be his crazy person.
