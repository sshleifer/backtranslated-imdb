Margret Laurence is probably not going to have any of the novels he has taken on the film. Hagar, as a character, has challenged a sustainable social norm (Whom does Gainsay have the courage to do?) And, in the process, he began to sacrifice nearly humanity. The characters in the book (Stone Angel, Silver Thread, etc.) are old and new, and are constantly reminded of the massacres that take place along the way. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is very loyal to the film's surface (but this is not really a plot character), I think it's the point of capturing the spirit of the film. Hagar's disobedience was not there. Bram could have been much more than a picture, and Hagar's father could play more "traditionally". If the film director insisted on stronger images, the film would have pushed this point to the flat. <br /> <br /> Why should we look at the same cell phone, organic product and other modernization? We're trying to make some points to create some points (for example, a Muslim girlfriend and local people). Hagar and co. There is everything in the book, but politically correct, so why should we see it in the movie version? Modernization can be an excuse for a low-budget operation, but it looks like blows at the bottom of the mind, using it as an excuse to send unreasonable political misinterpretations of the novel (and movie). <br /> <br /> There are spectators. As we have seen, we would like to see elderly people as sweet and loving. Why should Hagar always laugh at her excitement? I doubt Magaret Laurence wanted to laugh with or with his readers Hagar. These people are heartbreaking and angry, and what we do is to laugh at them. I do not think justice and other nations do not justify it.
