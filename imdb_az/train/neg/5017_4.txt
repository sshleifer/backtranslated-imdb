Just finished this movie ... I saw the video on the shelf and became a fan of Nick Stahl, just leased it. In all honesty, he was probably on the shelf. The concept was interesting, and there were several pieces of intelligent twisting and queue, but before I came, I almost estimated it all. And, in my opinion, the film was somewhat farther away ... If you're at a glance, you see what I mean! <br /> <br /> In a positive note Nick Stahl's player was great (considering what he did). Eddie Kaye Tomas was well, but it always has the same character ... Paul Finch, who loves it, is my "American Pie". <br /> And finally, the worst part of this movie should be the emotionless performance of January Jones ... I think all of Hollywood's theme is a really good face.
