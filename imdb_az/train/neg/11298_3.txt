This is a direct continuation of the 'The Mummy's Hand' (1940) because the lead character, Stephen Banning (played by Dick Foran), is older than thirty and coordinates the story of his fiancée (with the help of archival pictures). The film has only two unusual features: Banning's early death and Turhan's. <br /> <br /> Lon Chaney has little to do with his role as mummy Kharis, while lengthening his arms or pushing his arms. His fiancé, Isobel (Elyse Knox), has nothing to worry about his being but an attempt to marry. Dick Foran receives the second invoice but was killed in the first fifteen minutes! We need to wait until the end of the film "Psycho" (1960) by the death of a lead character (Janet Leigh)! The first film, Banning's friend, Babe Jenson (now Henson), appears shortly after a little bit later, without seeing any of the funny strokes in her, much older and original. It's hard to believe that it's the same actor! Unfortunately, this great job is wasted, because only two short scenes are killed by Haris. Then Banning's son John (played by John Hubbard) caused the chase to cemetery. The sheriff besieged Banga's house and cluttered a weapon to kill the mummy. World-Familiar Sound? <br /> <br /> Turhan bey is introduced to the new ladies, Mehmet Bey, nursing and feeding the ladies body leaves. With its "exotic" sound and appearance, it gets very easily killed. A better movie 'Babe' assigned to mummies things Von Helsing and made a final decisive fight with him and Mehmet Bay. Instead, we have pedestrian crossings different from the previous Universal Fear Films, even by Don Winslowu (1942), as well as Don Winslow (1942) and by Hack Griffin Jay, who wrote many of Universal's other clunchers. Elyse Knox also played in the role of Elyse Knox, Coast Guard Don Winslow (1943). Elyse Knox, 6 Anne Howe (1946-1949) and of course Turhan Bey, 43 films and television credits in The Joe Palooka 'The Amazing Dr. X '(1948) has a great role. <br /> <br /> Kinematography is more dark and more atmospheric (with a large number of shadows in sheriff's office) <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR/> </ Strong>
