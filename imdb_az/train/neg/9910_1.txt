One of the worst films ever. Not fun, kinematography in poor television style, bad behavior. It is possible to see many prominent famous actors, simply have the opportunity to act. Leading woman Nancy Young can not move. Horrible direction. Sub-par with bad TV movies. Sometimes poor jokes fall flat. There is no point in the foundation of the movie. In any way it is necessary to stop a stomach, but there is no logic behind their actions. Slow pacing stopped watching my wife, but I suffered through her. Elderly men should act as young and horny, but not funny, they come as pessimistic. How did they earn money to do so?
