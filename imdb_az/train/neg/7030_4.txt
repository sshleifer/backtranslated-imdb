One of the cornerstones of low budget movies is to get a well-known, classic story line and get a complete scramble. Mall Phantom is not an exception to this rule. The screenwriter takes the continuous Phantom of the Opera Story and goes to the shopping center in the 1980s. However, the purpose of Phantom is to take revenge on those responsible for breaking their face and assassinating their family. Special effects, especially when the body parts appear in the containers from the yogurt stand provides a good giggle. Pauly Shore owns a small role that does not let her 15-minute MTV fame so not to miss her as expected. If you are looking for a good laugh at the expense of actors and special effects staff, check this flick. Otherwise, continue searching for something else.
