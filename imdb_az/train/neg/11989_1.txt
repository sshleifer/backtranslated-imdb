This part of a movie puts a new standard for filming bad movies. Jared Rushton gives a pretty poor performance in a bad movie, creating a net effect of a very bad film. The main stress of the film is the temporary excursion of a child to the Canadian desert after a plane crash survives solo. Although she is concerned about Ankara's discovery of a non-marital affair, she understands the concern of a teenager. Unfortunately, this is a strange "hallucinations" (including two hockey scenes involving the moon-fighting) and strange hallucinations that surprise that this child is not sitting on a street where the film is just asleep. (and what a nightmare!). Additionally, some viewers of the film's family trail have several scenes that are not suitable for very young children, or a single scene view of a submarine pilot, one of them's eyes, exploded. <br /> All this is a terrible film that no one is subject to less sinful children.
