We can understand history with inaccuracies, but it was a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> In the early part of the last century, an old show was shown on the story. in fact, explained to him by the old, strange, true Wyatt Earp and repeated the scene. The ear director is staged on the stagecoach and is scheduled to take place when it comes to stagecoach, so even though other historians claim, Wyat himself claimed that it was premeditated. This movie is the people and brothers described as honestly Earp. They did not say whether the date was not clear or not. Many people do not want to confuse deception and lawlessness, but this is not new. The truth is that they are OK in KORRAL, the law that follows the types of QUNFQUK. <br /> <br /> The guys I see as a career, in the old West, believe you have no time to think about anything else. <br /> <br /> The non-existent characters, the really unwelcome coral, make all this a weak film. It's actually weakened by adults who do not have a credible Doc. It may be the worst selection choice for Doc, but at the same time it is important to remember that old films are closer to the circuit and closer to reality. As a result, Ford acquired the first information from Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> All the expected events related to the Mexican girl also weakened. Hollywood was a very devoted Nazi in those days, and was ready to kill the darkest women in a predictable way to honor Hitler's idealism. It's happening in most films until the eighties. At the same time, it is not an excuse and less its art. <br /> <br /> The actors playing the Kulp slaves are good and Brennan is always excited. In fact, the Mature can only destroy the inertia of this flick. Perhaps this is the weakest of the old OK Corral films.
