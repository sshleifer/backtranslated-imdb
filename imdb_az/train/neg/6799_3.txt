I do not expect much from this movie. In many ways, this movie resembles a film starring Doris Day in 1956, its name is Julie. Doris, a flight attendant in this movie, has recently shot down the captain of the Louis Jordan team, and derby has set up an airship after his husband. He did more than convincingly Kim Oja, who was under the control of 747 and dropped out of the control tower. I know a little about 747 airplanes, and I use myself to become a flight attendant. As I said, I did not expect much from this movie, it was a cheap budget. Manufacturers were cheap to use an aircraft with the name of an airline. Oceanic is a name used by several films. The only airplane was the name of the company that made the plane.
