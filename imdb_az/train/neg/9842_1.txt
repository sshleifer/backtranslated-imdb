Everyone in this film directs Woody Allen. They are jealousy and pause and a little tricky. Only DeNero fans are really hard to die for! It tries hard to appear as fictional, but comes as it seems to be a very low budget movie prepared by college students. The most common word in the whole film is "hum". The film unites the atmosphere of the late 60s and early 70s. If you love movies while people often talk about one another, you'll be happy if you feel terribly illuminated (even for "art") and as though you were sitting in a political meeting, but you really should be bored. I found it in the CD cabinet and now I know why.
