For some reason, the TV Guide gave these two and a half stars, and Faye Dunaway was in it, so he looked at something he could see. My, oh, this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. I was shouting at the "I can not move" television (I ask her every time her problem). What I need is "I need actor lessons!" I say, incredibly bad <br /> <br /> And Brian DePalma wannabe has come to an end, all of which is horrific. I want Dunaway to be one of the best players. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was my first mistake to stay with it it was definitely second, third and fourth.
