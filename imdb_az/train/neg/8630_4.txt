I know that there is something else I'll discuss in this episode, and in fact I think I have some advantages; For example, after appearing from the "Sunshine Depression" in the Sun's Rising Sun house, after having been given the negative opinion of Jin, he sees the best of truth and gains a new, more balanced concept of life. <br /> <br /> But this story has an element that worries me so deeply that it was my use of the entire episode. Earlier, in the case of Jin's hand and shirt, he recalled that at the scene, Sun's father was a person who was enriched by cold, illegal methods. Maybe he thought he was also a mob boss; Shepherds are practically operating in Korea as well as anywhere in the world. However, in this episode, we know that Savin's father is actually a Korean automobile company manager (or senior management) and that Jinun's attack is physically attacked by a civil servant (actually killed). <br /> <br /> For the way I work in the automotive industry, I may not be touching this issue, but I can say that it is a special raid and racist to claim that such things continue in Korea. ; Large, serious companies such as Hyundai or Kia (this should be a model of a carrier-based car, because the real ones are actually working on these mafia-like methods, instead of Western as any normal car company). it's not unbelievable for me that writers will be tempted to write something on this story, and it's not so shocking in Korea. "Get away from abroad!" propaganda of foreign car companies by criminal, unreliable, third world clothing.
