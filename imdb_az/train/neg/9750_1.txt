The Universal version of a Protelco-MLC production is to break the molecular structure of an object, capture it as a "clean energy" in a cell, and then the "target area." What's the point of this, but Professor Paul Steiner (self-proclaimed actor Bryant Haliday " Devil's Puppet ") and his assistants Pat Hill (Mary Peach) and Chris Mitchell-Ronald Allen. <br /> <br /> During a trial before the famous Dutch scientist Lembach (Gordon Heinz), he failed to sabotage his car, as he himself "predicts" the revenge by Sheila (Tracey Crisp). Of course, he's screaming and looking for people as "pork roast" by electrochemical power. <br /> <br /> With this newly discovered force, she manages some of the Cockney idiots, a security guy named Latham (Derrick de Marney) and her laboratory physician Blanchard (Norman Woodland). He can also enter a pharmacy and steal a pair of rubber gloves and black coats. <br /> <br /> As a result, despite the attempts by Hill and Mitchell to help him, the clown destroys his equipment and himself. Generally, it's a completely meaningless movie that has no message. <br /> <br /> At the same time you will see one of the most stupid color films.
