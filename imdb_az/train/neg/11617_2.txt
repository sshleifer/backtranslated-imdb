This film "Joshua" is extremely uncomfortable and obviously senseless. This forces you to think that you really are people who enjoy watching. The young man's reaction to the newborn brother without giving the story is just the end of the iceberg. The whole filmmaker of this film is subject to one of the most uncomfortable child behaviors imagined. Adding insult to injury, there is no realistic result in the hands of a child in the hands of clean immorality. There is a large group of people who are not smart enough to see any payment, unfair service, and the ones around you. Surely I did not like watching this movie. It was very uncomfortable. For those who enjoy horror movies, such a movie can be many. Although this film is well-behaved, the story itself is of such anxiety that you should wait for a little bit of painful dental treatment in the waiting room for a little 90 minutes.
