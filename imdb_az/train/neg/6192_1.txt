Robert Carmichael's Great Ecstasy is a kind of dirty film. Scenario, terrible speed, lack of depth in any character, trivial subfields, horrible moves, unnecessary peaks, perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I think filmmakers think they are smart and dark, with thoughtful lighting, long-lasting silences, and an unusual mistake of classic soundtrack. If so, they are completely unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it is very important for me.
