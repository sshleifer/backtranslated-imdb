Where is it that it is said that the untrammelers should be sucked? Scream 2 did not! Others did not! But that was certain ... Problems are horrible actors (only Christopher Walken can act in the whole film), bad writing (not even knowing what happened, even initially I have been researching the idea of ​​Nephilim). Eric Roberts is the foolish Archangel Michael I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> As long as you do not despair of seeing Christopher Walken, beware of this plague. <br /> <br /> That is, he is quick to go where he is in the film and avoid others. <br /> <br /> Yech !!!
