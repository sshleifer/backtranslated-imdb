Unlike Korea, Hongkong or even China, I'm not a great fan of Taiwan film production. Powerful performance is clearly shown in this film. I do not think like watching the audience myself because I am an admirer of the movies like myself. But this film shows a weak plot and slow pace. I saw that I was lost in the middle. Imagine that it does not improve. Rainie's player is "very moving", trying to be very strange and cute. Although I have to look at me, I like to look at it. On the other hand, Isabella Leong plays a more relevant role as a mixed, sad, regrettable, extremely protected character. In general, I find that this film is a disappointment.
