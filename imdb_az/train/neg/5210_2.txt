First of all, I'm honest. I have not watched all this movie. I watched the first five minutes and realized that I had just fallen asleep, so I decided to go ahead quickly and see if it was any more interesting ... She did not do it. It's a bit of an attempt to make a story that gives you a decent horror movie - something that is already untouched and unpleasant. Because I feel it is a good event, even though it's a good event, it's a good movie. When it comes to watching you, it will not make you a deep sleep and it will only happen. Finally, I think this movie is in the public domain, it's important to think that you need to watch a littlesearch on the internet more and more, it will definitely show you a place where you do not have to pay to watch it, a stack of cinematic streams.
