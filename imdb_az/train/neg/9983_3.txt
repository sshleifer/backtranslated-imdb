This film is a massive Yonan that proves that Americans have led to Persia. Even if it had already been written to them! The original film "Hodet Over Vannet" is an error comedy comedy that will give you a rate of 8/10. It's not just a linguistic translation, but the whole chain of absurd events is totally jumped, shooting a genuine clever farcical character and transforming into a cheap "oops my pants" style.
