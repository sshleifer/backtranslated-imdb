I do not know what to say about this horrible movie that he did not tell before. I'm honest, I'm not just angry with myself. When I see the name of this movie that would be a terrible piece of crap I should know well, but I liked the War Games indulged in whimsical. I regret that decision for the rest of my life. From the very start of the government when people explain that their super computer terror can identify which of a video game they know to ride on if they forgot land-that-good writing. very, very, very bad plot line, dialogue and action list I have so long that I IMDB crash if I try to send it. I ask those who say that they see the worst movies. I'm curious to see what happens in the wheat pile of horses.
