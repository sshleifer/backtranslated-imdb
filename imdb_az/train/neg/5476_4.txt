I do not know if this SyFy Channel is one of the original movies, but how it feels. It's probably a very fast, cheap budget action movie, laughable effects for brand names for a few titles, naked dialogue, and an unusual pale star (most of the 90210 kids now shoot cheap movies). <br /> <br /> Ian Ziering plays Cortes, we know from history as a researcher who destroyed a whole population of North America while conquering a part of North America. He does not play here as a hero or even as a sympathy, but as a cunning opportunist; if it is of historical nature, its character is likely to be killed. In this story, Cortes tries to find something worthwhile to prove that America has the right to finance further research, in a short survey mission. He and his men find a humble crowd of dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> The true hero of the story is L. Rios, who proves to be proud, competent, and wise. He knows the right thing in every situation with the young, ambitious Aztec Shaman as well as the opposition to Cortes. Of course, a native girl who wants to marry with headache falls for the treacherous shaman, Rios, increasing her anger against the Spanish outskirts. So all pretty clich√©s. Relatively relieved by dinosaurs. Despite the fact that the story is in an open area, the story takes more than 95% of the trees or the Aztek village, so it is not interesting to see. <br /> <br /> Even I did not recognize Ian Ziering. He was laughing with a laugh and a double call, and in a way he disappeared. But for a second, it does not look Spanish and makes mistakes in every way. <br /> <br /> If the film's song went on strike, she did not ask for Razzie. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's unforgettable.
