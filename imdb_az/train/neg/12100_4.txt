Now do not take me wrong. In addition to the history of human civilization, if you need a profound summary of everything that is a perfect way for people to have a more brilliant future, better than using a comedian and pop culture? If you need a healthy dose of all your religions, go to Sagan or Dawkin, rather than BILL MAHER, for God (!) After the good reasons that led to the benefits of religion! It's a good moment and it's itself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Maher deprives us of our religious past as a neurological illness, ignoring the fact that all society, art and science are rooted. <br /> <br /> In this film, he has to demonstrate his perverted and kinty sensitivity while trying to look Ehudit and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect is not his job. <br /> <br /> Maher makes us laugh, but not the brightest lamp in the box. As an example, he gives the interviewer's answer (and I use it as an expression of "ambushees") to convey that the existence of Jesus is a historical truth, "not then," and hate it (nausea) . The problem was that the man was right and that Maher thinks he was the sures of the gospel in history is a mistake in his claim that Mahmud was Jesus. I declare that Mr Maher has never read the contemporary historian Josephus. <br /> <br /> But masses will flock to this fictional document because they make so-called works of other intellectual devils, like Michael Moore, and they will sing loudly. <br /> <br /> But the loudest and most missile merger about 70% of the film's filming. The anti-Christian tyrant, the audience silenced by 10% silent under the sky, criticized the Religion of Peace. Hmmm. The criticisms of Islam were not afraid of the hip and liberal target audience, or they were afraid to laugh. I say so, in both ways.
