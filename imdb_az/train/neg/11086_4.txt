Because the Spaghetti West was gone, I would put this person on the dull side of the genre. The film is not particularly bad, but the other SWs I've seen have no glow and shine. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but there is no need for the screen to capture it. With a remarkable exception, the rest of the wells are not particularly good. It's still unstoppable and offers few moments that I have not seen before. <br /> <br /> <strong> This is a bright place in another mediocre film. Unfortunately, its screen is less than 15 minutes. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson, but instead he is a person like Melin. I'm not sure anyone can make a mistake with Rosalba Neri, a man named John Bartha. in IMDb's list of credits for the movie.)
