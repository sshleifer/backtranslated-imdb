Audrey, I know your husband really loves Ted's memory, but he does his inheritance justice and listens to what he wants. Dr. Seuss has for a very good reason denied the license for his lifetime. We ask you to stop giving money in his stories, pictures, fantasies and symbols. They are released by the powers of Hollywood and Broadway. <br /> <br /> It is almost children who will be shot tomorrow with these books and strange interpretations. I just want you to listen to others' advice for a while. Save the rest of Dr. Seuss. Thank you very much.
