I saw this movie with anger in the movie yesterday. I gave some hope to the film, because it was really Spoorloos (The Vanishing) and her. The film is okay because it looks like a great tension. Sooner or later, though, the film has become a turmoil with animated cartoons, and never missed characters and spectators (like Marjoke) and horrible editions. The film is merely a very long black one, repeating itself, giving rise to the stunning chronology of multiple scenes, and the story simply does not add anything and it could easily be released. After you have suffered through the story, you get treatment for one of the worst endings I've ever seen. It should also be noted that there are numerous sexual scenes in the film, which you can watch in many Dutch films. It's hard to say anything good about this movie. Approximately one-third of the event came out of the theater in half of the film and I did not hear it after the movie was over. Avoid all costs for this movie. really destroyed any faith I left in the Dutch film industry.
