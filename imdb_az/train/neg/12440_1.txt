This is an incredible debris of a real religious situation among the most elegant, the most refined, the weak, the weak, the weak, the hard-working, the weak, the hard-working fans I have seen. You think Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, well ... Tell me, I'm like a Citizen Kane. Â¿Special effects? ... Again, Plan 9 is Star Wars. Actor? ... Thor Johnson Al Pacino ... so it's really out of the bad. But if you are looking for incredible movies, this is for you! I'm an admirer of "American International" for many glorious horror films, pricing-Corman-Poe saga, and some great blaxploitation things, but falling to the level of wealth with "Star Creatures." Of course, I would like to watch out for the worst movies I have in order to have 1 out of 10 movies (the man who manages India) so enjoy and enjoy ... it is possible.
