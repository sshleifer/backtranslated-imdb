There is nothing new for me: 4 hours on the same hill. The cast was very impressive, but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / God went on. He must have eaten a modest cake (for those who died in Kargil for himself), employed one of these brilliant Bollywood directors, employed a true scenario writer, employed a true editor, and hired a musician who was not related to him (and some cheap Indian medicine "Apocalypse Now," which appeared to have listened to some bad version), hired a real professional staff, threw all the fireworks and told a true story. Unfortunately, he, as the great pride of the Indian Army, made terrible decisions for his actors and was terrifying for his audience. We all died again and again. <br /> <br /> Please do not repeat, Sir! Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> When I decide to glorify a few hours of Indian director Gurkha, I suggest to employ more than one Nepalese to represent the commander. There are a lot of people who work in Mumbai - from the last 40,000 to half a million.
