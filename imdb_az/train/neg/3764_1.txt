This is one of the worst films I've ever seen and perhaps the worst movie ever seen in my life. Actors and actresses were terrible and they seemed to be trying hard to play their role as dorks, challenging guys, flowers, alls knows, and so on. And Bigfoot himself was terrifying. Atari and Intellivision days, a computer has been created. Sasquatches, like an army, were abducted at some point near the end of the film, the rest of the survivors, and one of them was shot down and looks like a poor man's own version of the ass! And one bullet hit and his blood was just horrible animation. The only thing else was music. A lot of music throughout the entire movie (classic or any way you enrich it). That was never done. Oh yeah, the film is also very boring. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen. We bought this movie for $ 3 or $ 16 to buy a gallon of gas or a value menu. CONTINUOUS!
