It's really a dive in the genre of tension films. CLAIMS THE GREAT LOVE. I think that there will be difficult situations and there will be a sense of tension in the future, but this movie is very much anticipated and not just convincing. I'm going to watch more of this kind of movie, and I'm constantly talking about everything to keep the players out of danger. Always making bad decisions is just the boundaries to be stupid. If they had taken the time to become more realistic, I would have enjoyed it. After saying this, it would be better to get away from you.
