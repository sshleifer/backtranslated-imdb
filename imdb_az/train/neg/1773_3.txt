My dearest friend Rarely, a "horror" film jammed me, or so it made me laugh. After a start with a popular start, a slasher flicker with some supernatural and sexually acidic fits more. Dear Alice Krige is in this situation wasting and irritating the peaks. Do not worry if you are really helpless. Rating: 3/10.
