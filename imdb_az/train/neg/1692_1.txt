Okay, you saw Ring, you've seen The Grudge mostly. Only freaky camera tries to be frightened by the job and loud sounds, but fails to fail. The area, though rich, is a weak and full point, for example, how did people in the care center know that Yoko would not come to work when they were not there? And it is not clear whether Bill Pullman's character is related to anything. He just came out of place to betray. It did not make much sense to the original family. Whom did a small child or a father depend on? Was Yoko cured or dead when the care center boy found her? There were many unanswered questions and I had a lot of difficulty thinking.
