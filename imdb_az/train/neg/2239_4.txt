It was already described by other reviewers, so I'll just add that the reason he wanted to see this movie was to see Gabrielle Drake in all his glory. <br /> <br /> Miss Drake is the most sexy, most beautiful example of "posh totty" in cellulose. Only Jane Asher is approaching just fine from the beginning and the first. What about the actresses with their music brothers? (Nick Drake and Peter Asher) Because of his admiration for Gabrielle for those who love me, his scenes in this movie are not disappointing. <br /> <br /> Generally, the film is too weak and results in a very cheap time. The song, covering opening credits, goes forever and looks horrible.
