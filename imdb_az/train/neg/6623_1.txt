First of all, I'm sorry to give this movie a rating even in 1 (which is less available). The film scenario, direction, characterization or functionality fails in each department. <br /> <br /> 1) To start, the film's name is C class (although the movie is suitable for its own name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan does his best to live in a character, but the weak script is united in a strange way and gives him a humorous character. 3) Sholay Gabbar Singh won him 50,000 (this was convincing). In the Aab this figure was Babban (100 crores for Amitabh Bachchan), but the poor man was beaten by our hero, and only a few people passed bikes (with all automatic weapons). Mumbai-style structure to create a modern Sholay film 4) When Nika Kotaria comes, someone else does not know the actor. Why Ram Gopal Verma pushes again? 5) Mohanlal was good, but there is something difficult about him. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav, who are great actors, wasted in the film. 7) The role played by Lila Misra (Basanti Mausi) in Sholay was replaced by cheap Gang Mummy in this movie. Ramu, grow up and understand that your movie should be a mind. Shiva and Aag have enough foolish characters in your movie. 8) Should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of the original classic. Do not waste money and time in this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Saurabh, is the best film for me.
