I saw this night on the other night. I can not even tell you how much this movie was asking. Writing, moving voice, even claymation. Terrible, Horrible, Horrible. As a 24-hour C-Span watch for the comedy. This does not just work. <br /> <br /> The film's animation is a very poor quality. I know this is a movie made by a man, but he thinks he can shoot a knife for 97 minutes, probably for at least 1 second can do something funny. <br /> <br /> This show is a cake for the worst movie of all time. Yikes. It was really bad. If you are looking for a movie that will make you laugh, avoid this abominable. My advice: Do not buy or even look at this issue. Your brain will be more than you.
