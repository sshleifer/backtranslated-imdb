The film shot in 1930 and released in 1931, I think, was likely to have a great difficulty in passing the silent period of the voice. Nevertheless, this Zane Gray area seems very weak. Also, Gary Cooper was probably just trying to move. The result is something that is incompatible with today's standards. In 1931, maybe. It is unacceptable for 2004. Some actors acted well. Unfortunately, indians always end up in this early west. Long before they came to the white man, they lived in the land, but they did not have the right to defend themselves against the twisted history.
