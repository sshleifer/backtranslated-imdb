As a boost in my days, we played in 4-plex "Special Lessons". It was a bedroom that sold Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks. I did not see it, but I saw it last weekend, so I decided to give it a shot. What I saw for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst films I've ever seen, and it's an inconvenience to watch me. <br /> <br /> The main story is a teenage boy after a sexy girl (Sylvia Kristel). She also feels the glamor of the boy, but it's a worse one. So, we invite you to watch the scenes of the guy watching the deck and watch it. <br /> <br /> Eric Brown, like a teenager, must be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. Each time Sylvia creates a piece of clothing or touches it, "scary" reactions are terrible. <br /> <br /> In some cases, a few days later, several days ago, sex scenes are the worst things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes are the worst I've ever seen. Although Eric Brown looked older, he looks like a baby. There is no idea how a woman would kiss (if she did, perhaps, I should look back at my criticisms) and she came closer to child pornography to be erotic. <br /> <br /> Although Miss Kristel was pretty nice without dresses and clothes, I have never been so extinguished with any sex scene. <br /> <br /> ALLEGATION WARNING ** We need to talk about the final scene. It's just a plain illness, but I remember the movie frozen and pleased the audience. Hero returns to school and begins to flirt with one of the female teachers. He asks him for cooking, and Tom Cruise just stares at him. He smirks logically and smiles in the camera smiling. Give me a TIME! <br /> <br /> I will never understand the 1982 appeal of this film. Of course, there was a lot of nudity because of the many teenage sexual comedies that were bombed on a large number of nights. The same young people who rejoiced this movie 22 years ago now work as corporate ladders and perhaps help manage this country. This is a scary thought.
