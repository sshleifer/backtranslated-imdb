The movie is bad. There is no other way to say that. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I do not think most people will know what the "marchers" are or what they are really careful. I felt I was watching over 70 films. The topic was not just convincing for 2007, even in DC. I think that is true for anyone watching it because the applause is extremely low and fast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> I do not think Schrader thinks about the film early. Many of the scenes were cut short, or could not finish them, as never before. He threw a shot after a scene and you guessed it, tried to figure out what happened or what happened. I really did not get the personal life or spouse of Woody (Carter). What was all the "artisan" men's captivity and torture photos (from Iraqi prisons)? What did he think? I think that Woody's character (Car) was a very poor attempt to create this dark private subculture life. It did not work. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (Car) flawlessly. Indeed, it can be like a "marcher" (you say twenty years ago) in a great sense. He was great and probably would never be known for that. <br /> <br /> When it comes to Lauren, Lily and Christine ... Boring. <br /> Do not see! It's painful! If you are not genuine Harrelson fan.
