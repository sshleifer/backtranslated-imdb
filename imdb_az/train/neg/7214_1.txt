Nahhh! Leyla (Grace Mills) is a teenager who turned her into the Devil (and LSD) by her archeologist fianc√© Richard. Leyla and Richard can not drink anything, drinking water, drinking drugs, engaging in sexual organs, dancing with lung psychedelic rock, and engaging local hippie religious rituals that attend children's pants, masks and dresses. Unfortunately, this kind of non-activity exposed Leila to the devil's terrible "evil spirit." Leyla comes from a habitual family, or does not help. His older brother, John, is a foster-looking mother-in-law. His mother, Patricia (Maria Perschy), suffers from depression because she thinks her father is responsible for her death. Moreover, his sister (Maria Kosti) is a semi-golf golfer named Debbie Gibson. There are plenty of hired helpers to spend more time. Udo (Luis Induni), a hawkish voyeuristic handmade who spies Leyla's clothes, takes her naked pictures and gets a smell of freshly used beach costume in the pool house. Her two girls are wearing some clothes and an old man spying on everyone. <br /> <br /> Paul Naski is a persistent priest (zzzzz), Adrian Dunning, who begins to snoop on both John and Richard's back. Leyla tells him: "They make me distort, and I will prove that this is true!" On his birthday party, his guests were told, "If you make me sick, I hate all of you!" He says. and when she thought her mother had come to a doctor she said, "I do not want to hear this oil!" Debbie thinks Leila is called "kindness," but she runs away to Leyla and joins the clergy again. <br /> <br /> As far as this point is concerned, there is only a ten-minute walk, and we have a lot to do. The sad scenes of how terrifying and festive the lives of heroes are and how Leyla is strangely engaged. Sit up as almost an Andy Milligan movie, agonizing to sit like a mess and laugh. But finally, the title of the movie over the last few minutes - flick to get an EXISTICIST. Unfortunately, its best part is Leila's contact lenses. Black shows a slightly less time-consuming loss of legs and face, creases the lips and gives them a blue and white marble look. He began to get out of the rotten body, walked up a few feet, began to speak with the tone of a tear, and his mother went into bedroom and flies a little around him and says to him, "The bad nickname of a prostitute." Father Adrian, who is finally convinced that he owns, is getting rid of his attempts against himself, frogs hallucinates, eating in the kitchen, and marrying Leyla with holy water. The doors are open and close, a mirror is broken, suddenly there is a thunderstorm and the bed is lifted. After leaving Dunning and the two ladder, his spirit is in him and who thinks he is? Why Borg family's stomach! The Demon dog then turns to Adrian and extends it a bit before signing a shot poker. Then, loyal to the film, we get one of the most irritating shots. Leyla is in the normal sexually explicit form of her bad appearance. But then, after a period of influence, he thinks that such a person can enter the body again. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <br> /> Tilt contacts, from 10 1-i.
