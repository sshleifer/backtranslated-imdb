Ohhh man! Now I'm talking about it! Despite the bad / unpleasant horrors, this movie really was in its class. A real gem! <br /> <br /> Firstly, the film is not in English for the first time. Sound dubbing is really good except it's exceptional! Here's my favorite piece of dialogue (and where is it more than that)? <br /> <br /> And what's the drama! <br /> <br /> Field 1 ???????????????????????????? Scientist: "Can not you do it? This will be a catastrophe!" <br /> <br /> - Military servant: "This is just science fiction" (which, as the scientist predicted, causes a complete disaster). <br /> <br /> Scientist: "If you do, many will die!" - Military official: You do not know what you are talking about. <br /> <br /> 3rd scene? The scientist said, "Do not do it, everyone will kill you!" - Military servant: "It's ridiculous" (everyone is killing) <br /> <br /> 4, 5, 6, 7 scenes? <br /> <br /> If this is not enough? there were several scenes that really seemed to be classics! At one stage, military soldiers consisted of 10 people showing unarmed men to two unarmed men. The Leader yells, "Get Get!" and all 10 of the army guys, drop their weapons and strike two opponents! Instant classic! <br /> <br /> And do not worry. Focus on the track! <br /> <br /> The hip / upbeat '80' button in this movie was a keyboard / synth soundtrack! <br /> And trust me? I know that this research may contain some spoilers, but there are many good things in this epic, and I really just scratch the surface. This calibration film goes on once every ten years! The real movie watching the experience! A work! Amazing! Wow!
