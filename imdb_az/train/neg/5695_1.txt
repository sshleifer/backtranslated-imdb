This movie is described as an action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and the presence of James Belushi signify a humorous gangster movie. However, the introduction of a ridiculous woman begins with many heroic twists that give very little to hide the end of a similar one. It is animated by a movie, a comedy (used in a blank image) and a dramatic drama. The article is the beginning of some scenes thrown from mature scenes. Leading woman (angel of the head) moves weakly, and the actress has some extraordinary, descriptive character. James Belushi is the only one who works well, and it is down by poor scripts. One to escape.
