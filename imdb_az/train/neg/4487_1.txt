As fans of science-fiction films, I've been aware of Matrix since it was released in 1999. I would be allowing you to talk about it for a moment, I was very original and complicated. I'm a worshiper at Alice in Wonderland. I did not understand that I missed The Matrix when I was released. <br /> <br /> It's time to buy and watch DVDs with a recent version of Matrix Reloaded. <br /> <br /> The alarm was too great. The premiere of the matrix (a controller for the film) was intelligent. The philosophical foundations of parallel worlds, alternative realities are shopping. However, I was watching the film as a science fiction, if it were strong in this genre. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a standard, "they will run, escape, save those who need it, and so on." Another martial art workshop went on to worsen issues. Problem science-fiction and martial arts films are really two different types. It is the purest, the same or the other, mixing the two does not work. It's like a science fiction mix with romance. <br /> <br /> If you have problems with Matrix, it's not the same for each other or for each other, as well as in that movie or the same movie. Matrix Reloaded really complicated the problems. At least thirty minutes of the movie was the sequence of martial arts or the longest car speed. (This observation does not take into account the questions of every professional, negative view of the film: If Neo Superman can do anything, why worry about fighting for it? The answer is, of course, a young, demographic group theater.) Then there is the aspect of "buying with love". This device was eroded by Richard Wagner a hundred years ago. Die Gotterdammerung really worked well with it. <br /> <br /> So who releases Matrix Reloaded? Fans of martial arts may have been shouting at the tradition, but the science fiction philosophy. Fans of science fascinated wondering why they were sitting in the kung-festivals festival. <br /> <br /> The audience is in the majority of viewers in the compressed state of the film's nervous romance. <br /> <br /> How much money do you need when you see Matrix franchise movies? art or soap opera? Part of each does not give more than any one of them or a film worthy of the affectionate of each one.
