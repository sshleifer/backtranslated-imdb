I do not know that Margaret Atvud is thinking of allowing this movie to be named the same title. I've always been a great admirer of the Robber Bride, and I'm thrilled to find out if there's a movie in her works. I know that the translation of the film is not perfect, but this movie was the worst. The names of women are correct, and some of the rear parts are correct, but this is true. I feel like I've lost a lot of time to use this movie. <br /> <br /> Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia actors were well-chosen, though I suspected Mary first. -Louise Parker. I just want to have a better script to work because it really has nothing to do with the book.
