What's going on? 'Doubt' had a lot of potential to be a brilliant movie - but instead, he was easily trapped in a cunning line at a speed that I stopped to watch. The arrival of the film was just the glow of Meryl Streepin, who won the DOUBT Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> In some of his films, he was not one of the best speeches, but he still bloomed on the screen gave us a solid and true character. However, the shine of a screen legend is not that of the lower hill of this movie. Because of the end of a boring start with no power or shock, the film was really a disappointment, especially since it has so much potential for its adventure and traction. <br /> <br /> The film crew was faced with the simplicity of the filmmaker and ended with long dragging drums without much discussion and inadequate performance. <br /> <br /> In addition, other Oscar nominations were more convincing. Philip Seymour Hoffman did not deserve Oscar despite a decent performance. (Especially because they leave the performances like Will Smith, Seven Pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve his candidacy. Watching Amy Adams was like watching a cardboard box - one-sided and straight. It would be more meaningful for Razzie to nominate, but I am sure he would win. Viola Davis gave a short but accurate performance, but the length of his performance questioned whether my academy really was nominated for it. <br /> <br /> Generally, I think it's one of the most disappointing films. It was a mess of a very potent film, and I do not recommend it. The only bright light in the film is Meryl Streep, though it gives a stunning, solid performance - not even enough to save this movie. *** / 10.
