This is a low-cost movie "Scream". "Maddy" is a new employee in an unrecognized office, where he faces "Chris" and begins to contact him. During the hot tub party, Chris and his friends convince Maddy that Murder Club, which everyone killed for hitting anyone. <br /> <br /> <strong> When the item loses it and kills someone in person, it comes to hijinks. <br /> <br /> The film looks good, and it's a great deal of money for the genre and budget (nudity, gore, probably fewer than a few big stars), but after you've credited, you've been watching your life for 80 minutes you will ask.
