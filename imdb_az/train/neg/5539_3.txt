Wimpy is a group researcher wishing to find and destroy the hidden technique to create zombies Armand Louque (gracefully played by actor Dean Jagger in a graceful way). Armand falls in love with Claire Duval (blonde Dorothy Stone), who uses a soft handle to marry Armand's businesswoman Clifford Grayson (hopeless wooden Robert Noland). Armand, frustrated by Claire and being angry, uses voodoo knowledge to revenge. Does it sound exciting? Yes, not sure. For beginners, the static (non-directional) aspect of Viktor Halpery leads to extreme overlapping and unchecked discussions. The worst Halperin does not bring to tedious processes that irritate any tension, atmosphere, and accuracy. In many cases, many of the most strange players do not help items; Just like intelligent General Duval and E. Alyn Warren, Dr. Trevissant, just like George Cleveland, managed to revive a bit with pleasant and refreshing hammy histrionics. Drippy's stock movie library account, painful open-ended transition kits and raw cinematography are also very bad and unimpressive. In essence, this delicate excuse is similar to the heroic character that the unpleasant visuals of the Big Bela Lukasia can alleviate the brain's boredom. Angry dull dud.
