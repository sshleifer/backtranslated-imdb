Hi Hi, <br /> <br /> This is my first message on the IMDb, though I use it as proof for a while. That's why I greet you all. <br /> <br /> It is inevitable that I am Greek because I have explored the 2 years of my life (all of our Greeks actually), the Omirus epic (s). As you see Homer everywhere), rhyme and grave. It is good to remember that in 8th grade Iliad (Iliad) and 9th class Odyssey (Odyssey). Warner's Troy was a big disappointment for me and the Greeks living for me (I'm studying in the UK). <br /> <br /> The Iliad epos is one of the best literary works. It was written 400 years after the original war by a Greek poet Omirus. Historians have set up a Trojan War of about 1200 BC, and the true cause of the war was not the beauty of Helen, but rather Trojan's strategic importance. The purpose of this work has never been to say that it is impossible to understand that an epic of an Omirus did not present real events. <br /> <br /> This great poet is interested in reading, self-respect, love, anger, hate, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. The best part was long negotiations with warriors before the most educated battles. None of these were released in Troy. <br /> <br /> Warner's Trojan was really cheap in my eyes, and the other English people were English and German counterparts. It's a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad situation. By the way, the perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computer graphics did all the work) and is still the best work of Wolfgang Petersen. <br /> <br /> I do not want anything from my husband. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
