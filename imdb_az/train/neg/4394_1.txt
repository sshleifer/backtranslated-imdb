John Goodman's program was terrible, but that's just plain. One of the confusion that made me smile was just one thing - and Patrick Starfish's voice was accepted as Frost. This story is hopeless, written by someone who breaks the memories of childhood accusations, but has never achieved any maturity during the intervention. Paranoid rules the dark world in which these characters live. Everyone is unpleasant and unreasonable. We can predict the arcade, but the boards that have been shown to one another from an invisible, inaccessible scene are not entertaining to watch it so senseless. The worst thing is that it is lonely, in a mixed-looking production crew!
