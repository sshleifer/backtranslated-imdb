We're sorry Fulci fans, but this could not be over. The soundtrack was frustrating as they came from, the player was alien, the story was made and the exercise and the direction were non-existent. <br /> <br /> A massive child film project looked honestly. But I've seen some of them and it really looks better! However, they have been forcedly deported so they can not afford ... ANYTHING! Not a DoP, not a director, not even a remote running hint. It was a very poor kinematography experience; <br /> <br /> This was the worst suck-fest I've ever seen, beside Terror Toons, just outside the space killer Klowns. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong>
