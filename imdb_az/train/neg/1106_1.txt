Do not waste your time doing this. As you can see, the symbols have no indisputable values, and watching the relationship is torture. "Gothic" was the least fun, it's a shit. If you watch ambitious and spoiled poets who want to drive each other, this can be true for your alley. Lord Byron is described as a complete shaking and why others choose to spend more than five minutes is really amazing. Mary Shelly seems to be the only character with any spine, and even comes out of the entire trial without respect. When is the time lost? Instead, look at Gothic. I remember another great movie based on that theme, but I'm not heading. I was hoping for that, but there is no such success. Not recommended.
