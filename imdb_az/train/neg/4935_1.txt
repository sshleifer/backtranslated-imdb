"Cavemen" surpassed my expectations and was not in a good way. It was worse than I thought. Basically, there is a show: Cavemen is an alternative race, opposed to prejudices and so on. It is perhaps the most stupid idea in the future; almost worthy of writers' imprisonment. A demonstration cavemen tried to get girls, went into a club, and then something else did not happen. Recalling the 22-minute Andy Rooney dialogue, Midget was killed by knife blades by Cannibals. For those who do not enjoy this show, here is an example of a dialogue: "You were not sure of going out with a caveman." "Well, it's good, it's like 10,000!" <br /> <br /> I love the recent article about how bad it is to apply for a car from a car insurance ad. I saw they will be next to Gecko, so they can be a new chapter for the worst show I've ever seen. Even worse than Viva Laughlin. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Viva Laughlin" was far from anything that was inspired by something. <br /> <br /> In such a way that there is a comet somewhere to the ground. <br /> <br /> (Certainly not honest ...)
