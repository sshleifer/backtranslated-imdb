Wayne, west of this early John Wayne Lone Star, has a bit more to do with the Lone Star rocks than you've ever worked on. First, he has his old friend Paul Fix; After being a very good actor, the standard Lone Star cheerleader brings the most demanding professionalism to the environment, often instead of the usual suspense line readings delivered in these dishes. It's strange that you are expecting to have the budget of the budget in the 1930s, but the Wayne's strawberries make a long way to its good appearance, attractive charm and one-line way to make it more comfortable. Swing, Balding Eddy Chandler does not believe that Wayne is a woman like Wayne, and Chandler and Wayne have a ride on something that happens when they want to get into a tough battle. On the other hand, Wayne's love of interest is not played by anyone other than Mary Kornman, the small "Mary" of the "Little Rascals" glory. She is a 20-year-old adult, blonde and sweet as a button. The majority of Wayne's Lone Star / Monogram "B" ladies were very soft and colorless, but Mary is sweet, sweet and sexy. Generally, Wayne has a scene in the common store where Wayne wants to get a bottle of "nerve tonic" in her upper shelf, so she needs to get a ladder and go upstairs. shelf Wayne was surprised to see the film shot in 1935 after looking after her, climbing her up and down again a few minutes later and asking her to buy another bottle. she tries to hide that she has checked her cover. In any case, this is not a big deal, not a bit of B, but it's strangely and casual as most LoneStar production is. The last gunfight is not all good, and after a while Chandler becomes somewhat annoying, but all in all, it's worth a look just to see a cute and sexy Mary Kornman.
