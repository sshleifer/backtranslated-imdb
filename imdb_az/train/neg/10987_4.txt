I was delighted with Margaret Atvud's novel The Brave Bride and was thrilled to see a movie version. A woman is trying to erase her friend by closing her husband to a police officer to kill her and checking the friend of an old police journalist by checking the naked woman friends of the dead woman. <br /> <br /> Eve, the film's scenario, mimics Atwood's scheming to focus on the stories of these two men who are victims of schematic women. Okay, you took me. When these guys are mentioned in the book, and I'm pretty sure the movie is completely prepared, I'll eat my hardback image dust cover. As you can see, the three main female characters of the novel are not enough to carry a movie. Zenia manipulation is not as interesting as to see a person happen, and one person's life is broken. Roz, Charis and Tony talk about their stories - a man. <br /> <br /> It does not matter if a person does not hear it. <br /> <br /> I loved the characters in the book. It hurts to see them pushing for a man's story. I usually do not want to look at the press from the feminist perspective and I try to enjoy it, just like the movie. I loved the movie even though I did not read the book. So if you like police and old police, and you want to read more about them, you fail. Read a novel with a romantic prose and a subtlety of a plot that wants to characterize. The same area: the film dug it, scraped it and smashed it into the barn. Margaret resembles the vengeance of Vengeance.
