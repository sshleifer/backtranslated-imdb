This film was first of all confused. I usually love Gina Phillipi, but it's also a good choice for Rosie around the Ring of Ring. The Jeepers Creepers were way better. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. He compelled me completely, and finally, it was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) who came to the funeral of his twin sisters. She lives in her house and has a sister named Dunaway, named Amma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) is sacrificing his relationship to survive, and he can not die while he wants to live. Even if Jennifer strives to kill her, she works. Ravens is in that strange part. Ravens eats his organs when they are asleep, so they will not go to bed. But they are doing it. Basically all crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and their ties will be buried, not dead, b / c they should suffer forever, so Mary Ellen can survive. Yes, I hope this helps. If you do not, sorry. I love you.
