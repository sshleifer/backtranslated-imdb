If you just look at the cover of this movie, it's pretty cool. DO NOT STAY. The film itself slept for me. It was slowly used, with minimal severity and weakness. The player was down to film and plot, it would be cool for a different movie, where it was shown poorly. They even kill the only character in the film! I gave him 2 out of 10 because the only good thing was eventually twisted. In addition, you can save yourself from this movie trash.
