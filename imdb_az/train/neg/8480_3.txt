I can not say one of the best films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I want to say again that this is one of the worst I've ever seen. Okay, so basically a girl makes a beach, it's okay, she wants to go to expensive school, she can not pay for it, and she needs a hockey bonus. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not like the actress playing Katelin. <br /> <br /> Katel was just a person who accused himself. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;" He tried to treat people good and useful, and two athletes call their names and say something about their choreographer he says, "draws lines." and Spencer. It was a typical typical of classically uniting and eventually coming together. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a movie for watching you do not want skate, but if you're a skater, it's a great deal. Basically, it's good to kill your time.
