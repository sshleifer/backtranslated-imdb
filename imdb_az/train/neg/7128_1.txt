To rent DVD REDLINE, I'm a dumber person. This foolish film, Chicago Pictures, has never paid Palisades Media Group to buy web ads on various car sites, including mine, rated at 16K ALEXA. They agreed, and now they cost $ 16,000, and most of my personal time is wasted (they contact Palisades Media). <br /> Please, please, the movie! <br /> <br /> "REDLINE" is neglected and has weak actors. <br /> <br /> This film is a shock
