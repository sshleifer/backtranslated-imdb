The groom was in a very good start. The first scene was really interested in what would happen next to my seat. In addition, the first half of the film is BORE. Half of the film is related to the falling title because the Spirit of Kapoor is in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, do not you think he is a little old? <br /> <br /> Finally, when Juhi talked to us about her husband, things start spitting in the middle of the movie; Woe is that wisdom! She was really savvy, neat and bizarre with HOT TEMPERATURE! He used to beat the poor Juhi without any reason! One of the reasons I really love this movie is because Juhi (my favorite actress) can not stand to see a lot of abuse. This film is mostly exploited by the WAY and blood shed; <br /> <br /> Anyway, I do not want to say if you think about renting Daraar, put it somewhere else!
