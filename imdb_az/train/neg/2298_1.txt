Some examples of Pat Robertsons have undoubtedly claimed a "relatively good mark" of predictions. <br /> <br /> The Christian Broadcast Network's 700 "Broadcasted on January 2, 2007, may be" very serious terrorist attacks "and" mass killing "in the United States in the" second half "in 2007, host Pat Robertson is a relatively good record, according to previous predictions. But Robertson's 2006 New Year's predictions violate this claim. He predicts, for example: "President Bush will strengthen." WRONG "Fall elections will be impossible, but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the Republicans". <br /> <br /> "The war in Iraq will succeed and we will begin withdrawing troops by the end of this year." <br /> <br /> Robertson has a history of suspicious predictions: <br /> <br /> It is projected that the president will be able to win President Bush's January 2005 election again. Bush won 51 percent of the votes cast by the Democratic Senate of Massachusetts, John Kerry. WRONG In 2005, Robertson estimated that the bush would be able to win after the victory in the second round. According to him, the Social Protection reform proposals will be OK! <br /> <br /> He claims to speak directly with the god ... Perhaps God is a little strange.
