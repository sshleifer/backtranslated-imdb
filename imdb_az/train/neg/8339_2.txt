This film is just in circles and the audience does not know where they are. From the very beginning I thought that .. mmmm, this can be a very cool movie, but it's just drag and finally I do not know what's going on. Leading woman was a good actress and her role played well and psychological sting was creepy, but after a while she did not worry about what really happened, because this movie just drifted. <br /> <br /> The wife and the psychologist, who have a good career before them, will remember this movie and do it. because they are well-known or have a regrettable film for what they did.
