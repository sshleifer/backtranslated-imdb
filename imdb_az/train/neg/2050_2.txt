"Ulli Lommel's movie" filled me with hope, but I have to admit that ZODIAC KILLER can fall below my lowest expectations. Young filmmakers have the latest trends in the use of digital video for early projects, and it is good and good, allowing all children to create jobs without spending the money on the movie. But many of these young filmmakers, as celluloids, seem to be far more likely to be frustrated by the filtering concept of the finished film. The effect is not perfect, but it helps. An unprinted digital video really works only in the "mockumentary" style, because nothing else appears on the video. There is a major problem with ZODIAC KILLER. Watching the movie feels like watching a day's soap opera about something sinner. It does not feel like watching a movie. And Lommel is not a young film, but more spotless. You need to know better. As you know, it was impossible to create horror (or excessive) in the video. For the love of God, this man has ruled for over sixty years! He may be the only director who has been unable to improve his career for forty years. And luckily wrote us! Hence, nothing can be expected of something that is unreasonable and at least one really ambitious plot element that is almost totally unsatisfied. Please do not miss this movie. Thank you later.
