Although it was interesting to get rid of Atlantis, I found myself less than hoping to read the plot. Probably, I have a child at a technological age: the film was officially five years back after five years ago, after fantastic fantasies such as the Lord of the Rings and the scientific fantasy fantasies like Star Wars. <br /> <br /> My beef, I could not say that I am of the same age. (a young adult) and a middle-aged man does not have a problem. But the picture did not lead me to a different existence. I would say, "ACK, I would do a job!" My dream has not opened the doors. Without comparing budget movies or other television movies, certain aspects of even standalone features are stereotyped: The development of character in children is very fast when I like it, and the stereotypical arbitrariness is too young - We're a big-happy-family-let's-never- separation-again-for a long time, we can shoot or break a picture. Even the characters themselves have improved: a typical set of one or other stereotypes. Athletics had an everlasting beauty of humanity, accompanied by the perfect image, which combined the behavior of good appearance and intelligence, and the extremely elegant elderly brother of ours, who has become so widespread these days. Although personalities have lost the story, I think that the more nuances and the more rarer differences would be to add more individuality - more and more incredible (as in character) - would bring more to cinema. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Do not get me wrong: all the movies are worth seeing and you will never meet someone's opinions, but I think a bit deeper and a bit more (I do not believe) I said that it would be magical to escape from Atlantis.
