DarkWolf explains the tale of a young lady named Josie (Samaire Armstrong), a pretty ordinary life, until she was killed by a Werewolf, friendly Mary (Tippi Hedren). is a special organization to combat psychological threats. Perhaps, he wants to unite with him, in fact, the detective Steve Turley (Ryan Olosio), who claims to be a pure bloody wolf and that he is a "prince of darkness", and wants the whole world, or something similar wants to create a new breed of pure blood to win. It can be understood that when Josie believes in him, there are hard times, that is, until he sees his proof with his own eyes. Sin and the world of Josie, to the world of Wolf and Steve to save the world ... <br /> <br /> Co-executive Richard Friedman has prepared and directed. I did not do anything for DarkWolf's digital camera's fear film, which I thought was a pretty bad budget. Scripts by Geoffrey Alan Holliday have been set up in a lane club with very bare hands on the show and a hopeful way, and then there is a Werewolf attack that leaves a person spat on everywhere, but after this decent start, I'm scared. It's slow for a beginner, it's weak, it's predictable, and it's a very boring character when it comes to a very bad dialogue, and when they have the opportunity to hit the wolf, there's no idea Why did they just want to stand there instead? The scenario is mute and does not reveal itself, why did Josie not become a Werewolf before? Is it really one? Why can not this "dark prince" find another woman Kurtam? There are many things that make little or no sense as a past book, but the tuber is very important, but then completely forgotten halfway, but only in line with one film <br /> <br /> Director Fridman's film bright enough neon light, but it does show that it is new or original and does not actually improve the film. spectacle Now you can talk about special effects or not because DarkWolf is too far from the effects, the wormback conversion is achieved using CGI, and among the worst-looking CGIs I've ever seen, a serious Playstation would be embarrassed about this computer graphics. This was the easiest I've ever seen, the worst Werewolf transformation I've ever seen, the American Werewolf in London (1981) 25 years ago, but the special effects are in the DarkWolf, a pre-light year. has improved over the years? Although at least on the screen is psychic, animatronic puppet effects are no better. Many blood splashes after the deposition of the abdomen and many dead bodies have been killed since then. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> If this If anything, perhaps, with the exception of the worst CGI effect, it's well-designed and at least has the production values. Some of the worst, but by going to the dentist story, I say that if it's a bit fun to go to the funeral. .
