The lame sequence and two-dimensional scripts seemed to be carton cuts. Of course, it was difficult to feel empathy for every single character, especially for her fianc√©; He looked more and acted as a cartoon. In summary, in my opinion, it is equivalent to typical drama for television. Uses only every click in the book. Torture classic musician who wants to leak and play salsa. He draws on a "bean" counter that does not like his fiancee who hates herself. I would not list them, or else there would be another spoiler because I would remove the entire field. Dance was good, but something special. I saw worse. 3 stars for good music. The group was really busy. I've seen this on YouTube. Unfortunately, I did not pay good money to see a theater. I'm still a little shocked by the great reviews of this film's decoration.
