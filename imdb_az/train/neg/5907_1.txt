Yes, it summarizes it. This movie was terrible. She wanted to shut my eyes in two minutes. It has been described as the "innovative LDS comedy", but it's not good for church members! <br /> <br /> First of all, you can say that this film did not make any effort. Excessive emotions, glibs, and trite plans seem to have been thrown into each other by twisting each other with a gift for consistent (at least semi-consecutive) thinking. After that, there is a ghost player involved in everyone *. <br /> <br /> The main hero of the Caucasus, we do not want to believe that he does not want to believe, but this road is full of embarrassing bad dialogue, terrible, ugly "gags" and many Mormon "jokes" you need to think of their right mind, LDS or anyone else, completely * fool! That should be one of the worst films I've ever seen!
