In 2004 she liked it. Then it was very stupid. This shows that children are brainless. Children are insulting. Cartoon Network was used to be great. Hamstero was one of the favorite shows. She was able to be creative and creative in her approach to programming children. The show (Foster's Imaginary Friends) is like putting 20 spoons of sugar in Sprite. Today's television makers are interested not only in their imagination but also in earning money! Recently, my kids have moved to find something interesting to look at in the old show (60). Perhaps, the lack of originality, watching the past of television and repeating the programming of children from past days.
