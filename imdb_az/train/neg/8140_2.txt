When I called this movie "Live the night" I saw it at the mysterious science theater. This topic is less deceptive than "Batpeople". In fact, it would be better to call Batperson. This movie belongs to a physician who works for bats I think he wants to make a better treatment for rabies. It is not really clear. Obviously, she and her spouse go on a cave trip and run out of bat. Why is it that a scientist goes out to study bats outside me? He should not go by himself. After the torment, he and his wife go to beds where they fit. They still go to the worst doctor. The boy stays in the hospital and kills his nurse. Finally, three or four people lost their lives and her husband stands next to her, and instead of the sheriff of the crime investigation, we must stick to her.
