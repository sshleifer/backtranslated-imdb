As a usual movie watcher I can not say I'm really happy to watch it. It's not too emotional for a drama, it's not too fast for a motion, it does not get too hot for a tension. Moreover, some aspects of the film are very reliable. Okay, I understand that soldiers reduce their opinions somewhat, but it is difficult to believe that a person's life is in danger, mix the enemy in the middle of the city and run away from the professor's friend without questioning it properly. Although it's an animation or something quite romantic, it's likely to be a daring movie about warfare. There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture is a front view of a movie and <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;">> This picture left a question in my head: WHY? Why did they give Oscars? Why Six? And IMHO is the most exciting part of the movie :)
