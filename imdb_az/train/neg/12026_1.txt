I really wanted people to be funny when making a comedy. This is a movie that you can sit but there's nothing special about it. After watching, you were not good. It's not boring to watch, but the audience did not joke to laugh. Entertainment means to actually get something more. story. This film wanted to be a "Toothie", but instead it failed. <br /> <br /> I gave him 10 to 1.
