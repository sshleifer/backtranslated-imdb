The absolutely funny "epoch" is a delicate pretext for a broad, graphic description of a monster, which is supposed to harass the hero's work with "animal", some women in every age. It's pretty much a thing, and the animal's description of the film is really scary; a tall guy with a mask and a large PVC tube with a fur suit is a challenging task for those white fluid squirts. For fake animal porn fans, maybe this is really a shift. However, I was interested in the opening shooting of horses in the public square.
