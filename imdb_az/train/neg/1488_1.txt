To make a comment about how terrifying this film is, I only have to sign up for IMDb ... my cats and a string have a better story than that. The worst I've ever seen, but when I erase almost all the cast of the movie in 5 minutes, it creates a little bit of whatever. While watching the movie "Halloween", there was no "fear" in the film. All around, it could be a good story, saying that the loans were rolling down and saying that Chaseey Lain was there, I could say that he was suffering a bit because I did not know him immediately and the scene was already over before I said, 'Oh yes, he's got it.' I was so glad to see this at a hotel and if I had paid a percentage to see it, I would not be paying for it. I usually like or can love a movie as a darling factor, but this is no exception. The worst is that it is not so interesting that it is so good - it-bad-bad .... it's just bad.
