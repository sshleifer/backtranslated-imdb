This film is about a family who wants to go to Genova, Italy, to deal with the death of a mother / wife. <br /> <br /> Genova's structure is promising but, unfortunately, it's empty and focused. The film consists of scenes that reflect the daily life of the family, such as swimming, piano lessons and cooking eggs. Many of these scenes are unnecessary and tedious, able to attract spectators in a sensitive way. Because it's not spectacular, moving or emotional, the end result is very disappointing. I am sure that I can say that I am disappointed and disappointed by "Genova". A good thing about the movie is sunny weather and Genova's beauty. Genova can be a long-term tourism ad for the city, but can not be used as a movie.
