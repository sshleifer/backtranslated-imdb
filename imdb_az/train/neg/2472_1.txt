Indeed, anyone who has the ability to live in this movie and who can feel as if it is a good film does not appreciate quality movies. This film was an insult to watch, direction, high school class quality and cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had better cinematography and I hate these acts passionately! Story film had a very powerful movie, but with the rest of the film, the first 10 minutes went straight. Someone said that this movie is about a child's imagination, it's okay and good. But they still could do better by doing this than they did. I would like to say that Indian is in the store. The boy looked at the small idol and suddenly imagined the whole story about an Indian spirit called India and Wendigo? They talk to the store's worker, and they say by chance that there is no one else who works here, so you think of a creepy ghost scenario, but then he simply comes to the idol's amount and we forget the little boy who sees this boy. It was very disappointing that this was not a pity. The last left was what happened to Otis in the hospital alone, but also interested in the sense of OMG. Why did I just spend my time watching my paradise? This is an uncommon action to watch, where there are better quality movies that will not offend your intelligence! My witness, I never paid for this movie, I had requested my money back! For those who are easy to enjoy this movie, you are very sad to say that the standard is a really good movie that you have brought to this level of the movie.
