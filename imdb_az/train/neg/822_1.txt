This movie really has two parts. First of all, the film "The Simpsons" is a ridiculous prologue to a hysterical and boundary film that Troy McClure should tell the story. <br /> Then the rest of the movie (technically good, killing with an inaccurate, unbiased and impartial conspiracy is not just an unimaginable character but begins with a headline song that is not compatible with the others, which can not give any meaning to the film <br /> <br /> This was especially the case with Mickey Rooney's Spiventa, which Hackman had given any unbiased decision to negotiate with him. <br /> <br /> The general problem of the movie was to whom or with what but it does not want to give details, which is behind the assassination, claiming that the creators of the film are not a part of society, they have the ability to create such an organization, and that there is no explanation and that the audience hopes to produce its results. /> Simply put, the movie failed at all levels.
