The Hal Roach comedy is short, A Tough Winter, the "Our Gang / Little Rascals" series and the eleventh Talkie's ninth ninth. Basically, here is a showcase for black comic Stepin Fetchit, who has special billing space, and we see that his gang goes to the hangman. Farina receives a letter of love from her letter and is called by Stephen to read it because she can not read in the daytime when she goes to school. It happens to be her lover of Tennessee, now Farina's got to be packed with cotton because it's too hot to listen! In another room, Weezer is instructed by Mary Annah to tune in to the radio, but after missing her back to the kitchen, Miss Annni Tabasco and Lux's adds to the magic of the gift's spokesman to rice pudding and Spanish Tamale! After the encounter is over, Jackie and the rest of the band will help them with a terrible taste, but with a very sticky matter, as they are stranded on the walls. Since they all try to clean, Stepin works on the tubes in different tubes and electrical sockets that involve phones such as vacuums, vacuum, and refrigerators that feature the changing devices! Last. I only describe the short song "Our Gang", a pilot for a short series of "Potential Step Fetchit". Fetchitin's lazy enrichment was only a small dose of entertainment and it did not happen, as it is today, very painful. The latter sequence was a very logical consequence for me, but it is very striking that most of the scenes I describe are good for some laughs. In summary, Zorlu Winter is a curio worth seeing at least once. By the way, Stephen's original name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
