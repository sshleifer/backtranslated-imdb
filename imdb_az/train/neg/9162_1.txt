The only reason this movie is given to 1 is not one of the zero choice options. It is striking that Widmark does not kill the director for putting this black mark on something more delicate than the caffeine soup, horrible mood and special effects of the depression cycle that appears to be leaving the Thunderbirds television series. Even in the 1950s, exceptional submarine sequences, special effects are very strange. I can only assume that he is putting forward for the best special effects, because no one else has any influence except under 20,000 league leagues. Of course, it was their competition, of course, no competition for Disney. Even the most realistic scenery in the underwater sea is limited to a heavy underwater submarine film because the seawater is limited to a shot that falls on the raised periscope. From this era, there are better, better, sub movies than other periods, like the 20,000 League or Torpedo Run.
