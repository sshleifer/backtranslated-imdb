Thinking that Arnold was probably an alien creature, Simon was going to talk to a colleague, and he was also planning to say to his colleague that he was an alien. Paul and his beloved sweet friend Cindy (Arnold, for example, Nadine Van der Velde) are responsible for Arnold, but for a long time they have been unable to see each other in the Arnold bucket. Meanwhile, Simon's brother, Cecil (also played by Korman), a successful snack company, wants to buy Simon's home and land - adjacent to them. Simon does not want to sell, so Cecil Arnold shoots on a scheme to steal. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: The best shootings in the film are those that have natural scenes in the background, for example, when characters are walking outside the desert city. they tend to look like elegantly decorated, cheap gems and, more importantly, have to show that Hirschin is not very proficient in banning and building shooting., Surprisingly, Cecil's house was similar to the smallest details of the 1980s, Cerson's son, Dude's (John Stafford), was a fun contract. <br /> <br /> In any case, Korman is a fun actor, but it looks better Simon than Simeil Unfortunately, Simon is in the majority of films resulting in the absence of a ridiculous wig and physical hair Cecil was not just a "bad capitalist" of the film, but one of Korman's classic, fraudulent characters - one of his specialties and often the "Carol Burnett Show" (1967) sketches. Directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers have a very long way to manage Hirsch Korman and Cecil character, unlike the Carol Burnett Show, because they spent their sketches in a way that they learned to push the skates just to the brink of chaos. Many other directors There are problems, at least the film's pacing and editing which completely shake the dramatic effect of any postponement or impressive film. <br /> <br /> It is said that the scenes they stand up - for example, munchies - surprise an old woman on the road - they are so much more appealing. <br /> <br /> There are serious logical problems with the story. Where's the camera in Machu Picchu? The trailer of the movie appears to answer it, but it is made up of the last part. A more serious problem, unlike gremlins, munchies, cute, cuddly furballs do not have a clear reason to go for dangerous monsters. It happens only. In addition, when the Munchies PG is stored and the creatures are in the monster stage, violence is never too dangerous. At least temporarily they are sent easily. <br /> <br /> Of course, the essence of the film is humor rather than an unusual, terrible, modest drama or something else. This is more than a Gremlins and then a parody of countless rip-off. The only problem is that it's only a few times naked, but it's not funny. Surprisingly high proportion of images is soft clich√©s. Most of the remainder consists of non-regulators. Because Hirsch's bad times are spent, all of them fall flat. There was a potential for filmmaking, as well as funny and intimidating, cheerful and uncomfortable, cheesy and suspenseful, but also from the Foreign Space Killer Klowns (1988). Too bad, then the Munchies do not get anywhere.
