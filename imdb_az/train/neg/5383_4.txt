I think that almost any business style can be partly fun. The true test is whether it is better than the start. This is the reason I gave the same title for care. Most of us would agree - even those who like me like to read many blogs - blogs can not compare with good novel for a number of reasons. In the same way, FEM can not compare with a good film because of a number of reasons, and in fact, it is a poor example of independent filmography. From the start, FEM feels like a vlog that combines with one another. (Heck, even mySpace gets pimping.) If I wanted to see lonelygirl15 for an hour - I do not go to watch. FEM is more interesting than the quiet atmosphere of the press, but it is an interesting storyline. As I watch most of this life, I think it is very natural that I agree the most. And FEM's creators want to applaud us, film about their postmodern movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, do not worry about anything at all. I'm shocked to say that I really took the time to write this review. FEM is not obviously bad because it is not; It's only a few minutes to break a smile or perhaps think - maybe just something - something will happen. It is almost certainly mediocre. <br /> <br /> I hope the film creators / "actors" borrow from their debts. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, even though your time is up and you want to do a lot of things. but do not worry if you miss it and miss the great, undefeated talent. Not really.
