I looked at other comments and were so excited to find out in the movie that I actually clarified only those who worked. So, I hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you want to make a bad movie and comment on it, it's a bit lower. "Reflection" is very low. It even produces a Boston-based college that does not even reach the amateur amateur movie level. What is your expectation for a child to do? A very rational stupid action movie. If you want to relax, it's pretty laughable. You will not see anything unless you are a student at Emerson College.
