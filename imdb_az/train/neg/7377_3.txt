Despite the fact that the site was very well detailed, Steven Seagals was in a state of excitement as to what his voice was talking about and who was talking. There were a lot of things to begin with, and then the voice of one of the others was talking to him. I thought it was having difficulty with the sound of the film, but I still repeat the events that did not reflect their voices while restoring. For the quality of the film, I have rated this movie from 3 to 3. If you do not pay for a movie, whether it's a movie or a movie on a DVD, this movie is not worth the entry fee. For a long time, I have been continuing for a long time with Steven Seagal and all his films he has performed in the past. So far, I think it's one of the worst we've ever seen.
