Richard Condon (The Manchurian Nominant 1962) comes from this dark tale of political revolution and conspiracy. It's hard to swallow the story of almost comic book fashion. This poor effort, which is considered to be all star cast, is not entirely the burial and the crew's fault: the novel was filled with the same shortcuts. As you can see, the story is actually mocking more sincere efforts in the "Manchurian Candidate." A frustration on all the counts.
