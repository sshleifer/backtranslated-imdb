<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The forest is a very extravagant and excessive worn-out. The International Mystery Man came out straight from the sky. It was only a star that a little man heard. But it was stunningly original, complex humor and spacious humor, always kept in good taste and a brilliant cast. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie, I thought it was funny, but only after watching it or three times you see all the flaws. The player was good, but Heather Graham could not move. His performance was not very convincing, and Liz Hurley was not as good at first. The first blossoming characters (Scott Evil, Numbers 2, etc.) are thrown into the background and can not get many individual scenes. The film is just a crowd. <br /> <br /> In particular, I have never seen some scenes in IMOM. At first, when he killed Vanessa and sat at the Basil, he said he knew he was a whole fumbot. What happened? The first one killed the number 2 and now brings it back without any explanation. This is supposed to be a spying probe, and I do not think that any characters in the film have even taken up arms. <br /> <br /> New heroes are very reluctant. All Mini-Me are enjoying my dimensions' jokes very quickly. Fat Bastard is probably an excuse for humor. There are only two or three good jokes. <br /> <br /> If this were the first movie of the series, perhaps it would be easier. But the series started with a dry mind and then dropped to a general humor level. I say, if you just did not see the predecessor, watch this movie because the spy who forgave me is a disappointment.
