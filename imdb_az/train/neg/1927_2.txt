(possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> Someone once asked Dr. Seuss that he could provide film rights to the 1957 Christmas classic. Chuck Jones, from 1966, claimed that he could not do anything better than the TV (perhaps his 5000 Fingers of Dr. T) in 1953. When a good doctor was killed in 1991, widow Audrey Geisel still refused to sell her rights to the film. However, when the use of CGI effects has become a reality, Mrs. Geisel has changed her heart. Universal made a generous offer to him; She also admitted Jim Carreyin as a hood character. Probably, he was satisfied with the final result. <br /> <br /> Ms. Geisel, who is part of the film. <br /> <br /> The film was given a budget of $ 123 million (which is much higher than the gate's price, including inflation adjustment). sophisticated makeup, design design and special effects (slightly distorted by strange cinematography). Unfortunately, none of these money was translated by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman ("Who's Framed Roger Rabbit?", Framed Roger Rabbit's High Budget) If the TV commercial was not a 26-minute ad, she tried to fill a minute of working time, which, like a child, was a matter of mockery, including an under-eight madrasa, especially a downtrodden experience, and it turns out that anyone who scares our poor Mr Grinch is someone else. Trouble seems to be 105 minutes long with a dead bull with a very long dead ox Only Grinch could have been so bad if it were a bit better ... well, Grinchy, Dr. Chris Jones and Chuck Jones's later animated character, slipper attempts to miss the holiday season, shaking with sudden change of heart (and global rise) . Carrey Grinch, loud, hyperactive castle and sometimes "Cheermeister" holiday, "the anger into Whoville town square" (hopefully, the scenery is as good as it seems)). <br /> <br /> The goal of the conversation is "to make Grinch more sincere", and that Whissille is unique to everyone (at least in this interpretation). <br /> <br /> Dr. Seuss's vision is an honest people who know Milad's true meaning in their hearts. The film's Whoville is a pretty noisy and crowded place filled with exaggerated, arbitrary, materialistic ninnies; An open attempt to comment on American consumption. <br /> <br /> This movie is sensitive because movie industry has greatly benefited from American consumption <br /> <br /> The film is also a small, but important one Character, character Cindy Lou Whoin characterizes and redefines. This innocent two-year-old waif who is walking about fake Santa is old and wise, always questioning Whats's counterfeit values ​​and trying to understand the idea of ​​Grinchin (a key scene of the original is re-accepted)). He is the only person who knows that Christmas is more than just gifts and ornaments, and therefore makes it a completely different and more boring character. <br /> <br /> Those celebrating the Christmas holidays must accept a charitable donation more than their pregnancy on the morning of 25th December, when they are shocked, disclosed, exaggerated, hand-to-hand. a classic feature film. It is once and for all that it is inadequate substitutes for darkness, honesty, manipulation and heavy morality, gravity, intelligence, sincerity and heart. People at home should fall into their own collective knees and thank God, the $ 123 million worth bomb is worth $ 260 million in the country or not here today. Moreover, Mike made it possible for Myers' Hat on the Hat!
