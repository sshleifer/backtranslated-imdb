Ritchie's first two films were fun, entertaining fun. Is there a raid on the last two classics? 'Ordinary Suspects' and 'Fight Club' ?? <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that he has secretly hidden himself (the 'suspects' approach, 'the greatest thing you've ever tried to convince' - or whatever ...) and the real-life and internal manifestations of the films, Club "tries to twist, struggles to keep interest in the film in the second half. <br /> <br /> In the latter part, you know that you are a blind pitch and slowly going out in a difficult way. <br /> <br /> Enemies, chess and game theory are all major issues, but Ritchie makes them superficial and <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be watched by the movie is Ritchie's scene and Maurice -Jones with a dynamic camera in a courageous way. <br /> <br /> If Ritchie joined a more delightful plot and was able to make a tougher arrangement, he had no reason not to do another nice gangsters kicker. <br /> <br /> That is, Revolver is the loss of your time. The misunderstanding is not equal to the depth. Follow the "Lost Highway" if you do not create a logical logic, but if you want to see a great movie that's the cause of it (and, say, a run, not stored in a single cell).
