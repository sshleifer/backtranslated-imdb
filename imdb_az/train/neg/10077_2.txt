Yes, at least the theater team was laughing. Of course, since I've been a little girl, I've been watching Grease, so it's still a little special to stay, even though it's not my favorite music or story, because it's fun to watch. I heard terrible things about Fat 2 and therefore never decided to watch, but my darling says that it is not really bad, and my friend agreed, so I decided to shoot a shot, but I called them and just laughed. Initially, after being totally stolen from the plot, it is not really smart to use the same symbols as different names and actors. Tell me, how many years did you leave after leaving Pink Ladies and T-Birds? <br /> <br /> For the first year in Rydel and for several years, as in the first film, it was a striking similarity to the T-Birds. music and dance did not stop. But when a new student with Sandy's uncle's son came on stage, his love was shot by a Mrs. Stephanie. But she needs to stay in the code she just needs to stay with Pink Ladies T-Birds, so the new student decided to train her as a T-Bird to win her heart. Thus, good hiking and bad bikers are easily dressed as robbers in a revolutionary revolution that can easily hit the legs of the T-Bird. But will Stephanie really tell who she is or find her? <br /> <br /> Travel 2 resembles a kind of silly television show that does not work. The Bag, as well as the first Grease, was not something that the French came back, but a little witty and unbelievable, because I did not click because I thought Rydell was a graduate, but it had not. The songs were really charming; I'm glad Michelle can splash so fast, but this is because she's a talented single guy for a while, I really do not want this movie, I do not want it, but I've warned it is a more loyal attempt than a popular music. <br /> <br /> 2/10
