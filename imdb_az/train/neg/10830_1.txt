In 1999, the film critic would go back to history as if the public was off the road. At first we were sent to EYES WIDE SHUT. Then they broke the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now the worst movie, MAGNOLIA. What is this? Who knows how easy it is. She is filled with self-esteem and malice. I always want to stay and watch the credits, but when it's over, I was not able to get enough of the movie theater. Most of the viewers who have shown me I have felt the same way. The dates were controversial with each other and strangers. An ugly and hate movie that will feel ugly and hate.
