This is a movie that you regret to put on your VCR. Stephen Kings is a strange bad rip version of the film "Misery (1990)". <br /> <br /> I do not understand how this movie has taken the 5.2 score. Because there is no story and I'm relieved after the movie is finally over. <br /> <br /> This film was released as a short film. Instead, it often goes to the same thing. As in every bad film, everything happens only in 10-15 minutes at the end of the movie ... <br /> <br /> So before you decide to watch this movie, remote control batteries will do all the speed of the fast transmission. Do not worry, do not miss the important thing.
