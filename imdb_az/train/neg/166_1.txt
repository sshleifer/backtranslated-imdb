First of all, I sat down to see the premiere of the "Star Trek" series to see a cowboy flying around the globe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <2 he sends a cloudless service and is forced to serve ... <br /> <br /> All the episodes I see are due to Archer's foolish mistakes, and all the problems occur. Oh, and did you see the preview of an episode showing the kissing of Archer and T'pol?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to watch this episode, but then I completely abandoned the Enterprise and went out on television. Come on! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In an episode Hoshinin had a banana bone, but some had to leave behind for a foolish reason. Well, a small tulip can bring as much bone as if you were going to space. Okay, I thought as if I were on a desert planet. A BANANA SLUG CAN NOT LEAVE A DESERT !!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> How generous are these writers?
