My first thought in this movie was bad. I was expecting a horrible, horrible toy, bad fun, ridiculous special effects movie. I really do not care. The special effects were terrific, but the movie itself was quite interesting and the script really good and decent. The player is not that bad and overall it was fun to watch this movie. This is still a pretty bad movie, but I thought it was not entirely worthwhile and I was happy to know that despite the good of this movie I was wounded. In general, this is a film that should not be shot, but it's not so bad for me.
