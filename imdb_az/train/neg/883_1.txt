There are a lot of problems with this movie, but I'll try to point out the most brilliant and uncomfortable ones. First, while the theme offered a series of vignettes about Manhattan's life, everything was just as strange as something normal, sexually explicit, as in movies and television. Story lines were subtle or non-existent, and almost every stage, camera layout, dialogue line, and emotion expression were completely fake. Finally, after a rush of one hour, I reached a point (in recent years there is nothing rare for me). I would have guessed that some of the film's 3rd degree film project was managed by some movie writers, but I believe that Mira Nair, once a pre-Amelia, was involved in this abusive transit, so she was unlucky in American directorship.
