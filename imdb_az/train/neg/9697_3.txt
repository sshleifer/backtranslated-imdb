I saw the first of the dwarf-movies and sometimes I had some fun watching him. There are many well-known TV / Comedy players appearing in the first section and presented with fantasy suits, typical small episodes of the stand-up program, and this is the second issue that should be fought. Everything was already there ... something new to achieve. Very often you get acquainted with the dull and dumb "jokes" and have always put every comedian in the last decade who wants to return to the scene. There is nothing important about the story: Rumpelstiltskin's typical fairy tale story is of no importance. I was expecting something similar, but it's not something I can complain about. I'm actually complaining about the story of lazy story, which is actually a background story; Their only job was to be in shock and parody, but they did not take it anyway. This is a shit (except if you do not like it, you get 2 points) that Helge Schneider has a great deal of time and money. If you want to save money and get bad jokes, every Thursday on SAT1 or RTL is free spread. I'm sure you'll find some "laugers" I've seen in cinema last night.
