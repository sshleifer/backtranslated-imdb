there were many blood in this film, the sabretuous attack, and I liked it when the men and women had a good time, and then sabretooth attacked women and ate their belly and pulled out their liver. It was the best and 1ton sabretooth pushed his fore legs to talk less and talk less about the action than this movie, and I also remember those movies that lived in this terrible 1 sabretooth and eventually killed women There is always an ending enemy! OK cursed, this movie is silent, I do not believe that my lil's stomach loved it because it came out of the stomach and burned the blood.
