Here's what I wanted to really like, an indie movie, but it did not. The lack of a script (boldly proclaimed in headlines) really shows and kills this picture. The story is a ridiculous confusion that you do not have to try to figure out. Soon I fell into a compressed situation and then suffered the rest of the first 40 minutes - hoping for the best - before the episode is over (endlessly) ends ... even this extra effort. OZARK SAVAGE is very difficult to be smart, raises the best sequence from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX. As a result, there is little to do with OZARK SAVAGE, which has never been seen before. This movie would be more entertaining in a short time of 10 to 20 minutes, but as a feature, it feels just flat and compulsory. Of course, I do not have money on shorts, so I fully understand the financial reasons I think are motivated by up to 75 + minutes. Director Matt Steinauer greatly promises and wishes him success.
