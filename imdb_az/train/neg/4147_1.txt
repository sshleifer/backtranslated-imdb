I'm an admirer of horror films, on the one hand, my cheesy and downright ridiculous game. Imagine my spirit, I was going to Local Rent and found Vampires and Zombies. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> After seeing a terrible film, I was as if it was not. Me and my palm were sitting outside for a few minutes without mentioning each other, and we both watched this movie and think of the future of our lives. I broke the silence of words: "... what is my friend?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Regular WTF mode is not always available. The Characters; No development, unforgettable. Music; Worse than pornography. Vampires; Vampires? Zombies; <br /> <br /> Finally, everyone should see this movie, honestly, I still try to see it again. So give yourself a blessing, look and get depressed.
