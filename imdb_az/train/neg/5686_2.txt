Hello This is my first look at any movie I've seen. It was difficult for anyone to say that it was the most disgusting movie I ever saw. I feel as if the movie is being screened, I'll give some concepts about budget restrictions. I saw that I saw the film in a very bad way. <br /> <br /> I saw the scene that I was worried about in the Caucasus. The scene almost lasted almost forever, it really was about 5 thousand but still. I would like to note that I love some horror movies and, if it's good, give credit. this is a director ule boll and one of his group should think this before another before making this movie similar. a last note haha ​​!! EVENTS OF THE TASK general objectives of the operation, LIFE, WOMEN AND with children meeting with the attack HƏDƏLI A HAMMER ON A personalized head turning observed will be the future of the film will enjoy it and if you horror, a higher budget film to go with, for example, saw . People do not really believe that they are going to shoot such films. Anyway, uwe is sorry for everyone who loves and cares, this is just my idea of ​​the movie.
