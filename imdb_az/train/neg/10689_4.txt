Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent accusing himself of plotting against the US president. I will note at the same time that this talented actor does not have a role to play and why this film shows us. <br /> <br /> Even James Woods, along with a player named Cuba Gooding Jr, is a constant reporter for the assassination of an assassinated president Angie Harmon, Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'End Game' and can handle it in a simple way; a part of the action is good, the player is not all bad, and the story led to a fun and enjoyable movie, even though it was a cliché - EVERYTHING! <br /> <br /> Writing the script and its direction does not give you the slightest idea of ​​erasing any story or any character for it. <br /> <br /> 4/10, predictable and boring.
