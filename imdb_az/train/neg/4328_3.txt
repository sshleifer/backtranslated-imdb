The title of the "National Lamp" is the absolute assurance of a death in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and everywhere in Germany. Can be an organization in the United States, but it is practically unknown in Europe "The National Lamp's European Vacation" is unlikely to fix this situation. Terrible Griswalds are just that - sad. They are not funny. Obviously, Mr. Chevy Chase thinks he is funny, but despite all that Miss Bdi Angelo laughs in her jokes, but she does not have to earn £ 2.50 for a concession. The UK division is typical. The former same old former television performers, Messrs Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M.Lippman, come out of the same old old old tired clichés, Mr. Chase lost in the hotel corridor .... wash, wash and ... Bucking - da Palace, Big Ben .... I feel that your baby is cheating on two or two ......... bar red cheeks on what we see on a small porcupine - dren, should I continue? English buffoons, French cruel-laced Yank-haters.Alms pampered and puffed, (War, Clark) and puckers of the lekker of the Italians. Did I forget something? Every possible "funny" situation is fatal, Mr Chase snaps in the heart, Miss Di Angelo is kind, children are embarrassingly disgusting. Despite the fact that this franchise continues in a short time, it is necessary to bring relief to those who offer no opportunity to waste money by minimizing public taste.
