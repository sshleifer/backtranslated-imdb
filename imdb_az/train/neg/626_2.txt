<br /> <br /> The soul of a high school pupil killed is a strange one that will take revenge on everyone. <br /> <br /> This movie really bothered me. There is a great-looking monster, some have good low budget impact, some environment, but good things are badly short-circuited. Currently, the halfway has begun to move forward, and then passed through the DVD chapters. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with this movie. They look up to thirty before the stomach and still think of being in high school. After all, you do not believe anything. Fear is not too long when it looks great. He says a stupid liner and moves as he thinks he's more fun, then he's scared. Is this a comedy or a horror movie? A problem that goes beyond a liner is built up and built up to most of the dialogue. More heartbreakers are sent to each clutch rather than a horror movie. <br /> <br /> We expect that the film is prepared for a very narrow spectator, and for fans of fear who want to mock something else than mocking. <br /> <br /> Despite being a good-looking monster, it's a movie to avoid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
