This 70th Italian film is entertaining to watch soldiers soldiers, The Howling, or the Terrible American Wolves in Paris, but ... I'm talking about a leading actress, a stunning blonde, and I am in her birthday suit. We are talking about graphics, full nudity ... it looks like a real blonde .... Story is a hoot, SFX stigmata and childhood (most part). The only value of this movie is the value of nudity and sex scenes (and there is a LOT). Compatible with HBO standards, but is still entertaining to find yourself on Saturday night without a date. OK ... GREAT USE ... I have no worm, except the hero's (?) Father's starting scene. The girl imagines just a werewolf ... in other words, a clinical Lycanthrope.
