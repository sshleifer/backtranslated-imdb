This movie was boring! <br /> Yes, there are some funny moments and jokes, but you can not rely on the whole movie! <br /> <br /> The heroes are very clich√©s, there is no real story, but short episodes with strange side characters. <br /> <br /> Shame, because in Hungary many actors admit that they played a role. <br /> <br /> This is a new hope for the Hungarian movie. It was dull, though it meant being real or unique. It could have been harder for them ... 2 out of 10
