These were 80-minute semi-unexpected boredom. First, how can one get something like that? Then, when I reached the 70th minute, I convinced myself that it was just a few minutes and I'm proud of waiting for this movie as a great trial for human patience and crap tolerance that I continued to the end. Is It Still Worth to Look? Well, as I wrote above, if you want to test yourself, give it a try and you can continue even to the end if you have to be strong ... If there is no coherence in the film, there is no solid thought in the characters. All the events in the movie, you can be sure of looking somewhere and will only be filmed to fill the film roll.
