First of all Lucio Fulci by Zombi 2 really glad. This movie was completely trash. I could not stop to watch it. The fact that Zombie 3 has nothing to do with the Zombie 2 is a joke. <br /> <br /> We run away from Voodoo and run away. People LIFE BACK. Whatever happens, this movie is not worth $ 1.00. I really enjoyed the lucio fulci film, but it was terrible. <br /> <br /> If Zombie 3 is an indication of how zombie 4 and 5 will be, I think I'll skip them. <br /> <br /> Zombie 2 is a terrific flique tho.
