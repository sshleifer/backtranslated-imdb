I will not spend a lot of time because I'm not really a beginner movie, because I'm concerned, only borrowing shots and embarrassing amateur images are all about to combine the whole mix and call it a continuation of Boogeyman. About 80% of this movie, as the actress did not get the name of Suzanna Love's unique character (Lacy), these garbage writers, even the "Boogeyman", a film that has not had a hard time watching. In order to add insult to the injury, the killer is invisible to the original images and appears in new images, and it seems that viewers are as fools as they are. I wish more than 10 to 10 IMDb's rating system, even the most delicate and frank attempt to crash the people I've seen - YOU WERE WARNED!
