<br /> <br /> I share this concern: 30% tone-deafness, 70% does not write. <br /> <br /> 30%: I agree with the first commentator's resolution about the lack of variety within characters and stories. In my opinion, this movie, in the best way, connects people with jealousy, and finally, as the Gossip Girl (one of those Gossip Girl lovers) desires. <br /> <br /> Several minority characters are written in stories, but they are committing, so we can see the shots in the film, but at the same time trying to be "different", but fall short of it. <br /> <br /> 70% falls short of everything. All the symbols, white and several tokens, one-dimensional, cardboard cuts of people's concepts. Worse, they have a relationship with each other for the vignette of the movie, as the audience looks at what I say "bulls": when we're going to get a basic humble, then a punchline wants to be smart. But even if we stop cynicism for a moment, "OK, this was a surprise" ... stories are still not interesting, because they are also very versatile. <br /> <br /> Caucasian> romantic stories. This is a good. But romance is incredible, deep, sometimes complicated. In this "romantic" story, a girl and a boy with a single place share the same position and look at each other. Words are exchanged, thoughts are predictable, but they are able to communicate with the audience where only one person is involved. The meaning was that no attraction (in broad sense) was trying to reconcile the existence of any conflict or unity between the will of the other two, and to accommodate the other. The only story about a superficial appeal is that the viewer is surprised to see that the girl who was hit by Ethan Hawke was an abusive prostitute. Of course, it is interesting to hear the words while trying to hear their words, and we were glad if we were with them, but there is no such story outside of "A and B". So, if something like a postcard is to "open up", it is the same with all other stories: A - then B - This is just as it did in the "set" in Manhattan. By the way, only Brooklyn is the sketch of Coney Island; <br /> <br /> The shift of a train drawn by a character going to the western village is just a run. <br /> <br /> It's easy to choose films that include all races, sexes, sexual orientations and stereotypes. it is. _New York, I love you, because of his title, it's worth the harder research. We really want to see New York and the real New Yorkers, but from the very beginning, we have selected demographic slices, symbols from OC, and several others to SEEM. <br /> <br /> Even when we look at whom this symbol is approaching, all the candles are transformed into an illusion of diversity and ethnicity and culture. <br /> <br /> For example, a little white girl in the park with a Latino man, in fact, when she was a father, made her mistake as her two sons (taste). Despite the last scene of this episode, it was unnecessary in terms of dramatic-construction (it would be more interesting for her mother and her stepfather to move away from the girl), and it is strikingly surprising that the scene we learned that the girl's father was Latino was a sexy dancer you must tell us what it is. What can not, Dad, be a South American man? Now she was obviously warm, she had a child with a middle-aged and upper-class white woman who was better prepared to accept the audience? Are we not clever enough to want these demands? <br /> <br /> According to Mammadov, for a few years, however, every vision has to be addressed in the direction of return to return, the status quo, and security. All these stories could have been more interesting, at least, without the choice of standard and clear stereotypes, even if they had to keep the single dimensions of living characters. The Asian girl living in Chinatown, the mosquito in the old white boy's belly? Instead of ending an Asian scandal that followed a white college child. Again, I do not want to say that all the thinking needs to be changed. This is just every one. damn story place. so hackneyed - and beyond that, failing to deliver something about what New York likes may be, beyond. To improve the film, you could write a scenario that you really read. <br /> <br /> I will accept the film's dissatisfaction, good film behavior (even though it is a tempo, good balance) and a common sense of most of the scenes. The film was good to sit and I did not distract anyone. Nevertheless, the most important respect for nonviolent action is that of the old opera singer, "I love New York: everyone is different from each other." Well, you're aware of watching it.
