This movie should have fun. Young Lea Thompson, young Joaquin Phoenix ... and Terry O'Quinn. In space. <br /> <br /> Some children go to a cosmic camp and accidentally called a robot friend (Jinx, respectively). Spatial scenes are then repeated, repeating (the same accident occurs twice) or, depending on the point of view, is surprising or scary. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> A young Lea Thompson should be strange and attractive, but if he were alright, what is first of all this? Joaquin Phoenix is ​​so lucky that he is still performing in the movie, but it's great, but it's a hearty and medium-looking look that you want to date. Maybe he can act as Microey in Life Cereal ads, but he knows how to handle a normal child, he is not on the screen and I do not think we can identify him at home. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anybody .
