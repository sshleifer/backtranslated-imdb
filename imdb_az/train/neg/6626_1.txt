I saw the movie and I was bewitched as the movie was foolish and boring. I thought the sand was right, but unfortunate, and the whole movie was spoiled and they were "spoiled". the cast and crew were bad. While watching the whole movie, some of them fled in the middle. Amitab Bachan's movement is weak, I think this movie will be the biggest hit of the year, but this movie will be the biggest floppy of the year. None of them, including Ajay Devagan, justified their work. This movie is not worth the audience. I think this movie is a flop. <br /> <br /> "THIS IS FINISHING THIS MOVIE"
