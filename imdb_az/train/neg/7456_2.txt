It can not always be the worst comedy, but it's close. The producers of this movie stole the half hour of my life and I want it back! <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan is funny for about 10 minutes. His loud sound and terrifying heroism begin to wear out, and then you realize that the rest of the film is worse. It falls into a long line of past SNLs trying to film. Some were brilliant, others were in a miserable state. There is not much room in this category. <br /> <br /> Kris Farley was brilliant, then he was okay, then not so funny, then he died ... so I think he hit all the spectrum in a career. <br /> Avoid this movie as a pandemonium. br /> <br /> c
