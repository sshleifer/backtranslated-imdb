I have to admit that before seeing the kinematic adaptation, there are actually some books that have really read movies. It is one of the ninety-eighty rare events. The book was very beautiful. It was an immersive and exciting prophet. But the movie just filtered. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The first five minutes after watching the movie was only half a half of a two-part assignment for a single class. It was dark and strange, but did nothing to attain the right atmosphere. The player did not have anything at the middle level, and given the lack of movement, it was a serious disappointment. The book did not show me, for example, that Winston was unable to cast more than one vote at a time. Boredom, anxiety, and poor visually impaired film completely demolished his book. Wait a second ... Is not it English?
