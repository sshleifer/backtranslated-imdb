This horrendously bad debris fragment acts as a racist, sexualist, and homophobic, at one point to be pretty chic and sophisticated. The sad speeches, the clich√© scenario and the drill direction are to clean the film from one another. The two scenes were particularly attacked - the scene kissed by Schaech after kissing another man (indeed it could be general) and kissing Eastwood's Schaech's best friend, Russia. When he leaves the room he says, "F ** kings are foreigners!" <br /> <br /> Jonathon Schaech can be an actor on the screen and has a stunning look. In a previous film, gay director Gregg Araki is a shame that has not learned much from the forefront of learning, and try to put this movie into declining gay stereotypes and homophobia naked.
