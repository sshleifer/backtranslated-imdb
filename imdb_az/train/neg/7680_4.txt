Snow White is an artistic point-blank film in my opinion. The area was very responsible, the characters were stereotypes, the editing was exaggerated. In any case, the film does not have many artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, this is a straightforward commercial thing. Includes a symbol in the French part of Switzerland (actor, leader of the group, SENS UNIK), aims at a larger audience. The straight-line German-Swiss film would not be sold in the French part - and vice versa. Indeed, my nervous film was a product placement all over the film. Some scenes recalled ad clips! <br /> <br /> I think the topic of "young people who take drugs without any goals in their lives" is a widespread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be prepared with more care. Hopefully Samir won a bit of money with Snow White, the next film will show his true artistic skills.
