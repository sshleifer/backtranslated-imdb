The boy's performance really liked it, but I can say that it's just a positive thing. Everything reached the point of absurdity. Most actors, as you would expect him to talk to his nine-year-old nephew, acted as a tired, hard-hearted police officer or a very wicked one. The ghostly noises seemed to me amateur. I could buy a cheap synthesizer and managed to make better music. All 1984 What Is Police Torture? It was quite a lot, and the story had nothing to do with actual events. He added so many things, in fact, he thought he would be really cool with his appearance, but he had nothing to do with the story. One of the things that made Borges's story so well is minimalism because they are closely related to any details. This is exactly the opposite. I saw Lonnrot questioning Yidische Zaitung or the guy there. I spent $ 4 this job, but at least I enjoyed writing this review and hoping that we can save the same mistakes from others.
