"Fred Claus," Tim Allen, who has at least some fun moments of being this year's "The Santa Clause," is afraid of being a starter, but does not think that the value of the theater is enough. <br /> <br /> Holidays are becoming increasingly festive and emotional. But in fact, it can be at least anxiety, like the "Fred Claus" in Dobkin ("Shanghai Knights", "The Wedding Crashers"), which is basically a funny memoir. a line between a fancy Vince Vaughn and a fuzzy Christmas movie. As a result, both are not all. <br /> <br /> With a castle of Vaughn, Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey, Rachel Weisz and Kathy Bates, it causes more disappointment. <br /> <br /> Vaughn Fred, Nick (Giamatti), plays an old and exhausted brother. once left her and her parents (Bates and Trevor Peacock), after a long enough stay with their parents' favorite siblings. Nick grows up to be Santa Claus, and while Fred, a Yuletide-tired repo man in Chicago, while talking to his beloved moments, tells us that time and your family freezes during your holiness <br /> <br /> <strong> The birthday of Van (Weisz). <br /> <br /> He was suffering from the law and forced him to call his younger brother out of jail. Nick agrees, but Fred agrees to help the toy-work in the North Pole. Fred agrees willingly, but loyalty faces an infinite happy nature of Santa and the elves, even an effective expert (Spacey) controls toy factory operations, but if everything fails, all Arctic operations will be closed. /> <br /> As you can see in the film, there are moments, but the length of the padded length extends gracefully. <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <br /> <br /> Neftchi's former player is on the table, but the deliberately written scenario of Dan Fogelman really does his job. Giamatti brings a charming old attraction to the iconic character, under the badly-oaked suit, but, unfortunately, Frede needs to play the second belt. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of people involved in the filming of Fred Claus, of course, the season's worst-case scenario is, but there are certainly better ways.
