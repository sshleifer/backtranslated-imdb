Okay, first of all, the video looked like it was in the 80's. I was shocked to learn that it was released in 2001. Secondly, all the seeds were on the ground. If there was a short prologue or presentation, the story would have been better. And thank you for the fantasy, but it was a lot of movies. A strange and bad movie was shot. The scenes run efficiently and the characters are alone. It was difficult to watch and maybe it was a translation, it was difficult to understand. I love Chinese epic films, but if you are looking for a Chinese epic fantasy movie, I recommend Promise (a stunning, intriguing, and good character development). You will be disappointed.
