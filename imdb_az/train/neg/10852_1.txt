This movie is a very funny movie. Violence is bad, the player ... Well, you do not usually do it, Dani, when it's a stick or a paradise for singing or screaming. Undoubtedly, flawless coincidences in everything, goth lads that are sexually explicit. Personally, this movie is really a suit. The story and characters would be great, if you're a director, actors and other smaller nibby things have been made better. But the film is just bad, people are like that shit, which is Danny. This film is perhaps the worst B-rank film. And I believe that it is difficult to succeed, especially with the Def, and with the horrible stories of "serious" horror movies. I'm not a CoF fan and so I see it as another garbage movie ... It's a bad one. Dani goes well if he makes it a comedy. Very good work done. At the same time, I also fall down because it is unfortunate. When you are happy, happy, happy, rejoicing, you can laugh everything or prefer multiple types of medicines.
