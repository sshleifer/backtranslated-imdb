Wow! <br /> <br /> I was given this movie by a friend who just took Walmart at 1.98 and he felt it was taken! Not awesome, most scenes are shot in front of a green screen, the player does not have a script, it is almost improvised. Martians appear to be CGI, like they were a novice or a Fan-producing movie. <br /> <br /> For example, Martians are tortured on a scene by local women prisoners. She goes to a CGI copy of a woman in front of a green screen. The change is totally noticeable and you see a 1990 figure that looks like something in the game! <br /> <br /> If possible, be afraid of this movie. Tuberculosis! You can download two trailers from their site and see how terribly God is!
