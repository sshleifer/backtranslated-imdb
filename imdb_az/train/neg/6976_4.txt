Robert Altman's book, Edmund Naughton's McCabe, disappeared when the new curly west disappeared, but in the past he followed a very serious criticism. Along with the absolutely convincing bum-city scenario, the characters here are not of great interest, and the picture (intentionally) appears bitter and weak. Bearard Warren Beatty is a centuries-old entrepreneurial era who settled in a society that fought beyond and established the first sacrifice; After earning a profit, Beatty is provoked by city toughs who want some part of the natural move. Altman creates a spectacular, warm atmosphere for the film that gives the audience a sense of time and place, but the movement in this sad little town is limited - most of the story consists of vignettes - the Altman Pacman deliberately slows down. Certainly, a statement (in fact, in fact) and weak actors look at each other without thinking about each other. This is a painting that is self-defeating, yet, Altman-quirky way, proudly wears the defeat. ** from ****
