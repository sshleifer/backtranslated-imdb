This is perhaps one of the worst films I've ever seen. Critics say that does not bother me, it's bad. I think the problem is about the Kundera novel. This is inadequate; just as 99% of his job, ambitious and overdrawn. She seems to be surprised by her novels, though heroes seem heroic. I read many of his works (even his Socialist Realistic poetry was really terrible) - I do not understand what it is. It encourages readers to read (like self-absorbtion). In a movie, everything I did not like about Kundera was enlarged. Perhaps something missed, but I do not think so. In a side note, I do not believe it's a Scale Collection DVD. This movie is important.
