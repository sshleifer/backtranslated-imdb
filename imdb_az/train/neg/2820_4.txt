I do not know much about Tobe Hooper, or why the title is named, but maybe it did not bother. According to another commentator, there is not enough horror or eroticness to bring fans of both genres. The area is not compatible with each other, the pseudo sequence equals and the majority of the action is the same. Englund did his best with a weak material, and Zoe Trilling really has a huge bottom, but it is not enough to carry this movie. It's a tape-over. Level: F.
