This movie is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. On the first scene, I knew it would be a crashing accident. A mission begins with a seemingly evil girl who killed many nuns. As you can see, the people there were some random zombies. Yes, after a few years, some college children have some penniless poems. Terrible moves go from hostage to head injury. Things like Jock shout for him to do things in a rather non-challenging manner, and give him a bribe to react and to be "fully engaged". Completely HORRIBLE special effects with guns. For example, guns create no noise and vice versa. <br /> <br /> This is accompanied by a stop-animated zombie (why stopping movement is mysterious on the move), cheerless music and nearly 40 weapons from anywhere. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a shit. Like many others, you can rent up to 50 cents for a rental at the nearest rental car.
