If I drink little kids running around strawberries, will this really look at RUBBISH? From a kinematics point of view, this is probably one of the worst films I've ever encountered. Some angels woke up one day and I was going to shoot a movie with little girls, and I say art, I kept them in the village, and why do not they need a story or explanation or why they do not? live anywhere or have parents because there is no need for such a film. I would comment on the rest of the film, but I did not mention spoilers, so just find a good movie to avoid, avoid and watch yourself.
