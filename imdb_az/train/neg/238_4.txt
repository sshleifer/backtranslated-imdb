A Cinderella story for adults living in Dreamlin. Romanticism is not very realistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect and so on. Until the end of the Cinderella area and Witness Capour is the only reason my stars are. If you're looking for a romantic dreamer with a twist, I have to save your watch for three hours for absolutely movies, but for the rest of us. <br /> <br /> Four out of five people who have been filming with me will not recommend the movie. We have put most of the non-realistic scenes in confusion. Maybe I'm missing something .. I can not defeat a classic like HDDCS I do not believe in a movie like this!
