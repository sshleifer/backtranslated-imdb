<br /> <br /> If this were the 2008 production of the Indian Film Industry (Yash Raj), then we are afraid for a long time to reach the right standards. <br /> <br /> Going wrong with this length with a big star movie such as Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, then filming is still being studied by everyone in this movie. There are no movies in almost all departments except Cinematography and Akshay Kumar. <br /> <br /> The first scene of a car in the highlands is that there are very cheap pictures. an animated film. It was a clear indication of the director's vision. Everyone who is active in another movie is simply consumed. Anil Kapoor's good test of the English language is often tricky. <br /> <br /> After hitting himself after thinking that the SIF has signed this film <br /> <br /> In short, there are the biggest wastes from the sources after JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM. <br /> <br /> "Aaja Nachle" would have been a better movie than this one. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how and why this script is written and approved. The most unwelcome was the amazing sequence of Akshay's story of love. The worst point of the movie after its wrong bet is its music. Vichal Shahar gave only a few melodies to each song. The songs begin very well and suddenly melodies have dropped a lot. Only one song "Falak Tak Chal" is a very good thing. The use of Vicar Åžahar is an opportunity. Exemplary this example of the manufacturer's sustainability intelligence: Akshay and Seyf set out on a mountainous terrain (likely Ladakh). At the next stage, they are searching behind Haridwara on the hill in Kareena and then on Kareena. <br /> <br /> If you are able to sit by the end of the latter, it's been a long time with so unreasonable and unnecessary stunts. All the heroes who walk through the silver storm will not feel as if you are in God. Do we still see a movie with all these technical highlights in 2008? <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar, if possible, ask for the preview of the films after your first movie. came out. As an artist, you are responsible for your fans and viewers. When you first enter the scene on your first scene, people still shout for you. I do not think that such a film should be seen during the day because it blocks the reputation of the film, actor and production house.
