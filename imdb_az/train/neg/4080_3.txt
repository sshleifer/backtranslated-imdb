It looks like one of our movies, but I did not. This was a very difficult thing to be a "master". Not all flash, content. There are some beautiful scenes, and each of them is nice to watch, but it unites them all and is just a difficult job to sit. I was renting it since I was a brilliant sight on the video card and a great Shakespeare admirer, but I was very disappointed. I saw a bit ambitious and sometimes boring.
