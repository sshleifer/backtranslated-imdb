Michael Rooker is a worthy actor, but he does not favor any job, except for low-budget movies. There is not really much charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has more screen presence and, unfortunately, she is not really the main character. <br /> <br /> Danielle Harris (from Halloween 4 and 5) is playing his daughter and she is a favorite and entertaining, but she is one of the main heroes who is clever and one of her dumb errors. Comedians Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwait and Stephen Furst are an exciting role here. It's just not worth watching what these characters are. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schiavelli plays Consigliare's local Mafia Godfather and it is difficult to say that the film will not work as a comedy. Tim Thomerson is also in this movie. It appears in every low-budget direct-to-video motion movie. Thomerson is also in some budget comedies. When he saw many comedian and comedian actors in the film, it felt rude. Is a parody of a Yakuza movie? It is difficult to speak at some points. Of course, there is very little Yakuza movement. <br /> <br /> The supporting castle of Prisons and Goons is dangerous and good. Some of these films are Piggly-Wiggly's Thugs, a local comic book store or stock guys. In general, this film is very inadequate. At some points it looks like a comedy or parody. Then he works as a good movie in other points. Then it ends. Without the contributions of Danielle Harris and Ryo Ishibashi, this movie is valued by Zero in my humble thought.
