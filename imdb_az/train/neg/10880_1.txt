This is the worst movie I have ever seen and I have an appetite for very good (and good) films. Indeed, it was very funny that if you have been consistent language-in-cheek - La la ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW (only) can handle one adolescent humor. Other films, like OYTER SPACE, like PLAN NINE, are able to be funny when trying to be serious (seriously) serious. As for the player, they made young people with brain dead and asked for all their products. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. The great ghoul-busting in the motorcycle had a broad definition.
