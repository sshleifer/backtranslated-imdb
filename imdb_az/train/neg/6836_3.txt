Please do not watch this frenzy, even if you are in the worst state of the mood. <br /> <br /> I do not think anything is wrong with this movie. According to a friend's recommendation, I watched this and I covered the whole 1 hour 48 minutes of my life. Poor activity, foolish trends, weak story, and miserable movement schemes - and "dual effect" when you mix them. Even the least expectations were not met. <br /> <br /> I have learned something - never follow the movements of the Van Damma movement. They are a clean waste of time!
