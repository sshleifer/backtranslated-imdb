Incidentally, Insane 2 includes a new DVD called Satan's Black Wedding / Criminally Insane, and that's a good thing, because it's always interesting when I see a movie and later find it (especially so dark). Now I am satisfied with my curiosity and will not wait any longer. The majority of CI2 reminds CI of "flashbacks" and Ethel's dreams, fond memories. Through Proposition 13, he was released from the state of Napa (he had to see The Cramps while he was there?) And Ethel sent half a beautiful old lady, who immediately called her "old man". All of these are shot with a video camera, so the picture and sound are extremely miserable and even completed with a few "rolls". Of course, Ethel is the guy who is presenting himself and his dining person, especially one of his characteristic acts and who exhibits his dessert. Additionally, you should be surprised at the slaughterhouse with a large drawer full of rats and knives, and any half-house with rat poison under the kitchen sink. All this is an issue of "trust". There is no good reason for watching something other than interest when it comes to murder or dislikes. Sometimes why were they so troubled? 10 out of 2.
