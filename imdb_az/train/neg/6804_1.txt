This should be one of the worst films ever made. The site was as exciting as Passenger 57. But it worked better with the latter movie. The site is the worst case ever. Some of the horrible moments in the film, a flight attendant stands at the entrance of a flying 747 and tries to shut the door without interrupting 250 miles per hour? After that, the land, starting at 8,000 feet, is only a few kilometers away, and it's impossible for 747 pilots with thousands of hours of experience. When it's a bad road (of course, straight straight) it's instructed to draw wings, HUH! To maximize the speed of hypotheism, give maximum power by using the opposite of the engines on the ships! I can talk about minor mistakes in the film, but the answer will be the size of the English dictionary. This is a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!
