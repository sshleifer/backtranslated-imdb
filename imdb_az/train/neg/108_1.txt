<br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong>> <br /> Check out: In my life, I'm facing a movie with bad zombie serials. If it resembles a budget of approximately $ 20, TZC is a horrific horror film that relies on forgetful actors who can not move to save lives, and this is worse than scaring. How to get a movie like this? <br /> <br /> My last 2 kopecks: This movie was developed by a movie company called Brain Damage Films. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 out of 10 (if it were me, this movie has reached a negative level, bajillion)
