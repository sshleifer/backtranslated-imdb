I like Dewaere in Serial Noyu. His talent was trivialized at "The Waltzers" aka "Going Places". Okay, a few children who condemn the convention in the most absurd and irreversible ways; Many nations find this kind of behavior fun. It was a dull, meaningless job meant to shock. I feel confused by Blier's face, facing the camera. Sergei Noir is a reliable expression of individual liberty and aggression. After seeing Patric Dewerin sitting in an abandoned section, we will spend the next few hours. When we saw him in the "Going Places" when we watched an aging middle-aged woman with friend Depardieu, we justified her with two hours of good luck with these tracks. I must add something "3" for this disturbed job.
