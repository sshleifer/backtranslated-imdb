Now I'm going to watch movies with poor eyesight and "Hmm ... it's not that bad!" I say. I liked Cable Guy and thought that Big Fat Independent Movie was great. Keep in mind that I really did not wait for it with hope, but maybe ... maybe ... maybe ... maybe it would be a bad laugh. I was wrong. Through this "movie", I have been so close to enjoying my mood in a mild way (and I use it for a short time). To begin, Shaq sees Quentin Tarantino acting as Marlon Brando. I hate rap music, but I can say that an Amis priest would probably make a better rapper. The main character is simply annoying and not a character. In a very clear way, I would like to eat a more fatty scallion than Harleyquin's once again watching the bloody wounds of the fetus.
