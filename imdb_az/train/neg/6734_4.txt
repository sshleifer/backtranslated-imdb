I found this movie as a wonderful idea. As we have seen, they found a way to create jealousy, but they could not fulfill their payments very well. In one case, the police are in for hours to find the secret place of the kidnappers. From the tooth dentist, the dentist takes care of themselves to adapt to the dental treatment. At the same time, the kidnapper (Mason) escapes from the elevator shaft. After all, the police are also free, at least against the slightest climactic. There are also great narration scenes taken by the husband and wife of the terrorist "thinking", which does not bother adding. We know exactly their tension and noise is an insult and Hitchcock is more effective, pushing the viewer of any chance of personal experience in fear, as he has proved many times. The biggest disappointment is to sit the whole movie and get a quick, very mild ending. I want to say that only ... ends with "small".
