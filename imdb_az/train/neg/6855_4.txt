Why can not a woman be a strong character in the film without a talented man? The campaign manager in this movie wishes Tom Selliks to go to the White House. Something that you can think about. So why should he have a relationship with him on earth? He added something to this area and served to eliminate successful women. The sole value of the tidbit was "we were with your husband". <br /> <br /> Moreover, the people who filmed this film could not see the falsification of national conventions? The transition between two major political conventions served to highlight the general ignorance of the nomination and selection process.
