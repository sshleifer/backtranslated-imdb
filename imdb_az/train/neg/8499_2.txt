This is something that excites the eggheads of the movie. For all of this, Feierstein's Flex Crush, you know, is not watching anything by Real Men Truffaut. <br /> <br /> Certainly, Truffaut could have been interested in something, though. The camera-voyeur motif is nothing new. Have you forgot all about De Sica's "Cycling Thief"? Or something by Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> So, we get, like all Truffaut, an expanded metaphor for the intruder (a very small charge) that consumes 'open his eyes' in films that violate teenage class discipline, and ultimately make the public boundaries 'own film' We are sorry to be there for a very important matter.
