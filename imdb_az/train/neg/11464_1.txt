Although I claim that there is no specialist in the sea life, everyone who has a modicity of intelligence has witnessed the forced abortion of a son of a whale (and even his mother!) Who died with a hint of revenge! I want to say that really! This is basically the whole plot. When Richard Harris accepted this role, it would be extremely difficult for her to play. It's so bad that if you pay 50 cents to see it, you feel like returning your money.
