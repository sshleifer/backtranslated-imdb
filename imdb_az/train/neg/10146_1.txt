Fury Flight is worse than a shocking, but all annoying Action movie - I do not expect much from the Seagal movie, it is all about what I'm expecting to do in the middle or at the very least - unfortunately, the scenes of this Movement are very small and far, The sequence is complicated with scenes occurring in complex and large areas in a sequence - the sequence of action is really terrible - the best of which is a shocking end with Seagal and its whisper is one of the best among the 3 raters apologies - I'm close to 12 m $ 12M If this is a challenging mess you spend 12 $ 11M Seagal's salary - I doubt in some way! It's a curiosity for plain guys or gay girls that two hot shepherds end up in the invisible sex scene on another board - invisible to anywhere. <br /> <br /> <!
