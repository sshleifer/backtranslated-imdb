Michael Jackson had asked for a place for the best-selling character in GOLDEN CHILD and because he loved children. It did not work (and why should we do it?) Instead, we rescued Eddie Murphy to save the world by rescuing Kid Midas. All future writers will undoubtedly be thoroughly familiar with the actor's faith in this interesting fantasy adventure comedy. This is a step closer to ISHTAR. Murphy says good or good, but I'm not wrong about his subtle comic talent; it does not belong to this movie and went for the same DR. DOLITTLE! Combined violence and visuals are key to sealing as a religious camp classic, and Hollywood and movie fanatics have no importance as to keep cash on the man. Outstanding speakers ran freakishly during Ronald Reagan's presidency. Murphy is better at reaching AMERICA and 48 HRS, but this old movie is not golden for my sweet crunchy taste.
