A young American woman visits the Irish roots and falls on a druid witch that owns it. An interesting sounds, but after an exciting start I lost and spent most of the time. The film looks dithering in two directions - are we watching a terrifying flick about a bad witch watching Irish-American women's travails fighting the alcohol problem or returning from the past? The Director will not decide. Two do not look and you are not going anywhere at the end. This could be done very well and seemed to be dragged towards the end of the story. It was most boring and hopeless.
