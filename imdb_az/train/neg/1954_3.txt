First, let's get out of here. . . Yes, this movie plays many films called 'Darkness Falls' (2003). Something that is set up for the "Dark Waterfall" is as follows: Female Pari, a murdered woman hiding her face, kills people looking at revenge. 'The Fair Fairy' (2006), a toothbrush, opens an angry revenge for anyone who is hiding his face. <br /> <br /> So, you have to ask: why do you want to steal a full movie from a movie, why not "Darkness Falls"? I'm sure they've got a few bucks in the cash register, but a good theater experience has been given to the presentation of the film. Low budget will not have the same effect as a flat video movie. <br /> <br /> When I watched the film's opening for 15-20 minutes, my expectations really rose. It seemed to be at least SOME production cost. The story was not terrible, but it was clearly demolished. After passing the first scene, we get a good character, including a hidden old doctor (a boy called Busey) and some hot veterinarian Jennifer (Jenifer Argento's Heroist Masters: Jennifer). Only a few minutes later, the film slowly reduces drainage. <br /> <br /> This, including but not limited to, serves all the major terrifying stereotypes: a naked old man with an invisible warning, heated heartbreaker joke, psychic and stripper. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest problems of this film was that the target audience could not stay. The film prepared by the film wanted to change the tone, as well as any character that was on the screen. When the adults were on the screen, that was a much better part. When the star (stripper) and the jok are on the screen, the dialogue has become foolish, error-free, leveled. As the child came to the screen, they felt like an episode called "Fear of the Darkness". . . just little scared. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is all over the place. Visionability varies greatly to smooth stroke. Writing is, as a matter of fact, subdivided. On the plus side, there are some extreme pieces in the tracks (quite cool (still painful predictors)), a tree baking scene and a pretty bad nail scene. Also, if you're looking for some of the sexy things, there's a short topless scene (but if you want to see this puppy top, there are better movies for that). <br /> <br /> As for this movie, there is no need to worry. <br /> <br /> If you are a great fan of "Dark Waterfalls" (are these creatures?), maybe you can check it out to see the story in a different way. . . <br /> <br /> Last decision: 3/10 -AP3-
