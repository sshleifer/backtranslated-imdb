They called this movie ... Yellow women needed to paint their roots. But also the main character, geese, very tight sweaters. Giggling. Adam thought it was a good job though. I hope we will find a good 8 star Christmas movie to watch this week. Throw darts. So he had to laugh. Though there are 3 more to watch on the DVR, maybe we're lucky. Oh yeah, I thought the guy did very quickly and took the rose and then nailed it out with his cousin. I told my daughter that they were going to the cemetery. How did two gals hurt you there, spying on them? Creepy.
