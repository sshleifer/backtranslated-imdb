If you hit your head with your back, write your script with your feet, and approach the intelligence level of this movie. There are no other gangsters in this movie that do not see and do a thousand times. Those who think "Scarface" look at "Goodfellas", "Menace II Society" or "Dead Heads" or "This is my life!" He was a hero of what he thought. I love this movie. I thought the movie would give you a chance because the premise was perfect for the prequel. After seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs take part, I have to get to know better. Everyone who is superior to the 4th grade will be able to see his original work with Pacino, the true actor and his approval.
