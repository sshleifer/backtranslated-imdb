There were some truths in this film. I recall a story I mentioned about four fishermen 15-20 years ago in the water and chose not to report it until the end of the trip. I remember being accused of interfering with the corpse (or some responsibility). I'm not sure if it's in Australia. Outside Australia, we live in a country full of aggressive and serial crimes. Wolf Creek and this movie would encourage this idea. The film itself reminded me of the Simple Plan. But, as some say, it's one of the best Australian films I can not be so generous. Put it in this way, I'm watching it again.
