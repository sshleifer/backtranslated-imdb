SPOILER: Young believes he has a relationship with one of two catty girlfriends, because Jed, Spinster, Kate (Andie McDowell) is thrown out. Kate thought that they had captured the most attractive delta. Kate threw Jed's shoes off the door. Jed thoroughly goes off and then sits in the middle of the road to pull his shoes off. Then he runs off a truck ("Machine", meaning a title). <br /> <br /> "And then runs with a truck." Can you imagine a screenwriter actually presents a script with this field element? Until then, there is a comedy that is going to be sparkling, but there is no real fizz. Everyone except Jed is just dissatisfied. Then they kill Jed, and everyone's grief is up to the last one that supports each other and likes to be destructive. I give it 2 uh.
