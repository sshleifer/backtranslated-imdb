I saw this film with a very solid expectation at the Toronto Film Festival. The movie has a great cast and it should be good that it is closed in the festival, right? how wrong have I been. <br /> <br /> Well, Edison's director / writer should have some striking images of the kevin cavity that killed a homeless person, at the beginning of the film, when the director meets with an actor named Kevin Spacey (director / writer, , because her (with other actresses in the film) disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely terrible! This is a mix of each of the police's hard-boiled stereotypes. There is nothing new with Edison. The player was bad and the direction got worse. it looked like the episode mentioned above. this gave me the best shape I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Some examples of mistaken moments in Edison ... Morgan Freeman danced to his apartment without any reason for rock music and ride ... Justin Timberlake gets creative criticism from his back while covering his picture <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
