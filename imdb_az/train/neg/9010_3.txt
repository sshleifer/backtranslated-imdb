<br /> <br /> Every dough member of the dragon wants to eat, you know that you are for a bad ride. <br /> <br /> I went through very, very low expectations, read some of the other ideas and left it. <br /> <br /> Unlike some other cheap and unsuccessful films, this is not really funny (or unexpected) fun. <br /> <br /> This is very inappropriate. When considering the "minor" mistakes of the growing dragon after 3 hours, all the thoughts on him are broken. Here's what the film wants us to believe is that dragons come from outer space in the form of meteorites, really dragon eggs. After explaining them, it shows a poking throw with a peasant pitchfork and the dragon goes out. Later, the mandatory "terrible scientist" overstepped how the dinosaurs continued. Almost people were around when the dinosaurs were, or we just had a nice little pit of land. The other important thing is that the laboratory exploded with a "semi-strong" force used for Hiroshima. Then two boys walk around to check everything, and it is almost useless! There is another dragon who grows up because he knows what he knows. All of this was foreseen. After reminding the boy to clone, he predicted that a dragon would be cloned. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <When leaving aside, the second worst is "special effects". Others spoke of fake rocks, CG helicopters and dragons. It looks better than a blob, but when he was hesitant at the same time in the hall, he destroyed everything that went for him. From the very beginning, flying dragons looked ok at a distance, for their credit (although one of the caves is one of the worst movies in the whole movie.) But funny to watch these things. The scenes of the same million different shooting encountered by the same person in different ways are not shown. <br /> <br /> As for actresses, they were not great, but at least they tried? They have, for example, been more attractive than most actors participating in the latest BloodRayne, and you need to give them points. Although a Meredith woman often had her face covered with makeup, there was something that distinguishes her from the rest of her tones. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> <span though I also have bad CG effects just funny things). Also, do not waste your time and money.
