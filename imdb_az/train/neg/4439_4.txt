Yikes. This is pretty bad. The start of the game is not great, and the decision to transfer it to the film is useless - especially Peploe decides not to decide how to behave with the theatrical roots of the material (we observe a theatrical audience, etc.) and decide to create a shot in the form of a recollection In fact, it only serves to remind that a film maker is watching a very bad movie by the filmmaker with his outfit. The central performance of Mira Sorvino is breathing and weak: the scene and the liar, as part of Helena Bonham-Carter's merchant philosopher. Only Fiona Shaw presents a performance of a note - and it may be that her pedigree pedigree can handle well with that material - but it's hard to track a performance for a movie, though it's a lightweight, accurate and whole show. Ben Kingsley turns average and running, and Diana Rigg's daughter, Rachel Stirling, plays only her role. Unfortunately, none of Bertolucci's magic has come out with his wife to prove this movie.
