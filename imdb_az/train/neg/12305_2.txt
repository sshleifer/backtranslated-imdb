I watched this movie at WTN because the television was a channel directed to me when I opened it. Corey Sevier's is a very reliable and enough boring story about a minister's spouse (Alexandra Paul) who is lying with a young workshop / drifter (washing abs). There may or may not be a field. Corey lashes her shirt somewhere and Alexandra swoons. It seems to me that he did not have any good, and he was confused with the skinny Alexandra Paul. This is not really important because I was telling her that she had taken a lot of shirts and just split some of my spark. There are many fakes in the soundtrack, it's just painful.
