Even the hottest stooge fans will not look like a movie (one of them), no material to work with stooges. This is really a shame, because it's the only art movie you've ever done with Stuoges Curly, and this effort is painless when it can have a great potential. Terrific musical pieces are no help at all. The shorter laughter they make with the same title is more.
