This song is shaking in my head. It's not the biggest song, 80's. This is about a lead singer killed while accusing her of killing her girlfriend, who is singing a backup vocal on her band. The lead singer Whli's name, Billy's "Eye" (yeah, right), died two years later and his band returned only for the concert, this time leading singer. Billy shouts at him and eventually kills all these people, raises his daughter, and tries to mislead people around him and think things wrong. Finally, he decides to go to a martyrdom and decides to dig a grave to see if he is still there. He sees the dead, still sees and hears his voice. At the end of the film, we know the reason behind that, Billy had a brother named John (again) and John admitted his brother was jealous, and assassinated his brother on his brother to kill and take away all these people, and then took his lover and called him horrified scared. The end is very striking, and the player is very smart and wood. But .... I love it anyway. I'm watching for the song. I wish I could.
