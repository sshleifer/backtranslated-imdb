I have nothing to comment on this movie. I have to make the first comment on IMDb's website to help some watchers spend some time and make something more interesting, instead of watching this "movie" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I also need to write at least 10 lines of text , I also have a low-budget movie, bad player, no name actor, worm and so on .. Both the story is made in the style of 80's special effects, which does not bring anything new. <br /> <br /> The film is as bad as the movie Megalodon. <br /> <br /> So, have fun! ;) (not watching this movie)
