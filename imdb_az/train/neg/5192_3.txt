Code Name: Diamond Head did not do this on network schedules. Television pilots do not pass the credits before it becomes clear how bad the film will be. Perhaps I had left something because the territory did not give much meaning. According to what I have come out of a mess, something called terrorist or thief or "tree" (Ian McShane) goes to Hawaii to steal something with a secret weapon. The world's most terrible secret agent, Johnny Paul (Roy Thinnes), went out to stop him. It could have been more, but did you trust me? <br /> <br /> Action movies should work. Moment of thirst should be stopped. And dramatic moments should be drama. Code name: None of the Diamond Head. Did I see the word "turgid" used to describe someone else's TV snoozer? and I can be better than any word description. None of the heroes are a little exciting and worthless. And Roy Thinnes is the worst guide imaginable. Its cr√®che is slightly slaby northern part. Ian McShane is the best thing for a movie to come easily, but, unfortunately, it does not seem to be a regular actor because everyone is involved. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> If Quinn Martin is involved, it will double. More funny things than Mike and Bots. I can only give the movie 3/10, I get the # 4/5 stage # 608 in the MST3K rating table.
