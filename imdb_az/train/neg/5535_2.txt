I think the biggest failure can be anything. Bad, really good drilling. This thing does not breathe. Cambodia is an interesting fact. Nearly 30 American films were filmed in Cambodia. However, the conflict is a bit difficult to understand. The movement of soldiers is such a bit confusing. It's a story of love that drags the cause. I did not know why these two men were completely in the shade. I thought it would continue to use its Zombies (as they do) and forget about it all. The film is just spreading. The perfect microcosm is the place where one of the main principles is a Cambodian priest who is in the water so that hieroglyphics (or everything else) can reach the secret place, explaining how to turn people into zombies. I thought I would never stay there. A man takes two steps. He stops. Looks around. The other man hides behind some columns. It takes two steps. He stops. Looks around. Another guy hides behind some bushes. This is a brief film. There is a strange and immoral dialogue after that. As for the B demons, I really have a very patient attitude. This does not happen. By the way, a better title would be Hypnotized Revolt.
