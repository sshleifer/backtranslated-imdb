Millie is a handle. She is married to a wealthy boy named Maitland and has one child. She then cheats her and divorces her ... but she keeps the child who claims to love her. In the early 1930's, he would have the right to support the spouse and the child, but the boy's amazingly easy release ... without any support ... what a sap! Later, when a man looks pretty good on his wife and his life, he goes out to be a cheating! <br /> <br /> Millie changes as a result of this bad relationship. Now she is a wild party girl - she does everything she can and she is afraid of her failure. More than a year has passed. At the age of 17, Millie's daughter, who left early in the film, did not change a little bit of strange fashion. Millie's old friend (yes, another bad guy!) Now she acts like a girlfriend, but there are stunning designs on her. Millie promised him that if he touched the girl he would kill her. Finally, guess what happens! <br /> <br /> In general, the film is a mess and often a strange turmoil - a bit but little attention, like Madame X. So, Millie's motive and actions are very small. And in the film there is a little bit of everything - everyone understands that it is a pig. It is unusual, but not particularly good.
