<br /> <br /> I love Fulci movies, but I'm not really looking at some dull ironic methods, but I find that most of them are not hopeless and boring. <br /> <br /> Fethullah Fulci's epic fantasy is genre and does not really succeed. Structured, like most Fulci movies you see. Some things happen, some are more and sometimes a scene can be encrypted. <br /> <br /> Of course, no bunch of Conan, no scripts, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is not a tough actor), no budget, stupid looking dog soldiers and a bunch of soldiers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
