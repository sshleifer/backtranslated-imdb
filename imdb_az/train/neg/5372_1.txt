It's a great thing to see why this picture is not for nothing: if it's not funny, the assassination is absolutely unusual, and it's impossible for the heroes to be completely dark and understandable, as the heroes (the young, versus the experienced loner) are quite predictable. it must be a masochistic inclination, the idea is exactly to understand exactly what the book is reading), and that the action is bad. Was it a basic idea to show that French filmmakers can also make Americans in the genre like "Seven" and "Lamb Sounds"? If so, this is a general failure. Although he succeeded (and the first French murderer has a religious status as a killer film) and appears to be a good product to export. It's strange.
