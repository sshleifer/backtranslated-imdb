Despite the original touches, such as "virtual gangs" that provide the background of the island's interior, reflecting Island Lovelace and its circle, this film is short and generally disappointing. When Francesca Faridany appears to be talented, but with a mid-film, Lady Evans wastes like Emmy, a character that is reduced to something else, looking at a moni-watching monitor. When 'Lady Ada' (Tilda Swinton) appears, 'build the island' lasts for a short time; <br /> <br /> Emily's longing for his "virtual" look, his facial expression inside the camera, his behavior, and even making him incompetent or invisible. <br /> <br /> Ada Lovelace's plain biopic, unfortunately, puts the life of Lady Ada, as well as a modern computer scientist (and his extravagant, doll-comrade).
