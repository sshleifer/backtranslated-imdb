If you want to see a movie about two absolutely non-sympathetic characters, this is one. The player is as strangely paranoid as his best friend, John Cassavetes, as he says, is actually going to go and rescues Peter Falk. It's a big mistake, but since it's both ruthless shooters and unhappy cats, it's hard to decide who's rooting for us. Only the writer / director Elaine May could have this association. I thought it was interesting that in a long interview with DVD producer Michael Hausman, he said that the two stars were "very different ideas" about the script, the director was not allowed to work, the photographer did not create the unusual requirements created by him, and the crew waited constantly angry and so on. This mood of many large unemployed families is clear on the screen.
