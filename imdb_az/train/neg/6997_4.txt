I was watching it with a feeling of drowning. Why, in the form of Iman Hunter, God encourages these people to flee from Devils Island? What was he doing first? That is, I know God's mysterious way, but I help thieves, murderers, and prostitutes to find help in rescue, forgiveness, and change in this courageous place ... Anyway, this is a very unpleasant movie. Despite the fact that Gable is attractive, there is nothing in this portrait of a completely unhappy man, Crawford is nothing more than me, and the whole view of the film seems to have been compared to mysterious films such as "Stagecoach" and "Mr Deeds Goes to City" prehistoric.
