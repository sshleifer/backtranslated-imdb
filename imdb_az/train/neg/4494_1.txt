*** ALLEGATIONS *** *** ALLEGATIONS *** Continue ... <br /> <br /> Here, the whole movie collapsed. First, we are ghosts, vampires, and pigeons, and we will look like that. We take a man in a slums talking to endless trashmen, there are two "ghosts" and a bunch of flyers that do not serve any real purpose and have no character. <br /> <br /> Some people have told me that I am a vampire (they are straight from Blade 2), but they are not as clear as they are. <br /> <br /> Oracle, a strange name with a pretty name, is just remote and far from bad. He has a simple point about the cause and effect, doing it, and then continues to do so and weakens it and starts to stupefy. The last line before going to Storm's "X-Men" can be compared to "honey" you can tell what happens with a calf ... at honest baddness levels. <br /> <br /> Therefore, after fighting a few kung fu, chocolate cake is such a lazy, miserable click and Monica Bellucci. WHY? Neo is allegedly one. He can do everything. He has the power of last, and why he uses it. Kung bloody fu every time. And if you can stop 1000 bullets, he still cuts with a sword and still has 5 undecipherable henchmen (vampire?) One meal. I wanted to see the powers of mind blowing. I wanted to see the wildest, most vulgar and most treacherous people ever to do everything possible. <br /> <br /> The car follows the car. This can not be bad. Well ... no, no. This will only be. All the cool pictures coming from this scene are on the trailer. Everyone. So, maybe Wow was bought from us, so we now have a good chase sequence, guess what a kung fu fight is! Okay, not Neo, but you would think that Matrix would tell the closest friends about the truth. At least he taught them something. <br /> <br /> "Hey, Morfey, do not worry about what happens to you in the matrix, it's not real, and nothing can hurt you after you understand that nothing is real." <br /> <br /> You are going there. Simple. <br /> <br /> OK, that's why it's not bad. It never takes and does not look like 16 minutes. This is very important. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> They have this plan that covers three groups. Later, only Morpheus shows a long, mid-afternoon prayers and monologues. To further worsen, the team does not clearly define the plan that the team needs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> I need to summarize it, so Trinity has to go to Matrix to build the latter can come back. This is the only reason. What is the question, why was it necessary to send 6 people to the start? Trinity is in itself within five minutes! <br /> <br /> Neon's going to the center of Matrix is ​​so sinister. Ooohhh !!! Another 100 Agent Runs on Smiths! Woooooo !!! This should be very thought out. Only now are in a corridor, so there is no scale of war, and it ends for a moment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Combine double, this is really the horror of the architect. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he has only one reasonable potential. <br /> <br /> He blows him! <br /> <br /> Consider Neo's options. Choose a door and all humanity dies (except 27!). Kill others and all humanity! Given the choice, this movie tries to explore her, but does not really give her hero. If he has the option of rescuing humanity and killing mission or rescuing mission and killing humanity, there is potency for internal suffering and tension. Also, falling in the middle of Trinity, the potential of a real cliffhanger who sees the third as necessary. But no. <br /> <br /> Now, the worst thing about the original Matrix is ​​that Neo dies and eventually returns to the right. Year after year, everyone was frustrated by how stupid Jar Jar's Matrix was, to a great extent, noticed that it had appeared to Steven Hawking. "Oracle told me to fall in love with someone and I love you" .... Come On! <br /> <br /> So, what should Wachowski's subsequently do? Well, they make the original look better. How? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify; Cliffhanger is not really a slacker, it's a reminder. <br /> <br /> This film is just bad, and I really did not want to be bad, This is not a movie that is not a budget enough to worsen matters, it's not a movie that's a short program, it's not a movie we've run out of, but it's not a movie that's much worse than Wachowski's Warner <br /> <br /> Matrix Reloaded: The worst movie ever created? Maybe not too much. <br /> <br /> <strong> The biggest dreams of impotence
