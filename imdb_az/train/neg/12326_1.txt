A woman (Sylvia Kristel) pushes a 15-year-old boy (Eric Brown). <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> Does anyone give this movie a light on child abuse? I suppose it could be a teenage boy - if there was a guy who deceived a teenage girl, it would be just wrong. Forgive, but forgive a boy for doing this. Still illness. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <STRONG> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Braun, <br /> <br /> I returned this driver in 1981. I was 19 and my 14-year-old brother (who can easily pass the age of 18). He wanted to see it - I did not, but what did I decide? We went in and got a ticket for three teenage boys who were really missing. My cousin thought that the drill and the other three kids were half gone! Give me this clarification - three TEENAGE BOYS, a movie with the nakedness of women! This should give an idea of ​​how bad it is. I was surprised that this was never released. A 1 whole way.
