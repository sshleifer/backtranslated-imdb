Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) goes to Tibet and pushes him enough to be a werewolf. She was accidentally murdered after she was attacked by her deceitful spouse and lover, and later, a female scientist who used theoretical oversight experiments. Renewed by Ilona Erman. Daninski later finds an underground shelter that is settled on the stranger issues in the doctor's unsuccessful experiences. <br /> <br /> After Nashi's death, I heard from his colleague, John Kitley, that I was gathered for a movie to watch. In my darkness, I found a copy of the Wolfman's Anger, not three copies. The film has suspicious video quality, sound is generally dubbed, and cinematography is sometimes a kind of slapstick. And in American versions, two love scenes were removed. <br /> <br /> This film claims that Wolves are Count Waldemar Daninsky fourth in a long series. I doubt that this is true, but you do not know the film itself. The field is sometimes confusing and there is no indication that this is the next one. <br /> <br /> If you read articles about Wikipedia and compare them with what they wrote in the box, you see that I'm not alone in my confusion. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you understand the shortcomings of the film are from Hell. It was released in 1973 because of difficulties in finding a single distributor, all year round. And Naski said in his biography, director Zabalza was inadequate alcohol and hated to work with him. This is not really a lighter charge and I did not know what Zabalza meant by his own name. Luck, sooner or later, you will find a low-level version of Fury. These three packages and boxes of Wolfman appear to be different, so they do not accidentally come and even know. What really needs to happen is the unshared version of America, a decent sound and video mix, and scenes of lovers. As far as I know it is not. Praise Paul Nashi's legacy and convey his films to a wide audience at decent quality level.
