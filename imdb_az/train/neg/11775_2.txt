When I was watching "Kroko", I'd like to shoot a movie for the first time in my life. I do not recommend watching this movie: plain mother characters - do not grow completely, e.g. Kroko remains a metaphor for a metaphorical German problem without a posi- tive chance of being able to positively re- Initiative actors, non-progressive structures. In my opinion, the film tried to conduct environmental research, but failed - it was shaken by the camera's motivation. The images were low contrast, gray, and dark - but I'm sure, but the components did not add the convincing impression of the social environment. Although the story had some potential, it could have done a good short story.
