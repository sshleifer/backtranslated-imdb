Wow, this movie is not just a "new lesson in real bad taste", but also a lesson in a "real bad film." Do not misunderstand me, I highly appreciate the 'Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence' concept, but also should be implemented when you're afraid of a movie. If you miss the story, 'Zombie 90' ​​is a government aircraft carrying toxic chemicals. It turns locals who start to collapse to enter the desert, causing the destruction of chemicals into awesome zombies. The next thing you know is zombie eating people living in all cities in the city, while the doctor and government agent try to understand these people's eating disorders - the name "Extreme Pestilence". Since then, all the zombies we have had at one local meeting have one field day - extreme and complicated clogging and fragmentation, accompanied by endless bark and intestines. Since this is a German movie, the movie should be dubbed into English and the noise at zombies' nervousness is very fun and entertaining. As the user has noted in the UnratedX, * SPOILER * * SPOILER * * SPOILER * has a scene in between which can be accepted and disapproved in the movie, so a woman with a baby carries a wheelchair, with a few people around the wheelchair and the zombies the troops are nowhere to be attacked and attacked. As you hear a zombie crying baby's body, the baby breaks down and breaks down. Wow, this REALLLLLLLLLY is a new lesson in bad taste. Panic, I betray you.
