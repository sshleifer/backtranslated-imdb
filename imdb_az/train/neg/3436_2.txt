A girl falls into the shower without knowing that a serial attacker sees the earth. Detective Martin Manners and Orville Stone are hot on his footsteps, but after killing him, they are not as warm as they find him after the rape and eats the girl's floor. I hope this will be the end of the movie. Not because it's so terrifying, but the level of acting is extremely embarrassing. Unfortunately, this is not the end, and months later, raped by the rapist satanists, Coven, as a zombie. So, he goes to the place where he left, and again with his detectives, this time also a baby flying in (asking). Very good low-budget movies have been made (Street Trash and Filthy McNasty spring wit), but this barrel digs. <br /> <br /> My price: F <br /> Eye cream: Theresa Bestul becomes nude! Anne R. Keys is without a ball
