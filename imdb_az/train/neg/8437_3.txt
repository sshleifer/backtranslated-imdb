Since David Mamet is a great admirer of his films and works, I was expecting great things from this movie, especially in his first film, House of House, with Joe Mantegna. Instead, I was disturbed by the lack of credibility and credibility of the film. Racist accusations did not bear any sense or sense behind me, hoping no racial pressure would ever prevail. Identity is completely reassessed and men become "heroes" for a specific reason. Due to the wrath of the police, the character of the leadership refuses to perform any relatively small action that can not harm anyone and maybe save lives, and still performs a very severe and very illegal act, but then still refuses to act. Additionally, an incredible subpot that covers a person who kills a family is presented only for a space point advertised with skywriting and the police's response to this event prolongs the credibility of all reasonable limitations. Of course, after waiting for David Mamet to excite another excitement, I was extremely disappointed to say the least. From 10 to 3.
