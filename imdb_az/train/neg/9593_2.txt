The story is simple and straightforward (though prologue seems to be complicated). Take three interest groups: 1) government 2) rebels 3) a group of conspirators. <br /> <br /> Now let's get the first (they never appear in the movie). Then only one conspiracy, the prince, a revenge trip letting you be a mischief. Add interest to a rebellious love with a guilty conscience. <br /> <br /> But they still did not share a story or movie. Some of the casual activity sequences and some strange visions are trying to be a Sci-Fi low budget, leaving you feeling emptiness. <br /> <br /> <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
