I refer to Oedpius Rex, because this is a tragedy! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films I've ever seen! I do not like any UVE Boll hater ever like a lot of humorless people on IMDb! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll films such as Post and Tunnel Rats are hilarious and therefore fun. But honestly, this movie was just terrible. I hated it so much that if I take it, I can give it a zero degree. That's the story! The film is about five-fifths of the movie, and then they have grizzly mean, which is terrifying tasteless murder scenes! Finally, it ends with a totally acceptable "villan-winning finish," but surely it can be more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> I'm not against Uwe Boll (as I said before) and I'm not against fierce movies! I love f ** king's violent movies! I liked Saw movies, Hostel movies, New York Ripper, Tokyo Gore Police, New York Ripper, Twenty-One Soldiers, Bloody Valentine, Left Last House, Guard, Wolf Creek, every Tarantino movie, every Sam Peckinpahi Cannibal ** king Holocaust! But that's it! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> It was simply tyrannical, sadistic and devious! And watch the movies you just read! If I love Cannibal Holocaust, and this is not it, it should be bad! Uwe, do not go into darkness again! You are funny, like Ed Wood, when you are light hearted. It was just a terrible experience! <br /> <br /> In some cases, since today, ALL AFFILIATED FINANCES !!!!!
