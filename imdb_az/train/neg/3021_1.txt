Tony Scott has never been a very good manager, but every movie that Crimson Tide has made is one step closer to doing the worst job today (Michael Bay may fall into the same category, but at least some of the major, moody, levels of fun). Like other Hollywood biopics (such as "De-Lovely" and "Confessions of Dangerous Minds"), similar to those of similar, overrated, or open-tailed passwords, the juicy backstage details, "Domino," are a film that starts with little potential and sixty minutes before reaching the infinitesimal amount. The 128-minute movie is twice as long and can be compared to the legendary surface and unforgettable when spending the characters (unlike Scene Guides, Skotone's Domino's strangeness, while recognizing herself, the rich girl noise is just the film's baled cluelessness attracts attention) can only be an actor who can find masochists. Story? Spoiled-up-bark-babe Domino Harvey (a neat ersatz-badass performance like Keira Knightley, his beautiful appearance) Los Angeles Rich and Famous Lifestyle Sick and Gruff Bounty Hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez learn more exciting trading; along the way, there are double lanes, laughter, media attention (the tone of Christopher Walken, the language of the trade mark), and laughable tips in romance. Scott combines the film for more than a few seconds, cranking resolution to create an obviously unpleasant film to watch the movie - if Scott Scott is distracted by an image, admiration, or misunderstanding; but all this sticky stylistic overload film has little plot, characterization and overwhelms of recession (say nothing to its value, ehm, "fun" value). Most cartoons are either unusual or stereotypical, and get a "tail" of our hero's coin until the end (see an unobtrusive, several-minute segment that presents a new list of African-American "Jerry Springer" categories) . "Domino" is a complete, weak rubbish - everyone interested in this interest, Scott hoped to inspire his viewers, and lost a few minutes of migraine in the neon sea.
