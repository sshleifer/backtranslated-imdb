Like many people, I've seen this movie in the theater for the first time at 97. The best "movie" was below, hopelessly not a "masterpiece", but all these "Titanic" fans like to do so. First, DiCaprio is a terrific player, despite how you look. People love it because of its appearance. His "abilities" are actually trying to say a lot of cheesy lines and behave in a sexual way. Secondly, the film itself was a very dull and simple event: the girl is in love with the boy, the ship is at home, and more unhappy love scenes. Everyone who owns more than 50 IQ will understand that it is not mastered in any way. What's not original. Moreover, the director needed to drag it 3+ hours. I can put a 1 hour block without losing any area. In the end, the "Titanic" is the most strange film ever. Why pay much attention and money?
