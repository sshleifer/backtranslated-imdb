Okay, let's start it, it will come as a surprise to anyone who reads other comments. As you know, MY G-D, THIS MOVIE HERE! I mean, WOW, I did something clear and I did not know that it was possible to make more money than it was worse than any Roger Corman movie! Corman has probably shot this movie in a movie, but due to the poor quality of the scenario! The only reason for this film's first appearance was that someone said, "Hey, zombies are famous, video games are popular, what can zombies play in? Resident Evil? No, someone else is in the first place Silent Hill? No, very silent. They do not have to sit in any dark room to fear ... Hey, is there a game that Sega has around a shooting zombie? <br /> <br /> Generally, they have done their best to shoot a movie, which is felt as a game, and they even fought in the battlefield. <br /> <br /> First and foremost problem is original game is terrible, I want to say that two-week and then-shippe d-out-and-bought-by-morons-bad- a-bad-game-for-merchandising-and-for-their-parents-christmas disaster.The graphics were boring, the monsters were bored, the levels were boring, the interference was boring, CASE missed In other words, it was a boring game, and it was ARCADE version, the home version was worse! With the homeless version, when you get stupid with this foolish game, you never even took a shotgun! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> HUH ??? Did the editor not have enough confidence to show that an effective struggle was in progress? Do not assume that ANY fight was shot in a video game that could explain the tough use of Matrix-style effects. The problem with this is that the game is the first person shooter (the player comes from the character POV). Maybe to tell you that it belongs to the game because they put the game graph ... Right, no matter ... <br /> Anyway, it likes AN EXPERIENCE remotely <br /> <br /> Everyone in the nature of the movie has a high level adolescents, so suddenly they fit into hysterical laughter and general unbelief, and did not go to take me. <br /> Do not see this movie! Do not rent it when it's in the video for a few weeks. Run. Just try it.
