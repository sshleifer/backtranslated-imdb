Well ....... Unlike other previously written comments, I have to say that the only good thing about this film is a bit like the truth about Jason Donavon, who remembers my youth. I could not win any awards and had no idea, but I am sure that the last result is the beginning of foreign soap operas in the early 90s. The site was non-existent, cinematography was desperate and the player was equal to one level of performance. Unfortunately, the long and the sub-fields were pretty unreal .... for example .... your best friend, if you had been sleeping with your 6 year old friend two years later, all of you are the best friends. It was all fantasy. All this! Oh yeah, and strange 90 home / soft key indie mind mind!
