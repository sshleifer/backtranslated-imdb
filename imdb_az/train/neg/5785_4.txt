VAMPIRES <br /> <br /> At least ratio: 1.85: 1 Sound format: Mono <br /> <br /> An isolated country where an motorist (Murray Brown) lives, two a beautiful young woman (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and freely sexually lifelike, but her homeowners become a vampire with a strange lust for human blood ... <br /> <br /> Started by the French-based maverick director, Jean Rollin, Jose Ramon Larraz's courageous shocker Vampire, reinforced by the success of Carmilla, slammed the concept of Horror more than the English censorship of British censors. In 1974, the film was cut shortly after about three minutes of original English freedom. Why it's hard to see! Larraz (who writes "D. Daubeney"), using the Gothic theme as an excuse for excessive nudity, sex, and bloodshed as a short-term movie, uses these commercial elements as a background for honest thinking. <br /> <br /> Harry Wahmmann's angered cinematography at a picturesque country house in the autumn of 1973 causes an exciting atmosphere, life, death, and impulses - sexually and otherwise. in the same area - a place where the Armenians lived and in a beautifully equitable manner - a hurricane of anticipated horror (Larraz also pulled a low-voltage tension in the same period of the previous year, at the same time with SYMPTOMS, which led to anger in the final). However, despite the fact that VAMPYRES's wafer-thin area and roughly attractive production values ​​divide the audience from the start, and although the two female characters are characteristic and attractive as talent, Brown plays a few extraordinary twentysomething stereotypes. Vampires are an entertaining curio for everyone, a sophisticated item for fans of cult film, a taste acquired. Watch for a short community at the end of the quiet-period superstar Bessie Love movie.
