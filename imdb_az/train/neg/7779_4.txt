The "real" story of a late monster that appears when an American industrial plant starts polluting water. Amusing is, though not really good, there are many people who are trying to get monster movie monster and continue whats, but by the way completely involved. For some scenes, give a point to give a giant monster clearly set up for measurement, but take it to some point where it looks like a dangerous dog. Enjoyment is an unpleasant thing in the mind of the mind. (One complaint is like a copy of a well-worn video that took place 20 years ago in the Elvira version, which is poor.)
