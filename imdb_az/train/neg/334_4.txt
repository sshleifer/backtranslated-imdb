Sure movie Such a ridiculous fantasy with very unusual special effects, very haste scenes (eg airport) and true unfunny times. (Charles Dance) is terrible as a bad man and he is better than the Last Hero. (Eddie Murphy) is a non-fun joke, and I've heard that this western success is a great success! Why and how do I not understand? In a television interview with a candidate nominated for Oscar 2007, I heard (Eddie Murphy), regretfully in a comfy way! <br /> <br /> It was not one of the comments (Hey ... 1980s!). Yes, no friend. Whether it's 1980s or 1950s, all this is kinematic foolishness that attracts many RAZZIE movies! <br /> <br /> There are two reasons I wrote about this movie. First, if bad guys just wear blue shirts, attack their home, and especially betray their bare feet, this should never be forgotten about long-term acquaintances in the bedroom (Charlotte Lewis). But how strange! I watched him in the following movies and was not that beautiful again? !! In any case, the second reason I've seen this movie is in the top 100 movies! <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Bad movie, Greeeeeat legs.
