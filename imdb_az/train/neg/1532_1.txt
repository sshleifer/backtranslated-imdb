Even though I have been warned, I actually sat down to watch this movie. Because I usually give it a shot every single movie and do not think of a movie being bad. I'm done. Even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick, or Ben Stein could not save this turkey as a ton of bricks. Once in the humor I canceled a runaway transvestite. That is the scene at Simon's time. The other jokes are either poorly realized or just plain unfunny. And you see some miles away. This movie is just what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III) or Scary Movie. All of this is most important to A funny gags, B. good dialogue and all C. unforgettable quotes. Men in D. D. have not found any of the above. It would be a bad thing to call this movie bad. THIS FILM YOU CAN! Protect yourself!
