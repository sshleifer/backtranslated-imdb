I have 2 entertainment shops in my house, and in my time I saw very bad movies, but it was so bad that I was forced to register and comment on it here. How bad was it? Let's say that Sofia Coppola is credited with Oscar for his performance at Godfather III compared to Giada Colagrande in this film. <br /> <br /> It was robotic and thirsty. His lover died a month before he came to the 'Rubber House'. Once there, he found out that he was deceived over his relationship, but none of them will be registered with him. Within a day, he contacted Leslie, (Dafoe) the guard of the house. <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> Even though Dafoy was evicted, his scenes were cold and unhappy with her. <br /> <br /> If you have a plot, I missed it. Even Willem Dafoe could not save this movie from amateur, cinematic train crash.
