This movie worked with good intentions and a good story. The director and screenwriter of this movie failed and drew a dull, boring movie that I felt as I was returning to the 8th grade Social Studies class of Mr. Hartford, No. 67. <br /> <br /> If each scene had potential, then we had some stereotypes and merged with black. and white footage from the historical channel to show the strike. It's shame. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was just a brilliant light on this mixed fest. The other player was pretty boring - tells the good movie that the Captain has set a new standard to deliver the line. However, if you're ready to accept all of these many flaws, the movie is awkward to be awed or entertaining, but if you want to learn about USS Mason, you need a watch.
