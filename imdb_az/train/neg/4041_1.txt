Like a hair shirt. Positive, absolutely no doubt, one of the worst films ever. Pure torture. Zero stars from him. Long after each other, tiring, hardworking, ambitious, unique, theater and advanced art scene. Inspired spirit to be dream-and-impressionist. <br /> <br /> Half-naked, whispered to each other like father and son, grope and lovers. "Homo erotic" is a high and open point. Okay, what is it? <br /> <br /> His son repeatedly repeated, "From the life of saints", "The love of the Father is crucified." In parallel with God and His Son, here everything is heavy, disadvantageous, and bombastic. <br /> <br /> Some references to Russia's territorial integrity include: "Mother and Son" (1997); "Return" (Andrey Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Father and Son"; and, of course, Dostoevsky, "Brothers Garamazov". <br /> <br /> Ingilisdəki loans, international distribution implies that the apology can not be an excuse for you to understand that there should be Russian. <br /> <br /> Sokurov's last, or "Russkij Ark" (2003), has no or no attractive place. <br /> <br /> Like mom and son, it's equally strong, some scenes are drawn from entertaining mirrors but not interesting. The film is almost monochromatic, from head to toe through beige filters and dramatically condemns its vision. <br /> <br /> Silent noise adds to the drug just like that. The old radio constantly plays in the background. The Russian romantic melancholy is inflated infinitely like "Tchaikovsky themes". A "sound design" s (Sergei Moscow) Participation of course, little voices, radio static, noise, distortion, and all who are sensitive to it, "intended" means. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to believe that someone wrote (Sergei Potepolov) the truth. <br /> <br /> The modern art finally was able to point out things without having to do anything, so the idea is that we saw the idea as an empty shell, but a shell, not just the idea of ​​a shell. Can the call appeal to a better definition?
