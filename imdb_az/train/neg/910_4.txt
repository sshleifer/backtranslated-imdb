The storyline was very straightforward and easy to watch and contained only a comedy that was just a bit dull. Some audiences have found it funny, but I love the more clever humor. <br /> <br /> The film had several well-known Swedish actors and their performance was worthy of taking into account the scenario. Lena Endre was always good. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the original movie because I can not say that it is better or worse. <br /> If SÃ¤llskapsresan is worth watching this movie.
