Although I am a well-trained filmmaker, I'm not limited to movies that fend off these borders, and often love and love movies that violate the rules. True, the director violates the film rules set by Pasolini. <br /> <br /> Pozoline's not able to work, but it's actually less of a matter than what's on the screen. shooting of films and film breakthroughs are less artistic choice than amateur cinema results. This is DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use non-actors and, while many directors came to a remarkable conclusion, under Pasolyn's leadership, non-actors remain non-actors. This applies to DECAMERON. Pasolini often contains images designed to shock, humiliate, or otherwise shake the audience. Such elements can often be used with an astonishing effect, but in the hands of Pasolini, these elements are rarely seen as something contributing to the film. This is true for DECAMERON. <br /> <br /> I was given to understand that there are many people who love Pasolini's films. I have never even met such a thing, and I have not started to read anything about Pasolini or his works. I'm talking about his work alone, but I'm not an "offense", but rather an amateur guide, who has not chosen enough skills and was applauded by the brilliance of his day. "existential brave," justifying it in bad habits, just like filming. I find her job tiresome, unimpressive and ambitious. This is also true for DECAMERON. And, unfortunately, every film of Pasolini has been my dissatisfaction for this endurance.
