For a good half an hour or so, I remember thinking myself: "Hey, that's Bill Reba's best achievement!". Opening sequence is atmospheric, there are some moments of frustration to enjoy instantly, and our director even expresses his indifferent stinker "The Spider Spider Invasion." The concept was stolen from William Castle's "home at Haunted Hill". Three old and extremely bored millionaires burned 9 victims in a shelter isolated to win $ 1,000,000 in an elimination game. Naturally, the participants have often and without losing each other, and the rest of the boneheads often take the time before the old folk are Sadists or that there is another killing between them. The film begins with an unfinished storyteller, and it is not a very interesting and even interesting thing, but it's a trivial thing to admire the first ten minutes, and it's really amazing to watch the bumbo (Shelly,) not funny. After half an hour, it becomes naturally inevitable, and the "Cold" classes transform the Rebane-producing ponds, the most terrible dialogues and, in general, the lack of excitement. There were no budgets for bloody murder sequences, but our talented director (?) Tries to compensate for the discoveries of the dance girls and the amateur rock band. There are four or even five different summits in the film, and none of them is a bit unhappy. Maybe it was an inspiration for LOTR: The Return of the King? Avoid this movie, be longer and happier.
