Some time ago I heard about a movie from a friend and recently found it on the DVD. We also had a lot of excitement and excitement that we heard this terrible movie really scary. How disappointed? MANY!!!! In addition, a scene (we all know) did not happen !!! <br /> <br /> I wanted to see women several times in the dark, and we should do some more shooting scenes that appear in the window or walk around the hall or something. </ STRONG> This is a fright, a flash, an atmosphere movie. I just did not see that I was scared. <br /> <br /> Perhaps in the United States there is a difference between what people are afraid of here. <br /> <br />
