I am one of the millions of Columbo addicts all around the world, and I'm just talking about the episode that started on the English Channel 5. It's interesting to think of what's being used so much, and I'm just surprised to see all the little touches that see the massive potential of Columbo and have such a beautiful and classic array. What's more, this movie is not as good as the rest of it (except for the embarrassing recent episode and patronizing English episode). If Columbo was originally designed as a "pilot," it will certainly not last for a long time, or will be watched and disliked worldwide. In this film Lt Columbo is a well-dressed, normal car, has a partner, does not talk about his relatives, and comes as a pretty aggressive one. There is no cat-mouse chemistry between Columbo and the "cane". It's fine, but for the novelty of seeing how Columbo started.
