This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not too exhausted, I told the guy to take the shelves from Blockbuster. The only thing that is interesting about this movie box. In the box I say "Boogeyman's Director", so I thought ... Well, if it's done recently, I'm sure that management will not be at least bad. film, and "bogeyman", some nonsense since the early 1980s. <br /> <br /> I think his wife is very fond of the name "Zodiac Killer" and is worried about investigating any Zodiac killings or MOs. Years in which he is active. All the crimes they are talking about have nothing to do with Zodiac, and "stories" about the original zodiac happen several years after the actual Burch's murder. They also compare Zodiac to the film "Dusseldorf's Vampire" by Fritz Haarman and often talk to Fritz's "son". Zodiac and Haarman have nothing to do with it and it's more important to compare it with the BTK. He is the one who kills people and does not kill people by chewing their necks. None of the Haarman facts are correct, but only a few nonsense. His son says, "Do not forget that his name was Fritz Haarman 2 t" ... His true name is just one! I think the writer / director has written a google search for simple killings and was Burch Killer and Fritz Haarman shortly. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, my favorite inconsistency in this film is that of professionals as well as young people. The killer suffers from DSM-IV and treats it. "I've also diagnosed DSM-IV and recovered," and so on. For those who do not know, DSM-IV is a psychological sign. If someone suffers from the book, then there must be some serious problems! Haha. <br /> <br /> Anyway, in my opinion, this is always the bottom of my list of 5 worst movies and it's rare that a movie has reached this point. But if you are interested in watching a story that is not accurate about the simple killers, full of inexperienced actors and not completely clever, check out this movie. <br /> Oh, and I liked how many victims of the killer were "tearful". Beautiful touch ...
