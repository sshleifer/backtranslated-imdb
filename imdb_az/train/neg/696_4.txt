Well, it's not a good slasher flick. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film there are three deaths in a close sequence, which is a good scene that seems to be the arrival of something. In addition, there are many characters around, browsing, not understanding what's happening, or following red biscuits; kill more time than people. There are other deaths, and the killer is not an equal killer, it does not apply to anyone. The murderer also wants to create other people to kill innocent people. <br /> <br /> The conversation is related to Christmas, but this is not the main factor. One scene is lit by Christmas lights, which is due to it. <br /> <br /> At least the film is dark with a muddy picture on the video camera I look at. Some of the dialogians have lost a bit of part of the opening scenes. He had to be stronger than the last. We think we know what's going on, though there is another chance.
