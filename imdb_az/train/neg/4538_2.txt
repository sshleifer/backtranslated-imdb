I actually went to see this movie in a theater, but when and how the money was gone! <br /> <br /> Some of my comrades told me that they were watching this movie and watching the book's author, James Redford. The scenario is very heavy. They really enjoyed the book, so the movie should be just perfect. Perhaps my expectations were somewhat high, but I was totally hated by this movie! It was unexpected, it was very sweet to a point I really missed, and I had vomiting and it would be all over again! Give the world a blessing, and stop treachery.
