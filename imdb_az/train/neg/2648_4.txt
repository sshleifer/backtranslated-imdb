I read Anita Loos's work and saw MacDonald's photo of the TCM Magazine magazine in the angel suit, so I thought I would watch this movie. I had never heard of any movie before, so I had no preconceived ideas about anything. I know Eddy thinks he's thinking of a good start as a player and a MacDonald. The scene in the suit of the sexy angel suit was a really pleasing event with the ongoing halo and wings. It was like Eddy going to bed and imagining a real angel. But after a while, it just started to fall for me. Eddy remains "asleep" for all part of the film, so all sleep. Whatever it is, it's not really important because it's just a dream. The rest of this is pretty much unimportant. I had to be firm. And the last issue that MacDonald's music number would go to for music was a mad hallucination. <br /> <br /> Eddy "woke up quickly" and the original story continued or really married an angel I think it would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there were not enough music numbers to call his music. The first few songs were good, but the number of jitterbug MacDonald's was like a nail on a cartoon. It is absolutely wrong for its operative voice. Eddy and MacDonald are still able to shine by showing the real stars.
