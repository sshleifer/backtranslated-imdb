Not all the Laurel & Hardy classic films, though, I saw most. I have always used it, even after funny foolishness. This new movie tries to bring back classics with two new players like Laurel & Hardy, but for a variety of reasons, it's a pity. Some of them (sometimes at the beginning of the 20th century) are depicted in the 90's, even though they are covered by their cover. Some of the old dialogue has been brought back, but this did not happen at the same time to approach the classic series. This movie could have been the worst movie I've ever seen, and she pulled out of the shelf and locked it forever. Real Laurel & Hardy, in such a bad imitation, make grandiose yarn in his grave.
