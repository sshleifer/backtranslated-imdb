Now I've hired this movie because Brad Dourif was there. He is a beautiful actor in everything, except for the movie, BRILLIANT. And I think that this film was so foolish and did not do a good job. This movie is an unusual comedy. Some lines denied me. And there are some lines that do not make sense, and it seems like throwing lines just like Tobe Hooper without thinking about the scheme. Oh! BTW's area is BAD! But this is one of TAHT BAD's films, which is really hard to watch. I suggest it only for the fans of BIG Brad Dourif or one of the other actors because the terrain is miserable.
