What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> Disney should be desperate for revenues <br /> <br /> Especially now they say they lost contract with pixar. <br /> <br /> Actually, only the editor's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unlike LK I & II, both had a powerful story line. <br /> <br /> There is no story in this movie. Although characters and animations are always fun to look at, there's simply not enough material for a movie. <br /> <br /> <strong > We must make time and effort and put on a continuous job.
