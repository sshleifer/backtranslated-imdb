It was about 30 years old and I hate everyone involved in this film. <br /> <br /> From now on, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Before I see this, I have never thought of Divers, no way or other. <br /> <br /> When I see this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally see it on television. <br /> <br /> I'm drifting about it - my peer pressure against a better decision. But when leaving the theater, those friends swore that he would never regulate my choice. About thirty years later, we are still moving from this film to mental traces. <br /> <br /> One of my cats is a time when I hope this film will be better. <br /> <br /> If you are given a choice, you prefer to sit in your eyes even if you are in this movie. <br /> <br /> I just registered for IMDb comments. maybe I can tell others about this movie. If only one person can overcome this, my existence in this land will be justified.
