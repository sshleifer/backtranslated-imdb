I initially gave this episode two degrees - now I thought more about it. I would also like to have negative assessment options. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to watch him, how bad he was all the way from start to finish. I love Ron Pearl and John Carpenter ... so what's wrong? The 13th episode of last season was settled by solving the problem of abortion. I think that this season, Mr. Carpenter was able to create a gray area that he does not know whether his choice or antidote is immediate. After just sitting down, I realized that he was a great deal of abortion, when the mother's "grandfather" shot and killed the baby and ended the horrors of "Ata", you understand it very well, and when it's gone, it's ghostly. But when you look at the character of Ron P., you see it - if someone thinks he's being threatened enough to threaten himself in the past, I'll tell him he will not be called to the police immediately. . Instead, we look at ourselves sympathetically, but I do not agree with anyone who has a strong vision, but if I do not agree with it <br /> <br /> However, as the political issues go beyond this episode is weak, was. The music was retro-70 and was not straightened up. The player (except for Ron P.) was poor. <br /> <br /> All these are said to be very pleasing to them, because they should not display a monster, rather than an excuse. There are Heroes Masters - I'm sitting in some really bad episodes to find the ones that are good. It's a bit of a hassle to rent horror movies from the video store - you win every now and for the better, and you value it all. I agree with the poster that the name has to be changed from the Masters - some of these guys are not corrected. (I want to emphasize that I hate this episode, John Carpenter is completely titled, he is a master and thru)
