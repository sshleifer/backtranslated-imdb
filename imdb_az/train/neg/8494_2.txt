Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, history of computers, and so on. When I was expecting to combine scifi and the era of the films, it was an illogical psevdoscience and a confusion of real and spectacular history, talking about movies. The writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) impresses that he does not have any realistic understanding of mathematics, technology, or history, which is the subject of the film, but instead uses fuzzy artistic impressions. For a long time, I have a painful place because I have long been irritating the origin of art and transferring scientific terminology and ideas to the point of confusion, for example: Emmy Coer: "Half of Information Waves Is Life" Island: "Surely half life is better than no life." <br /> <br /> This film is worse than in entertainment - it's also wrong. The only thing I can imagine is that the viewer can draw on the subject so distorted. Perhaps, I know better than science and technology, which is not a distinguishing feature of any magic.
