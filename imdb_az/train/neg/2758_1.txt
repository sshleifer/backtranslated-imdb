Because this is not a negative number in the IMDb rating system, I give this movie 1. This movie was terrible. It was very bad, the story was poor, the move was incredible. Even the Liberation Army, I doubt that soldiers can fight as weakly as in this film. You can not even spoiler the movie because the movie is not good enough. It would be meaningless to write comments to the site. If I compare this movie, I should compare it with the Athenian rule, but even though I did not like the Athenian rule, this movie was at least as good as it was. <br /> <br /> Some films were released before the end of the movie. I just did not think it was not because I did not. I hope the CGI is a feast and heartfelt struggle, but what is not happening. Martial arts lasted all 30 seconds, and it was exciting for a workout during a flash-back scene. CGI is also not good. A scene comes to mind. In one of the previous tank battles, soldiers do not shoot at anywhere. Someone forgot to turn to animated children on this bit of film because the street was completely deprived of the bad guys. I think the sound of a bad man with Mumy's Imotep's voice. It would be the same unique echo. <br /> <br /> According to some sources, I have several times. <br /> <br /> Behold, I will tell you about the battlefield, that it is a spoiler. , or do not buy a DVD when it's gone. You have been warned.
