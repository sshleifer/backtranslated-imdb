This movie is so bad that I can not even begin to describe it. What's in the pit burning with a writer, producer, and director? How did they get funding for this disgust on earth? The scene is funny, the best moving, story ... Which story? <br /> <br /> The first fight in this movie is good, but then repeats itself until it wants to extinguish it. <br /> <br /> I think this is the biggest weakness because you have not missed this fool movie after the first minute. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> I've given it from 10 to 1 because it offers the lowest IMDb. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a blessing: Look at the movie Uwe Boll ... twice ... more worth your time.
