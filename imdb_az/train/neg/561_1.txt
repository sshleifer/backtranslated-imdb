Here, I saw this movie yesterday and, unfortunately, is worse than what you think. First of all, there is no sense in assassination. The scenario is deliberately filled with funny dialogues. The audience laughed many times. And the suspense is very low. Players play such a good moment, except Sharon Stone, with some of the most fierce moments. The most sexy parts tell you something like an aggressive sex and say "I'm calling you" and it looks like it's a gentle way to say that she is a very mature, very sad and sexy woman. Erotic pressure from BI1 has completely disappeared. From the technical point of the Basic Instinct 2, a mediocre film is better than typical direct DVD, but better than the original film. For example, crazy joyride scene is badly executed. The main Instinct 2 director is Paul Verhoeven and shows. The new composer is Jerry Goldsmith and his show. The scenario is realized by people who are not suitable for Joe Eszterhas. There is no replacement for Michael Douglas. The film is often corrected cheaply and badly. I'm sorry, but after leaving the theater, my first thought was, "Why did we skip this movie to the sky in advance and with the original talent behind the success of the first film?" Compared to Citizen Kane for all of the original film. The first major instinct was classic and was a kind break-thru in popular movies. This provocation was sexual and controversial. His career had the best performance of Sharon Stone. This was the style of Paul Verhoev√©. Unfortunately, Basic Instinct 2 is a funny movie, which has been awarded the Razzie Award directly to many categories, poorly directed. Unfortunately, they created this movie.
