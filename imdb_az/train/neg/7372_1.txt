I'm very confused. For 25 years I've been a great Seagal fan. I saw all his films and many of them. I can only portray this movie as "strange". Steven Seagal writes and credits credits in this film, but it's a really challenging time that he chooses to sound more than his own voice for his own lines. What I did not get, if they did not refute some of their lines, why would their voices appear in the rest of the line? Seagal waits for us as long as we are. But in this film, Seagal has shown us the same film in all of his previous films, leaks the same strangeness, confidence, bravado, gravity and sex. The thing I saw most losing myself was a self-assured, self-confident attitude and an evil donkey that easily passed into this tempting heart. What is your in-face attitude and charm that you create such a great star? Hopefully, this film is an indication of what Seagal has to offer us - if not for the lifetime, fans will not accept that we know and love Seagal.
