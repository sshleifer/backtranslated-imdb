Where to start. The film started very well, but after 30 minutes, I kept track of myself. <br /> <br /> The horror at the start of the film was good, but then the story had begun. <br /> <br /> The actors performed on average in this movie, <br /> <br /> Dragged as it took the movie and took my words for me. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** I came up with monsters looking for skeletons in movies, just for the ultimate people, there is no sense to just eat fatal. Some meat has turned out to be a religion of religion, and good guys eventually die. In fact, this laugh just laughed at me. <br /> <br /> <strong> After the past, Vinni Jones becomes the new killer talking about his role. <br /> <br /> The film was the best film creep crew. I gave it a 1 star as a woman did a pretty good job, but she could not save the train crash of this movie!
