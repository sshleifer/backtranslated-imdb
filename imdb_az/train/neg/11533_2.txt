If the deranged and predictable aggression is intriguing, then you are in a rare condition ... They do not really appeal to me, so I could not find anything to save this amazement. As it seems flat since the 1980s, this is a different age when it goes straight to a video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer work with a weak article and elegant scenario. Gillian Anderson was engaged in such a film after last year's Bleak House's shouting as Lady Deadlock in BBC TV adaptation? While the director's testimonies of a recent rape and his work on documentary films have been expressed, it is not an excuse for a strange scene where a pack of bush shrubs defeats Dyer. I'm laughing at cinema, I do not think I'm the only person. FilmFour and Verve Pictures companies are the companies behind this movie that I can not understand. Both are taking part in some of the great independent English films in recent years. Verve's Distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Path - Straightheads are not worthy to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve note: is this really the best? How do you feel about the independent British artists? There is a big blot for both of these influences. Listen carefully: Thousands of independent English filmmakers have heard of desperation?
