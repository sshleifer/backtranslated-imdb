Oh, man, how low the series has fallen by the year 1952! This dull thing was a series that disturbed Annie Wilkes (from Misery). Only heroes were not in the previous chapter (and probably will not be there), not to escape the cages - baddies jumped in the episode in 7 episodes, but jumping characters), but I think this series has a World Reklama Rekoru. I want to say that the majority of scenes! And not just another series (all the flying sequences come from the King of the Rocket Man, and the cool "roaring rocks" of the 2nd episode, Captain Marvel's adventures), but not for himself! At Episode 1, episode 8 repeats the entire "moon" (the shortest period, 30 seconds long and the invisible characters who do not leave the Earth atmosphere) at least repeat! And the episode is all the scenes from 10 previous episodes! <br /> <br /> Why did MST3K never see the 10, 11, and 12th episodes? <br /> <br /> Do not take me to the science factor. Prepare to see the sunny moon! And moonmates who can not breathe in their own world? What did they smoke? <br /> <br /> And if this is not enough, talk and talk about stunts (usually the best thing in the series) is less and far. Sighting, I'm thinking that the Commando Cody's bullet-shaped (or lemon-shaped) helmet is absolutely funny-looking? How bad the Rocketeer's movie was (and the man was terrified), it was a refrigerator. A vehicle like a tank is better, a group of kids prepared for Halloween. The only positive thing that can be said about it is that the actress playing the hero is not a usual muscle (hey, everyone has the right to be a hero!), But then not so strange ... <br /> <br /> Even watching for Nostalgia not necessary. Instead of Captain Marvel. 2/10. <br /> <br /> (See the Commemorative Quotes section for BTW, Real Women Lib Pearl).
