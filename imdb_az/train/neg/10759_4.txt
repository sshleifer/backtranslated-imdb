Despite the perfect future design tones, smart Asimov's premiere and Will Smith's reliable performance, this movie is not up to expectations. Clich√©s are bold and fast coming; (a wake-up from a recurring nightmare, a maverick police officer has a badge canceled by the lieutenant, and can be deprived of more than one mile away). This movie is on the stage - you do not feel you are traveling anywhere; What is supposed to be a global disaster, CGI does not explicitly leave Chicago. Robots are good in the near future, but the "crowd" scenes look worse than Disney - CGI has been repeated. And if you can destroy the robots, why do you need to shoot 'Nanos'? You know, these terrifying questions are a duff movie when you start to worry about climbing. It could have been great, but it could have come from any action movie that has been in the past forty years, which is less than the sum of its parts, according to the predictable area.
