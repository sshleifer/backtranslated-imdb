As Jean Arturou loved Satan and Miss Jones, my interest reached the summit, and I thought I was sitting on this second string of inquiry about the death of a jockey, but I did not finish it. Arthur, a crazy, film-magazine fashion, or his old friend, William Powell, or other spouse in need of alimony, but I did not feel for him because the character is simply a sign of insanity (he's funny, once inside the morgue - like all the 30-member comedians - she is faints). William Powell says that he spent a lot of time with Miss Arthur but could never do that from the last result; looking at each other in the same way as they stand, hesitant of their misery. The actor playing Powell's valet is frustrating and delays in the audience's laughs are pregnant.
