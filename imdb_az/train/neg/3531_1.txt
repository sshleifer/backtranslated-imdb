This movie will now compare all other movies ... like, "Was it stupid as Revolver?" Last night, I became a spectator to the Toronto International Film Festival with an hour-long scattering in a room filled with more than 2,000 people, and then a silent silence. If Jason Stratham had only one purpose, that would be nice. In the first 10 minutes, Andre 3000 and Big Pussy (Soprano's Fame) have been offered, and this is no SENSE ALL! Then there are some shots and then Ray Liotta has embarrassing bikini linen, then Ray Liotta's bare cover, a lot of shooting, toothpickers, art house, and more animation than the embarrassing body that creates a laugh at each show of Liotta there is. I'm not absolutely convinced that it was a response ... not five times. In this film everyone thinks it is more intelligent than the average bear, and Guy Ritchie thinks Yogi Bear is incarnate. The story lines could have gone anywhere, but the posture was an outsider! The only way that this film could be even worse is inside Madonna.
