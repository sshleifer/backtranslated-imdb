For my job, I had to watch the movie, so I did not pay (on the contrary, I paid), but I still found it to suit the average of the movie. These jokes were two leading actresses ... well, to use the "first ladies club" section in Hollywood, not in their "hot chick", but in the "district lawyer" age. The most irritating thing about the film is Beavis & Butthead Do America (it is expected that her boyfriend will be murdered on a grandson who offers money to "spouse"). In general, a soft twisted piece.
