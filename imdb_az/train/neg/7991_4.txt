Colorful story with the story of the Numbers and some original color - and a really nice and deeply felt few minutes. <br /> <br /> Efficiently captures the delicate passage of a girl's adult life and is very sensitive and inventive with the experience of parenthood through cultural confrontation. Unfortunately, this microbes of a good film are worthy of attention, such as religious confrontation, road construction project, the life of the second and third degree, a mysterious man in the woods, a group of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, intricacies local church politics, and ten and later. All of this is not included in the true center of the hopes, dreams, and dreams of the two daughters (and their families) at the turning point of life. <br /> <br /> I was really shocked when I realized that everything would not happen during the summer! (and many films were made in 1.5 hours!) <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie is melodramatic, the point is predicted, events take place and are forgotten after about 10 minutes ... and some of these events are extremely weak. It is a shocking fact that many characters are involved in a horrible crime (completely predictable "twist") and then completely closed and that the whole event is never forgotten. Similarly, a secondary character is only used to die a few minutes and to provide another "curve". All of them are completely mechanic, close all idle tips properly (all this is not good, the film thinks you are interested).
