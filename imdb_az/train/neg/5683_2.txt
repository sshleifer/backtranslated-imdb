From the start of the film, I felt like I was filming another Jason on Friday 13th. And this is ... The debate about the film's interest. But it's just a silent, supernatural, silent serial killer, with only a trivial movie. That is, he entered the bed without a silent voice seen by any man. He had to be blind after he had failed, but he wandered and killed the men he used as a man. I'm tired of this. There is the same thing for me. <br /> <br /> In other words - it is not true. Many errors and embarrassing information. <br /> <br /> The woman who appeared on stage was surprised, but for the first time:} For this and for an exciting intro 2 stars.
