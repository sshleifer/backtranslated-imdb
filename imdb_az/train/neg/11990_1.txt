I wish I could give this movie a zero. Cheese effects and action. The only reason you can see this movie is that it's so bad. Start with a kid playing Brian. What a geek! I could not believe in kefalana! Then he talked to himself. I do not know, though, that they are still silent. Of course, I had to force her to swallow her, not something I did not see. But Jared has done a great deal of performance compared to the special effects department. From the bear to the accident, everything could have been mine and something better. I suspect that Gary Paulsen is something related to the production, because the movie is not called Hatchet. Finally, I do not think that the writer did not read a book because it was nothing. I think the book is big, but this movie drowned as a scent goat!
