<br /> <br /> This film will not help because the saints can protect us. <br /> <br /> Tell Mel Gibson to be the one who has access to it and tell her that Beowulf needs a loyalty. <br /> <br /> We have two versions of Beowulf in recent days (since 2000). First, why the story has so much interest? Secondly, why do these filmmakers take these shit signals? <br /> <br /> Two reasons for this were just Lambert's (Beowulf 2000) version and worse than 1. <br /> <br /> Even worse, some people will follow this and get wrong ideas about poetry. How can a industry of Peter Jackson get into the film with literature? Almost an example of the Roman Forum for Heorot. <br /> <br /> Do you have horns on helmets? Connect me. This is an insult. <br /> <br /> Hjm
