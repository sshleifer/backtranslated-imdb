<br /> <br /> The special effects of this movie, especially in timely, funny and so terrible, are used. <br /> <br /> This move is a "terrible stump" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film can be found in two things First of all, Karel's "Lurch" Struycken's perfect fallout mysterious psychic Gaunt can make people feel where and when they are dead and always there. The original finds, the SF-West union is obviously original, if terrible, but other findings are more original, like the armed Zack Stone, who can feel the pain of the people he has suffered (even if his player is short). <br /> Overal ... Do not just watch this movie, except for any self-respecting Dutch, if you love this oh-o-brutal Carel Struycken.
