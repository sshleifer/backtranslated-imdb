As a native film professor, I can say that this is perhaps one of the worst films I've ever had with Native content I've looked at. I would like to have a root canal rather than seeing this movie again. The use of stereotyping, attractive attempts to use traditional coyote stories and poorer camera work has only deteriorated by the glib desertive storyline and bad script. The writer and director have demonstrated the worst part of the colonial approach to describe indigenous peoples and societies. When this person is indigenous, they must go home and apologize to everyone they know to become German, for the indigenous racism and the sense of humor they have developed. If this person is non-native, they will seriously revise their white privileges and ask them if they have not been questioned, demonstrated indecent racism, or intentionally ignorant. My only hope is that local actors in this movie had a good time and at least paid for their efforts. If you want to see good Native movies then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Round Me Dara, Medical River, PowWow Road, Smoke Signs ... put a few names.
