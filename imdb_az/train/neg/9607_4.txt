Do not list the misleading name "Werewolf". Europeans are well-known for their fears of sexually and nudity for their actual fears, but here's little. The "Werewolf" looks like a mixed sex scene with a major actor and brutally kills her supporters. The first few times it's fun, but it's more than one hundred minutes to monotonous. Shes is not even a werewolf, a schizo chick hung in his father lycanthropy. The film was not the first time a ten-minute horror of horror (I thought I was a garbage classifier) ​​and could not decide its tone as a poorly-researched research that was repeatedly harassed and tortured. a rebound triller. Finally, according to the director, it is based on a true story. <br /> <br /> To be fair, production has some fun features. The name is a wardrobe female guard and has several beautiful gore effects and naked scenes. However, they soon become monotonous. In addition, the dubbed dialogue is very pleasant in camp fashion, especially the most respected doctor in the world (he drank). Unfortunately, the movie is quite uncomfortable. There is no real trick or anything else. His shame is that he has a description of what the film feels as a real potential. "Werewolf" is far too slow, slow, and slightly more meaningless than the standards of the exploit genre. (4/10)
