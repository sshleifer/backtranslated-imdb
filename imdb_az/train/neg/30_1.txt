Since 1987, I did not like the idea of ​​a woman turtle, and I had four brothers, together with her brothers and their enemies, and all four of Leonardo, Michelangleo, Rafel and Donatello had no sense here, or an important part and I believe the old TMNT series is newer than Venus. The story of a female turtle will not add us a story In 1987, we know that every part of the TMNT has a good point in being a new enemy, but a female turtle is a very weak point to move, we want to see more of the new TMNT series 1987- the characters we know without this turtle.
