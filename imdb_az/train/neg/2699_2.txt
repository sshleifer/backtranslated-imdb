I have not read an IMDb commentary on this movie, which reminds me that the Jewish character jumped up like a weapon and was shot by a racist skinhead <br /> <br /> Do not know that everyone can accept it as a balanced account of university life can. <br /> <br /> Universities should be regarded as lacking tolerance tie, and would fit their title when Singleton did not convert its characters to such vast cartoons. <br /> <br /> On the surface, she was encouraged to take Remy as a racist skinhead, as a bad man of the Ice Cube. But who ends the epilogue at the end of the film? Singleton showed me black as he could not sympathize with his black brothers or he could not forgive me (Or I said!) Or he could only keep track of a racist skinhead. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> What's the point of honesty?
