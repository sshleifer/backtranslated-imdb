Peter Bogdanovich is said to be a personal film. He relied on his life, but changed the things that were in accordance with the detective symbols. These detectives present beautiful models and have no problem getting them. A millionaire sounds more like a detective like a playboy director, is not it? All this film is written by Peter and shows how he deals with true people. You must write what you know and really did it. And the audience is boring, mixed and jealous about it. Dorothy Stratten is a curio for those who want to see people killed after filming. However, Patti Hanson, who wants to marry Keith Richards in real life, was a Stratten model but better and has a wider range. In fact, part of Stratten seemed to be forced; added. There is not much to begin with, the beginning is quite complicated. In general, every character in this movie is one of Manhattan's millions, but it can be related to very few people. For the rest, this is a irritating cocktail festival. It happens when you touch it. You will entertain some friends with jokes and have fun with all the rest.
