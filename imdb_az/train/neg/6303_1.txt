There was great hope for this film. I thought the premise was interesting. I fought with him, but I did not mention Helena Bonham Carter. When I split, I was thinking about spending, but at the end I wondered why she was bothering me. Perhaps there is a message worth delivering in the version of George Orwell. If this film achieved something, it inspired me to read Orwell's classic. It is difficult to believe that his tale can be as disappointing as this adaptation. The film's author would say goodbye to the message, "Secular life is worth living." I do not recommend this movie to anybody; My 101-minute life was wasted.
