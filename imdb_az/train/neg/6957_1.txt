Avoid this suddenly if you do not want to watch an expensive but bad movie. Sample? The sound is good but the dialogue is not clear - it is the main sin in a French cinema. <br /> <br /> This film attempts to combine western, drug intrigue and director costume epic. Yes? Yes, think about it. During the sword battles, cowboy music is striking. Or in the underwear of the woman, holding the knife and how to bed up and down? <br /> <br /> Someone should do this on the bomb "What's Tiger Lily". Writing a script or dub or tool writing. Heck, it's almost now. (BTW, Jerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet are also known to the American audience).
