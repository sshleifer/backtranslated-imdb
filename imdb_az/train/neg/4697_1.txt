Okay, I saw the hidden preview of this stupid movie. First and foremost, the film is filmed and is not real, it all comes to an end. They can not read. They are full of themselves. Its terrible. Yes, children are between 8 and 10 but it's really stupid. I said that their manager is a child. And there's a fake note tag. His foolishness. Do not see him. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad when it comes to establishing and managing it. It's a beloved documentary but writes something stupid. <br /> <br /> If you do not love only good music, you see it. Also, it is very fragile. Not even tasteful. I hate being so meaningful ... but this is really a shimmering piece.
