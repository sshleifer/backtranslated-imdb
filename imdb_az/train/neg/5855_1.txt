At the beginning of 2000, with two disasters in conjunction with MELA, the film opened a thousand years with such a hoax. <br /> <br /> The movie is suitable for 70 but looks like an unusual comedy for 2000. Some classic stones from any movie: Paresh Rawal I do not understand how to laugh as her roles or crying Cause: When she grasps the mystery of Anil's mother, she keeps her secret in my stomach, remember my childhood, my teacher said the same joke Urrf! <br /> <br /> Unlike some movies, many are similar to each other. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> very young in the old role and yet very good effort Rekha is enough, Raveena is a very good Harish evil Shakti Kapoor is a terrible Aruna Irani as Rajnikant is a cabbage
