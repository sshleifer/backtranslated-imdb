I'm not sure what movies HK is watching for other reviewers, but into the Eagles is nowhere in the Hatchback. Michael should be glad that "Fitz" Wong can get a job at HK because he could not get out of an old English paper bag. Shannon Lee is a good-looking and fantastic fighter (better than his foe who fights more than his father), but his toy skills are also subtle. In fact, all English dialogues (90% of the film's Gen-Y Cops) went to the Mandarin sound for me, just the lack of bad dialogue and the weakness of the English subs. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are some good gunfights (but we've never seen anything) and good cinematography, but cheesy visual effects really spoil the action. <br /> <br /> This is Shannon and Benny's "The Jet", in Urquidea. <br /> <br /> Finally, you'll see some scenes that appear to you "familiar", like shooting in the open market (Matrix I think) and Fitz Divers. comes from a helicopter with black chests (MI: 2). We think that at least one thought in this frenzy.
