If she wants to be true, she should have chosen a Frisco native, not a NY actor who knows nothing about Sucka Free (Sucker Free). I lived in SF all my life, and people here do not talk or act on the actors. Everything was dramatized and the only cats I saw from the Gulf was JT Bigga Figga, a small rapper, a rapper. It was the only shock in the film, really like cats (really his Warriors shirt) suits. Anyone wearing no Giants or 9ers gear did not feel; Instead, he has provided some of the stunning SF or Oakland shirts that are not sold here. Black and Asian conductors do not wear headphones or bandwidths in African or Chinese Olympic teams, every Chinese gangster can not wear a Yao Ming shirt and does not try to black on the rails. Additionally, although it is now an important yuppie community that invaded the Mission, all the demonstrators were white dude and self-proclaimed "100% West Coast Boriqua". This is not New York! Porto Ricans is very small here, and the Latin in Egypt is very different from ONE here, who is undoubtedly NY. Also, HP is not the only black neighborhood in the city. A realistic illustration of the HP kits with their headlines, Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview, and so on. He would have exhibited a drama. <br /> <br /> It was a better story to work with homework when it was better for Lee to do more than this movie.
