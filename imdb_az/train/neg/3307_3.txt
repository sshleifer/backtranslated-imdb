Random music is a concern, such as open, hackneyed melodies, which are popping up to comment on the story suddenly (eg, "Soul Spirit", for example - Oh, I get it!)

I can listen to people in the High Times magazine, which takes their jollies out of the great "buds" throwing these words out. Wrong scene? Easy.
