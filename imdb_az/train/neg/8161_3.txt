<br /> <br /> Mary Lou, when he comes to his fiery resurrection in 1957, his spirit is a prostitute who wants to revenge. <br /> <br /> Yes, the film takes place in 1986. Film 80 is a strange trap <br /> <br /> In any case, Mary Lou is doing bad things for people and tries to seize someone's body. <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is basically boring and stands around many invaluable characters. This is not really a sustainable one, but the only one with the first partner. Aug beats the horror, the back, the gore, the nonsensical nonsense, the Catholic Church. Some things are boring movies. <br /> <br /> The player is worth enough to give 3 out of 10.
