I do not really get the rating for Amati Girls and I really think it was actually giving out from 10 to 4. Otherwise, a little more than a fairy story with a decent cast of actors could be a common fiction what my eyes have. There are many stereotypes in this snap, the hair of women is just scary, and most of the scenes are inaccurate or fake. There is no real passion in this film, but a painful actor is acting on any restrictive limit. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, it's really fake-to-touch, so it's not just good in my eyes. I could not believe what I was watching doing to my TV in my living room in Switzerland. But maybe it was still good and lost in translation? Who knows. Surely, it's one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, and of course, not in a good way! Sorry.
