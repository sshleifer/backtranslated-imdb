There was potential. I've seen Creep and thought 'Oooh, it gets exciting' several times. But in some ways interesting plot lines are unclear or unseen, unexpected. The character of the lead was annoying throughout the film, and at one point my lawyer shouted that he wanted to kill him. There are some really terrifying moments, but they are very afraid of me when they are caught in hell. <br /> <br /> This is nothing but a horrible movie that endures and intrigues for some time, but ultimately creates dissatisfaction with the way film artists are trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> This is a saving grace film is a bad guy, but when baddie is more unpleasant than what is happening, you know when you are losing one.
