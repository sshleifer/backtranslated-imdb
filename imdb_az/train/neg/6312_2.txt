Over the past 20 years, most English films have reported on how terrible poverty has been to the UK while living in England's central streets and how our young people have a good chance of living. The British film industry faced the idea of ​​"broken British". Bullet Boy is another British movie added to this list. The main character expresses his desire to go straight, but still carries a weapon and depends on dead shoots that fight the network members on nothing. I would never assume that you want to go straight out because nothing is stopping study or trading. In fact, it would have been a pure breath when it was flat and had a life-changing character. Instead, it is time to help a friend who wants to be a relative. At the beginning of the film, when one family was picked up by a pseudonym, there was no feeling of sympathy, because at the beginning of the film I liked the whole family and the desire to succeed. I believe that manufacturers have missed a great chance to show those who want to succeed (like the happiness in the world). <br /> <br /> The purpose of this film was to capture and draw a life-style for black young people living in the UK's working classroom, but we do not have enough movies in the UK. With the same structure? <br /> <br /> These talented producers and writers give something to aspire to the British youth and to give them a better life. I welcome the creators of Bullet Boy to avoid filming the full movie, but in order to succeed in shocking events (such as Kidulthood, Football Factory) and to combat the maladaptation to succeed at the same time, this movie is an effective, does not offer anything new to a long list. There is no happy end to this movie or to the others I have mentioned.
