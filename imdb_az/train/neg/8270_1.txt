In the non-existent area, the weaker / super-cheese tones (Snipers / world-famous dogs who can not even shoot targets a few feet) plus tons? - Many law enforcement agencies vandalizing carnival shooting gallery, WTH?), Technical mistakes (how many bullets can you fit into a glock magazine? 100+? These people can fire your weapons without reloading them). <br /> <br /> This movie is so dirty that even though Hollywood's great actor Michael Biehn (Foreigners, terminator) can not keep up with this big problem. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie (I realized that this is a precious life). Hopefully, the director will either stop filming or learn more about the next movie.
