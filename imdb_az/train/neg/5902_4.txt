I was expecting the movie to be completely dumb. Any kind of entertainment without such an expectation would be a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> The conversation was the best part of the film, but it was fun to enjoy the nonsmoking in single rooms. <br /> <br /> Besides, there are many things about The Singles Ward. The whole movie was dubbed poorly and watched the whispers when listening to their voices. <br /> <br /> This film will work well with Mormondom, especially in college communities living in a single team. However, as the conclusion is, there is no hope for those who are not marrying. (Only girls in Singles Ward get married, greedy, ugly ones do it all.) Finally, we realized that the whole movie was advertised for LDSSingles.com.
