This film is not just written and directed in a poor way, it's just a bad thing. A beautiful novel is very poorly presented in this film. Certainly, the story line has been altered to make time frames. But the results are simply confusing. For the player's behavior, the scenario that eliminates the motives of the characters can not be captured. Everyone, when Esteban applies to Esteban as ESteban, is not translated into English. Terrible. Please read the beautiful novel as much as possible in Spanish. MAKE THIS FILM. What will be a wonderful experience will destroy you.
