If there was anything worrying me to see a bad movie, it was seen by experienced filmmakers who need to know better. The "re-imagine" of the Planet of the Monkeys could use some of the notion to say nothing of the key elements of the character development. Nova, the girl on Apes's original Planet, was in this version a better-developed character than Daena because she did not say a single word. <br /> <br /> For this reason, Tim Burton, this art should be something better than a man with an incredible imagination. <br /> <br /> All of them were inevitably different from this production. <br /> Development of the area. The first big mistake made it possible for people to talk. The main difference between these monkeys and men was that all the differences in the original film were silent, but Heston Taylor spoke differently than other people. In the current film, Mark Wahlberg (speaking) encourages human slaves rebuilding, but there is no good reason for them not to let their liberty ever end. They have the ability to communicate effectively with users and to create plans that can not silence people. No human need is needed to get rid of the stars to save them. Indeed, it comes from a technological culture and is a disadvantage of Wahlberg, not for the people who live there, because it has found itself in the technological era without any gadget to help. <br /> <br /> Helena was working hard to make Bonham Carter himself and Marc Wahlberg, one of those unanswered brick walls. His best scenes were with foreign Tim Roth. <br /> <br /> People did not really see the third action as unnecessary. Daena da Davidson (Wahlberg) and the young boy suddenly turned into a ghost of freedom from a part of the background. It was a weak character development. (Estella Warren looked especially as she could do more than she did in the scenario). <br /> <br /> The emergence of the ape: a half plus point and two disadvantages: Ape shared Wahlberg's surprise with what he saw in these men. Make-up men, especially Michael Clarke Duncan, had incredibly expressive eyes (he was so good at Green Mile) and the makeup design allowed him to use it. But monkeys did not look like anything on the earth, neither monkey nor human. The minus were the monkey jumps that Flash Gordon really looked like on a racket: monkeys were thrown out of an angel, almost as if they were jumped, not one of the longevity of the original monkeys. Secondly, the bad voice mix - the bumping of gorillas is quite obvious from an animal, probably cats are festering, silent and non-realistic. <br /> <br /> In the original film various "human" things are called monkeys and light works as lightness ("I can never recognize a monkey that does not like me."). Here, monkeys speak only exactly as the 21st Century, and there is no humor. <br /> A <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nothing gave me something close to the end of the "Star Trek" from the "V-Ger" movie. First, monkeys have probably been able to read Roman alphabet in the recent past, because they knew the name of the Zona partially in secret. Secondly, the mysterious article, which is named Wahlberg, is just covered with sand, which is what some ape has been doing several hundred years ago. It was worse for me than the very end of the movie. <br /> <br /> The nature of this nature is typical of today's science fiction films. In the 1960s and 1970s, they did not have a budget to create convincing futuristic groups, but they were actually dealing with genuine topics and ideas that are really science fiction. I think in 2001: Space Odyssey, 1967 Planet of Monkeys, THX1138, Soylent Green, Silent Running and 1972 Solaris. The first Planet of Apes used even the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of going forward. However, this film is only part of the sophisticated science fiction cliche: Storms away from the Star Trek, anomalies and worm pits; the planets of the solar system and their miracles may seem like all the big globes (in fact they are only light points from any planet, of all other organs, even from their moons); The service provided by a traditional missile that travels from Saturn to the Earth is a matter of several years; a two thousand-year-old firefighter and a full-time hero runs the button. I do not say anything about a transparent interior glass door. In a modern environment, why should we explain why the bulletin is proof, but because you are not a "science fiction"? <br /> <br /> Generally, Burton is the most disappointing film.
