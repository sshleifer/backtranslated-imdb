Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - perhaps with Bruce), the murderer from the first film, is still up to the old tricks. One of the consultants at Camp Rolling Hills. When the girls in the camp are far from wonderful and sexually explicit, medicines and curses are good. But just a few steps on the line, and Angela kills them - all the paths that lead to bad jokes. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a bad and bad splatter movie, but had a few good points. This is bad and bad, but there is no good point for that. The field has resulted in death, and this is nothing new to the formula. Many people have been killed here (people are burned, their heads cut off, throats are cut off), but all eyes are so obviously fake, it's really funny. This is the smallest camp I have ever seen, and actually everyone is too old to have their roles (especially Higgins). As expected, here is an unequal female nudity (provided here by the great Valenti Hartman) and a compulsory good girl / good boy band (Renne Estevez and Toni Higgins). Except for Springsteen and Higgins, the player behaves badly with standard film standards. There is also a cruel edge of this movie where a movie drowns in a single character! The trash and the patient have a foolish structure, a senseless nakedness, and an evil body. Jump.
