Two days before the official opening, I saw a secret and I have to say that I am very disappointed. And I have to decide most of these problems to put Claire Danes in the lead role. Depending on what he thinks about Denmark, he is a creepy miscast or so far he has to be the earliest favorite for the worst actress in 2007 Razzie. I think we will be sympathetic to him. Instead, it is not entirely different. Other "big" actresses do OK, but of course they do not illuminate the screen. I can say that Natasha Richardson is one of the best of all "great" actresses in this movie. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing in the scattered photo and it will only appear in the vicinity of the latter. <br /> <br /> There is a terrible scenario. As more read lines than the real "character", it comes more.
