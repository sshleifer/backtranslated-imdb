Yes, I'm here with another B industry film. It's pretty sad to see some bad movies, but if I produce a B-industry or industry-industry movie, there's nothing to me. Show some effort in your business. The characters are really bad. The player is not in this regard (surprise), but there is a plot. A duck duck squad can be a witness of the compassion of two companions, and then goes on as if nothing happened. The writer was telling the rest of the members how the doctor threw the stage into a joke about how beautiful a donkey was. Give me some time.
