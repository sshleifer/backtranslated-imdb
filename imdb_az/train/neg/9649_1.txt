Whom do they share with them? It was hard to win a lot in this movie. When Arjun (Ajay Devgan) did not want to know the fact of death by leaving amphah with London (when playing by Om Puri) in just a few minutes. The sole problem of this theory is that anyone who passes through London Heathrow is aware that such a conquest is impossible, especially in India. But film problems do not end there, there are two main ways (Salman Khan and Ajay Devgan) as rock stars beyond imagination. Yes, we have seen that success has come from Susan Boyle (a woman in England to dream after 50 years), but it's rare. I felt that Salman and Ajay's fall were simply imagined, because it was hard for me to stop my faith. They never played the same role in Madhuri Dixit and Sridevia. Why should Ajay Devghani and Salman Khan (40s men) be forced to watch out for the 20th and not to stand up to the 20th? Let's not talk about Asin, the most self-conscious actress on the screen today. This is his second film (I've seen) and he's just as hopeless as an actress, so he's conscious that he's just a good player, feeling better and entertaining, rather than giving a performance. She does not believe in anything to write about the house, about any fluffy, nothing like an actress after releasing all the other film roles to go to the star. And to overcome all of this, the film was drifting just in a dull way. There is nothing special about this subject, and predict every thing that I believe will happen.
