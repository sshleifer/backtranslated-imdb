This film has such a small class compared to Qatar's Strangers, and even in the face of this trick, in the face of the trick scheme, I will not feel right to compare it with or compare it. <br /> <br /> Jansy Butler's character came in such a dopey, and I am very embarrassed to watch the writer and the director. <br /> <br /> I did not like many lifetime films, but now I have to watch everything. in the sense of promoting harmony at home. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> Dean Morgan, Rochester, NY
