I really did not expect such a movie outside of America. Everyone can become sexually abused and become a "tension". <br /> <br /> <strong > -Breaking film "Happiness" is from the beginning. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. It is strange to read some of the more intelligent viewers there. They saw the subject shadowy and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is like a great cinema, a disgusting amount of ignorance, and a "happiness" to watch out for the real horrors of the pedophile. <br /> <br /> Do you think your child is more likely to be abducted and sexually exploited or be smashed by neighbors, teachers, friends, or even a relative? Hmm ... I'm curious. If they want to take a film about international children's care, they owe it to everyone and owe them to those who are in debt. 1/10
