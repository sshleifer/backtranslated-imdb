Fields and symbols are ridiculous and are only considered as "trick" and "character." The biggest problem is that everything is dark, out of focus and blurred. Fuller's filling the whole film with fog does not really help. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely strange and full of gender and violence. These discrepancies are quite entertaining; one of the main characters is not friendly, yet it is locked on a new guy within a minute, and has the entire body of women on the side. Fulci points out that his blood and flowing pictures are more focused on the characters, pointing to their own anti-social tendencies, some of the poor who care about their work. Maybe his career was destroyed, but not more foolish than Zombie. Gory is a hire when Italian flicks or swords and magic or desperate for something strange. With 2 meters underneath the bottom of the pit, and with whom do you sail for help?
