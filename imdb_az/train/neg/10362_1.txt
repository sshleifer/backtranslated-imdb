Disney? What's going on? Indeed, I would like the film to be set up in the 60's, like a book. Maybe I could deal with really cheap special effects to save your budget for a better fit ..... Perhaps someone may be affected by reading books, but how do people with red eyes change in IT? And what is happening with the collapse of the volcano? Where is the book? Peter Jackson! Protect us !!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that this movie was the European version. I'm sure that I can import it. I can only imagine that this true story could be closer to this bad adaptation. This movie should be X.
