I am afraid! Wow, the ninja's fuzzy ways to explode. Make a lot of swoosh voices with their wings, crawling on the earth (back or the stomach), such as flying like a beacon, flying through the sky, going to the buildings, hiding and spreading trees, throwing ninja stars, pushing the role of blue pleasant floors, rapidly sneaking or trotting on their legs. What an eye! Indeed, I can talk about many traditional events, but I'll be here all day. We should not forget that even now we have to forget the legendary Chuck Connorsu who has been coming many times and we expect him to send several ninjas with a shotgun easily. Which class? What a badass! In any case, the ultra-cheap "Sakura Killers" is just a stupid, yet cheesy ninja action that will get something in this delightful b-grade error just genre fanatics. <br /> <br /> In America, there is a genetic laboratory that has been kidnapped by several nenjas and is a very important video. <br /> <br /> Two Americans are being sent to Japan to be taken back by Colonel Chuck Connors. <br /> <br /> The opening of the feature is a wonderful thing. Be prepared to laugh! It then slows down, but only after learning about the two main ninja ninja and learning about it, she steals her suit and ran away from the stolen beta strip, which is a very important formula. Violent and aerobic domestic art really entering the game. This is also not flawless (like moronic script and daft speeches). <br /> <br /> The two Americans (Mike Kelly and George Nicholas) look at the case, share foolish conversations, and face some minor problems. What made the ninjas laugh at how brave and clever these two were. Should they be professional killings? Director Dusty Nelson ('Impacts (1989)') is doing a serious job of what it is and why it plays. It operates on the screen around the remarkable Taiwan locations. The score is a chintzy arrangement.
