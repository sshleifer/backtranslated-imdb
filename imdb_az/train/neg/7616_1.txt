The good news is a film that has a Aztec myth and an unusual Aztec-American (with such a word). <br /> <br /> With the release of Ed Wood's and the classic "Living Dead Night" by George Romaro, with. <br /> <br /> The Legend of Diablo is the exact meal for future future animation of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is a 'B' movie. The production values ​​were so horrible that I felt I was watching a skate away from a show or a 8-meter sequence of a group of school children. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A peasant sheriff finds a box containing a corpse of the Aztec and opens it in a non-suspicious society. Her daughter, a warm and an outrageous, instructor with the FBI man and a priest, attempted to re-jaw. <br /> <br /> Along with this, every single zombie scene seen in previous films is still weak. These zombies are wandering more undead than strange professors' armies! Infrared scenes from Demies are not something special? and he returns a lot of things in peace (against the very forward movement). The area where the priest's priest removed from the cave quickly was ridiculous! It really can be seen really for funny effects - though I did not know! <br /> <br /> Of course, I was waiting for the song of Darth Vader / Field of Dreams, FBI, Benny Hill theme music, to start the game and start a cocktail at the beach for all zombies! the agent becomes obviously funny. Then again this cheese ball was too! Robert Napton, the scriptwriter and writer of the script, must win something for that effort! (How about a lifetime blackballing like a Hollywood 10?) Now that I've seen is 1.5 at a 10 level level. I'm scared that this can be a little generous! <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Lindsey Lofaso looks pretty hot as the little girl of the dead sheriff. Probably his simple elder sister (Calvi Pabon) really ran away from home! Fred Estrado is just like FBI agent. Did Mario Soto, guitarist Rodrigue, be identical to Mario Soto, who was amazed at Cincinnati Reds? If so, she should be closed to baseball. <br /> <br /> If this is really a project for a college college, it's going to be a baseball theme and the "Demons in Outfield" movie class, I'm sorry. The group can be good enough for B or B + after taking college college back! 'Blair Witch Project' proved to be a cool, funny movie in a suit. "The Legend of Diablo", though it does not look good or shoes! It was low budget, low talent, everything down. The last scene - tell about the last 10 seconds of the movie - ONLY a subtle creative or exciting moment. <br /> <br /> I've paid $ 3.45 to rent it. I've had more burgers.
