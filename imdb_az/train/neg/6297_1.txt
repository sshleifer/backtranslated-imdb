I'm a great admirer of Martin Amis, in his book this film is based. Unfortunately, the director could not turn on the screen. Roman is a totally modern and highly artificially worn-out symbol and the splitting of the traditional plot line and character development. One of the most amiable of modern British writers is a hilarious investigation of human desires, excessive and empty spaces. The film's director completely missed the novel. Every popular cunning shot in the hands and the only one in the camera angle, shouting at the curved speed. It resembles that of Ken Rassel, and it diminished the joy of the old filmmaker by hundreds. The perfect actor Christian Solimeno's penis (short) surprise was enough to save me from this unfortunate film. Sorry!
