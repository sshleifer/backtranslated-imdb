Noonan and Marshall find it hard to figure out that they are trying to challenge Abbott & Costello, Martin & Lewis, Curley & Larry, or another comedy, but they are lonely people who try to imitate. All these incredible stupid pictures have sudden laughter. Noonan (who helped write the alleged "writing") and Marshall's chemistry; Marshall works for a Dean Martin type of satan-may-brightness, but it does not even get close. God knows what Noonan is doing, but he did not believe it was funny. She thinks that her arms and feet are intertwined and looking at everyone and everything is the height of the comedy. perhaps not for the audience, but for the audience. After the presentation, I remember seeing it in theaters. Three-year-old Jeff Chandler was under a double project with western ("Columns of the Sky") and three Stooges shorts (not Sappy Bullfighters), and about 20 minutes all the viewers in the audience throw things on the screen; The three Stooges did not measure the worst of the shorts, which was not a surprising result. I stayed around until the end (I wanted to, but my nation did not accept me after the film ends) and it was the only theater in the theater when it was over. One night I saw cables 15 or more years ago and I was stranded to watch it to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was worse. The only thing that went for it was Julie Newmar. Besides this, this does not mean that it is recommended. Both of them play Japanese soldiers, and they do so well as Jerry Lewis's Japanese heroes are compared with thick lens, delicate gear, and mental defects of Japanese heroes. Marshall continued to host Hollywood squares and Noonan took his hand to film, but the majority were so bad. Yes, though ANYTHING can be so bad. The film is really a pitiful loss. Do not waste time.
