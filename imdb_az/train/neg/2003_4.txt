For all visual joys, Renaissance would have been a great deal of activity. The animation is very similar in the big picture, but the characters are very cold and empty as the story and style of this movie. Perhaps the movie world would not be so lifeless with real actors. It is very important to be amazed here, but in the end I've seen that everything I could do was amazed. I did not like the movie and I clarified something I have not seen before: visual elements can be a positive aspect of the film, but without a good story and strong characters, nothing can happen. I will not go so far to say that this movie will not come to nothing, but sometimes it is approaching in a dangerous way. I love Dark Fantastic Thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City have two beautifully thought out films. But Blade Runner was his tragic villain and Dark City had a fascinating story summer. Renaissance has a shadow and light, but there is nothing else. I wish I could love this movie more, but a weak story and empty characters were on its way. Renaissance was a color and history of life and an artistic explosion. One of the most miserable and lifeless films I've ever seen is the title of the Renaissance.
