Tatie Danielle is a strange old age that suffered from a weakness of her beloved and disobedient family. There are a number of subtext that may have to do with France's colonial past, but Danielle often uses a few people's teeth (like deliberately delivering a small child in a park) with their fingers. Unfortunately, this does not happen here. It looks good and the toy is good and there is really nothing wrong with the concept, but it's just SMUG. God loves this movie. We are sorry that it is not as funny as it is, or as it is thought to be. The only boost in the show - saddening, film - Danielle nastier and nastier getting, and only to surprise he comes to watch the increasingly unbelief ways to do so. True: like a sitcom, what's this, will be added to the "bonus" with 110 minutes running with spells and delusions of mistakes.
