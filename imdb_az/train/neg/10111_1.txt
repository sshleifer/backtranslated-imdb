Terrible player, bad story line, cheese makeup and it's just the end of the iceberg. I did not see a worse movie in my life, and I decided to make it fast in 5 minutes to understand that something would be missed ... Not. (Apart from a nice nipple shot) The film was probably made of some furniture storage and was used for at least 90% of the same warehouse sets. Even in a few different "places" you look at the same red chair. At least one office building and one apartment will not be a warehouse for your entire actor's dialogue. (Note to producers) Small office space and one month's housing are cheaper than the entire warehouse and both are more direct and versatile. If you spend money to lease this people, I hope you will demand your money back ... I spent only $ 2.99 for leasing this night and fell to myself.
