STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday afternoon ** Sunday night * Monday <br /> Alice defeated Freddy at the end of the last movie and now lives again tries to fix it. Freddie, Freddi's great filmmakers, Freddy, Charles Rousseau (The Long Kiss Goodnight, Cutthroat Island, Cliffhanger, Die Hard 2), and Stephen Hopkins (Space Lost, Predator 2). But when Russell and Harlin do a good job, Hopkins IMO <br /> Freddie suddenly goes up to the story with a father and the child of a ridiculous devil. <br /> <br /> The expression "bon appetit, bitch" is the only memorable point of this one. Wise is a very forgetful introduction. *
