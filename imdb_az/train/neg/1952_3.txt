Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. <br /> <br /> Saggin's voices are squeaky, and no sound is heard. Scooby shows shows previous incarnation. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it is very important for me. any used formula of previous Scooby shows. <br /> <br /> And the animation style is very strange and distorted. I love it, but it's not a real Scooby-Doo-type animation. But the strange animation I used for other WBs grew up on me; this may also be. <br /> <br /> If you deal with the lack of a proper Shaggy voice, it is worth a look at once. It is almost enough to enjoy the show. In addition, I do not want to be a fanatic, not elastic. Develop or die as you say. See how it looks after two more episodes - then I got a lot more complex idea.
