Do not even worry about this movie, it is bad when it is judged on its own merits, but it is horrifying compared to 1972 (classic). And BTW explained that someone was bad compared to the 1972 film's book. These hysterical films should never be judged against the books they have received. They are totally different types of art (even though it seems necessary, but visible). After using these criteria for all films, it would be "2001" and would be "Forest Gump" and "Lamb's snooze."
