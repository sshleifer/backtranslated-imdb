This is a very cheap flick of a victim. The video is dark and dimmed. Audio is uneven and bad recording and mixing. The script is compressed with ordinary symbols, such as a harsh detective, with a silver pistol and waders! [literally full of silver bullets]. The player is like a tree like characters. FX is a non-existent, numerous association with fraudulent jaws and stinging. The only thing mentioned is the soft core T & A. Really for the trip to $ 30 instead of falling off this really extremely recent smuggler pic: "Dog Soldiers" with Sean Pertwee.
