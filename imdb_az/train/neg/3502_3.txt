Sarah Silverman is indeed the "delight" of the moon. Is it really worth the whole syringe? Yes and no. It is sometimes unpleasant (sometimes it's always funny, though it's really exciting to repeat it). At other times, you feel deceived by the media to exclude another player. She is one of the really cool comedies that tells men to dig, especially with their foolishness and intelligence. However, if you remove them from the corner, most people acknowledge that they only want to sleep with it, and therefore follow it. He reminds Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo why many people flock to what they are really "hot" in terms of popularity. <br /> <br /> Although Sara is 60 years old, she may love her lover (especially men). Like his comedy. When it works, it's stunning. If this is not the case, it's a totally uplifted tedium and very, very boring. The AIDS episode here is the best. Seriously funny and there are some good satirists in it. Brian Poeshn's character has an unhealthy obsession with the Tab in one episode, and it's fun to see him on a Tab T-shirt. But they will not go anywhere and ultimately will not like it. In the series of Sarah's character, the inconvenient, gay couple (Brian Poeshn and another guy) look alike and actually do nothing for a show and support players (including Sarah's real-life Laura) look at her . When the pictures hit, they are brilliant. When they are not, they are terrible and I'm really terrible. There is also a deception with coprophilia (aka poop jokes), today's comedy looks like a substitute for genuine intelligence and intelligence. So, should you watch this show? If Sarah is suffering, go for it. Look at him and act like you. As for his show, the good is absolutely zero.
