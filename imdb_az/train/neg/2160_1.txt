Where do the gods begin? I could only flee from the first 10 minutes before returning hate. With the exception of the act played by Robin Hood, the rest were just terrible. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, I lost count of errors, holes and horrible suits. He began with some poor peasants who wanted to hunt for a deer to feed his family. All good and good. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he must be less deaf, because when a few military men, full armored, horse riders, are behind the 10-feet range, they are already going to shoot at them, about 20 feet behind them. <br /> <br /> <strong> Many people in the Caucasus say they have put an end to their lives. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;" The soldiers tried to look as though they were so obviously fragile and badly unsuccessful, and I do not recall that the "soldier" of the leading soldier was bigger than the size of the 5th. Surely, it looks like a father of a little boy's excessive armor! Finally, Robin is able to shoot a perfect target around a hand of a soldier who seems to be back in about 5 seconds, about 2 seconds. <br /> <br /> After that, they will run away from the soldiers and stop to help strangely well-dressed women, and a pure "peasant" with a trench ... what all the nobles are always ready to do? A series of apologies for the season's second season is beyond me Production costs (at least for what I've seen) onl should be upgraded to a dollar (or euro) level ... <br /> <br /> I think it's a serious thing - to have a better picture of a high school drama class. It was so bad, even Robin Hood's terrible Kevin Costner version was better. <br /> <br /> I will skip this monster and offer you to buy a Robin Shawwud series in the mid-80s. <br /> <br /> For success, the BBC ... for shyness ...
