Come on, what is this show deal, Power Rangers already? I always felt a great show in Japan brought to a better shape than Japan, and I felt it was one of the ridiculous and meaningless excuses in the toy trading history! <br /> <br /> There is no point with this show. <br /> <br /> In the 1990s, bad hair, bad costumes, earrings and so on. Show all that is ridiculous in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> Shaban brought it from Japan, then Disney <br /> <br /> Now the public should remix this show on Disney Channel and so on. <br /> <br /> Once again, I was given a break!
