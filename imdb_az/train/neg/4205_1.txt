ALARMIST is so abysmally scripted that you think of yourself as one and the next actor like David Arquette on earth, to be here. It should be one of the weakest areas I've ever seen and it's on the threshold, without any humor. As for the terrible conclusion that happened, the director was bored and wanted to gather quickly to return home just to eat. Stay away from!.
