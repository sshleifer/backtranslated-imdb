I saw this film in Paris two weeks ago as "shaped pictures of the festival". Even though I'm expecting more from him, I have to say that I have been disappointed as many people in the audience ... If I wanted to summarize everything I felt, I would say that I compare it to the princess mononoke and nausicaa from beginning to end. Of course, this is stupid. But he could not help. The stories are very different, but the world is similar to each other. And from this point of view, "palm tree" can not be compared to the magnificence of Miyazaki. Even though it's technically good, boredom remains ... at the end, the lack of originality does not advise me to follow me. I've seen it from 2 to 10 (slightly tough, 3 or 4)
