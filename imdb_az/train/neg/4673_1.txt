I love Henry James books and Washington Square is no exception. It was very exciting to see a new movie coming out based on the book's book. Jennifer Jason Lee is an exceptional actress and Ben Chaplin's good roles are good enough to play. Albert Finney is an example and does not carry his role well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith .... or more of his ridiculous, strange role. The real problem is that it's a good script, music, and direction, which does not reach this latest version. <br /> <br /> I fell asleep in the theater watching this long, drawn and extremely exciting movie. There are more pauses in more dialogues than Pinter Play. In the book I took care of Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had an opposite effect. I also did not like the twisting of Aala's Morris sex. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. <br /> <br /> If you do not sleep, watch it, it's a specific snoozer. Do not look at your depression. You will then need Zoloft. Of course, "The Heiress" was the exception of Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift. An actor who played his father pointed as unkered, cold as a father ... still grieving for his dead wife and hates Catherine for that. <br /> <br /> This movie was not loyal to the film, but what is this? <br /> <br /> This movie was a box office flop. Why do not I doubt it?
