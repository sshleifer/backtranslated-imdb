In Texas, seven friends meet at the bar to celebrate Halloween's night before going to a party. At the same time, they call the American Nightmare Pirate Radio for fun and confess their inner fears. A serial killer who listens to their confessions realizes their nightmare by killing each of them in a sadistic way. "American Nightmare" is a strange low budget movie with a terrible start: without any previous explanation, a woman kills two pairs in an isolated campground, as if June 13. Then the story passes through a bar that celebrates seven friends Halloween. From now on, the story has a great potential and the unknown casting is always an ordinary indicator of the appearance of beautiful sex and bare bodies, and of this type C production. However, the end of the scenario does not provide any explanation for the murder instinct and the behavior of Jane Toppana, who feels that the budget ended before the end of the withdrawal. As for a better start and conclusion, this strange story would be a good low budget belt movie. <br /> <br /> <strong>
