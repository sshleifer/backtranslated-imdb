Well, it would be better if you plan to sit on this amateurs, a quiet, restful flick, of a middle-aged widow, a little older than you would like a young adult or a teenage girl. His mother, settled in Tunisia, is surrounded by his surroundings, becomes antsi and decides that he is reluctant (not only to help himself), to dance in a suit and a local dance. Meanwhile, her daughter takes dance lessons. The common denominator is a Tunisian bandwidth. When I look at the DVD on x2 and read the subtitles, it is very boring, angry, low-priced, with some winners, very good critics when walking on ordinary dances and everywhere (more wandering), only on x4 budget flickers. Go to the number. (C-)
