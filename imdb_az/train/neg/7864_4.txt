The Hills Eyes II, this is to expect it to happen and more. Of course, Oscar will be a film that will not be put forward, it's just a fun loser who lost yourself in just 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Solution is basically fighting with a group of National Guard Against unhappy mutated hillbillies on the last day of education in the desert. Throughout the entire film, blood and strangeness are constantly fighting in the film, which is often flying around, like the other film, and also another graphic aggression scenario. Nature's eyes are beautiful, clean I'll give you 10 out of 4 for fun. Even though I watched the film more and more, the audience was shocked and shocked by the graphic and random jumping scene, as the audience remained awake. <br /> <br /> Prisons are eye-catching, just good fun, and if you're bored, it's just a matter of time and nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
