The writer came up with a pretty good idea for a story, but many drawbacks in the execution of the plot drew him because he could not see it nearly a year later. Key elements, such as character development, shine the best. Inconsistencies also raised their ugly heads. A great mosque in the middle of rural Ireland? A fierce night (can I add at very favorable times) symbols "showing" in gardens during a stormy night? All this was not "bad". Based on Alison Elliot's story and talent, I assessed her at 4.
