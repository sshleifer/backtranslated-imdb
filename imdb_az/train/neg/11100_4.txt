I really liked the original story, there were very high expectations for the movie (especially since Barker was surprised at the interviews), and finally what I can say? It was a MESS general! The director was a moving actor all over the globe, entertaining visuals and choreography were straight, empty, and completely unnecessary (like slow moon speeding with worldwide music video technique? This movie is not needed and some terrific MTV Marilyn Manson / Smashing Pumpkins / Placebo music video vibe lowered into the video). Some of the killers are very cool and cruel, some just ridiculous laughs (the first killing of the Japanese girl was cheerful and Ted Raimi's death was just funny). He escapes from the original story, fleeing to all places with zero tension and cries, and then begins to deteriorate further. I did not give any comment, so I knew what happened as I read the story, but sometimes for people who do not know where they did not know what's going on and what they do not know. <br /> <br /> Yes, I would like to love this movie because Barker's I adore and love the story because it has great potential. for a crackle movie, hell, and even some of the movies in Kitamura, but this movie has just turned out to be amateurs and tranquility - I did not care for anyone or anything, everything fled and seriously cut off the actual source completely. It turns things up. When he watched and played with Vinnie Jones, he was a good dancer, but everything else was somewhere else, more disappointment. Gutted
