Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time; Meet St Louis, Bad and Beautiful. I was looking forward to this movie with great enthusiasm. But what a disappointment. <br /> <br /> Someone fled. Sinatra is a sad sack, she has succeeded in finding exciting family relationships, making her feel hungry, and satisfying her end to the exciting writing of exciting excavations. The film has reached a dramatic end to a disappointing disappointment with Sinatra and MacClane. Sequence involves tension, but Minelli is not Hitchcock; She is applauded with pretty colors, the scene is a gritty clich√© and characters are so subtle and sophisticated that we do not care that we do not care so much that we do not particularly notice. (especially MacClane) But this is the only real cinematography in the project. Otherwise, we look at the characters remaining in the bars and around the living room. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie. After WW2, the dilemma of displaced and indifferent soldiers is better handled in "The Best Years of Our Life." And one of the two ingredients, 'Naked Light' and 'Travel' is a traumatic dead-end city.
