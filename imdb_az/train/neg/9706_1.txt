... and I really gave a ZERO on my individual 1-10 scale. Since 1952, I joined the cinema and saw more than 1000 theaters (I do not appreciate the movies I watch on TV). <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Actually, it was my daughter (26 now) who warned me about this movie (she was surprised by the overall rating of 4+). The animation of the dinosaurs was then amateur (and even worse), the actress (especially Sean Young) is treacherous and the story line is simple. <br /> <br />
