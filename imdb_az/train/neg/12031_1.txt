At first, this movie is not a comedy; If you really do not force yourself, you're laughing loudly. Second, the film is slow and boring. Acting is not bad, it's not special. In a small city, there's a Lucky Luke comic of two families (one big nose and one big ears) fighting each other ... you'll smile more if you read it instead of replacing it. Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy, and this film does nothing but confirm this rule. There is a similar comedy about '' home teachers ''; There were some good moments. My last comment: Do not waste time and money to watch this insufficient and boring movie.
