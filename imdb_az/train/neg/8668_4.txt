I have never read the Bradbury novel, although it is based on this movie, but I'm also interested in what I'm collecting (finally reading it and reading it). My comments are based solely on the movie. After seeing my trailer, I had to see it and am very excited, but at last I was disappointed. The reason for this is that the film feels very amateur. The actors were not a good player (Robards and Pryce were both good players, but not here). The kid's players seemed to just want to show, to get their clothes, to tell the lines, and to make faces. Set and props were cheap and non-realistic. It was surprisingly bad. Therefore, I had to go to the internet and check the managers to see what I saw. The editing was interrupted and stuck, and the scheme (the script) was the same (despite the fact that the author was concentrated, mocking?). <br /> <br /> I read some comments in this movie, and I think it's hard to believe that people really love them. o The most harmful content is interesting and entertaining and interesting. There was a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it was technically bad that the film was far away from the glow of the story.
