I'm a big fan of the camp, but whenever the 'twist' of each area is predictable and bad, it does not seem to be obvious, and I lose it. I value it 3 degrees, but it's easy to put an end to the end. His only saving grace I've hated more than any other movie. To do this, beer in the world is not enough.
