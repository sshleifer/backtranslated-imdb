After seeing this movie, I thought my dream was a bit funny. Selma Blair was an incredible, currently missing actress, and Max Beesley's "Kill Me Later" was incredibly attractive. The story, of course, was not genuine, of course, some words. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this issue has not been considered. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, he slows down shots, slows down his shots, shoots images, uses unusual camera angles, uses frustrating color filters, makes quick cuts, has gone back and forth over time Every kind of unique "modern" soundtrack. I do not remember the last time I did such a groundless job to manage the movie. His ego should be great for throwing the actor and story and putting his focus and focus on the attention of the audience. <br /> <br /> There are several beautiful scenes called "Kill Me Later". What could and should be. Unfortunately, when they start to promise everything, Mrs. Lustig gives her film a tailor's advice and pushes things back. We can say that Blair and Beesley are good chemistry and that the film is really a good heart. 3/10
