I just watched this movie, and with such a great talent and great talent, it must be said that this is Turkey! A friend presented this movie to me and watched the story with an open mind because he had such a high praise. <br /> <br /> Well, the film began with a retired pilot with Kevin Costner ... why? Why did they make him a combat pilot? It was supposed to be hired by Anthony Quinn as a new pilot ... We also do not approach an aircraft for the rest of the Costner movie! <br /> <br /> Costner becomes a Texas businessman (James Gammon), a Mexican businessman and a trader with the Costner tag. Without knowing what to do, Gammon is beaten near death, and Costner takes him to a meeting where Quinn is a co-creator! But nothing comes up ... nada, zilcho! Why was Gammon a character? Why did he sell horses with Quinn if nothing happened? <br /> <br /> Of course, they resemble one another, and the next thing was transferred to a monastery! <br /> <br /> Many talent has been wasted so poorly in scripts and poor editing! I just watched that a friend was mine and allowed me to look ... I'll throw it for 2 hours of my life watching the blown up!
