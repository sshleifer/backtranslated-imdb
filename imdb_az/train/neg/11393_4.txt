Wow, I do not believe if people consider this a "good" movie. <br /> <br /> This is the best film, but there's more romantic / comic comedy. John Cusack. <br /> <br /> This is the best mediocre movie ever. For a romantic comedy, the player was not terribly big, though less passionate, less romantic. There were many invisible or missing spaces. Unfortunately, the main characters are full of cowards. They know themselves well enough to understand that they do not love the people they deal with. How do we know they are not in love? With the absence of love of conscience, both characters leave their financial resources. <br /> <br /> The shootings of this movie can be more romantic than ongoing running. <br /> <br /> The film will not end with a wedding scene, it will probably also get cold feet and as hot potatoes when each other is approaching another. This movie is actually two people who can not do anything different from Cusack's previous characters (Loyd's Anything, Martin's Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.). <br /> <br /> The biggest failure of this film is the lack of any twisted transformation or something interesting. After the movie was over, I felt that she could not carry the heart to the story. <br /> <br /> Some people are saddened by the fact that they are very sad about this film's immorality. Any criticism that everyone is "very keen". This is not a critical cynicism, it is not an objective research. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is great, try these movies, your hearts will explode: The Princess Bride, Say Anything, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Faith, Charade, Back Window, Northwest North, or Mary There is something about it (a romantic good exam of idealism against today's society).
