The relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider) was very good when the French relationship worked well. In this catastrophic catastrophe controlled by Frankenheimer, the film focuses on direct involvement in the capture of Doyle and Charnier (Ray), bringing stones like the Raindeer Games and the Dr Moreau island. Finding Charnier with the help of the French local authorities, who thinks NYPD will allow Doyle to visit Marseille, loudly laughs. You made me wrong, but Charnier did not throw the city with 65 pounds of pure smack! 32 million street worth, but yes, send Doyle to find this guy, and that's his pinch. Please! The story was weak. The player was very scary (excluding Hackman just overplayed his part exclusively). The place was all over the place. Even the breaks between the scenes were terrible. Give yourself a blessing and look twice for the first time, and take this one.
