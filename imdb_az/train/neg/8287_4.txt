This is a television version of the tale, the movie begins with an episode 'Xena ...' with a small meaningful dialogue or character description. After a while it becomes a bit more meaningful, but all the characters are still cartoon. <br /> <br /> Salma is an exotic beauty. Richard Harris is a seductive and sexually exploited Frollo for nutmeg in Salma. Other characters, including Quasimodo, are very memorable. <br /> <br /> A sorta liberal version of the story is also the suppressor of the "Enlightenment" ideals, as Frollo is in the "Rose's name" and Quasimodo is a freelance champion. The shadow side of Quas's character is ignored, though it is intensifying people. She is really an outsider who looks different and plays more with the average person. <br /> <br /> Probably the movie is intended for children, but I'm skeptical of the bloody changes that Frollo Flogs want to shake off her monkey. Not very interested and unforgettable, but not horrible, sometimes fun, giving a fairy tale.
