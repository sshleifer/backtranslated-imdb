Oh, come on, give this movie a break. It was something I liked it ....... Sorry, I still think. Oh yeah !!!! John Wayne came and hit the bad guys. Oh, sad, wrong movie, I thought of a better quality movie. Now let me see, I'm still trying to defend. Oh yeah, Clueless was the chicken there. Do not put Stacy Stone. That is, we all make mistakes. But the boy, Stacy, did a dooooosie. <br /> <br /> Hey, something that has never been done in the West, and even the shooting of all women really cried a woman. This may be the first west. Although his neck should be broken, though, he should be a little effortless to make the director try his first attempt at the west. Also, although I did not see a woman in a western horse, I did not see a single woman in the West, but I thought that the director would give her an idea of ​​Roses # 2, which should be done right after Ed Wood's monster bride # 2. Maybe the creators of this movie He was going to. <br /> <br /> Heiey, if the producers of Gang Of Roses want to continue this mess later, say, "Hey, do not worry about my daughters" and "Speak with your hands, baby, talk to your hand". You may also be a surfer friend, MP, says things like marshal, "This gunfight was completely RAD man." You know things like this.
