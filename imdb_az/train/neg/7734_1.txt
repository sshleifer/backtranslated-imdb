This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. The story line is weak - could not even follow it. Acting high school. Irritating to the sound track. It is not a breakthrough. It's horrible. Loans even slowed down - it was ashamed that my name was related to this film's expense. Do not waste time thinking about this move on the move.
