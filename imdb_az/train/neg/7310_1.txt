** CRIMINALS! <br /> <br /> Cabin Fever is the nod for the WORST movie of the year I saw. This movie is flat GARBAGE! There is so much error in helping the movie, but I'm surprised at how bad it really is. This movie had a great potential to be good, but eventually did nothing. The heroes were as unique as each other; For the whole film you just ask yourself, "Why would you do it?" or "What did you do in this business?" ... this is how meaningless and stupid your characters are. We do not make any gains for them, so it's obvious that you do not give rats as their fate ... Only their laughs can be laughable. <br /> <br /> - For example, "Marx" (Marcy) ... was he obliged to go to Paul (Rider Strong)? There was no point in saying that filmmakers needed an excuse to infect the virus! UGH. <br /> <br /> - First, though, does anyone really get into the woods and drink water from the cabin crane? <br /> <br /> - Why did not Bert just hit the sick boy? from the start? <br /> <br /> - How long did they finally decide to leave the cabin? hiking? <br /> <br /> - No, just wait for my friends to get infected 2 (an eye blink of death). <br /> <br /> What was the main reason for Paul's fishing attempt? Hermit's body to get into the dirty water tank and get infected? <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> I do not know if a movie has not gone wrong. Initially, children asked the hick store cashier to know what the rifle was and he replied "for his niggers." At the end of the film, three young Blacks (dressed in underwear, less than one in a row) entered the store ... to come to the hunt for the cashier to learn how to clean. <br /> <br /> Therefore, she continues to give all her pounds and hands and jokes like getting married with her. <br /> <br /> Please, HELL WHAT? How can we be tasteless, film makers think it by filming it? As a black man I, of course, was dissatisfied with the first 'Nigger' statement. It was a tasty, meaningless word. My question to filmmakers: What was the end of the black kids? Have you forgotten my first racist comments before? Doing something with the black viewers to fix things? Yes, I did not try to try this helpless, at least funny funny. The whole film was a joke .... a filmmaking film that should not be given during the day. Did Peter think that this movie was good? Which movie did you look at? <br /> <br /> If ZERO * **** * came out of the stars I could give it a low degree. Please note that other IMDs, do not lose 1/1 of your precious life of watching this "movie" disgust. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.
