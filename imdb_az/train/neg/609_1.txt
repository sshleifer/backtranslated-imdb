It was a completely scary movie. Do not withdraw by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this should simply be the worst part of history. Even their great actor could not get the funny story of this movie. This film is part of the early nineteenth US propaganda. Colombian rebels were the most depressing scenes when they were doing their job for the revolution. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared fake, and Walken and her lover's lover had an exciting emotional plug in a film that was deprived of any real meaning. There are such films that I am disappointed, the actor breaks the name of Christopher Walken. But it would be possible to sit there.
