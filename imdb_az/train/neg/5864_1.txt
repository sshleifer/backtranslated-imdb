I'm sure this is the worst movie ever. If a 13-year-old boy does not laugh at his foolish humor, you have to give up the eternal comedy. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose differently. The film is packed with pre-set shades (some of them racist) and very unfunny jokes. Especially in an unforgettable situation, the doctor is the scene describing the rabbit's death and pregnancy (as I wrote, I do not believe it's actually a movie scene). The man is running a dead rabbit on the table and trying to mouth his mouth. ROTFLMAO! NOTE! The blow line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie "I knew I should be above". ha ha ha ha ha ........
