The only value in this film is actually how bad it really is. I get my sub-account with a middle-high school writer looking for a good, well-behaved, good-looking action. One of Tom's seas did not like being obviously selective because he was a very early film. The best special effects of the film are a man who consumes an incredible counterfeit rubber monster.
