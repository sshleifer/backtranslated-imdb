Now I love fantastic comics. However, at the end of 2006, when I saw "Robotboy" in Canada, I watched the premiere and inevitably got excited. Heroes are common and stereotypic (do they really wear an African-American man's tiger strip printing clothes and talk with a Jamacian accent? Why are all the Asian characters yellow and squinting? The mother's big bud and chest and constantly complaining?) Things will not come true, common, and sometimes uncomfortable. At Astro Boy, there are similarities, even stabs. Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay, etc. Let me explain. My Life Like Teenage Robot, Star Wars, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kamen Riders, Sailor Moon, and co. they stand up. Notable racist / gender stereotypes can not be mentioned. Even my real sources have not begun. I'll just say that it's clandestine and pretty bad. But seriously. Do not try to watch it. Especially if you love Astro Boy.
