This movie is all flash and no soul. Actors put lots of passion into numbers, but these numbers often did not get in touch with the movie and felt alone as music clips. The figures are almost as if you were in front of you, and no effort was made to sound, each of them sounds like a studio, and essentially takes away all the songs from the songs. Their speeches, above all, were Hudson, who was really angry, playing the "mighty" (he stubborn and selfish) black woman. There was no depth in his character and none of the other women. Despite the fact that Hudson feels that he can endure difficulties due to the severity of his character, he really refuses to do the best for the team that has the power to make the end of the movie completely meaningless. Hudson Academy Award is a joke, there is no basis. He showed his emotion when he played (often it was a mistake of the writer / director, though it was mistaken), but he did nothing against a character that was already written when he moved. Eddie Murphy's character is a summer run and has done a great job, but still is not worth the Oscar. The only actor in the role was Danny Glover, a small, relatively insignificant character who made a real thing from her. There is nothing to drown teeth, drama or heart, or even to laugh. The placement of musical numbers was so bad that sometimes the film was fun, not music; When Hudson had been discussing with other girls, it would take a long time for a family to go to Guy's skate. I did not know what was going on in the movie, and in the past few minutes, I felt insulted. It's a big, rich time, and it's really the worst movie I've ever seen in '06 and it was the truth that could not start with anything last year.
