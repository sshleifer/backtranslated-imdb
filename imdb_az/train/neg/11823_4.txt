<br /> <br /> In the late 19th century, England's younger Tom Brown (Alex Pettyfer) was sent to Rebecca's public school, where a radical new teacher (Stephen Fry) was reforming and a resident of the school, Flashman (Joseph Beattie). <br /> <br /> Already a large number of traditional Gordon Parry's 1951 version - Thomas Hughes' s constant novel, written in the early 21st century by writer, screenwriter Ashley Pharoah (TV's "Heart of the Heart") and director David Moore THE FORSYTE SAGA) takes courtesy. It is quite pleasant and beautiful, but it differs only as Fry's sincere activity and is a new principle set out to clean up the school's most suspicious "traditions" and the 14-year-old Pettyfer is awesome in Hollywood and beyond is a talented child with a charm and a vivid look. Otherwise, this is a typical British television feed, something that is well-liked by officials who want to fill their tables with the 'prestige' product, not even that good. In the UK's Radio Times, it has been described as "strangely strange" and has raised a strange eyebrow on "a beautiful, dark deceiver, suffering from the lives of all these fagging and cruel and sweet young boys." I would like to.
