Here's what this movie was meant to appeal to Chick Flick: I sat down and loved it very much. But this was a very critical attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (hell to his right). Her player was over-exposed and overcrowded in his role as compared to his colleagues. This movie could have been more, because there was a budget suitable for settings, actors and a good storyline. My husband and I realized that the movie was "Muck," because the movie was a painful embarrassment! Next time, better luck, Miss Graham looks like the kind of movies he has from Hell.
