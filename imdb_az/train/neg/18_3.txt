This is an art movie made in 1969 or 1972 (National Film Protection Fund 1969 and IMDb 1972). Regardless of the exact date of the film, this is often the most common indication of the overall period of time - some of them are explained by some camera work and pop art styles at the start of the 60s and 60s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> \ These distorted images are accompanied by music and no dialogues or no areas. This, of course, was designed as a form of art of performance and, as most performance art, is first of all interesting, but soon becomes tiring. To make it clearer, the film is a common hole and will not appeal to anyone, perhaps a film that killed a family and friends, and perhaps only a few people with a hip and understood us "deadly."
