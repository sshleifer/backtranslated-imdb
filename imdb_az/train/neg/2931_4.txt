Sitcom "Gentlemen League" fictional village "Royston Vasey" follows the lives of several bizarre residents. <br /> <br /> In the first century, through a new way to be built through Royston Vasey, the various scenes associated with a number of sketch indicators in the main scheme are interconnected. As a result, more and more foreigners travel to a small city. However, Edwards and Tubbs, owners of a "local" store away from the city, do not like foreigners. When a visitor enters the store, they kill him. In my opinion, some scenes are unpleasant and funny, for example, when they have won two teachers who want to set up a new pair. Edward drums, half a bare dance around the Tubbs victims. <br /> <br /> Pauline Royston lives in Vasey. Works at the Local Business Center. Although Pauline hates people who work, the woman does not want to lose her job. <br /> <br /> Therefore, if an unemployed person becomes a firefighter, he is not ready for the job because he does not allow him to go. <br /> <br /> Then Barbara Dixton, a transsexual taxi driver <br /> <br /> Besides, veterinarian, Mr. Chinnery, always kills animals instead of treating them. In one case, he comes to a farm and is taken to a living room where he puts in a basket. The farmer goes abroad. Mr Chinnery takes him out of the way because the dog is a sick animal. After a while, the farmer opens the door by holding a "real" sick animal, a sheep. <br /> <br /> Some residents nephew (his wife was killed by shop owners). The couple is very neat. They have, for example, towels of different colors. Each color is a part of the body. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, actors play very well. The scenes are funny, playing with women. Costumes are also compatible with actors. Tables have a scarf and sometimes crazy heroes, for example, Edwood, unappetizing black teeth. The show has a lot of typical English dark miracles. Set design reflects the mood of the series. The village and all the houses look gray and rot. There is often a fog around the local shop, which also enhances the danger. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Royston Vassey, you will never miss it. <br /> <br /> Although the actors think that it's a great job, this is not my taste.
