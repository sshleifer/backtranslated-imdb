This show was a lot conscious, but I did not know about it until midseason (season 1). Someone even offered me a show. But I decided that if I wanted to watch it, I would not wait until the end of the season, so I could watch it massively. I was happy because of the show format. <br /> <br /> We need to wait a week to learn what happens next in life. <br /> <br /> Taking into account that the show was able to shoot sex in sex. Jason will have sex with many things that move. She realized that she had been killed in a sexual intercourse, and the next night she went to bed with another woman! Then Tara and Sam pull each of them knowing that Samin Sookie loves them. Sookie cries for some reason, even though she is lying down with a vampire. One of the problems associated with the show is that it does not do well to pay attention to these symbols. I really did not see any interest for Jason. Along with the uninterrupted desire of the unfaithful, he was rude to people who were really worried about him. After a few episodes, I would not have thought that if he died in some way. For this reason, Sookie's grandmother felt uncomfortable in the murders that turned her into a victim (because the first two were closely related to Jason). <br /> <br /> Then Sookie and Bill entered into sexual intercourse. The story takes a few more subfields. Tara wants an exorcism from his mother, and then exorcist woman Tara tries to convince her that it is a must to eliminate her demon. Since I know that there are some people who really believe in these things, I'm not worried about all the assassination things. However, Tara spent little time in herself to show that she and her mother were a farce after spending about $ 1,300 on a heart attack. At other points, some developments are very fast. Jason continues as a whisper trying to sell his grandmother's belongings to buy vampire blood, and this seems to be a new crack or something. In her search, she finds the daughter of V (the vampire blood) with her. They are high and fall into love with each other for three days, and V runs to a vampire for a permanent source. Bill is another example to go to a vampire court. <br /> <br /> Sookie went two days before she left, and she began to wonder if she thought she was thinking of her "vampire policy." <br /> <br /> Dishonesty is a powerful suit of this show. It does not even matter to understand that something is happening with the dog. Although my assumption was not dead, it was not a surprise. But the last two episodes really did not work for you, as if it were really annoying because it had revealed all the developments. When Tara fell into a car crash, the face of the naked woman with a pig was clearly shown and easily recognizable when she went to the prison for survival. It is not enough as in the sky, and then again with her pig in the house. Then it's time to complete the crime. At the end of the last episode, he revealed that Renee was the one who was and that he was most likely a murderer. In the final episode, Renee puts a murderer on your face. Sookie reiterated that Renee's thoughts were not an accent. I thought Renee was so good as to be fraudulent. But the next scene is full of suspicious evidence against Renee. She shows Renee's Vampire and Maudette cassette and finds a tape in her boxes to falsify Renee's Cajun accent. At this point it was only funny. WE WILL USE IT! So blah blah blah things happen. Bill still kills himself unless he rescues Sookie, who has managed to kill Renee. They start building on season 2, leaving unfinished issues. The naked pig lady and Samin have a history, Lafayette has been missing and killed. <br /> <br /> Jason is in the process of being brainwashed by a church that is struggling against some vampires - this gives me less importance. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how many people really love this show. In my opinion, I expected this show to be even better. I'm interested in seeing what's going on in Season 2, but I'm watching it, and I expect a season to complete.
