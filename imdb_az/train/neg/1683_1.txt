It's hard to call a horror movie called The Grudge. <br /> <br /> If he forgets one dimmed fear and looks at the other side of the film, he is still disappointed. Acting is good but not good. At the beginning of the event, he may be a little interested, and one tries to find out what happened. But I understand that there is not much to understand. "Scary" elements are sometimes added to the scenario without occasionally ... <br /> <br /> So, look at this movie, if you do not have anything more interesting, looks like a carrot or a cloud.
