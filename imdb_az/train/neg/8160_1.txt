and is not a fun way to follow. it's just bad. People are shocked that they write positive things about it here. The story sucks, the action is bad, not scary, special effects are special - oh no! the writing board came out of their hands! oh gee - mirror turned into water! In the 50s, the hair, clothes and makeup are inaccurate, and there is a middle-aged man who plays a high school version of a high school. This is like a nightmare about science street items. I enjoy sitting here to watch a very cheerful horror movie like everyone, but there are better ones to choose from.
