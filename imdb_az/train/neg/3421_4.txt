<br /> <br /> Some plutonium was missing and there were many bad guys. With the help of Josh Makkord (Chuck Norris) and his young protégé Deke (Judson Mills, a different actor from the previous film) Josh's daughter Que (Jennifer Tung) <br /> <br /> This is a year after the 11 September events which was a movie. Norris, who was shot in 2001, even looked at the story of what happened in New York City that day, so that Norris and his supporters would be in the mood of a movie that did not hit any other terrorist donkeys. Norris, however, is not in a position to go beyond one another. This is surprising to see what the original is doing to ensure its continuity, and if one of these three people is approaching one another. <br /> <br /> When you see a Norris movie, you really have seen it all, and there is nothing new or unexpected in this one, but at least what you have gotten and I said, It could have been. **
