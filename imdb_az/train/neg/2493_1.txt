Very scary movie. At first I did not know that Kiwi was an effort, but soon I realized that all the characters were talking to the secret kiwi puppets under the fake American works. Why should the United States be set up in any way? - It was set in NZ and then the actors could use their normal voice. Certainly, did a production team hear horrific attempts to talk with American accents? Bad bad movie. I was surprised that it took a long time - how could she do it? Slick / Willis type flick.A TOTAL WASTE BATTERY looks like a very bad attempt! If any TAXPAYER comes in this trash box, I can bring a revolution to return all the money to the Treasure. I'm still leaving the garbage I've ever seen (go, knock!). Why did I continue to look? Yes, I'm a fan of movies and I can help myself!
