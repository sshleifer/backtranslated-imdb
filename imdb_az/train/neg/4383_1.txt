The worst Bob Hope comedy ever (and includes some heavy competition). She hopes on an island with sailors, with a geisha remaining in a wind that drives a "steam ship." Nobody, of course, ruled this hopes on the cliff, because Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida have the features and can not create any laugh and excitement yet. Bing Crosby really needs it?
