Wow, I knew this movie would be bad, but that's not bad. Roddy Roddy Piper is a sickly retired police (cliche!), helping everyone - crying over the smiling and dead son as post-op lobotomy patient. His son's son leaves the Special Forces of the Armed Forces and "sees everything" because everybody tells them something about the past, describing their teeth. <br /> <br /> It is time to purge the streets of another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (a bad boy killed) and his son once. <br /> <br /> My darling is a very good young lady. He wants to throw the bones of the former Army bloc. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ font> All this has been done before, all of which has been better Ong-Bak is the best example). <br /> <br /> Erm is called the HONOR movie, and labeled "Bloodsport and Kickboxers" - other films by director David Worths, and although they are over 10 years old, we will soon realize. <br /> <br /> Classics like "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - this is really what they say. <br /> <br /> I'll give you Â£ 10 before you see this movie. <br /> PS - If you do not know the character names, you are sorry, though he tells you something.
