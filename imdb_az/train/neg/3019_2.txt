How can you perceive the story of a gruesome, fierce blessing hunter, living in tough, stressful ways? This is absurd. In addition, the director's visual style is awkward and gimmicky, the plot is simple, boring, mixed gangsters, and the player is incredible. The film presents a new character throughout the movie and, in the fragmented flashback, is largely disappearing - it looks just fine and mixed. Look at the killings of "the first women" (fake), which says nothing in your movie and then says, "It did not really happen, it's happened". <br /> <br /> The events that took place in the fourth period, first of all, have seen a series of incorrect sequences. 1/5.
