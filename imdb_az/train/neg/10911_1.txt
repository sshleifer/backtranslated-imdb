I hate this movie so much that I remember it alive. Not even funny. Any movie that relies on unforgettable sex jokes and racism humor is not worth the money to do it. In the first half hour, Rob Schneider drank an anhydrous milk carton. All I thought was "worth it, for such a bad movie". Do not waste your time or money.
