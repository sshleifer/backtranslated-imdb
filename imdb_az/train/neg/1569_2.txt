The weak area, the likely car crash and desperate fumbling characters. At first, I thought that this movie was shot in the 70's because the picture quality, as well as the story and drama, were taken from the old Kojac episode. I was surprised to see you were prepared and really prepared late at -97. <br /> <br /> If you read this, if you consulted, if you see it, you would do something more interesting. paint is dry.
