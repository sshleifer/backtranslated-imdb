It would be a good idea after watching the movie on the movie if it realized that this movie was totally horrible! The land does not matter and I think the best part of the 5,000 scene is that it makes the film more boring and horrible. I was not able to watch the late night yard with noise, but this truth was just the music I was scared of, they called it disastrous music, they played opera, it meant being serious! This movie summarizes everything that is not good about this kind of movie. Explain yourself at your own risk to become an honest disease, this film is just the trash, ENJOY!
