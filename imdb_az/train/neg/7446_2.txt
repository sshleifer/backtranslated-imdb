There are 2 words for you. Sean Bean. This is the only valuable asset in the film. But I do not see such a movie. Although the main villain is good, you do not want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I was not interested in heroes (except for the little boy), and in fact, if the lovers of the star came together or died, I really did not care. The film did not care for me or he believed that these people were not interested in each other. After watching movies, I read many "classic" novels and did not even want to read this book. The story looks so dull. But I can continue, and I've read that story on my own. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actress who played Lorna also had Sense and Sensibility, and she was even better. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E Pride and Prejudice have great films. Or MiniSeries like Forsyte Saga. Check them out, do not worry with Lorna Doone.
