I really did not have anything new to add, but I felt like commenting on this sack. So here goes: <br /> <br /> Atrocious. I'm working on my MST3K DVD collection again, and I just looked at Hobgoblins for the 10th time. It's really painful, but it's next on the list ... You know you're a small core of a movie buried under the bumps of Hobgoblins, but could not. Everything about this movie is 4 degrees. Story, action, effects, women, "action scenes", ... ahhhh forgets it. I can do something with the negative effects of "Dr. Z" (aka "Zaat" bloody) (I really liked it at TCM at the end of this month) <br /> <br / > <strong> "Hobgoblins" is not something, it is not a game. <br /> <br /> The worst part is that after about 12 hours after the movie's end, a good night's sleep, coffee and some toast, my medicines, and still Amy, Red Shorts and Laraine Newman, ersatz "New Wave" Dancing music is frolicking in the living room SOLUTION with my head. This torment will last for several days. <br /> <br /> Good luck, okay?
