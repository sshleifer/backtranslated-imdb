<br /> <br /> This movie should be one of the worst French films ever seen (actually with Brotherwood) <br /> <br /> This is really interesting and original source of thought , because it's really sad. Especially when Antoine DeCaunes and Jean Rocfffort were among my friends, I was scared to see that they were threatening me in such a poor film. <br /> <br /> Lou Doyon is a pretty bad example, and the famous parents can take you to the movie, but they do not necessarily give up talent. <br /> <br /> Take this movie if you want to laugh instead of Alain Chabat LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN.
