Jean Claude Van Damme tries to save his career with the continuation of the Universal Soldier. But did this movie save her? I think he's going to hell after his death. <br /> <br /> In the first minute we see the inside of an object that sees the bad guy. Scary, huh? But not as scary as the player (following the details). <br /> <br /> Then you see Van Damman with a black girl (I do not remember his name, good, at least not important), trying to escape some muscle men. Of course they are the new Universal-Soldiers. More muscles, less brain (like movies). After a while, Van Damme fights with Goldberg, but then the "mission" is abolished. It was just a test (is this film a trial for our nerves?). Apparently, Van Damme is working on a new Universal Soldier project for the government (the first movie might think of Vanamme's character as the most unusual thing you can do). But later. And a "story" has to come. Oh, I forgot. She has a daughter. <br /> <br /> After 20 minutes, the supercomputer is talking about shutting it down and quitting the project. Of course, the cube is angry and takes action to kill everyone. Van Damme runs from the facility, but the computer sends some soldiers who do not spare him (Van Damme wants as a soldier - because he's the best (really?)). And what can we say, Goldberg is one of the hunters, he was always a foolish sentence to the audience before asskicked. Funny? Yes, like the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> After some "story" Van Damme's daughter (his wife - the first film correspondent) is trying to save her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A final show that fights Van Damme Bad Guy comes and you can see the most expensive scene in the whole movie (see for yourself, say it's funny). <br /> <br /> You can not watch this movie. But if you hold it with you!
