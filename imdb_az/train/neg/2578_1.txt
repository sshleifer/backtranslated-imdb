To summarize this film: Without a true plot, this movie consists of an 80-minute mistake symbol, or it is a drink or bad joke. Music is just awful, humor is not funny, and all female characters are bony idiots or common geeks. It seems to me that the film is really written by a 14-year-old boy who is drinking is quite cool, women are designed to please men, and those who oppose those ideas are geeks. Also, the film has nothing to do with original American Pie movies, with a few names, and this is a small character, Mr Levenstein. The only good thing about this movie is beautiful looking girls. Do not be fooled by this rating and do not be fooled by the 5.4 rating, because it is obviously overturned and does not deserve more than 2.
