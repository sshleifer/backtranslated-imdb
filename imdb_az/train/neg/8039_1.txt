It's a stupid movie, a dull and boring piece, like a full house repetition. For all people who want to see a great, exciting, and horrific film of horror, you should not consider watching this awesome job. one F - in my opinion. I have a question, what did they think? Let's make a list: 1) Bad script 2) Bad script 3) Bad script 4) Bad activity 5) Bad management and last but not least bad script. That is, I'm not as disrespectful about every movie, but I was disappointed when watching. This film should be banned in a box, locked and sank in the sea.
