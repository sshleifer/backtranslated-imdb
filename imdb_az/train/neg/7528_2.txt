This is worse than the original game of death. Our younger brother, Bobby Lo, has led us to Billy Lo down from a helicopter down the hill. So, after some Bruce Lee clone, the movie kills one and writes us to a thirty-minute story. The main reason for watching this is the time Bobby Lo fights against a person in a lion suit. Jang Lee Hwang is usually a pretty awesome, but a little bit of the time of the screen. Basically, this was part of Bruce Lee's box and they watched Death's original game. They are not surprising to be included with Lee's finished works. No one would buy anything else.
