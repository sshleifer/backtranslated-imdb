This movie is an unhappy and forgetful Sean Connery tool. The performances are particularly unfortunate by Capshaw, Fishburne and usually Ed Harris. Connery looks bad as a Harvard Academy. Go, the film is getting worse. A third degree is that it is not often opened. The film is made up of perfect supporters. George Plimpton plays a minor role in adding some gravity to Connery because they discuss the death penalty. Violence and atmosphere are the third degree mystery / tension that manipulates pepper at the highest level. Scenario and direction are very weak. Connery's charisma and appearance on the screen are the only virtue of the film. Manipulation, violence and ridicule. 2/10 Avoid.
