The films of children's actors have been up in the back since the beginning. While there are some exceptions, most children can not move alone, and even those that may be annoying even after a few minutes. The children at Paperhouse succeeded in capturing the worst of the two worlds, as they are also very annoying and have no partial capacity. Short; they are trash. This is not good, and it's not good if you think that it's not really possible to take this movie seriously for garbage actors, given that this is their potential. This film is such a dead end, as is the case with this movie (not entirely). In his book, a young girl watching in a fantasy world created after taking a picture of a house is watching. Soon, it becomes clear that he can manipulate this world with these images, and therefore, his desires are determined to make various changes until they are afraid. Oh darling. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this line gives you a nice base for a fantastic fantasy horror movie. However, many fatal accidents are wasted. First, though primarily a perfect structure of ingenuity; The film is extremely stale. The midfield is played very hard and the result is totally boring. The lack of tension is another major defect in the film, because it is up to you to drag each line to accelerate the sequence, so do not think more (because of the lack of these ideas). According to the lead heroes of the party, she feels like a child's movie throughout the film. It should look like star children, but Bernard Rose had to decide on what he wanted to put on this story; the horror of the film was the best laugh. The film is also very unattractive and the 'romance' between two potentials is extremely invulnerable and provides a very painful look. In fact, if I conclude this passage in a word, I will choose "painful". Paperhouse is poorly moving, laughably plotted, very corny and boring all. Do yourself pain, see something else.
