this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life and I've seen some pretty bad movies. I did not like the filming of this movie. not all actors are known, and a group of comrades come together to decide to take their own films. but absolutely terrible. I have not seen a worse movie. The story is very fake and I just saw that it really took a long time to reach the end of the movie. there was no plot, it seemed to have been unplanned before the film began. The story is very strange. I did not like how much I slowed down to the point of the movie. This film has no point in filming. If you think of watching this movie, do not do it. you only waste your time.
