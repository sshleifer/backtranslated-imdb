I am probably one of the few people you have read Stephen King's book, this film is based on. As I read this excellent job, I waited to see the version of the movie. After watching the movie, I was completely disappointed. The only thing that this movie comes together is the name and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put on show. The main object is to live. But not in an arena. In the city, he had to go free and had to flee the game shows (I would say), the villians who did not sympathize with film characters. This premise has created a lot of tension and endurance and has ended with an uphill climb. The film was completely trash. There was no kinematic quality for this. I fully respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, but he agreed.
