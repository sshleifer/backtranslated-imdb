It's a good thing to work around. Poorly thought-out opponent with very little complexity. A scientist working in the field of communication sends signals to the outer space and receives them, and is captured by aliens. Along with his beloved lady, they occupy their territory and are given secrets about them. This process is treacherous. Of course, he has little choice. There is a scene in which he gives them everything he wants. This is a very long, stretching film that is small. The area is technically not bad. We are just behind a car, walking through a forest, exploring the building. This is to edit. I think that the story will not technically support more. Not much here.
