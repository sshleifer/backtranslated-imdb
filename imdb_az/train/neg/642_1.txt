Above all, if you're a funny admirer, you'll be good, I'm sure, I'm sure! Low budget movie! Largo had to be Serbian in comic, and now suddenly it is Croatian, pfff! Chicken producers gave a comic taste and strange (By the way, in the film, his father speaks Serbian and speaks Croatian ... Lol). Stunning N.Y. The crane building is a small average yacht in HK. Well-seen Largo becomes a loyal Tzigan / Turkish looking guy. Freddy, the cool "skarface" pilot, gets some fat, sad, average fat. Simon, the good friend of Largo, there is nothing! He gave a little pepper! Largo does not knife, but looks a bit snake ... The whole story is mixed and looks like an ambitious TV movie. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, adhere to some romantic attitudes in Paris to fit your talent or technology properly. Very bad movie, I just hired a good thing, it does not fall for me to follow the sequel (if any!).
