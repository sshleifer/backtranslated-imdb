If you want to see a mystery, do not follow it. Although Elmore has a straight line of Leonard, the film director is approaching the episode of "Dynasty", because the film's director is focusing on "character development", as long as there are long, boring talks between foolish and non-inviting characters. Some people can make exciting movies without real action (see "Exotica"), but this is not. Especially if you want actors involved in this regard, do not hesitate.
