This film creates some questions in my mind. First, how did Jennifer Tilly gain all of the filmmaking career of this movie based on this ridiculously squeaky voice and many torn facial expressions he has worked on? Second, what were the people in charge of thinking about this attack on the earth and the deeply modest movie? And the third is ... there were people who were deviating enough to make such a devastating decision, there was no one in the system - a studio, a distributor, or a place. You really need to look for a very long way to open up a movie so deeply ... and it is not even billed as a movie movie - it can be seen in any genre of film, of course. The film is horrific, violent and exploited, and has no realistic features. Actually, I do not defend censorship (I do not believe) ... but I really can not see that someone can do something positive about watching such a movie.
