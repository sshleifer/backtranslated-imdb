There are many movies about Bigfoot, the majority are not good, but at least at least they have a charming attraction for themselves. Sasquatch Hunters are going for it. <br /> <br /> Sasquatch Hunters is a paleontologist, primatologists, and forested monks who have come to a remote part of the Pacific-North-West forest. Bones belonging to a number of unusually large primates have been discovered in this area, and because monkeys are not natural for North America, this leads to a scientific expedition. Perhaps soon this monkey will discover the location of a temple full of skeletal remains. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film is made up of teeth, in the woods, resting, indifferent and substituted. looking for a group of missing members of the forest, walking in the woods, diving, casual theory and a solar campaign, for a long time to walk through the forests, to explore and explore a few finds along the way, to gather around, discuss how little they are doing that day. When Sasquatch finally appears, it turns into a person who fled in darkness only once (with an eye blinking and you miss him and the actual killing goes out of the camera). <br /> <br /> This movie wants to be seriously accepted, and the director tries to clarify, but no one will be found, so we are left with stagnant, drawn scenes. People travel around the forest to walk around the forest at night while trying to go somewhere and try to scare. <br /> <br /> Although Sasquatch perceives itself as something else in the film, there is not much, and there is no different identity. Except for the scenes used by CGI instead of a human being in a Bigfoot suit that's painful during the daytime monster scenes, all of this seems to be a ghastly version of King Kong. One part is a little modest by using computer effects to bring Bigfoot life to life. <br /> <br /> According to one of the films, there is a movie monster. . All this, in fact, is a premise extending to make a feature-length movie without worrying about adding all the ingredients to making people a valuable movie.
