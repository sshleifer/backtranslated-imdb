At first glance, it's a ridiculous blaxploitation flick and contains an impression that splits in this direction. However, the idea of ​​the main story is stronger than expected and is a respectable effort to describe racism issues during World War II. Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and old Billy Dee Williams are the best sounds. However, Stephen Boyd does not stop shortly before turning it off the type of star that shortens the ovary. <br /> Of course, low budget leads to inconsistency in production values. The places are large, their impacts and their actions are weak. Imagine that "Keeping Custom Ryan," Vin Diesel, is about half the same way as Caparzo, and then hit Hanks, Damon and Burns, and hit five Germans in a jeep. Nevertheless, heroic soldiers are striking despite the fact that heroic soldiers are not respected by the heroic soldiers and Boyd's racist captain, because the characteristic sequence of Turman writes in a magazine of his imaginary desires. <br /> <br /> In short, the Black Brigade / Carter Army does not succeed. But this is not a bad joke, but a respected achievement. It can be rebuilt as a very good movie, and it stands an interesting effort.
