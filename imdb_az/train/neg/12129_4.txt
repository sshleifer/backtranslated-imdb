Before this film, I had seen only two films by director Andrea Bianchi: a terrifying zombie creak for Le Notti del Terrore (1981), a celebrity sleazy giallo Strip Nude Killer, popular for horror fans for the unforgettable performance of human-kid Peter Bark. What made the film a particularly magnificent movie scene, but both had a special fun (and they did not have plenty of nudity). <br/> <br /> <br /> In a hotel where a prisoner is killed, a series of murders are reported. It is a mixed and oh-so dull, horrible film, when it's filmed in a horror movie: it's a real fight to film a movie when it's not flowing and the skin does not show up (it's four attempts) <br /> <br /> One of the only sources of interest to the film is its producer Lucio Fulchic used many of the death scenes. Cat in his mega-film Brain in the Cat (AKA Nightmare Concert). If you've already seen this movie then there is little reason to worry about Massacre.
