I am a great fan of the 1930s and will watch everything I've seen in the new Turner Classic Movies. So, I gave this one shot, after all there is a great Harold Lloyd, who has a great soliloquy of Chaplin as a silent movie comedy. I looked at Lloyd's silent films later, but I have to say that I'm a big Chaplin fan. Anyway, this movie was so low for me that I did not finish it. I can understand how limited his voice career is, he did not get a good material for me to work. It's very unforgettable after Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy, who talk about violence (and generally violence). I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjouu, because I liked him very much on Porsche Road, but his role here did not do anything special to me. Perhaps at least half a movie (at least in this way) should have been inserted earlier, perhaps earlier, than before being in a ring. We can say that many of Lloyd's supporters are here and that this will not be a popular review, but you should rate it to 10 to 4, compared to that price. Watching everyone watching it look like old movies because they can not watch you anymore. I recommend Kelly II a few years ago for an alternative to anyone who likes or is less aware of comedies, but with Patsy Kelly, another orphaned, turns into a boxing comedy and a supporting role, Charles Chase. Both of them were featured on the Turner Classic Movies channel.
