Opening was the best thing about this movie because you hoped for a passionate, well-prepared independent film. I'm hoping for luck, because I'm filling in. Since the "Film" slowly progressed through plodding, my thoughts were related to this "movie": Was there a lot of oil in my explosion? Should the actors give the PAY to the director to be in this "movie"? Have I approved my ticket at Box Office? Yes, dear reader. I saw this movie in the theater! This will be an exception to seeing a movie on the Cinema at home cinema because it will use it at home. Are there any restore values? Peter Lemongelli lived in a standard college "nerd", especially with a dog collar. At the same time, this "film" was trying to become a comedy, leading the family drama to a spiritual rise. It did not reach one of these fronts. Oh, and her girlfriend was absolutely filthy. His performance was just the comedy I found.
