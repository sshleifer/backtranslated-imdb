Bugs Bunny ends up in the South Pole by accidentally trying to strike in the state of Florida. Where he met a little penquin trying to get rid of an Eskimo. It runs short and the penquin is astonishing, but at the end the laughter department is a bit lighter. Eskimo really is not a foil bigger for bugs and I've just seen other shorts, even better than Bugs Bunny cartoons when paired with other well-known antagonists. So I can not afford this proposal with good conscience. But it is good to see him indefinitely. This cartoon is on Disc 3 at Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1. My Degree: C
