Despite being a great James Arness western, this film was regarded as the worst Alamo movie. Throughout all of these, the story has been terrible, inaccurate, and terrible mistakes! The four winds were smashed. Does anyone hold stack sequences? The Mexicans were thirsty enough to shake the mountaineers and the hills from the pipes. Come on! Brian Keith's ridiculous hat! Consumers must be away from something or something. Or just minds!
