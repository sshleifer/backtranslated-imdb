A friend of mine was in the game as a FEDS agent (as an unrealistic part as I said). DVD, I could see it. It was "interesting", but I felt like an amateur movie. Although it is a good amateur film. Indeed, boring and poor writing. It was probably fun to do and involve, but it did not necessarily have any broader freedom. <br /> <br /> If this movie is shot or filmed, we really should work. there is a really interesting story line and good actors. I am confident that this is a great tool for them. I wish them happiness in the future, and I hope they can improve the film's preparation.
