In fact, it was pretty laughable ... a "god, how hell is a movie". If the life-style film was entertaining ... i kinda ... to go on and watch ... but if you really think "Is this a good movie?" <br /> <br /> This movie, I was asking for the worst scene I've ever seen in a movie ... it's usually five minutes to film it, "this movie can suck." But you know it well. this film speaks about edgar allen poe ... does not try to explain anything, people who do not remember poe life story ... so I know one of the things that is said. <br /> <br /> This film is about a writer "ethan poe" with his brother "ann" .... they are both edgar allan poe and descendants ... or they?!? As you can see, people do what their ancestors do. this man ethan poe, in fact, etgar "usher" is the generation of "usher house", written by Edgar Allen Poe. Ann's brother sometimes shows some to try to rape ... The mother is also attracted by three different people on the same street (seriously, three ... they are like the back of her eyes) and even does not understand. characters killed throughout the day will try to get rid of the end of the day .... but they do not know. In the end, Ann shoots when trying to kill his best friend. he certainly shot it before he "nevermore!" this film should be seen nevermore!
