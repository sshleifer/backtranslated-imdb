This is a serious concern film. Even though the children deserve some of what they earn, sadistic were "little" on horrific executions. <br /> <br /> There were promises for a promising event at the start of the film because it was a work to shield viewers from improper security, from the joys of the future generations. <br /> <br /> For me, the only thing that could save a movie for me was Jack Nicholson's shooting and shouting: "Where's Batman?" Kim Basinger shouted. <br /> <br /> Now it would be cool!
