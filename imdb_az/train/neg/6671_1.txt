I felt this movie started well. I had to imagine and feel the state of the whole family, although the real family unity did not come to an end. We did not have enough information to really feel the pain of setting up all of our father's or his hostility to Tobe. You see on one stage that she is surprised at her joy, and in another scene she only takes her head. Another problem with the film was solved only by the end of the day, and I was curious about it. Any film that has long been drawn and painful should only receive an automatic rating of 7 or higher for the player. We look at all the qualities of the film. The situation in this movie is extremely bad, I just think seriously about the theater. This movie shot me and then shed it.
