Home Alone 3 is one of my least favorite movies. Viva Rock Vegas: It's a cream of this product, as it does (or down) with things like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones. In fact, it could have been worse than two of them, because at least they were laughing at me at least in the middle. It always pained me and cried when the loans extended. No other movie forced me to pain. <br /> <br /> <strong> This is the wrong place in a remote management tool (!!), and that these terrorists want it rotates around a chip. <br /> <br /> The spouse, the events, are similar to everything and everything else, but watching this boobytraps is not funny, unbelievably unpleasant. I did not laugh at once (or not like a laugh), or rather, I cried many times and hoped that the terrorists would crush the child. <br /> <br /> Instead of providing a funny reaction, the bird was dissatisfied and annoying. There is no good performance here. Alex D.Linz, as a child, is totally different and unfunny, terrorists are on the move (and they are watching their movie credits), as they are hurrying on the street ... and that is good. <br /> <br /> Some people say, "People, it's good for kids: good guys, guys look like this, but they can get a hell of a hell out of sight." Before seeing these, look at Monsters Inc and Toy Story Hell, even better than Scooby Doo and Garfield (see more sucks - see more reviews!) In short, this is a strange movie that has been turned down because it is almost completely predatory for money; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <STRONG>
