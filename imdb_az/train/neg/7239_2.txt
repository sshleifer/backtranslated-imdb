This movie is presented as a clever romantic comedy. It's neither smart nor romantic and it's not necessarily an effective comedy. The conquest of a character with a well-known "Tom" nickname is one of the most disgraceful disasters. The only saving graces are the moment we see Toni Collette and Paltrow's lovely face. Generally, to avoid it!
