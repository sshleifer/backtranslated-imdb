For a non-broadcast television series, this frank pilot looks at the young Canadian actor Shiri Appleby as amnesia. CGI is parallel to television business, and Appleby is as good as an amnesia, but it's hard to swallow as a super hero. Richard Burghy, who was acquainted with recognizing television, stretches for Appleby's mentor, but could not do anything to raise his tassel than the moderate level. We see a very bad sign from the beginning of the cartoon flying comet. Moreover, the scenes that Appleby trained for the Burgi's fight really laugh. They are a good example of some of the other films, especially REMO WILLIAMS.
