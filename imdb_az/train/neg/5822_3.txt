Famous cinematographer Freddie Francis (Glory, Elephant Man) directs this pretty horrible horror / drama film. The British of the 19th century, Dr. Thomas Coke, has a different theory about how to apply more drugs. This law states that only the investigating bodies of criminals will be investigated and tested. But these organs have a small amount of resources, and Rock needs more, and it's more refreshing. Being a maverick in his circle, he begins paying people to find out the organs of learning and testing. Desperate sleazebags Robert Fallon and Timothy Broom take the wind from this fraud and start killing people and sell them to Rock. Naturally, this kind of action results in worse results than applying to dead bodies of non-criminals and is of concern to everyone. Generally speaking, the story is an interesting thing, but almost everything about the Doctor and the Devils is strange. <br /> <br /> After the first fifteen minutes of the movie you already have a seating decision. The entire appearance of the movie is dirty. Those who watched the film in the 19th century at the top of the UK were likely to have a "ugly look", but they would not be cunning. From cinemas to cinematography everything is just cheap, weak and disgusting. Also, the scene of everything is simply packed with something you can not take seriously, and most of the time, when it is associated with the majority (both small and big roles) appear to be either visible or totally funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Their symbols are not crazy about nature, but Pryce and Rea are fatal to death. Particularly difficult to maintain the same emphasis on shooting - especially for Pryce Cockney, Ireland, for a long lagoon to Long John Silver, and so on. It is also a heroic act in a desperate street prostitute, because she can not see Twiggy in this movie as well as she can not move to save her life (the song is not so funny during the recent credits). Very trusty boy has come a long way: "I take clothes for chill" from the "flower power"! In this film, as it is as bad as the three actors, Julian Sands is hosting the award for the worst performance of the film. Choose an emotion, an emotion to give each other a funny, funny attempt to describe anger, love, happiness, excitement! <br /> <br /> There is only one good thing about Doctor and Devils: Timothy Dalton's Dr. Rok performance. Despite being surrounded by cinematic sewers, Dalton is very good; an electrically illustrated, but well-directed, man of power. The rest of the film was pretty bad, like Mr Dalton could not have been.
