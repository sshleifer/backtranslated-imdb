I want this Diehl character to be America's own microcosm - to see Arabian terrorists under every rock, to understand that it is their own acts of siege, indeed, if it is a good thing for all people, it will be rainbow and lollipops . We're sorry, Wim, that you have been neutral to politics and have made some incredible films in the past for a good reason, polemics are your weak points, and they make a strange movie, well-prepared for absurd characters, dialogue, and trick. More luck to your next flick. Another thing to crank is the homeless part of LA, which is about hunger, which is not enough to eat. Surely, these people will not regulate, but in real hunger these people are spiritually hungry, emotional hunger, and mental hunger. People who are unable to give it are self-respect, self-worth, and dignity. Yes, this nation is hungry and it is possible when needed. I'm saying that there is less hunger center in America, more alcoholism, drug abuse, mental suffering, and economic downturn. Hunger is a noble attempt, but homelessness helps a more systematic society and older people's problem. Although Bill Delx is good, Michelle Williams was still cute as a young (cliched) old soul.
