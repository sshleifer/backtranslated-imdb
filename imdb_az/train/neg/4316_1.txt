I was generally hyperbolic, but after seeing for over two decades worthy of the Academy Award, this year's witness, the poorest, the total oppression, and the most disgraceful example of my mistake that I have ever experienced, is the unhappiness to witness. I do not talk about the awards - as usual, there are many things to contend when you are dealing with winners, losers, and even non-candidates, but the process is always just as responsible for the process. <br /> <br /> Cats and Horvitz have greatly beneficial treatments such as "stars" and "non-stars" in the hands of "reducing boredom". <br /> <br /> For the last few years, everyone who has not been Al Pacino has been saying "what he has been out of play" in 45 seconds, saying what he is saying and how his emotions are behind the statement. It does not show any disrespect to the candidates nominated on the stage without paying the honor of showing their faces, to keep them silent when they are lost, to excite them on the podium, and to compel the audience to read their statements. All of these are called "non-stars" - regardless of the presence of these artists, most of them have only a chance to meet their peers and audiences. <br /> <br /> Stars do not spend much better. Winners of Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood's calibers are worried more than a comic when they want a few extra seconds to perform. Christian Chris Rock was just as inflammatory and controversial as the Academy, or not as funny as it could be. His opening ceremony was more than harmless as it was originally intended to act as Sean Penn (but not much) and was interested in his comment during the show. Of course, as with any homeowner, it was kept as soon as possible, and when it became clear he could not be accused. In the end, Chris Rock was something he had never been before: a non-person. <br /> <br /> Even musical numbers were run badly. Beyonce sounded good, but only three of five songs had to take place. Another example of absolute disrespect for an artist was given by Jorge Drexler to Antonio Banderas, despite Drexler's involvement and, despite this, he did not even consider to read his song. <br /> <br /> Cates and Horvitz could have worked harder to make the show shorter and faster, but eventually a life-saving show. We have all talked about the many speeches delivered by people we do not know, about the hearty production, the self-congratulating. But this night is not theirs. People who intend to celebrate have become an insult to those celebrated. Cates and Horvitz should be ashamed of the open.
