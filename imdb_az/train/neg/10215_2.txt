Cunning is a senseless and filthy, boring movie. Stranger Than Fiction does not have anything new to say but any of the newest stereotypes about anything, and is based on a fancy center concept that is not genuinely innovative in its original and uncertain way. <br /> <br /> Ferrell is probably hoping to meet Jim Carey's Truman Show and performs his usual screams (usually very funny though Talledega Nights). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Because nothing like being an old law student who abandons Harvard as a baker, he likes making people happy. Please. <br /> <br /> Marc Forster's attempts to jazz movie by using computer graphics serve to emphasize only unused material. <Br /> I will watch the prestige for the third time or see it. I wish I had chosen for Prestige.
