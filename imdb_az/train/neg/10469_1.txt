Yes, I admit that I was crying in this movie. It was such an incredible disappointment that I could not help myself, but did not cry. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) reiterated this. The first is to have a Million Dollar Man (former professional wrestler) program, and that's it now. <br /> <br /> Omega Code continues with the flow of character-oriented religious-oriented films. It was quite entertaining, but also bothered to find biblically inaccurate. The film accomplishes what is known as the Bible. This movie is very weak; from his writings to his leadership, to the hilarious horror movement. People actually make this movie difficult. <br /> <br /> Some of the movies seemed to be a nightclub in the United States or in the United States. <br /> <br /> Even if you have a life, I recommend watching this movie. it was dependent on him.
