Original "les visiteurs" were original, fun, interesting, balanced and perfect. LV2 should be a candidate for "The best first film to be a very good film". In LV2, everyone screams, repeating 5 times in some uncertain hopes that it will eventually become funny for the first time. LV2 is a terrible parody of LV1, of course, a parody of inventions. If you like LV1, do not just watch this movie, just watch LV1!
