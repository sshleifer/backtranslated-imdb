This movie was worth five blows on my "starvation card". In the mid-1970s, I saw that in Virginia. I just saw it, I did not have fun when I looked at it. It sucked. <br /> <br /> I thought that I was watching this movie, it was awesome. I suggest you do this: what was this mirror? At the end of the discussion.
