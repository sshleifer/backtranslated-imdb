<br /> <br /> This movie has a great time. The movie I found very boring also reminded me of the Judgment Day (Christopher Lambert). And "Semana Santa" is a fragile film in every way. <br /> <br /> Alida Valli is a beautiful man when doing something for this movie. Alida is one of the elderly women in European film history. I liked the manicure of "Suspiria" and "inferno" (Dario Argento). I will not spend more time with this movie. I will say something better about this movie ... if you sleep very quickly ...
