This ridiculous and subtle movie is, of course, the most erroneous version of Hamlet to reach the screen. The attitude of the nose to the material can only be described as vulgar; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> an Eduard setting it has also decided to use a text that is almost untouched, and often a strongly rooted dialogue in the Elizabethan mentality does not make sense in its context. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And Branagh, more images. "I will not be hungry anymore" of the "All Information Against Me" that finished the first half of the film (at least how it feels), trying to play with the dramatic crescendo throughout the Gone With limits. This can serve the Branka ego, but it does not serve Shakespeare or talk: When I see the movie in the theater, I have been involved with my wife and "Mr Hamlet and Great Moments." He keeps the most funniest and most delusional moments of Branag when he shoots Olivier and Klaudin's justly marked death, throwing Hamleti over the high tower of the monarchy, trying to slash it with the sword. Dane of the nave is royal to escape from the bull's eye of the super hero through Claudius' heart, with a heroic ridicule that appears throughout the palace. <br/> <br /> <br /> Although in some circles of this film, the tragedy is described as being seriously illustrated, it is not a show of a talented filmmaker's star at a time when it actually coincides with its own laugh. The Emperor had no clothes, and this Hamlet had nothing to do with a few laughs and a man's ego to offer an uncontrolled look.
