The movie was upset. The theater was silenced and killed, because everyone was ashamed to be in a garbage dump. I think someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and wrote a script with his dialogue since he was five years old. Martial art is 'complete', but when you put Jackie Chan next to the movie "The Matrix", it's best to see one of them.
