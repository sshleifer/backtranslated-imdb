I bought this series, I regret it. I expected more action, more objective picture, and more compatibility. It is simply a pure propaganda series, just a little bit of darkness, charm, or romance. I find that the actors are very weak. O'Donnell may seem attractive like Robin (with Batman), but it does not have any charm in this way. Perhaps she does not lose the child's charm while growing, but she does not gain adolescent charm. It is not surprising that 40% of the price offered in the UK and not even sold in the Netherlands has not been shown in many countries.
