This is a comedy, but it's a bad taste, causing a smile on the film. The film will win a picture of a few guys working on a child and those who are in real life in this situation. For example, scenes at the fertility clinic are not ridiculous and ashamed quite sincerely. A construction worker and a man with a hard hats are seen as a poor excuse for refusing the village people. The woman is trying to look younger than 20 years younger. Both are weak, ugly and completely unsatisfactory. In the film, for example, there is a variety of ridiculous and totally unassuming incomparable scenes with a budget airline deprived of any humor. The only reason for 1/10 instead of this 3/10 is a sign for Shirley Maclaine and a half-decent (old-fashioned) music, a class of anything above pic.
