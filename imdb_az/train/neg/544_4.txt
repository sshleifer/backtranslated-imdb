PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance (just me or is this guy always trying to get angry with the EU?). Some touch scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> KONS: All 1 hour (jokes were flat to say the least). Every scene related to Rajpal Yadav. Great foolishness in EU decision-making. Let me go straight, is he a good way to take responsibility for Akshay, finally telling him the truth, to insult her son's soul (in all probability)? WTF? He thinks that Akshayen is too soft to think of the death of her dying father because of cancer, but will it make her insult more? Is not that the only thing I do not see here? But the biggest flair of the film is easily. <br /> <br /> - Akshay becomes a tough guy. LMAO !! Every year we graduated from the first year of the college and received an MBA degree. However, when he comes to support himself and his pregnant spouse, he becomes a loser. LOL !! How do you apply for a normal job in the Ur field? Or Heck, apart from a place where ur life is not in danger? <br /> <br /> This is over. I hate this melodramatic shit. Everything is about to make us feel sorry for the nature of the EU pushing our throats. All this reminded me of a little bit of SNR at KHNH (I hate). He continued his journey like this, "I'm sorry for the sick person." For the previous man, I felt more puking than sincerity. The last 20 or few minutes could not be seen and therefore rapidly accelerated. everything. <br /> <br /> Bottomline: Waqt is a very dumb to call it a good movie. Discovered by director Vipul Shah, a story that is really meaningful in emotional fragile flowers and old ages could not pay less attention. Give you a few decent poetry pictures, fancy dresses, plenty of glycerine scenes and some star power, and they are happier like that.
