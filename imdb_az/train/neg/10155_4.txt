I've read some good reviews that defended and criticized the various aspects of this film. One thing I see again and again is the concern of the idealist politician, Megan, who is trying to change the world. I liked his character. Perhaps a 23-year-old politician is a science student, and I think I'm going to change the world, and I'm associating with Megan. Besides, she is cute. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify; looks very striking and long-lasting but it does not match his character, and he continues to show his intention to sacrifice his life to prove a point, he thinks that people who make such a show are sick, and I think he has made his own debate very well, of course, despite being a young girl , he is afraid of what he wants to face, and I think his activity depicts a young girl who is morally courageous, despite her great fears. <br /> <br /> Generally, unlike Megan's film, it's up to my expectations There were some perfect scenes with micro-budget standards, but the plot was probably quick to think, which is mainly the name of a dark humorist meaningless sl asher film.I love my doctor's sadism, he broke Megan's shirt (not so much for sleaz), but he suffered even before killing him. Chainsaw hick was hilarious. <br /> <br /> I've given this movie from 4 to 10. It had a good structure, almost no structure, and a mixture of good and terrible action. I recommend it for a horrific excitement, but a rough rough diamonds for this microbusiness horror.
