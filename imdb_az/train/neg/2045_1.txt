This movie should be the worst movie I've ever seen. My sister and her husband, Burch (2007), hired and took it with an accident. I thought it was a joke before the original movie. It was terrible, I was expecting to scare her and never did it. this movie did not have real facts about the true Zodiac clay. The filmmakers were not even bothered to learn anything about the murders ... just loved their name ... so they decided to write an article about something worthwhile. I did not understand that the film was not too early. I try to ask anything from every movie, I do not hate movies ... I do not want anything ... besides. If you did not give any stars, I would definitely. 10 to 1.
