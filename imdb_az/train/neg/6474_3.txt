It was the first time I saw it (except Jafari's return) and I honestly thought of it before watching it close to the truth. <br /> <br /> Life is a companion, I have been disappointed with treachery. <br /> <br /> The storyline was basically the first script with several extra symbols and turned around the situation. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, a melody that is dissatisfied with life in the land. She wants to be a mermaid. However, when Ariel's daughter protected her past because of protecting her past and when Melody saw her angry and angry. And he decides to escape and he becomes a mermaid. <br /> <br /> Life is not very bad, but repetition and duplication of the first movie is simply too obvious. And Melody is generally very boring and makes the film unbearable. <br /> <br /> Also includes all the other new characters, both of which are Tip and Dash. They are not as bad as characters - just do not think of Timon or Pumba. Songs are here to be very willing, they do not have the same magic energy as the songs from the original songs. <br /> <br /> One of the issues, in turn, clarified this issue: <br /> <br /> Ariel's original character while watching this movie. Beautiful, rebellious, exciting teenager "grows all", a soft, boring wife and mother, and her branded red hair is all connected. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that in the United States, in the US, other sequels such as Cinderella II. But it's not the same as the original one. But if you do not have anything else to do, Disney will lose all your adult fans if it goes wrong.
