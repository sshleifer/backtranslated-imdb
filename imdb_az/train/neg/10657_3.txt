There was a lot of hope for this film, and so it was long-anticipated; basically according to Kamal Hassan. He is an incredible actor who records foot steps in the sand forever. But this movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen. After watching this movie, the brutality and violence in the one-hour and hourly orange appear better. <br /> <br /> Hero, Raghavan, a very courageous police officer. Who is determined to investigate the crimes of wild series. In this situation, the oppressor finds the issues that are united effectively and approaches to solve the killings and draws psychological blows to psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students, but are fleeing and rebuilding. In the end, Raghavan will kill them after they have committed many innocent lives. <br /> <br /> There are two psycho-killings waiting for the retirees to go to theaters. Crimes and sexual harassment and aggression have been clearly demonstrated that this movie could have been filmless. <br /> <br /> Naturally, it is not something that teenagers and children can imagine in the form of a picture that is forced to watch this movie in the theater and forced to shoot in their pictures. Director Gautham must understand that the society and its audience have some commitments. Of course, I'll never go to the movies that appear to be Gautham's name on the production list.
