A sheet and newspaper campaign (as often as they did) offered a tougher and fierce piece than the ones appearing on the driver's screens. Claude Brook is, in fact, the American version of Claudio Brook, who works for many years in films. It's hard to find anymore; I would like to see once again to compare with other international horrors of the day, but I do not remember the way they are particularly admired. Luck is a downgrade for US theaters and videos. But oh, that one layer ... is a ship that I still collect the next horror.
