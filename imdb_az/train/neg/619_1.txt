WOW can be said when you read it or when you read it. <br /> <br /> I laughed at most of this movie, and the best game I've ever done is funny! I do not believe they favor the school! I have repeatedly played that scene to laugh more and more every time. If you make a movie like this, it gives hope to our films. Even the suit was bad. my 7 year old cousin might have done a better job to do so. I had a story that would have been written and worked well. I know that I have to follow the second part because I see it as bad as the first. it was a great idea about a killer strangeness, but a better job could have been done. Hopefully another killer comes out of a strange movie, just not like this.
