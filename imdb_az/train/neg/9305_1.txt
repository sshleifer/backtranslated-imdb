It really sounded good because I and a friend rented this movie. But we were wrong. The first of the operation .... wow ... the player was the worst, the effect was really bad - it looked like a college student. The area was pretty good, but I had seen it. The most destructive of movies was an actor. The main guy was the worst actor ... it's a shame, and even an actor tells him ... The only good thing about this movie was so funny ... if you want a good laugh ... stay away. I usually love the B list movies, and this one, but I did not even know how to put it in the video ... it's the worst thing I've ever seen ... And those I've seen bad.
