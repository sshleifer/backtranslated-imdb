One of the slyliest movies of the 1940s, the home comedy of the uncommon thrilling music by Kay Kyser. Keri, the director of the orchestra and the radio star (and everlasting college fraternity gateway) have been a guest at Spike Jones, smooth for guests and supported by a striking troupe of musicians. A brave host, where the poison drift imported from Africa and where the wall was hanging, called for a birthday party. Chindig is a creepy referee, a scary professor, a terrible swami, many giggly women, and three bad hobbies to fill up Bob Hope's pictures. Nothing is to beat the songs (by Jimmy McHugh and by Johnny Mercer), and is not sure how Kyserin was able to climb up with a backed elbow elbow after 1918. * from ****
