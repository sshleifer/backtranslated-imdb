I'm glad that IMDb is able to grasp the genre of this movie. I was convinced that I was trying to be a comedy, but I was not sure whether it was a dark or solemn melody. For a comedy, the flawless release of even the most outsiderable initiative to heroic spaces is until the end of the ridiculous "twisting" of the whole movie, which confirms how much leisure time it is. It is difficult to describe the real life of the LIFE. Did anyone in this movie have any idea what they were doing? In fact, you have to look at the horror of a horrible situation in the screen.
