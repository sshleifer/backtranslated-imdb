It was not good. The heroes were less developed, and only one of my memories of the previous movie (or not) contrary to the "new" personalities. I was seriously thinking about how Ariel's opening scene was so absurd. It was serious. It just reminded all the boring characters of the Disney channel - everyone is hyperactive and throws embarrassing scenes into action without any involvement of the story. <br /> <br /> The most disappointing part is amazing. There was an incredible and powerful voice in the original Ariel, and the whole song was tempting and entertaining. He remembers them and want to read them. But the songs in this film were not at least creative; as though they were talking to an annoying song, as though it were frustration. <br /> <br /> There was no one who wanted to make this movie, so it was a little effort. . . this movie will not need a new storyline, new charming songs and more warming and enthusiasm "See me! Look at me! I'm not too bored!" The mentality of this generation of Disney. : '(
