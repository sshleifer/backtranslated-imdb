This movie ends (especially) from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this is a "big" watch, so everything is bad, you have to move, story, photography, camera work and so on. will give you more than enough good laughs. The worst, the better! <br /> <br /> I'm not talking about what I think of this movie. A serious viking movie? This story is a curse, which is more like a masked comedy, just like the Mafia, meaningless, but damn funny. <br /> And watch the end of the movie ... dead.
