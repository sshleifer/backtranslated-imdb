I only know that I do not appreciate films at a low level of 5. For the first time I am very excited about this movie. Within a few months, he had a large number of trailer on TV and wanted to see this movie. <br /> <br /> On the night that I saw on FearNet's request, I bought some popcorn and sat down to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The story was quite interesting - some mates irritate people who are not suspicious metro. There is a discreet photographer with missing people. Where do they go? What happened to them? One day, the photographer sees a link between some of the photographs he has captured and is restrained by the butcher, or around him or her. Although the scenario of the movie was quite predictable, the film was the way to succeed. <br /> <br /> "His wife says," It's dark, look behind us, "she says. <br /> <br /> The background is interesting, though it is expected. "It was good until the end .... Then it was just foolish," Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. I fully agree. And here come the spoilers ... Look, I'm hoping it was some psychic person who was in contact with a mad clay, yamyamish. No. There were some secret societies that kept living things for centuries. Woo. How original is it. How realistic is it. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come to Lionsgate. You did a great movie, but it sank.
