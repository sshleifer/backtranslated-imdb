The main reasons for seeing the "Red Eye" are Rachel McAdams, a perfect performance and Jayma Mays, as a helper hotel manager. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy gets so bad that he becomes a cartoonist. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < STRONG> is a summary of the field. The character of Rachel McAdams (Lisa) manages a new, strange National Security Director who is planning to stay in that hotel at night. Rachel flew to Miami from a funeral, but she is calling the assistant until she leaves the plane. Meanwhile, if someone calls Cillian Murphy (Jackson), he is ready to kill Joe (played by Brian Cox) on the edge of his father's house. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All Lisa, So <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson finally convinced Lisa to call and in the middle, plane phones loose ties. Lisa is trying to falsify her call, but by chance, a man in Jackson's corridor is calling on the phone and begins to show his phone dead. <br /> <br /> For some time, Jackson beat Lisa and, of course, beat ... but only 30 minutes . 3. Jackson gathers Lisa (very large) in a mirror in the mirror and stabs her around a bit. In a miracle, he is only a 11-year-old girl who has heard something, and, of course, is discounted. 4. Lisa struck her with a pen on the throat as the plane dropped off, pushed her cell phone and set up a naked whistle for the passage between the seats and 18 passengers. <br /> <br /> Although flight attendants know she is a stuck passenger, the flight attendants are forced to open Lisa's path. <br /> <br /> 5. OK, these are all reasonable (if not very difficult). But there's a place where really stupid. Lisa entered the terminal at Miami Airport and did not have cellphone alert (every large airport in the United States accepted a big phone). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Jackson, who lost the Lisa door at the airport, dropped off the train terminal at the door, lost a little voice on his throat, but could still be somewhat clear. However, he is not concerned about calling Joe's man on the edge of his house. (PS: There are no trains at Miami Airport, but one of them looked at things like Orlando Airport). 8. Lisa stole a car and sank. Of course, while going to make a call this time, the cell phone says "low battery" and switches off soon (when we use this cogitative plot device?). 9. While the phone still said "a low battery", Lisa directed his family and his family to assist the timely shipment of the flight from the fishing boat to the window of the 40th floor room. moved. Of course, they did not expect us to see that the hotel was surrounded by the ocean on three sides, so it could be the launch of the rocket in the first suit and the loss of the entire Lisa-Jackson square. What is the story here? The original room on the 38th floor was one of the worst rooms in the hotel. Nevertheless, everyone goes out before the missile strikes. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa goes to Joe's house to see her killer outside. <br /> <br /> <span style = "font-family: Jackson came to Joe's house and beat her (we how can we see ... maybe another head cover.) <br /> <br /> Lisa first told Lisa, who did not kill my dad because Lisa did not want her to die. <br /> <br /> 12. The rest of the movie (about 20 minutes ), Jackson drove Lisa around the house and resolutely opposed him, of course, a real killer (that is, played by Jason Statham) would have faced Lisa (or anyone else who had not been murdered) in the first 30 seconds Jackson is stepping on Joe at least once without killing him. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jackson is dominated by Joe, who intends to kill Lisa. br /> <br /> So, my suggestion ... Wes Craven should continue to be horrified, or maybe he needs to make the "Red Island" together with Michael Bay (aimed at the same fool "The Island").
