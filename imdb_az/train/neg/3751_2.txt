I'm a big fan of David Lynch. However, this film was quite disappointing. Beyond background music? really determines the film's mood? Almost all the qualities I've come to associate with Lynch's job. Visuals are weak to say at least, while dialogue is indefinable and monotonous. <br /> <br /> It feels like a filmmaker is trying to make a dogma movie than an unusual work of an experienced director. I have seen many amateur movies with superb camera work, scenery, sound and scripts. This film does not have almost all the artistic qualities. I feel watching one of the Davids home videos produced on a weekly visit with some friends.
