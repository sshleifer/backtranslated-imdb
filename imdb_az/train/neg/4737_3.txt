I liked the first Azumi movie. In television appearances, I saw many ladies Ueto and saw the fair share of samurai and ninja flies. <br /> <br /> Given that the film was shot and created at Azumi, this movie should have a better job. <br /> <br /> When they were concerned about referring to the first film, they did it in a very weak manner. and weak. He is the best of the band of high-profile killers at Azumi. <br /> <br /> In Azumi 2, she's a little diminished and looks less impressive. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that it is a total loss. There were several good fight scenes and many top-level characters. Unfortunately, the film suffers from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The latter two actually captured the "manga" in their scenarios while the old one had never "taken it."
