Cynthia Rothrock (Man O'Brien), Manhattan Chase, 2000, is pleased to watch this movie, and of course, this cute petite gal burns the screen with his artistic skills and warm sexuality. Chinese O'Brien is disappointed by the police officer and calls for him to leave and return home and return to his native sheriff and his father. His father is old and the city has changed, gangsters capture the city, and local women began to make recommendations and were tired of the city sickness and their cities going to hell. It would be better if you can guess what is happening and if you're right, Tea O'Brien returns after hitting the big tragedy. Take a picture wrong, but Cynthia Rothrock brings this movie to a great conclusion.
