There is not much to say about this. Gammera is a kind of shooting breath tortoise. It is deprived of a nuclear explosion. He leads the land and begins to destroy buildings and tanks and other garbage (yes, almost forgot about the electric lines). At one time, in the early hours of the film, he is a friend of a small boy and throws it down instead of throwing it down or destroying it. Safe. Since then, we have to follow this swindler to escape, escape, escape, escape and escape after a little escape. For some reason, Gammera is listening to this child 20 min feet away. Oh, well, the plan is to put Gammeran on a rocket and try to bring it somewhere to be fired into space. As usual the monster is lumbering and uncoordinated (a guy in a Gammera suit). The Japanese army (with the help of Americans) uses enough ammunition and fire power to solve its national debt and, of course, this is not good. Anyway, you should know it. In Tokyo, many monsters saw stomp. It does not put down, but really good, because they can have fun.
