The soloist has all the ingredients to admire the Academy. Director Joe Wright has already written the best picture candidate. Trusted actor Robert Downey Jr. starred in a widespread superhero movie. Finally, the film itself is a drama. After being released in secret at the end of 2008, filmmakers and critics were proud of. Now I've seen Universal say that Universal has not delayed this movie to promote Iron Man-Oscar Buzz. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The mill and co-star Jamie Fox is not responsible for this mishap. Joe Wright is largely mistaken, but can not even save a story for a lifetime. Many movies are very complicated and inaccurate. This is unusually simple. A film about Steve Lopez (Downey), a newspaper reporter who made friends with a homeless musician, Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Fox). This is so. Ayers is not resonated with schizophrenic and Lopez's traditional approach to friendship. They're two friends. They start out as familiar with this movie and become BFFs until the end. The tension is as follows: Will Ayers take Lopez to homeless shelters? <br /> <br /> This material would be better as a production for television than a movie. <br /> <br /> Wright is a cheap humor to hide the lack of content. Lopez is a sub-field, fighting defiling raccoons in the yard. What is wrong with this guilt or pride and prejudice? These films were structured enough to allow a casual joke, but there was nothing to extend. Ayers' back story is fired when it is not needed. The worst of all, these scenes are not interconnected and appear at random intervals. This is the way to admit that the main story is a little charm. Nathaniel was a lot of violins with a toughest upbringing (too). This is a great attempt to sincerity with Ayers. She is a homeless schizophrenia crying loudly! As the film lives above as Amadeus and Beethoven, it moves music to humanity slightly. However, one of these photographs is not effective. All movies are related to Ayers schizophrenia. Finally, he is interacting with everyone. Being a musician is a nice touch, but it is a very valuable thing. The film does not fully match this characteristic to its identity. Take music from the top of Amadeus or Bethoven and no movies will be left. Compared to soloist music, it's more about friendship than generally. Nathaniel can be a writer or a film critic, and a few rows of dialogue should be seriously changed. <br /> <br /> This is not only a romantic look at Joe Wright's third film and Keira Knightley, the first one. Hopefully, this is an indication of how his skills are limited. His previous works are stunning, but the soloist is weaker than both of them. Universal universal protection did not agree to release this photo. This movie appears to be adapted for Imagine Entertainment (Changeling distributors). I would not be so disappointed if I had been released freely. The performance of a weak cashback can prevent the spread of drama at national level.
