I just hired the first movie because I loved it. John Carpenters also calls Vampires: Los Muertos is just a toy for hire. He is, in fact, an executive producer, and it is clear that he has nothing to do with the preparation of this movie (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?). <br /> <br /> A tragic story, terrible special effects, and Jon Bon Jovi's most convincing Vampire Hunter always. <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> Avoid bubonic plague.
