This is the biggest meeting I've ever seen. DO NOT BUY! The creators of this film should be a group of filmmakers. It starts with a plot, then can not accelerate anything. I would like to look at the painting after looking at the paint. The actors were terrified, the plot dropped rapidly, and film was shot to make a lot of work. Do not say anything about this crap movie. If you rent this movie, you will not lose your money. I really enjoyed the films of National Lamp, but it was a waste of time. Learn how to write, move, study, learn and learn directly. I have to file these holes in the film for the money spent on rent and time spent on the film.
