I really should have taken a different film from the commentators on this site, because last night the audience was halfway out of the dialogue (even I was not deceived) in a film show. The filmmaker, using the Fassbinder-inspired player, uses David Lynch's inspired images as he believes he is approaching a charming new land while presenting a homosexual wedding story. The speeches in this film are very boring and boring, as I imagined, as seen by the scenario of one of the actors, how disadvantaged they were. Worse, it's colorful as Miami Vice's episode. I do not know who this director thinks; Maybe it's Bunel, Jordovsky, and so on. as well as claims of surrealism. However, the problem is that all of the above-mentioned directors demonstrate a level of sensitivity that can create a disadvantage here. I used to understand the significance of this film ten years ago, but why do you worry about this kinematic tour when we have masterpieces such as Bad Eduction, Mysterious Leather and Show Me Love? There is nothing new to see here.
