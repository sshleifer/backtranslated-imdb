This movie was very bad, and could not sit on it without doing anything else. There was no plot. Completely missed and remember a joke or funny line deserving a description for a movie about a comedian movie. <br /> <br /> So how is it created? Is there a quality control in the movie? <br /> <br /> Watching girls in Bikinis was the sole propagation of this horrible experience. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to imagine Adam Sandler, who appears in popular and beautiful comedy, surviving after such exposure. It was not at least funny in this film, because writing is very important in an effective comedy.
