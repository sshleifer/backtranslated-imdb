I love Chris Rock, but I feel that this movie is frustrated. The idea of ​​rebuilding Paradise Paradise is good, but filmmakers have closely followed the structure of that Turkish nation. When Eddie Murphy reconstructed Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he finished them again - they were Murphy films / vehicles, not just a stunning remakes. That's why it was successful. If Chris did the same thing, it would have been a better movie. The fewer smiles she makes is a recurring attitude, so she can also have a concert movie. It would be very disappointing if the white man living in his body was a truck driver or hillbilly. So Hollywood does not do such a thing? People come to see this - they're like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent post and give us some good movies! First of all, do not make good movies!
