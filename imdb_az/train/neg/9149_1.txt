This film has nothing to show even its most talented shell. No one had ever acted in advance, and even the coffeehouses seemed to be stuck in place. Nothing looks rehearsed.The quality of movies is terrible. The 'most of the operation' is carried out in a narrow aisle or apartment, moving between the 'actors' that come back to the cheap cameras and convey their lines. There is no tripod and no compatible microphone, the sound quality is terrible. Even "Manos" costs are better, at least they have the appropriate equipment. <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ font> You'll have a long search to find more movies.
