I think that most people believe in the existence of extraordinary things, and this film does not impose any restrictions on trying to exploit it. The presentation was very interesting, well presented, and the graphic art was in the art, but from the scientific point of view, it does not work. Hydrogen is full of flying bleeding? They should be a useful Mack truck size. And then there is a possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with fantasy, just do not try to accept it as a fact. Some nations are always misunderstood. All the whole movie was fun, but I always said myself "brother, what a burden". If you want a FAKE documentary, watch it instead of the Tears. Or turn off the sound at least.
