Mel Brooks's suspicious comedy sheet "All Musa!" <br /> <br /> This is no real field, just pretending to uncover the baseless comedy skills. When Dudley Moore and Laraine Nyman fled to an ancient book in a cave on a bus tour of the Holy Land, they read the story of Herschel and Zerelda, played Moore and Newman. Herschel's life was parallel to Moses, and the river, which was to be found by Pharaoh's family, was also Moses.Herschel's late father, Ceyk Coko, became Herschel's slave who worked as a sculptor after Herschel's rescue by the idolaters, and finally Herschel was an astronomer for Pharaoh Herschel and Musa thought that the wing brothers, married sisters, and Herschel God had chosen him to free his people in Egypt, of course, Moses accepted the Divine Word, but Herschel was misunderstood. I'll ... break ... but the rest of the film is a series of bad writing scenes covering actors Moore and "special speeches". <br /> <br /> These scenes will not lead to advances, but a small story to stop a reduction. <br /> <br /> Jack Gilford plays a tailor. When you meet Herschel in the desert, Dom DeLuise may have three lines. John Houseman is a chief prophet, giving the same line readings in The Paper Chase. David L. Lander is a fake man who "heals" Herschel. Andrea Martin is one of Zerelda's sisters. I'm not sure who Madeline Kahn should be, he's taking a trip to Herschel and has half an hour on the screen. John Ritter plays a very discreet devil. Richard Pryor has a scene like Pharaoh, but the two do not appear on the screen because it is obviously different from Moore's scene! As a result, Zerel becomes a salt pillar after looking at the destruction of the New Sodom, yes, yes. Herschel writes ten orders and gives them all the glory of Moses. In the final scenes, screenwriter Herschel's decision to test and save this delicate film, feeding God as an argument. God turns out to be like all the powerful bull that Herschel spoke through him to command him, all around him, for his entertainment. <br /> <br /> Even in this film Zerelda quip "God is working mysteriously". Thus, everyone in the film is forced to compel Christian behavior. <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny. There is a lunch that will be found everywhere. At least Monty Python has had a lot of religious bases at Brian Life, in addition to being questioned in the life of Jesus, but here humor poo poo jokes and heroes are constantly slamming their heads. It looks like Mel Brooks Merchant / Ivory. Instead, the film's exposition, rather than the position of the film, would be betrayed by the church, but they were influenced by their deceitfulness (I know, not a word) about something they obviously did not know about. "Yes, Moses!" it's totally filthy and is ashamed of all this. <br /> <br /> This is assessed for some physical violence, blasphemy, sexual references, and adolescence (PG).
