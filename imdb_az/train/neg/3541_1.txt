Here's a movie about how your money and revenge will be regretted ... or anything like that. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> <strong> He prays his pride, benefits the enemy, and fills his face with all his money. When Jason Statham's character is already scared by Ray Liotta, he is crazy enough to beat Liotta's head on the final stage. Why? Basically, you can not create a mafiosis as Liotta's character, who has a wife in her life, showing the harsh manifestation of the film, and then just to commit suicide, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <strong> Okay? Stop the quest for wealth and find true happiness and inner peace. Be nice to your enemy, and it has confused him to destroy himself. It looks like the film itself, and it's not a bad place for a story, though it's genuine. The problem is that Ritchie is simply unable to train as a filmmaker.

Marvel's shooting of some scenes like comic animations ... why again? <br /> <br /> At the end of the film there are many topics and unanswered questions. try to figure them out, or just accept that there is no answer, and every viewer interprets everything.
