I was expecting this movie as an admirer of Notorious BG. I could not see that it was a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward, Notorious B.I.G. is not quite convincing or realistic to describe. Many of the story is the true son of Notorious B.I.G., Christopher Jordan Wallace, who understands B.I.G. as a child. Unfortunately, it is not convincing enough for his father to be good. Derek Luke is as sinister as "terrible" rods like Sean. In summary, nobody is quite convincing enough to play their role here. The biggest problem with this is that they are the actual people they are playing. Sorry and Notorious B.I.G. No information given yet. admirers and non-admirers. I'm disappointed with Angela Bassett, a very good actress, especially like Voletta Wallace. Notorious B.I.G. as well as film beams and dills. fans will earn money from them. I failed to tell you what happened. It is not near any good movie anywhere. I've been waiting long, but unfortunately I did not get what I wanted. I think that will definitely overtake it.
