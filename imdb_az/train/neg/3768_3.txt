True. Fred Tepper and his family have written, directed and produced a movie. <br /> <br /> Thus, however, he had to work well and work better than Faget, Titanic, and Native. There are some scientists and some forest guardians and a hot chick with big fake tits. All of these are really bad in the workplace, including hot crisps (I think it is necessary to be a photographer, but who cares for the bikini wearing). One of the forest inspectors said it was good for scientists to say that they are "professional people" because they would be terrible if they are professional soils or jellybeans or Ewoks. <br /> <br /> They say that they have gone through search trees, some of the strange monkey bones, and that none of them can only be bone bigfoot. They just walk around, and one of the units shoots in a fraudulent way. We all hope that we will soon die (a sister with her sister will be able to be a loyal, but really hysterical). Then they find, as if they were a Sascu ... That is, the Grave of the Burial of the Animal as the ape. Of course, I just do not remember the Bigfoot bones encountered ... Scientists and forestry workers do not think of such things. <br /> <br /> Then, Sasquatch and his tribe, of course, to win everybody's happiness and kill all those who do not love, follow the other victims and again Muriel and Cousin Josh (in a tragic trout tragedy (A few times in the zone), a believing plot, difficult characters, bad CGI (a person in a monkey suit looks better), and I'm not just that very good, so I'm not going to add it to shoot the whole movie <br /> you will check it; good for some unusual laughs.
