This show made me physically ill and totally left the English community. It was in similar programs and was Blue Blue, claiming there was no classroom in Britain. They always say so; "Go to your porch and find it ..." or "go to the garden tonight ..." - we have never had a "boat" and never had a 1-meter balcony on the 14th floor of a "garden" I did not see the stupid, the middle classes, the children behind themselves, with the funny old old plastic bits ... a grace to me and to go to Mama and Pope 's money, to cut your wrist or to overdose the cola ... you make me sick
