<br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is such a bad idea that you are trying to get the same characters with different people. If they could not get Sarah Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this way they would have cut their losses and would agree with it. Instead, they get NEW actors that are terrifying in their work. <br /> <br /> As I was in primary or secondary school, I felt as seriously as college play that played such a role. <br /> <br /> Is there some of these people? Is this the first movie? <br /> <br /> This film also parallelizes the originality in a few lines. I just did not watch the first one and threw it to No. 2. I was thrilled to watch the second part and was the worst show I've ever seen. I do not know any * EVER * turn off a movie, but it definitely went about 30-40 minutes later.
