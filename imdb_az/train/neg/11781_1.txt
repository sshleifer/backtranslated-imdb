The Baby Party was a strange look in the so-called Corleone family and was forced to become a violent act when it did not want to be part of an innocent young man. Part II of the cross indicates that the young man's new role, his characteristic desensitization and the full loss of the crime, show that his life is deeper and deeper. <br /> <br /> The first two episodes of Mike Corley's revolution are becoming one of the greatest tragedies in cinema history. Michael Corleone is now the older Corleone family. He regretted not only through gentle behavior but also by using his goodness and accepting all his sins and using his regrettable feelings for others. The complex character of Michael Corleone is very clich√© and opaque. An ambitious young disciple and enemies that Michael plans to use for his goodness. Michael's daughter is finally a victim of the ongoing wars, and her death is expected to lead to Michael, who understands that Don's entire life is in vain, and that Done himself does not have any flaws. <br /> <br /> Before preparing the Caucasus chapter III, Godfather Saga is an emotional story of an innocent young man's journey into darkness, and does not forget about Michael's roots and those around him with an incredible catastrophic end, which always abandons something important. loyalty Part III, Michael is a victim of a situation and always takes a picture as a person. This greatly violates the meaning of the first two films. <br /> <br /> The Godfather Part III is a terrible mess of a never-ending film. The last part of The Godfather is to claim that the only solution to the problem is, and the saga ends with a terrible act of shock to be a member of Michael's murdered family.
