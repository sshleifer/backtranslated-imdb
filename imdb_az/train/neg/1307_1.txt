It was a really bad movie. I'm a great fan of the Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our best friend Lamberto. I found the first two "Demons" to be entertaining - they were pretty bad, but it's really bad that really is bad. Extremely boring, the story did not go anywhere and I hated symbols - my husband's husband shed her pain and painless pain *** I was shocked, there was no place near Ogre's story. Perhaps the best actor in the whole film. I was very, very BORED because I turned around three-fourths of the road. Please do not worry.
