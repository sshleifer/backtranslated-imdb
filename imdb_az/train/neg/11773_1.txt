It's been a few years since I've been hiding on these boards due to the lack of intelligence that has been reported through the regular screening of this film in the IMDb space. I've seen this movie, the film's newest Asian film festival (this year reflecting the excellent selection of films, the green, the June Anniversary, the CHA NO AJI, the Survive Style), and every day I regret that this is a scene from the movie <br / > For this reason, I believe you can read a summary of the subtitles of the movie Metro Cinema. Perhaps I made a mistake. drift to my friend The description I have long wanted to create a fright film that is based on more pernicious terror than cheap scare. P was actually different. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> It's totally incorrect. In this film, there is a sub-plot built to look like the relationship between girlfriend Pookie and the reality. More lie. This film is titled "Are you afraid of darkness?" It looks like a short look in the form. This story was ridiculous and simply made the audience laugh and confused, and finally forgot about $ 9 after eliminating the attempt to see this movie with any seriousness. I was almost paul spurrier spectator, I asked him that he could laugh at him and wasted only 5 years in Thailand to make a bad soft amber-cum-porn that belonged to the evil alcoholic channel, and only the actress was taken away from your family and causing a small movement in the Belgian film festival it was. This is just something in the lower intestine. Anyway, hopefully, I'll leave everyone else without seeing this movie, it's really the worst 3 movie experience I've ever had, and beat the soulplane for number 2.
