Attempts to imagine SENTINEL as something challenging would have been tough. There are many problems. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas is known as Pete Garrison, a secret service agent for Reagan, who died. Years later we find Pete assigned to the Whitehouse Family, primarily as guardian for the First Lady (Kim Basinger, L.A. Gaza). Difficulties arise when Pete is closely involved with the first lady and threatens the President directly against her (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete did not cancel the polygraph examination, he was selected by David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 TV series) as a surprising tool. <br /> <br /> Pete, in the case of the assassination of the president, to his people. His only friend is his first lady and does not want to give everyone an idea of ​​his love for each other (Pete did not have to carry out the polygraph in the first place). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he trying to get enough time to kill the president? If he is a sinner, how can he help to avoid an assassination attempt while fleeing a secret service? <br /> <br /> One big, big problem with this film is that there is no reason for the president's threat. What about the movie? Someone would have thought so! But why would the audience want to kill the assassin (s)? Hmm. Someone forget to put a violin somewhere? <br /> What is David Breckinridge's (Kiefer's) new partner, Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? She sees the film is definitely put in $ - a candy. Again, what was the purpose? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < the answer to the answers given by those who failed to watch the movie.
