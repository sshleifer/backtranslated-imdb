First, I'm not an admirer of everything else that eats new things in the genre of the movie, but because of the fact that my next movie is the worst movie of my neighbor, I'm a bad movie afficionado. This is one. So we're starting to watch it. First of all - three times a video camera is recorded! Secondly, the whispered white doctor's voice is dubbed by a big black man! Third, the dialogue has no meaning. Fourth, though zombie scenes, weak makeup and tomato paste are weak and confused, the director (and his next neighbor neighbor) is in need of psychological help. It's about 5 minutes funny, but it's old-fashioned. A weak dumbled high school with zombie is so amateurish watching video snails. A note to everyone involved in this movie - I would like to watch 20 minutes of my life before I go to sleep.
