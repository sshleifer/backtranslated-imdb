It should be the worst "comedy" I've ever seen in my life. Can not Stiller, Jack Black, and Christopher Walken make me a brave homeless man? Something should be wrong with this picture. This is the only movie I feel like leaving me. I've used free transitions and want my money to be refunded. I can honestly say that the only film I saw worse than this movie was THE DEATH HOUSE. Articles ONLY. worse. movie Unfortunately, it was a little laugh at the scene day and night. It's more fun to spend 2 hours on something that's billed like a comedy, right? I do not know, the filmmakers think that the "flan" is a comic word or something. And another jogger joke really burns a horse horse - literally.
