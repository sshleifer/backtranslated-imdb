It's the same thing to tell another story in a long line drawn by people who think they know how to operate the camera. Within 15 minutes, all the places are placed in just a few lines, so there is no secret, and therefore eliminates no tension. Only half a dozen adult actors are killed for 10 minutes, so we're stupid characters who run around stupid things. Low-budget movies can not afford expensive special effects, so the CGI part was surprisingly unimpressive but at least a valid attempt. The Creation costume emphasizes the dark-colored eyes that are scary and directed by the mirror as seen on the sidewalk. The dialogue is calm and thirsty with a series of reminiscent of foreigners or Terminator. The last action sequence occurs in a police station, as well as a break from the Terminator, and everyone is hiding in a cupboard that Darkwolf can not enter inside. In the end, the girl names her hero as "a good protector", but she gets her true Protector and at least three people on both sides, does not recall many policemen, kills all without a good shot, despite a silver bullet and a backpack. But there is a real window for bad writing: it could kill the animal after the initial credits while holding the stripper while blinking red eyes. Instead, they were taken into custody.!?
