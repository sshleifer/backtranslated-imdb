A noble effort, in my opinion, but ultimately a poor one. Before seeing this movie I did not feel "Bartleby, The Scrivener". After seeing, I still do. Unfortunately, only those who read the story will understand what is happening and will face the unnecessary versions of the movie (moving from New York to London, renewed from 1850 to 1970). Paul Scofield's real talent even looks at me as a good thing, but can not make a mistake for Melville's metaphysical classic movie.
