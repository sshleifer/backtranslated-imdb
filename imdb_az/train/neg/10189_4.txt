I've seen this movie a few years ago and I was amazed ... but still I was 12 years old. I recently looked back and would like time back. This movie is pretty bad. I want to see a film where Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (See My Bodyguard (1980)), where he is a heroic (also playing with Bill Murray) for some laughs and Burgess Meredith, in this role <br /> Anyway , Lee Majors character, Franklyn Hart, is a car driver who is planning to drive a race car across the country (his car parked). One problem: The government has banned all private transport. I thought the concept was ok (I heard it was not bad), but the execution was a creepy failure.
