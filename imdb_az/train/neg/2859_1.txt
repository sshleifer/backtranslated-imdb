The 2007 CG is bad for a film shot in 1998. In a part of the film, a dinosaur actually has a well-behaved action, but it's only worse than the over-the-counter amateur work in CG. <br /> <br /> In this film, writing, action, leadership and everything else is just scary. It's bad if it's not from Raptor Island and is not better than 100 million! Again, as with other films, only a scary section about this film is actually produced and broadcasted on the Science Channel. </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> < / STRONG> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> is one of those who are sarcastic in their own eyes or someone who works in this movie.
