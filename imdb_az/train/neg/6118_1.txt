This is not a very good way of telling the Tarzan epos. There was only one reason for this film. John Derek wanted to show inside his buff with his beautiful wife! Bo Derek '10 was at least a humorous film and caused nudity and sex. This movie is nothing more than gentle pornography. If you look like this, well, go ahead and come back! This film (like Bolero) was again a tool to show his horrible actor for Bo Derek. She is a beautiful woman, but her post is more interesting than this movie! Richard Harris was a better player; this is one of his few mistakes! Do not waste time in this movie ... Buy the book instead.
