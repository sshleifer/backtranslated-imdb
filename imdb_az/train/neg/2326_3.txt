Dr. Mordried is scared. I will not see it if any adult or child is already screaming. There is a lot of shit in this movie, but I'm frustrated. In the eyes of the stars, there are eyes in the sky on the back of the stars. Only the devil could have imagined such bad things. I rented every copy I could get from local video stores and hit them on a five-pound crucifixion. This movie must be locked in a basement behind the 4th dimension with all the other disgusting animals of paradise. That's where this movie is. If you want some scandalous entertainment, rent and rent out all the dogs in paradise or outside the angels. These films are worth seeing. If you want to commit a sin and to love horrible movies, Dr. You need to see Mordridi.
