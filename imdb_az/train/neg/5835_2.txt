Based on the novel Richard Condon, who has been involved in a conspiracy that killed the president of the United States 20 years ago, OPEN KILLS. Kondon knew that Manchurian, who was dealing with a similar topic and waiting to see a clever tire, wrote me cold KILLS. It's a tension - this is a piece of worthless crap, perhaps the worst movie I've seen in this month, and the guy saw a lot of bad movies in June. The problem lies in both the direction and the script, and if William Richert is seen as responsible, it should be completely blamed for this groundless Persian <br /> Two things are wrong in this movie. First of all, everything is best presented in the best way possible. Not like the OTT, James Bond says something with David Niven and Peter Sellers, but everything has an indefinable edge with the performance of the actors. If the movie had the value of entertainment, it could have been justified, but nothing. As a satire, it is very awful, so silly that it is almost unwatchable. Secondly, because scenes appear to be cut off, they are meaningless. For example, the hero faces a militia leader called Dawson. When describing a 30-second hero, Dawson cut the one on the plane. Scenes will not start and end with no heart and intention <br /> <br /> It is a difficult movie that is hard to sit
