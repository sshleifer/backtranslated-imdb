College student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is full of ghoul's nightmares in a cellar in Alcatraz. He cut his own hand, poured out the worms, opened his chest, and fired from the open fire. After seeing the "6 feet" sign on the bedside, a useful, cautious, discreet teacher (Donna Denton) claims that they are attacking Alcatraz against their fears. Certainly, no one will be able to stop things around when they go in the middle of the night! <br /> <br /> The group is stranded, and Alex's brother, Richard Role, is killing and killing everyone. Tony Beth Sammy Mitchell of Mickey's fame appears to be a useful ghost, the lead singer of the Bodybag band. She teaches Alex how to get out of her body, and rock music dances try to get away with the recurrent nightmare. All of the victims appear to be clever ghosts with the character of Griffin Dunne in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. The scenario is full of gaps in comedy, cheersy dialogue and excitement attempts. Good FX work and cool boot loans (both Ernest D. Farino) are worth the only thing. <br /> <br /> In some of his films, he sings songs "Burj" and "Devo" ("Whip It"). <br /> <br />
