I have never seen the original movie in the series ... I hope this is a very good movie made only in the 1980s, and I do not think these two terrible later were justified. This film was a really good lead when it was advertised to be featured on one of the old independent stations, which is part of the past. Anyway, this would be a pretty good scary movie. However, a film that would shoot some Walt Disney films was dark. Indeed, it was a lightweight bundle of no beach that was said to be invisible to the film. As seen in a very heavy rainfall, only one real marking ends, and there is no sign of a living being really disappointed as another child. According to the story, everything killed by the old evil hunters and after the creatures of the purple clay, and the children go out to help a few casual ladies in the woods loving him or her to shoot random boats through the water. I would not be worth watching, but I would like to see the original, giving a similar producer a unique purple life of the 80s, but made a very good slasher movie of the 70s in The Town of the Dreaded Sundown.
