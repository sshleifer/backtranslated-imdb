Although this genre is an admirer, this program did not do it for me. The main factor that frustrated me was that the main character was not a dominant scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < It reminded Hudson Hawk, as the main character was on every scene, and I hope to engage more with the audience of this program's writers. I do not doubt the talent and crew's talent, just after watching things like "wire" I came to expect great things from the police drama.
