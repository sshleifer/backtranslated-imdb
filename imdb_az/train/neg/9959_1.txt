Cheap and manipulative. This movie has no heart. <br /> <br /> This is a strange dialogue, unconvincing characters and an unhappy or non-existent story. <br /> <br /> And HEDGEHOG !!!! How cheap can it take to shoot several films? <br /> <br /> Indeed, the hedgehog has given the most convincing and spectacular performance in this ninety minute cringe-athon. <br /> <br /> Do not think if you're watching this movie. Sorry, but I can not find a single payment feature for this movie. This calculates the big, greasy ZERO with me. Definitely for Alt-Dogma pants-wetters. Yawneroony! <br /> <br /> If Dancing In the Dark Yet <br /> <br />
