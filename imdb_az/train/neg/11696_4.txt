I began watching this movie down with expectations, in fact I just felt it, I can not read the novel. <br /> <br /> I am happy that my expectations are low because the movie is not close to something good, but it is interesting. The story that really drives this story is done by the director and actors. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> ">"> <br /> <br /> My vote is 4/10.
