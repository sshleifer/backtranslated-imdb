If you're twelve, this movie really is not worth it. Of course, B is a film with a low budget with actors and sometimes with a genre like fantasy that requires a CGI job that is not good at times. I knew it would be bad when I rent it. I laugh at bad movies. I did not know how bad it was. After 2 hours, it really begins to burn. The style of war is in line with the laws of physics and wars, which goes between the normal struggle. There are no comments for transitions. There is a plot, but there is still a kid's movie. As you can see, there are clear moral lessons of the day, which is presented as Sesame street or something. Unbearable. But you'll be better, I say, nine.
