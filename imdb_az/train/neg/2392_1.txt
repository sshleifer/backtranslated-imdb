We actually watched twice in the theater twice this time, because we did not believe how bad it was for the first time. Maybe we have left something ... or something missing is missing out on preproduction. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <strong> <br / The first problem of the movie is to do this and the rest of the train remained there. Indeed, nothing works - it's not blessed. Some nice external photography curls up with a random camera placement on the inside shooting. All actors are least concerned - Angie Dickenson was killed in a positive way - Unlike Rain Phoenix, he is unaware of how dangerous he is. Dialogue is a long, invulnerable madness. Fields are not meaningful in second seconds and there is no relationship between them. <br /> <br /> According to one of the films, the film is being shot. <br /> <br /> It's too bad to be funny; it's just heartbreaking. Gus van Zant has made other great movies and I encourage you to see and I'm happy (and learned) to live in this confusion.
