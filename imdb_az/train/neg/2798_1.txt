This movie is bad. If you're thinking of watching it, there's only one good scene in the movie and it takes about 5 seconds (topless scene of Amanda Carraway). The rest of the movie is horrible. I think that the higher school is playing, and probably better. Land is meaningless. The set was pretty naked and it was not even good to have fun. It was just boring and very bad! I watched it in Starz, so I thought it would be worth it at least. The small description would be good. After watching sad music videos, she kills her at the beginning of the film for no reason. Transitions between the scenes are very sharp, and like some, put a ton of clip on a movie, even without thinking about how to spend them. From just one stage to another, it will not cut smoothness. To tell me why the sow is happening, as I have a random passage about talking about how bad the film is. The sound is somewhat less in some points, but you will hear it, then the "gay" thrown into the casual points of the movie loudly shouts with horror. Each time the same sound. <br /> <br /> Article: 0/10 Impressions: 1/10 Storyline: 0/10 Music: 3/10 <br /> Lame meter: 1,000,000 / 10
