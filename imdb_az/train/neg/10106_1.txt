Yes, I am sure that there can really be one nation. . . the fourth was cloned all over the world, and two were cloned several billion times. People, I saw this movie instead of renting it on FEAR.net. I'm a great admirer of George Romero's films, and I'm sure he would have been laughing if he saw this movie. What would you like to say is the girls who made them like zombies and wandering around Charlie's Devils? It really chose the unfortunate fashion show music as the music composer went to the killer of the zombies, especially when they went to the warehouse where they posed as a furniture shop / police station / apartment / apartment / room. in the background with gong and livelier argued about the indoor furniture store. I did not even help to illustrate the nationality of the murderer and his emphasis on several nations. Yes, you can expect from a movie that they take on the scene in a random battle, but there's no good reason for storing air boxes all over the world. So if you perform Mystery Science Theater 3000 or for all the bad C movies (C Crappastic C), this is a movie for you. . . or not.
