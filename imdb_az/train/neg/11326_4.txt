This is one of the two postapokaliptic fantasy films that Albert Pyunga made in 1993, and that's bad. As you can see, all the energy came into "Nemesis," an entertaining non-stop movie, and became more expensive. "Knights" resemble a very often a video game (new competitors always open and kill as soon as possible). The only thing that saved this movie from the trash can be Kathy Long; is not a particularly charming woman, of course, a miserable combat vehicle. As for Kris Christofferson, taking into consideration his age (58), I hope his double was double good. (* 1/2)
