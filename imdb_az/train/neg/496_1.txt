Do you think that you are a schoolboy boy behind a dark, uncrowded theater with your sweetheart? How bad should a movie be, if you're going to have to leave the theater and house before you finish? This movie is bad. Indeed. Movies are often bad that are good; this movie is beyond this stage of evil. Very bad. Too bad, crime against humanity.
