This 1974 Nashi trip was directed by Leon Klimovski and you can look into the photos and packaging of the public, which can cause you to believe that there is a middle ground between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania." Unfortunately no. <br /> <br /> This is a serious PG job with torture torture sequences, no nudity and a small edge. Naski (an admirer) keeps his belongings like Gilles de Lancre, "antiguo Mariscal de la Nacion". Unfortunately, it is more than pantomime. In this film we feel that we have seen (and have) it before. For this reason, only Nashi completes it.
