Above all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this film and she is just scared. This film is disappointing in every imagination, and all of it is bad. Couples with sex. Funny (not) horny jock. A cool chick with bony. Reptiles a locally-colored man. Parent-type pair. A virginal chick that does not die in these films strangely. Dialogue is in a very miserable condition and is delivered in a depth of a constellation pool. Almost everyone wants to die more quickly. Some time ago, I saw the film being smashed, but in a way, it got worse. Of course, Jameson smiles trying to eat his implants, but it's hard to even rent it. Avoid all costs.
