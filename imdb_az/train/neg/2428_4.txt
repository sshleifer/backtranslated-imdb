The audience will most memorize that the film is a very sensitive, weird, camera work and a bad headache that gives them a fast, mixed cut. If I had worked properly with most of the films like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh, I was not against stylistic devices, but there were many ways to do so. It looks like a shooting and lightning shouting from Mexico, and every important scenario is that the story is pretty thin and that everything is predictable. The biggest disappointment is based on how you can handle the end of everything. According to a film violent, violent, and morally distorted, it is not a sinner to be explained by the depth and character of the story, much or too deeply. Another disappointment part of the movie. I do not need any justification for watching over the conquest, but this film tried to justify the murder of Denzel Washington and was weak in convincing any convincing speech. The first half an hour or so is described in silence archetypes and clich√©s, and when the motion machine starts, it is cut very quickly that you do not know what actually happened. Thus, the movie does not work as an incredible drama / tension level or pure motion film. Of course, the film is not as bad as some blockbusters in recent years, but I do not understand why many people claim that this movie is fresh and cool. There is a very long way to the video clip and very few items for a movie.
