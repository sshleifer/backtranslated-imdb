"Major Payne" is a Hellfire film that lives in the sea for little children. This movie does not really offer much, but it provides many cheerful moments that cost one hour. But do not expect it to be a memorable movie. Wait for the movie and other people to laugh at your way. The confrontation between Major Payne and the cheating guy was striking, and I really remember about the movie, except for guys who want revenge on the great Payne. Again, this is not a big movie, and maybe a bit strange when you need it on a good rainy day.
