I went to see this movie with fairly low expectations and thought it would be part of a beautiful dress. Unfortunately, it is not. I did not want to go out of the movie, but I sat down in a difficult way. I went with my two children (ages 10 and 13) and even "How much?" They asked. After continuing until the end, I was interested in those who approved this script. Even the trusted Fred Willard could not save the dialogue of the peoples, the jokes of the state and the unique area. I would like to let the local community colleagues receive or release an online screenshots for a class of who wrote and manages this movie (loosely). At least, there are many books on leadership, screen writing, and movies that can teach you something about building, plot, dialogue, and pacing.
