Okay, first of all, I'm a great zombie movie fan. I liked Romeron's leak and I'm very glad that the Dawn of the Dead is being rebuilt. So, when you listen to every critical critic, this movie is still optimistic. That is, critics have hated Resident Evil, and although it was not a great fun, it was a fun zombie that had a half decent structure, so I liked it. However, it is a clean shit. Terrible dialogue, unfinished plot and video game scenes were included in the film. In their right mind, he thought who was a good idea. About this movie was Jurgen Prochnow, Captain Kirk (Ugh), the only film I use (that is, using the empty word). When you remove the name from the window, you can see it's in the extreme movie and its performance that can do the best of it. Everyone treats something else as Shakespeare does. And I can add too bad. Basically, this is the only reason why you see this monster.) A great zombie buff and every zombie should see the flick, or b.) MST3K, like playing a home game. <br /> <br /> See your friends and be prepared for unwanted laughter tones. <br /> <br />
