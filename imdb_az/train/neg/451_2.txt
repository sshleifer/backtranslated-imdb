I do not pay enough attention to the extent to which this tradition has been nominated, and this is stunk. I did not know if to turn off the kit or make a lawsuit against OJ's lawyer for my mental illness. I was rarely dissatisfied with this; Calling this stupid fun is a slap in front of every movie-goer on the planet. The whole story was foolish, the player was uninspired, 'drama' was emotionless. I am grateful for not paying for this illegal experience.
