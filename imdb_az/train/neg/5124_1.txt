I watched this movie in the youth group where another intuitive youth leader and his wife bent over him. Some adult couples from the Christmas party associated with a church have been mistaken for giving each family a copy of this movie, and now my home is in the movie (though she continues to be grateful). The sad tears were tearing over these sad events and why: Firstly, this movie has good intentions, especially you are a Christian like me. This film tries to put your faith in God and show you how to improve your life. Is not it too bad? Eh It can be a problem - something great. This film was prepared by a church, of course, every issue should be solved with taste for Christians as much as possible. Not all black-and-white, gray areas. <br /> <br /> In this film God's grace and will are expected, and it comes to all who make up his tender immediately. <br /> This is not God I know. It's not a Christian life I've met. I believe that God is strong and trustworthy, but not one that provides every desires. Although it's often difficult to go, I'm the best I'll follow; still in this movie, the football team finds it easier than ever to find it and to control it. During a few structured film scenes, we can not deal with cardboard fragments that run badly to the good side. Although I follow His commandments as shown in the Bible, of course, I have never blessed it as a symbol. The immediate benefit of my reward is to know that I am in my power; <br /> <br /> But take a look at this movie: Grant Taylor teaches a soccer team at the Shiloh Christian Lifetime School, which lasts six times. He can lose his job and he and his wife are less than money. They want a baby, but the doctor says it is sterile. Oh, and her car does not work. The guys in the soccer team think that they are crying after scoring millions and scoring too much. <br /> <br /> Grant Taylor has decided to rely on God for everything. And he had his faith in his team. So far so good. Not a long time. When they begin to obey them, bless them from their word. Suddenly students disrespect their parents; there is a great "revival" at school; the team begins to win every game; even win the biggest championship against the heaviest team in the league! Coach Taylor's job is trustworthy; the school gives a brand new lorry as a gift to her (meanwhile, the story of a shallow, fair airline employer); gets an increase; his wife (get) even sterile sperm remains pregnant! And the first darn field manages to score goals when the skinny child is really important! Wowzers, woot, summer, praise the Lord, etcetera, etcetera !!! <br /> <br /> Yipe. YIPE only. In my church, no one has ever lived in Christ. Yes, in my family there were many miracles, the gifts and the approval of the living, and I describe them to God's grace and love. But do not tap a faucet to turn it on and off God by being good or bad! It is a great secret; His gifts come unexpectedly, often when you do not need them, but you really do. <br /> <br /> This movie has good intentions. <br /> <br /> It's a long, difficult trick on the way to the film. However, due to its high reliability and total escapism, it is maintained at a level of 1/10. <br /> <br /> In some films, everyone who wants to shoot a movie is like one another. <br /> <br /> Future churches are planning to shoot a film: REAL must add some unfavorable truths to life, even the mix. Nevertheless, people who are very popular with this cotton sweat therapy do not learn anything from anyone. Give us meat, bones and REAL products! True life is true not only to Christians but also to one and the other "facing the Giants".
