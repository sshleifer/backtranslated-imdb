The painter has a wonderful job. Susham Seth Alok nath had a good role. Amrish and Mohnic were very good in their parts. His small role was also good.Arips a Mediocre film.The direction is mid-bright. Editing is weak. The story is boring. Ravi says about the famous pop singer. She has many admirers. One of them is Kaajal.Ravi and Kaajal love and marriage. Ravi is killed by his brothers. Kajal becoems ​​is a widow ... Ravis cousins. They go to Bombay. Raja.She fell in love with her and got married. The story can be predicted. The Climax can be predicted. The first half bores.It drags too much. maintained by actors and musicians. The second half is entertain.The music is attractive with some amazing songs. Cinematography t The first half seems to be just imaginable. Songs of the song are exhausting, except for "Sochenge Tumhe Pyar" and a rain song. Suits are obsolete. It is only watched for actors and music. Rating-4/10
