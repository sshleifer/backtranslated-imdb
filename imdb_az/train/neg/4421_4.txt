The subject, of course, is complicated: a group of people take the love of the game one by one creating warriors, kings, princes and fortresses full of medieval worlds. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that is part of our collective need to "escape" from truth and sometimes sometimes to our very existence - it is almost everyone's. Heroes are a predictable blend of Rings nerds and Lord of the Star Trek enthusiasts. Most of these people are enough to watch. However, the film is soon turned into a war-shaped subject, with almost a stereotypical arrangement of viewers, who can not "get it." Cinematographers take the subject of war, and this is especially important with the medieval gear reptiles and foam swords, giving you a more serious response to the adolescence. It is difficult for anyone who does not sit on his computer to destroy the last star to play 7-10 hours a day or to understand what the characters are saying and why they even care. However, filmmakers seem to prefer not to focus on the subject themselves, except for a strong narrative with a clear story that everyone can understand. Moreover, the heroes themselves are not necessarily such and are often bored: when you try to attract people's attention over 90 minutes, there's no big deal.
