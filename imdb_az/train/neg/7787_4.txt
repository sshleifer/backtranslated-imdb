This is one of the more exciting films to watch from a much more academic perspective than a fun perspective. Based on how much I like or enjoyed my rating, I have 4 results. However, I regard it as an academic film, although it is very interesting as a silent silent movie with sound effect and reality elements. <br /> <br /> Along with this, there are many disgusting elements in the movie that I could not find in this funny thing. They are basically worried. Some of the movies are also very interesting and there are some interesting insights, but some features (especially between mother and son) are quite disturbing. <br /> This will not happen. It was interesting for me, but I did not have a good time and I will probably not go back for the second time <br /> Academically 10/10.
