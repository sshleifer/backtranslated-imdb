When I saw the front of this movie I thought it would be dumb, but at least it would be funny. Yes, I made a mistake. Even though manufacturers did not go from one place to another, there was an interesting message about the parents being left alone and re-evaluating their lives. When it comes to the first couple of times in the pair, something foolish was relatively ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I love five lines of dialogue from some movies, and everything is fine, but it's still going on. For the film itself, I can say more.
