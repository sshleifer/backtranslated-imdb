I saw it in the "Last Days" and some arty movies showing some of Charlie Chaplin's films. Based on the quality of other features, I decided to give Immortel a chance. I left nearly this movie and I feel like science fiction! Story, the Blade Runner style is set up in a futuristic New York city with a series of similar discussions about sky ads and cloning / synthetic people. Unfortunately, the scenario is insufficiently concentrated for one hour and forty-five minutes. There are three groups in this world: human, artificial people and the god of Egypt. Artificial people have the upper hand and control the city's policy. People are used for robbers and eugenics and organ donation. Egyptian gods have pyramids (leaving a flat "patch" on the pyramid, complete with a bad appearance and a perfect futuristic pyramid will be perfect). The Pyramid is at the top of the city, and no-one knows what it is or why it is about it. I will not get over you with silence, but it is very unnecessary and there are many common scenes. As you know, the film was influenced by Blade Runner and possibly Fifth Element and Matrix. At the end of the film was thanked England, France and Italy. The film uses French, not English-speaking English actors. Therefore, it is clear that their French dialogue is dubbed. This is a distraction and I also thought that the improvements between real people and animations are remarkable. It does not help animation to be poor - it's better than video play. Skip somebody.
