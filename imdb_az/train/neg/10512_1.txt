For a reason, I hired this flick, Tom Savini, I respected his job, but it was an annoying clich√©, the half of the film was a naked woman called "fallen angels" trying to move in fear, oh and then sequentially "Blair Witch" black and white cameras was the scene. The character of Tom was really terrible, horrible writing. And you should love these lines. "Who's there, who's there, it's not funny." I wish I could give this flick 0! Character names. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but released Anthony, the Breakfast Club united in the unmanaged player forest.
