It was a movie I was not expecting to see! So, I finally got there and I was quite disappointed. The film for beginners has been described by a group of very few buildings, streets, bridges and caf√©s in New York. She really does not pay attention to the magic of New York. It's something else that's changing my mind. I know this is a remake, but it's not a repeat of French style! Anyway, as long and terrifying scenes here, the elements that remind the French films, no or little talk, and, of course, everyone draws the French style! The story follows a lot of lives (for my tastes) and they appear somewhat tangled. I feel that I'm not longing for the characters as in the stories. It was too short for everyone to cover the happy end of everyone. We can see everything about 30 minutes for about 5 minutes. And there's 120 minutes! If you like active scenes dialogues and products, this is not a movie for you! I gave her 4 New York because I loved her and loved the hill!
