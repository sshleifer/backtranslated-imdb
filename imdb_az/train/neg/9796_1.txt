Okay, I do not think seriously worse than the PR series. There are so many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, and so on. But seriously, the Power Rangers was GOT at the bottom of this list. Can you think of five of the six teenagers (who do not act as a normal teenager) dancing in the same dress with HELP DESCRIPTION ACTIVITIES? Fans, do you come across a real man who was thrown out against a mind wall and almost immediately rose and wounded? <br /> <br /> Power Rangers for 5-year-old boys and I believe that when I was five, I did not like this show. <br /> <br /> I can say that Dino Thunder is an exception. Young people are really teenagers like ACT and Tommy Oliver actually acts as a mentor, or a teacher. <br /> <br /> Many people say that Power Rangers is a shit, but I do not want to. Drowning would be an insult. So, a five-year-old boy, Power Rangers trash.
