The Priyadarshan / Paresh Rawal Combo went to the movie (India multiplex) with high hopes, especially after slick promos, so it became golden with HERA FERI and HUNGAMA love. Unfortunately, like HULCHUL, this movie was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Others have commented that they are the beginning of the film, without any advance development of the film, or layering. After a while, you want to finish the movie so you can go home (if I was watching at home, it would be easier to cut my losses). Akshay Kumar's performance is good, and John Abraham should not try to repeat comedy. The film's overall comedy trends lasted quite a few weeks. I just remember giggling twice as whole movie. HERA FERI, which consumes me, or less laughing at me in AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA. <br /> <br /> Paresh Rawal was a couple of the anticipated classic moments, but generally he did not have much influence on this movie because its role and character was given a lot to grow. <br /> <br /> Neha filmed just one look at Dhupia, and it was fun to look on the screen. And some of the songs are entertaining. Especially opening and closing of ADA and KISS ME BABY songs. Otherwise, you're better off passing this movie.
