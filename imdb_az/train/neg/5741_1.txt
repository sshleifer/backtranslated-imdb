<br /> <br /> I am a big fan of terror, regardless of budget, but after watching countless horror films over the last night on cable and video, the worst of these films. Bloody special effects (like those seen as a flaring blood or re-rendered frozen) and people fleeing from the left, then right, then again. At the start of the store it was staged and stopped there and was left for 15 minutes. Instead, it is dragged too long. Very few x5 budget. Many scenes were way too long. As the narrator liked, he spoke of a very small man. Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji and Godzilla, despite the higher budgets, is a relatively low-grade movie. Try to stay awake with 10 snoozes, one whole month, or better, as an unconscious brain dining team. Why-Did-I-Ever-See-This-Piece-of-Zombie-Dung-Blues. Magnificent bad movies epitome etc ... infinitum. -infinity / 10
