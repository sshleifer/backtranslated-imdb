What was the postponed man wearing an old clich√© that appeared in a scary film, gave us some information, and then exploded without a clear cause? <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that it is useless to use it in this movie. If you've seen the first movie (the first remake is necessary) then the information given is absolutely worthless because you already know it. In my opinion, the main characters are of no use, maybe why is a fool's head hitting him? He did not want to live? Of course, he would have died anyway. <br /> <br /> This is the second film called "Eyes Ey Eyes II". The first is the continuation of the original 70 films. It's a little complicated for someone like me. Look, it's probably part of the minority of my age, even knowing that there was less HHE1 than the original HHE2. And now we have a remake of the next and this continuation is exactly as named continuation for the original HHE1 ... it's just worse! But anyway. <br /> <br /> Wes Craven had the original Hills Eyes. Finally, this idea was better than the presentation, but he probably had a down-budget. To be honest, Wes Craven is a horror director. Only a few good horror movies (Science St. Nightmare, New Nightmare), a few alright (Scream) and a bunch of terrible ones (Luxury, Shocker, Vampire Brooklyn). Oh yeah, and he also made Swamp Thing ... but the original HHE2 fall under the last category. <br /> <br /> Now he has written the new HHE2 and has such a disappointment! Last year's HHE remake was better than the original movie. It was difficult. The main characters I had was a family, a beer and pot and sex crazy teens, not the fact. He made us feel dirty. In the first hour we were in hell, and in the last few minutes, good guys took revenge on the bad guys and felt good. <br /> <br /> There is no tension in this new movie. There is no tension. Only severe things happen to very stupid people. There is no dangerous situation here. <br /> <br /> <strong> Do not hesitate to kill people living in the Caucasus. During a conversation, Samuel L. Jackson was a day when Deep Blue Sea was walking around the water, and then he would be eaten by the shark because the stupid water was approaching .. I do not think anyone will do this! That's the same thing. People know that they have killed people, so they go out to get into a leak ... Do not they expect a potential defeat? And then when people think, another goes by themselves! When the heroes get their A-game and are still losing, seriously, they are not afraid? I would have thought so ... <br /> <br /> Someone even provides. This should be re-established for the first time as a "Fog" reconstruction (which is more dangerous than the Becker episode). Worse men. More time in caves. More tension. Most of everything. <br /> <br /> But in fact, she's down. Less bad guys. No tension. Of course, we have more time in the caves, but there is not much. As a result there are only two or three bad guys. The last film seemed to be the whole tribal tribal. Where is this clan? Who is watching them through the binoculars? Seriously, these are the things we have brought to this movie, but it ends with the same word that has been given to us by the same "watched" scene of the last film. Come on! I'll give you a devil. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> Gore (although most are sped-up in the dark), but without tension, and even care for the character ... in my book no there is nothing! Finally, you are scared. You will not be shocked (if you are not 8 years old). You do not feel like you are seeing something new.
