<br /> <br /> I had a lot of problems with this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some basic facts about quantum mechanics. Quantum physics is more than 50 years, although the film presents this information in a magnificent way: "Did you just blow up that much?" Yes, not really. These are no longer destructive verses. In any sense, I have been familiar with quantum theory and wave equations of particles, and so on. It is not necessary to describe it. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this film is to use the quantum theory as a way to provide a scientific basis for the imagination and spirituality of these people. I have no serious problem with mysticism and spirituality, but quantum mechanics has nothing to do with these things and should be kept separately. People who are interviewed for this film start with the ideas of quantum theory and then think about something that can change the environment around you, and think positively to have a positive impact on the world. and make our lives even better. Imagination is completely laughable and results are not logically created by quantum theory. For every "expert" they interview for this film, there are a large number of theoretically incompatible physicists. <br /> <br /> It is the source of peace. <br /> <br /> In some people, this film is about to appear and eat completely. Because it leaves them with a nice positive emotion. The film's main weight is as bad as attempting to justify religious beliefs with justified psychological-scientific arguments, based on its common misconception of the theory of quantum. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. <br /> Yes, yes. At one point, according to one of the "experts", it has been revealed that most of the hypotheses in the world have been deceived by men throughout history, so the assumptions in the world are wrong. Huh? Not fully monitored. And even if not, I do not see how to help her argument. I would like to say that if ideas are never turned into general assumptions, then I think that they are wrong, based on their own ideas.
