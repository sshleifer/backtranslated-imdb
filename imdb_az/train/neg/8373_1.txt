Particularly in this movie, I regretted this movie because I went with a good intention to see a movie that has a 12A certificate in the UK with my family. As for horror, this movie was full of embarrassing sex jokes. (It's not an adult problem, but it's okay to watch with kids). Sometimes this film is sometimes very rare with fart jokes, groin and so on, and most of the film is not very funny. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of the film, Sims, Calvin's 2inch midget, comes out of the prison and stole a giant diamond, but then has to put it in his bag. <br /> <br /> Some of the movies seem like she's been abandoned as an abandoned baby to enter the house. <br /> <br /> So far, Wayans Brothers - but this movie is biscuit. <br /> <br /> A little good advice - Wait until the TV or cable
