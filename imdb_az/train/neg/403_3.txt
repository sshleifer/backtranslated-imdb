Another violent, angry fantasy from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: he has taken his strange adventures because he is acting with sardonic intentions or completely forgetfulness. All brilliant visuals in the world (and some of these outstanding ones) can not hide a negligence on story, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who discovered the invisibility and took it to his spiritual bankruptcy. Bacon is usually a liqueur actor showing his dark side ("The River Wild"), sometimes to replace his boyish images; However, the material does not hate enough to postpone the Bacon. Other principles are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin. None of them are quite talented enough to make an impression and embarrass themselves when forced to believe. Fourth is a great deal, and blasphemy must be really stopped.
