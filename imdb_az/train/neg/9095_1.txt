I have many, but this time I felt that I usually do not write a comment. <br /> <br /> I am looking at tastes, and all this is wonderful, but when you come here, it's just a bad taste. <br /> <br /> I love movies. I liked the famous "B & W" movie "The Island of the Dead". I liked the films Scream and Scary Movie, because I liked these movies because at least it's good at least. I appreciate 99.9% of the films I have seen because they are telling a story that has not been heard before, and most directors only make a good movie. Throughout this film, "Where am I going?" I thought. (even to the end) "Where did these terrifying actors get"? "It was a joke." and so on. I thought I was skeptical with the obvious curves, but perhaps he "prepares" the film and did not waste my time. Sorry I made a mistake. Starting with this story was bad and rupture really ruined any glimmer of hope. Here's a demolition: Storyline ?? As the first film, which is very good, it is slow and sparse in relation to characters or situations in the audience. Situations are heavy and tidy and totally boring and predictable. Bending was terrible, it did not feel like an excitement or a VOW. Only "God". She would go back to most of the film and say, "Oooo it's not smart." At the Battle Club, there are flashbacks showing Tyler's genuine personality encoding at the end, and when you look at it again, you've seen a lot of work - really great, how it was written, corrected and directed. It was a trivial attempt to make an awful twist. I think it was "wild stuff", which was pretty weak, and I still love the movie because the rest was good and it did not work very hard to get a big twist. As its CI2 writer, this will be the best twist. But it was really thrown at the end of a bad event with a bad twist. The film came to an end soon after, and the whole film by Sebastian's story was gone, and the paedophilic ended with a terrible part of the film, with a young and innocent girl, who did not make any sense. Operation? The actors of this film are strange. Almost a bad "Sunset Beach". - Extremely dark and badly played. Even better than "Hank". The worst thing I thought was from Amy Adams, who played Kathryn, which was a harsh, perverted, and ill-acting performance. Robin Dunne was also poor. <br /> <br /> I have not seen American Psycho II yet, but has no doubt that she has set her "cool" style and has also destroyed the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a good movie anymore. If my son or daughter liked this movie, I was ashamed. But they will take into account all the good movies in the film, because there is no one in this movie. Indeed. Some people say, "Do not be in the age group of this movie, and do not look like this," I'm frustrated. Now I like a young person, and I love all the movies I've tasted very well. Also, do you really think that when you reach the age of 20, you do not like a storyline that is suddenly nonsense? No. I love "Middle Girls" and other common teenage films, and I'm always watching "Beverly Hills 90210". I'm afraid that poor directing, acting, and scenarios have no excuse. In addition, it was 16/17 while watching for the first time. If it were anything, if you are older, a terrifying movie will give you a better referee. I do not believe everyone can give 10/10, or one of my favorite movies is Memento and I gave 9 as I know it could be better. <br /> <br /> Everyone who loves this movie must change his taste. and maybe their lives and, in this regard, this was the worst movie ever. (Worse than Loch Ness) <br /> <br /> If you're not a bad-looking teenager, or just a bad taste, you'll absolutely hate this movie.
