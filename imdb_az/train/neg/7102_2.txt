OK, I accept that I watched this movie at Mystery Science Theater 3000 (I'm a great fan), but I'm not one of those who automatically rated the MST3K movie 1/10. Although I hate some of the movies I've been playing, some of the worst films I've ever seen have actually been able to use some MST3K movies. That is one of the worst films I've ever seen. (MST3K writers do not believe this one is one of the worst.) <br /> <br /> For me, this is a good example of not being filmed. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this film is that the dialogue is very bad, the player is worse and kinematography is true (though this is the best thing in the film). Several times in this film, the audience had to wait a whole minute for something to happen. Even though it does not sound very long in a matter of minutes, it can be a movie, especially in this movie. I'm sure it was a mood, but I'm very glad. <br /> <br /> "Stop kufr" is almost ten minutes. <br /> <br /> If you say "fall asleep" in a movie, it's a lot. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Only terrible, <br /> The worst and most probably the worst since 1/10 one of the dull movies
