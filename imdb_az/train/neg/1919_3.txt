I have read my book several times, and this movie is not exactly what you need. I could leave this slide after a movie. But there are serious issues with the film's creation. This film and its base is based on the events taking place in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city, and this film should be taken as a basis. First, the "small" city, which speaks of reception, is the third largest city in the state. With a population of 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city in Lincoln and Denver. Decoration of the second film is wrong. Grand Island is in the Platte River valley. Very flat with very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but it made me crazy to be treated badly in my hometown. It was a real event. Most of the city was destroyed. In the book they talk about biking on motorcycle park from Mormon Island. I think you will not slide for 15 miles on every road.
