I just saw this movie (mainly because it was Brady Corbet) and I was not happy about it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the computer graphics were fine, but the story line should be touched a bit. Also, in my opinion, if this film was evaluated in PG-13, it would have done much more with blasphemy and blood. <br /> <br /> This will attract more people to see him -> teens. More teenagers (especially teenage girls) will be involved, and Brady Corbet will have a great proximity to the Thunderbirds poster! <br /> <br /> Although the movie looked at the low points, I still saw it and thought it was okay!
