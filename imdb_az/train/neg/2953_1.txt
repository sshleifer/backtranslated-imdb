These reviews, which are claimed by this film, are so good that it goes well with it. In this film, Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli have no guilty pleasure. These movies were fun for their horrors, but this meeting of the dinosaur sprout was very painful. As I watched Baby Geniuses and Superbabies, I did not watch this bad movie. Before I begin to study, let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex refused to put on the New Line Cinema theaters for a bust of $ 35 million. It's the most expensive plain-and-video movie that has ever been released for decades. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A woman named Katie Coltrane and an ironic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly stop her after the death of a friend dinosaur . <br /> <br /> The solution to you is the movie of all the mystery of the film. Then you have to admit that this movie is really terrible. Whoopi looks mixed and tries to wing his performance, but no benefit. Theodore Rex, frustrating and rectangular behaviors remain thinner after five minutes on the screen. Most of the images pose a threat to pour people and hit their tail (accidents and targets). <br /> <br /> I thought the government was bad but back to Theodore Rex: The worst movie of Whoopi's career. <br /> <br /> Do not allow anybody to say that this monster is bad for being unpleasant. I did not see it while watching this movie. The movie I saw was a train crash written by Howard The Duck, written by some of the people who needed to be surprised at the Duck movie. This humor is at that level and looks like Theodore Rex Barney's inbred cousin. From the beginning to the end is completely painful.
