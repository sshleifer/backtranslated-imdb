<br /> <br /> If you think that Mickey Mouse can imagine a pimp in New York City or John Wayne as a Communist spy, then Pat Boone, as a guilty man living in her uncle's farm in Kentucky you believe. br /> This film is very stupid that in the mid-1950s it was not even a camp for sex love story. And the problem is that Holly knowing that Shirley Jones will not be killed by Holley to avoid any expectations for Pat Boone's "depletion of the screen" is so great about a woman's refusal to kiss a wife before her release. from their love. <br /> <br /> Cowboys have something to look like in the west without a gun. <br /> <br /> The story is meaningless. <br /> <br /> April Love Isartar and Plan 9 belong to the worst movie bargain building in outer space.
