Better Dobson, a sculptor of "Cleopatra Jones" statue since 1973, is bursting into a heroine ring in Hong Kong, returning to the role as a chic, super-addictive drug. The cross-pollination of Blaxploitation motion-flick and kung-fu B-movie is fun at the start, but ultimately it is a flag. The output break is corrected and Dobson appears less energetic than himself (he is still sexy and puts a unique spin on his comic way of dialogue, but it could have been a lot of things) for him - torn off. Stella Stevens plays villainess this time; She is good, but the predecessor Shelley Winters can not fit. ** from ****
