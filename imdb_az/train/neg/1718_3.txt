I read some books about Bonnie and Clyde, and these suits reflected on actual photographs taken from local networks, which is definitely more accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version. Particularly good is the death of Buck Barrow and his wife Blanche. This actress resembles Blanche's photographs of the day he was dead. However, this film is still a pink cheerleader during his death when the hole full of Hollywood and our anti-heroes is still full (life, Bonnie, the famous ambush years before the automatic accident was burned badly and does not look like). The scenario is exhausting and the player is weak, especially the results. Very disappointing. Click on Beatty and Dunaway. They can not be a "real story", but this is a great movie.
