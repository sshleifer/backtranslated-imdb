There are only two films I'll give up to 1/10, it's a stinker and a "man falling into the world." When I was in high school, I recalled the Protocol at a theater in the early 80's. The scenario insults everyone (including a high school student) intelligence. He has lost me with a "hillarious" lamp of a completely hacked one. Goldie Hawn should be charming, but comes as vapid and moronic. Thereafter, there are aggressive stereotypes about the Arabs, and then Goldie gains over everyone by spreading populist dribble. The player Goldie Hawn was also terrified. The IMO did not want to see another movie after seeing a document that everyone would not save on their own. If you do not want to make any effort to write the scenario, this is a kind of movie. The worst.
