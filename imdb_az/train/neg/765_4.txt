What did they think seriously? Over the years, the Columbo series has broken some of the new things and went away from the usual successful formula, but this movie is really great. <br /> <br /> This film is basically different from any other Columbo movie, but the differences are not for the good of the movie. <br /> Of course, the main thing that differentiates this movie from any other Columbo movie is that no crime has been committed. The entire film is totally different and places Columbo in a completely different environment and condition. And the overall is completely different and more 'modernized'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Director, Alan J. Levi, has made some other Columbo films in the past, <br /> <br /> This is the only choice that has been chosen for filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The Columbo character is also helping her nephew when the bride is gone after the wedding, because of a completely different environment and situation. <br /> <br /> In every honesty film will not be too bad, but the movie is becoming more and more. and it is more laughable with his story as it progresses. It's a stupid post-story, a story that begins to be more and more. The film is also more unwatchable. <br /> <br /> Along with this, supporting actors are not the most talented people around. . Although his character is completely different and the movie is completely different, Peter Falk is still good and his presence still keeps this movie alive. How can you watch this movie without it? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> /> 4/10
