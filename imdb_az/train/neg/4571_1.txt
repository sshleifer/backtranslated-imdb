We know what the body is and does not understand the mysteries of the universe, and it's an unprecedented look. It is provided with a paradigm of clear experts (none mentioned) that speaks and pontificate us in a comprehensive scientific manner. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on topics such as science, philosophy, theology, and politics, and collects it without considering its accuracy. and then somehow produces a few prozes and absurd results. <br /> <br /> We believe that quantum physics is a goal of our existence and that the filmmakers do not want to show their fingers, but have difficulties in answering other difficulties. <br /> <br /> These errors and irrational non-regulators. How did we start from quantum mechanics and ended with pseudo-science spiritualism and mysticism? <br /> <br /> There is nothing real in this movie, and almost nothing is clear. Any discreet viewer will be disturbed by severe hand-correction, interference, and imprudent special effects and lack of substance. The audience will be drowned in the tears in every subject that has been touched by the science of violence and science.
