Recently, when I looked up, I saw something really heartwarming, and even budget and attractive actors were an inevitable failure to see if they were really trying to bring the book to the book. With any objective measure it was a disaster, but I made my imagination easier for someone to be as sincere as the film of his Lord, and with money he could use the most talented artists and writers. Unfortunately, thanks to Jackson, it will not be possible for a long time. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was not regrettable for me at all, but that story was just not filled up. Fantasy offers many opportunities to make an exciting movie. In this film, there were many moments more interesting than Peter Jackson could do, of course, you always have to use your imagination for poor performance. For example, Frodoun tried to show the world its look. Or Galadriel's Sama showed that she was showing what was happening to someone else's home. <br /> <br /> What I really appreciate in this version is silent moments. There were moments when there was no background music chatting back in the back. Compare Jackson's spectacular sliding cameras and the apparent intervention account imagined to imagine each scene in the most intense and powerful field we're looking at. <br /> <br /> Jackson's films were full of importance, it was quieter and modest. <br /> <br /> Jackson and the cooperative sold these costs at more than $ 270 million in production costs, at least $ 90 million for marketing, a massive tax deduction from the NZ government and a great deal of NZ filmmaking in the United States. However, despite his marketing claims, he never intended to be loyal. This is well documented. Philippe Boyens said that after reading many things during the interview, he did not read the books again. Jackson, in the first place, said that the rings were preparing a fantasy film "across the line" of the lord, and that he really wanted one of them to be the King's Return because he was in a lot of battles, but no character developed. <br /> <br /> tried to be. Of course, many things were wrong, the player was terrific and pretty much everything, and his pace was very fast. Naturally, they cut a lot and adapted other scenes and they deserve it. Although Jackson has added many action scenes that have never served the purpose of the field, Bacchus never cut off the book scenes that did nothing to improve the ground. <br /> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> First of all there is an interesting similarity between the structure of Jackson and Bakshi films - of course, they can happen. It was a good movie, but there was potential. Bakshi said in an interview with Ongan AV that only animation rings can do the same. Its version did not work, but it could have been true.
