This is only a response from yahoo, which says that this film is more classical, the genre is MASTERPIECE, and Jaws is more realistic. Yes, brainiac is known to fill large nets (and sharks, bulls, black ends, ocean-white, and other types of tiger) in places where there are easy hernia. People often remove it from the menu, but the shark in the film has repeatedly been attempted to exhibit unusual behavior. It's not like there's never been. Immerse North Atlantic fishing boats hulled a few dozens of thick hills, singing a human nemesis, destroying nearly a city, and certain people are so laughable, to reach to know all the friends of the above-mentioned "nemesis" when it's close enough for the water . Like many of these turd to beat Jaws. It's funny. The large white shark is also known to be frequently chewed in boats, underwater cages and people in the deck and surf because they look like seals from the bottom. The shark of the Bruce size (if you do not know) can not dip a ship such as Orca (hey! It would cost more than 6,000 lbs.) I can continue but do not have the jaws incredible (better effects, better effects, better) music, better writing), looks like Orca (SOLUTION, Cumming, Legendary Effects, The Most Outrageous Thing Of The Olson Twins) is not a masterpiece from the University of Colombia.
