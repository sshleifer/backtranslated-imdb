It's Miscasting. Susannah Yorke is a brilliant young Jane Eyre and her performance is flawless. But Edwards Rochester should be 35. White-haired George C. Scott looks and behaves as an arthritic 80. Jane's late cousin is in a better shape! It causes stroke and drowsiness, immorality, and fright. It looks like a bullet killer who sends it to sharpen the ax. We were not surprised to have a closed wife in the attic! The great love story looks like a sado-masochistic nightmare. The trailer is pretty dark in the novel, but when Bronte's Rochester has chosen, it's relatively young, athletic, powerful and attractive. He is trying to strangle his voice with good speaking and singing, with a good mind and conscience.
