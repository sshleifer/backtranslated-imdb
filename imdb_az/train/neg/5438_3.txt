I'm an admirer of very romantic / screenwriter Michael Chabo. His novel "Wonder Boys" was transformed into a fantastic movie by Curtis Hanson. A masterpiece novel, "The Great Adventures of Kavalier and Clay", awarded the Pulitzer Prize a few years ago, of course, confiscated the Spider Man 2 script, the biggest comic of all time. <br /> <br /> Rawson Marshall Thurber directed Royston Marshall Thurber, as well as beautiful comedy pieces such as Dodgeball and the giant short film series, Terry Tate: Office Linebacker. <br /> <br /> Peter Sarsgard, <br /> <br /> John Foster, recently, has been in the forefront of the recent crackdowns against the United States, but has not been frustrated by a cast, including Sienna Miller, Nick Nolte, and Mena Suvari. He is faced with stars such as Art Bechstein, a son of a master who graduated with a degree in economics, and is in a state of imprisonment: he is a minimum wage worker in the Book Bar, he has a vapid relationship with his lover / Phlox (Suvari) less than one night, a party room in the party offers a beautiful, clever violinist next to Jane (Miller), who then goes to the pie and asks a question about John's life: human I want you to say something I never said. Do not delete this night. "Then John tells him that he wants a reaction to the city by looking at the faces of the passing edge, but no one sees it. <br /> <br /> The next day Janein's wild boy, Cleveland (Saarsgard), dropped out of his job, and soon, with John, Cleveland and Jane, they go to every waking moment punk rock concerts, deal with drugs, and drink a lot of alcohol, which does not fit well with Phlox, to whom more personal relationships, such as meeting new friends and </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> The movie, because of her father, Phlox and her life's work, because she finds freedom and expression through her relationship with Cleveland and Jane John tries to get us on the road when shaking the shackles. <br /> <br /> We have a problem with watching John watch the movie : no passion, no passion, or no target, she travels like an invisible man who describes the night she talks to her husband. First of all, this is not a problem. But it will not be more interesting. It is a completely passive character. <br /> <br /> In some cases, she explains together with Kogleland and Jane, but she never quarrels with ever questioning whether she is interested in her or not. <br /> As a result, the film and its supporting symbols do nothing more than the party, sexually explicit and get arguments. In other words, there is not much to say about anything. It's a shallow skin of a good movie without anything in it. Sweeping cinematography, noisy characters appearing in the distance, many of the sex scenes do not seem very important, straight and gay, great arguments, angry breeds, sad scenes and tragic deaths. At some point in the hell, Jane asks how many people are involved in the motionless actions: "What happens, Jon? What is this?" Yes, Jon, say. We are dead to know the audience. <br /> <br /> The title of "Pittsburgh's Mysteries" should coincide with the symbols themselves, as they are. They are all facades, one-dimensional stands for the actual people. The film never allows us. We will not know what anyone will do. We'll see a lot of them, but why we do not know. And the lack of "cause" is one of the worst things in a movie.
