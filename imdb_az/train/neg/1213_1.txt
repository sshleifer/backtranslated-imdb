I do not believe that Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger liked that part of the trash! The scenario is very bad and the weakness of the directive (and the same person) shows that it is difficult to find more dimensional characters in the film. Dialogs are so naked that they laugh at a few laughs who name the theater. It's hard to build, it invites you to believe that you're going to watch a thrilling tension, and turns into a stupid oppressor. The nature of Bassinger is so dumb that he really stands to shout from God, "Where are you?" so people can follow it afterwards, and then it gets a leak !!!! And then he entered the world's smallest tree by appearance, it almost runs on the ground, and the killing never loses its trace, and it's in the middle of the night. It's really a miracle, Hollywood's best writer can find that people spend millions on production.
