This movie assumes that there is a mysterious, serious tension about a man looking for a missing girl. However, the film is about 30 minutes, definitely becoming a funny, inaccurate story with random characters and random scenes. At the cafe accidentally Karate starts this blonde girl or she can not imagine anyone laugh when she "slaves" that old woman fists. Lines, symbols, and movements are weak. I always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but this year made some horrible movies; <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch the tension that holds a tense story. If you really want to enjoy this story, go to the original rental. But if you intend to watch it, be ready to laugh at your wishes and the final scenes; you should not take them seriously; This is the only way you use the movie.
