This movie was t.v last day and I did not like it. The jungle was the first George was a good comedy, but later .... absolutely terrible. The new actor and actress were not good to play leading roles, they were the original actor (Brandon Fraiser) and the original actress (I had forgotten his name) that this movie is a movie that you can sit and watch, and you can appeal to another channel or a movie you have taken back to the store if it is hired or purchased. It was good to see Ape's monkey, but it was not as fun as the first, the new George had to grow up as a son of Georges, and still had a little better in the film than Bredon and his face.
