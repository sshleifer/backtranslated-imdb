It was like a free-of-the-art TV show on the 80s and tried to be a soft-core porn movie. Oh, my god was bad. Characteristics of each character were of minor importance. The field itself was not something to talk about. I can say something about a stalker. Does he finally hurt himself? It's not really clear, but it's a kind of volleyball game. And the main character (Randy) lies around a lot. The only reason my friends hired this movie was because they were in Casper Van Dien and they wanted to move fast to the scenes described here. I thanked God that he did not spend any money, but I would like to return the time of my life.
