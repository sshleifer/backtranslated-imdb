The following warning Spoiler. Base-based leisure with real events of Antarctica. Besides, accusation, scandal! Shot in Canada; most likely Canadian crew and cast. I watched the last half of this film closely with the global television in Canada. I'm just saying how terrible I am, but in American history I'm a clear part of the revisionist propaganda; and Susan Sarandon plays the role of all people! Only Canadian-born director Roger Spottiswoode can accept that the film's heroes were forced to make USAF, in fact a small private airline located in the real rescuers Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
