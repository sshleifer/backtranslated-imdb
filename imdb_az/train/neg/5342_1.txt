Rachel, Jo, Hannah, Tina, Bradley and John are at the top level here. They deserve the Oscar nominees for their performances. I am a big fan of the television show. Their musical compositions and all of them are very talented! I'm a great indicator of SARCASM !!!!!! <br /> <br /> DO NOT ADD THAT YOUR S CLUB FANS! <br /> <br /> The performances are pretty weak, the dialogue is awful, and jokes are not properly executed (apologize for the director). These jokes are incredibly bad, with 8 little, passionate S Club fans laughing. They think they can do it better. And they did. They conquered the world. They were S Club Juniors. Paul thanked the lucky stars who "made a ghost band, an ugly man". One of the worst films ever. PROTECT THIS THEME! FUTURE AND GET IT! NO LIFE! YOUR CRY! 0/10 RJT
