Defined in a post-apocalyptic environment, cyborgs at the beginning of the war work over the human population. They are largely livestock, because the living human needs blood. When Nea and his brother had a child, he survived one of his attacks and crossed the Kiborg several times, but this time he was saved by Cyborg Gabriel, who was created to destroy all cyborgs. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Will take Jabriel. Low-cost x-ray cyborg / post-apocalyptic foray writer / director Albert Pyunun (previously Cyborg and also the "Nemsis" badge) was a fairly wrong tale with some interesting updates. Very few direct structured scenarios are included in the sparking story, like weak, dark, and excessive. Leading jokes try to be neat, but it's pretty wrong, and it's funny in unexpected moments. The majority of the actions are quite meaningless and regular. The goal could have been used by another maneuver, because it was inspired idea, which was washed with lazy inclusions, a narrative scarcity and almost jokey tone. Clearly, the post-abstraction result is extremely sharp, especially in the absence of continuity. It feels like money is exhausted, and it's time to pack up another day (or another decade), but it's more focused, but it's some good fight for its fast pace, and a slip cinematography that captures George Mooradian's visual detention background. just like Kristian Kristofferson's dry and durable personality, Gabriel is a beautiful, self-confident, psychologist, Kathy Long, who has experienced and aggressive stunts, but his player is very wooden, a looter, Lance Henriksen, a rude cyborg leader of a sustained saliva meltdown A clean bath, like Job, gives mouth-watering performance, and Scott Paul's direct cyborgs and Gary Daniels have plenty of brightness as well as poutings.Phon slipped into several exciting martial arts pieces, with some shimmering force and extremely slow motion The background is filtered, but the mechanical music is honey, with special effects and makeup FX pretty good. Expected, but not very successful, and minimal restrictions can be a reason for this.
