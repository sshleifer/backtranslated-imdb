This movie succeeds to be one of the most unique films you can see. However, this comes from the fact that you can get out of the confusion or make a queue. It appears to be a series of difficulties that have been created to determine whether or not to go out of the movie and give it money. If you do not want to make an excuse, you will sit down with this horrible movie and develop a sense of regret for the actors involved, you've seen better days, but then you've really figured out a lot of money to do that. <br /> <br /> <strong> Nearly something that Ed Wood will do will not be enough to overcome this horrible movie, and it will undoubtedly be his kingdom. <br /> <br /> The dialogue that opens the love you have not seen and heard, should be five minutes long. Also, it is narrated that the viewer does not read. Then we meet Mr. Slater and there is a dam for a horrible line, but he only works to line the poster tag line. Coming soon, we usually meet with Stephen Dorff enjoying it) and does his best to avoid drowning, but in the end it does. Then the last insult comes, Tara Reid plays a clever role, help us! Tara Reid is not a very talented actor and she plays a role in those films, in my opinion, she must remain true to the movies of the American cake. <br /> <br /> When you go over the video in general, it's possible to see it for yourself, I know that I got a shot from it, almost all of this is to be honest and to reveal the shortcomings of others.
