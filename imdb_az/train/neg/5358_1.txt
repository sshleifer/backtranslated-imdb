Obviously, all the good reviews that have been submitted so far know the person who is closely acquainted with the movie or someone who is so familiar with the film, and thus recognizes more than one person. Yes, I can not attract everyone, I've seen the last part and it's pure garbage. The only thing that goes for it is the many gazelles from the legends of passion and horror (for a very long time on the screen). The filmmakers made this movie a horror concept in the weekend and filmed scenes during coffee breaks such as Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman. This is a very awkward, ultra-cheap, captured video-wannabe X-Files, playing the role of non-actors that are far more than the ones that can be accepted in the 21st century. There is little or no action; this is an entirely explicit dialogue that tries to explain the meaning of an imagined space. This computer FX is a joke, but it's enough and there are not enough moves to make this movie unpleasant in a MST3K. Over eight straight scenes, you'll be on your way to the fast forward button ... and I will not go. Totally worthless.
