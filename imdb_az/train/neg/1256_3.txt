This film is one of the attempts to capitalize on an address that has been introduced to the director Tim Burton's 'vision' screen. He is Batman, Sleepy Hollow, and now he did it. This is not repeated. The only thing that is common with the original is that he is a sympathetic who can speak (and Charlton Heston is a community). Burton rebuilt the whole story and drank it for today's mass audience. <br /> <br /> Apes is the product of the original Planet time. In the 1960s America was struggling to recognize its culture. It was a time of incontinence, considering and re-thinking public norms. Insufficient number of groups was a civil law cycle that required equal treatment. In this context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical confusion against day viewers. The POTA was a very clever film that made it very difficult to question justification for a low-minded intelligence-maker, who gave very challenging questions and was gently weakening American society. <br /> <br /> <strong > POTA is a product of today, when it is sixty. This is Apes for Dummies. To replace the politically correct thing for the intelligent dialogue and to focus more on the shape of matter, it is superfluous and jejune. The end of the "surprise" is totally incompatible, and nothing will contribute to the film, except for a cliff that it later created. The ending of the original POTA, while putting everything together in a strong place, Burton's end was just angered by the audience: "I do not know if you know something and then you have to wait for it later. <br /> <br /> Technically Burton's film The movie is great as well as the make-up fantastic and Burton's camera is outstanding (although I still do not like my dark look), but the prosthetic makeup will not pay for the important document, which insults the thirty-three years of progress. <br /> <br /> The story monster The film is downloaded in support of Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) in a few shifts (like Ari, especially Helena Bonham Carter), and help fight the terrible monkeys that are defective. <br /> <br /> Presentation is perfect for today's fast food mentality which is very formal and straightforward /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marx Wahlberg is a good actor who just has a role to play in. Walberg suffers from the painful but powerful dark, dark heroes. This section requires an inspirational hero who is not in Wahlberg's repertoire. Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor, whose character is so loyal that this demolition is laughable. Therefore, Tim Roth says he runs hopelessly to do something of this kind, but his interpretation presents a cross between the college peace loving demonstrators and his lover's love. It is a virtuoso performance that keeps its film from being general in disarray. Roth is diabolically hated as angry General Thade. He has created one of the worst and most esteemed evil I have ever known. <br /> <br /> This film is a big disappointment. In addition, its physical activity is very high and shows a kind of chimpanzee, such as a perfect mold. <br /> <br /> This film is a big disappointment. It's a decent entertainment if you check your brain to the door. I appreciated it at level 3/10. Technically, this is better, perhaps 9/10. But the story is an insult to the original franchise. Burton is another attempt to fix himself, using a name familiar to the box office, so many people can see what he is. Of course, this is true, but he would use his talent to create important films instead of a simple thoughtful pope designed for mass consumption.
