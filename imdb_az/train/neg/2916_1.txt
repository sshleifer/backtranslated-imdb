This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Cunning and message are terrible. There are a lot of mistakes in this movie, which is also impossible. I can not understand how this movie can get any nomination, just why: 1) Sam Lee describes an angry / rational detective based on his father's hopelessness. Pros: He is angry. Deficiencies: When it comes to the scene of interpretation, it does not convey the grief / dreams of its father. The scene of this crying was very fake, and it almost astonished his eyes from the corners of his eyes. <br /> 2) To close the film, spiders or dogs sounds like a scene and a scene that has no connection with the audience. I understand that this is a metaphor or not ... but just dumb! 3) WHAT DOES THE FAMILIES DO NOT LOVE? This is a heck error in the movie. When a murderer stabbed him, throw him. He was already dead! What a heck? There was a lot of opportunity for killing the killer, but I do not know why! 4) The time of the girl's leg injury. At the scene, it became apparent that the girls' LEFT foot was damaged, so how is the heck that lends all its weight on the left foot at the next stage? And the actress shown as the best new actress? WTF? 5) The sounds in the movie are not synchronized. <br /> <br /> 6) I guess that this film is trying to bring awareness about violence and violence among children in Southeast Asia, why the bad guy has won, and then the police participated in the battle? 7) This film is very intense without a goal. If the cops beat a pulpa and then cooperate, they give marijuana and coke? This is the worst movie ever. Indeed, the person writing this movie is sadistic and patient. I have never seen a disgusting movie in my life. WITH THE HOSPITAL FILM!
