Yes, stupidity! I just watched and still have a bad taste in my mouth. Many colors, a story is a very unnecessary "addon", very stupid characters (I think I want to achieve a funny relief, but I just want to cry) ... most of everything. It is a shame to disguise one of the divine stories from such "Arab nights". I do not think that childhood, naive (both badly) and magic disorder can hold up to fifteen minutes of childhood. The prince is beautiful but she should be dumb, and she does not know how to act as an actress. The rest of the pig is worse ... our "bad guy" is really bad. He is shocked that "good man" is not better. David Carradine, the only light in this darkness, undoubtedly goes deep in this level, but at least retains the level of actor / "fighter" skills. I still feel sorry to see something like this, but I was glad that I had something to watch. Only, ONLY, for her, I will give this 2 stars to this fiasco ... I'll give her more, but it will raise the final account of this movie. The rest is very bad, maybe I would like to rate it, but there is no 1st class lover here, so it would be a lot.
