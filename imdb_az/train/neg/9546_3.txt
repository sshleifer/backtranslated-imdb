If you think the original is worse than 83, try the masterpiece of this modern day. How could it be worse than ever? Well ... at least one of you run on the Ally Sheedy sports column. Renewed graphics, modern day issues (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a new sexual response to Ripley, unfortunately, is also a sad tired story. Everyone who sees the first could see exactly where the next scene / line was in the story. And for anyone who does not see the first ... consider yourself fortunate to have just one watch. Maybe in another 23 years Hollywood will try again.
