This is a real bomb. We need to believe that Merle Oberon was a jealous daughter of an ambitious politician who had to prove that Tom DeLay was worth supporting in the 1930s as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle will not go anywhere, but besieged by politicians and their runs, frail women, and simply uncle Harry Davenport. Goran Cooper combines two guilty with a blind date and emerges. Some shooting of the Rodeo might have been enjoyable, but with the Misfits but there is no chance. Gary then goes to an official dinner hosted by Merle and reads a lecture about snobbery, although she is invited to sit and join the band. What is the difference of this unusual cowboy suddenly? The most exciting scene in the film is an honorary party that Gary holds for his missing companion Merle. Will it ever end? One to escape.
