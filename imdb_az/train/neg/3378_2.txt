The film was released four times since the release of this film, and it was the most anticipated release of the long-awaited production of the Chorus Line and the storyline. My husband and I were at the clock before the opening of the box office from the day the film was released. It was not just a disappointment, it was a stroke in the abdomen. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the story was "shifted outside" by incorporating scenes outside the theater. These limitations are a large part of the story's meaning and influence. <br /> <br /> Second and third together (give your order): one of the original songs with a very dynamic dance number has been deleted; A song that has not been produced on the stage has been added. What did you say? I did not understand! <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 2 is my praise for the hard work of the ruling and the artists. Now I've seen the Chorus Line at 6 stages and will not see it 6 times before I die. It's perfectly written with spectacular music, and genuine true stories. If you want to see a great selection of "livestock calls", I come to All That Jazz. If you want to see the story of a Choir Line, look at the scene.
