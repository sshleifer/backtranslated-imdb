For the first time I started watching this show with my friends in 2003 or 2004. Of course, then I was young and this show had some jokes. I have 11 years of age in 2003 and now I have 14 people (2007). My age probably plays a key role in how I evaluate this show, though after reading the other reviews, this show has fallen from the pipes after the third season. Agree. <br /> <br /> The show takes place around Timmy Turner, which is largely due to the two parent's miserable men, because life is terrible. a bad baby sat down. The basis of all the instructions is that this child (Timmy) and his children always want some destructions that can not be prevented by another wish, because they do not know anything in "Rules". In the presentation, there are many lines of repetition, such as "magic true love, super toilet can not be broken", or even some intricate joke lines that Nickelodeo thinks of, and has decided to put the episode at different times. <br /> <br /> The show is aimed at children under 10 years of age, because most children in my age are in a situation where they are not interested and have "kids humor". The choice of character sound could be very good. There is a very loud, noisy, feminine voice like Timmy Cosmo. Wanda sounds like an old woman. Timmy's father sounds like some speaker or game show, Timmy's mother's voice sounds to many women. Attitudes in this show: in some episodes Timmy speaks and is terribly and almost acting. Wanda's appearance is smart and wise. Cosmo, like Timmy's father, does not have foolishness, charity, or thought. <br /> <br /> <strong> Timmy's mother seems to end up doing Timmy's work. <br /> <br /> The show is now being removed from the truth and now it gets my approval. Perhaps as a small child, I've seen more humor in this show, but when I grow up, it's really old. Not to be released or to "throw out", there is a mentality in the show that wants to kill the characters. Such a show should be yours only, if you know what I mean. If not, you are mostly dissatisfied with it.
