This type of Swedish movie is quite typical. It is strange that the player is very bad, which usually gives a good show. Casting was poor, something you did not expect (I will not tell you). The starting character was terrible ... I do not know where he finds it. Anyway, stay away from it and look at Den Tredje VÃ¥gen, which is a Swedish move.
