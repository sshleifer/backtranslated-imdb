For the first time I've seen this movie for a long time in the TCM Essentials series. The patient's clich√© was never more eye-catching. This beholder saw this a little bit. I was surprised by the endless attraction of Lucy (Lauren Bacall). Yes, Bacall was a beautiful woman, but her character is softer than the glamor. I would think that men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would overlook an instant infatuation with Lucy. In Bacall's defense, this film was made during the last illness of Humphrey Bogart and the weight of his deteriorating health could have affected his performance. Certainly, part of this musical by Lucy had to distinguish him from the nail Marylee, hilt by Dorothy Malone and played outside. While his father climbed his ladder for a deadly heart attack, he was the scene of a fearsome, charming dance scene and the best scene in the film. Malone's performance, despite the brightness of Jasper Hadley's fatigue in the disappointment of the rest of her children, has shattered the rest. Generally, I'm almost excited about melodrama. Cartoonist behavior is a very subtle story for my tastes.
