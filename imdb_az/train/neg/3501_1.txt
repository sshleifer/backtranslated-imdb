I understand the jokes very well, it's not just good. The show is awful. I understand it and this is another terrible thing about it. The only cool character ever shown was this hobo in one episode, but I've seen other episodes including this episode and show. Not fun, funny! People do not want people to say, "Only clever people do it" because people know why judges are clever and are not smart enough or intelligent enough to understand them? It says "blue red", but even outside. But anyway, it was the worst show I've ever seen in my life, the jokes were terrible - almost we can understand them, they're just terrible, her debate is very bare, her fart jokes and other jokes of the body are really dumb and really really fluids doing bad behavior. I'm not sure what these "smart" people are seeing in this show, but judging others when it's unknowingly about any of them is not a complete explanation.
