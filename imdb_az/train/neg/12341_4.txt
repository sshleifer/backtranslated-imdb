Horror defects are not just something in the 21st century. Before the "Scary Movie" series, there were several examples of this genre in the 80's. However, most of these films are slammed or flipped by these films. Some, like "Elvira, Dark Mistress," remain above, but like "Saturday 14" and later convey that laughter. <br /> <br /> In some of the films, there is a particularly great criminal, and "Transylvania's 6-5,000" often causes many casualties. <br /> <br /> Pros: Some of the humorous humor is fun. A corny, but capture theme theme. Some good Transylvanian places. <br /> <br /> Cons: Sewing area. Very tiring pacing. Most of the humor does not cut it. Monsters spend too little time. Would I think it would be a part of these funny movies? <br /> <br /> The last thought: Is this a comedy? So why is it really so small and far between really funny lice? Comedies suggests us to take us to the ground, not to wash our eyes, to burn, to end the pain. I do not believe that Anchor Bay posted this tired garbage. I'm not one of the worst films I've ever admitted, but it's not worth the time or money, even if you are an admirer of any actor. <br /> <br /> My rating is 2/5
