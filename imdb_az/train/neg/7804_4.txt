TEMP (1993) did not do much theatrical work, but here's the direct-to-video rip-off you do not want! Ellen Bradford (Mel Harris) is a new woman named Millennium Investments, a high-level brokerage firm that will begin to receive useful advice on Deidre (Sheila Kelley), a wide-eyed secretary. Deidre is becoming an ambitious daughter of a father who can not stop anything to stir up the corporate ladder, and she thinks that everyone who goes bad will die and not kill. <br /> <br /> She makes skeletons in Ellen's wardrobe, trying to face her husband's (Barry Bostwick) problems, killing her because she's responsible for her, trying to make money from her daughter. <br /> <br /> <Harris and Kelley provide mature performances, the supporting player is good and in a good place, but will not compensate for a script that goes through a well-worn road and offers a few surprises.
