First of all, I love the West and the Civil War stories. I think John Fordu is an excellent director. I also have the same feelings as John Wayne and William Holden. <br /> <br /> I do not remember if I saw this movie the first time I went out in 1959. For the first time I saw last night <br /> <br /> According to my 4 ratings, I can say that I did not like the movie. </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> This script was investigated in a poorly written and filthy way. Recalling the terrible conditions of Andersonville Prison, Andersonville did not have an operation during the film. <br /> <br /> John Ford has been filming for over 40 years and winning 4 Oscars. It should have been sick when doing so. His usual style was missing. <br /> <br /> He is not a film in the south or east, but in the Monument valley. <br /> <br /> He is a stock company, which is usually used by all his films. This time only small cowboy stars have roles in Hoot Gibson and Ken Curtiss, and of course Anna Lee plays a minor role. There were no other people besides 3 stars. (see below) Mr Fords made most of the filmmakers classics; <br /> <br /> Now, the main stars are John Wayne and William Holden. The duke had to be ill and went out of here. This kind of role is usually perfectly suited to style, and it is sufficient here. Wiliam Holden did his best, but it was as good as everywhere. <br /> <br /> This film was asked to be an actress. The first major role here (the second film), Constance Towers, is a very nice person, but it is still an actress, but still plays on television. May he have benevolence and he has a long career, more than his appearance. <br /> <br /> The rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standards of other John Ford films. a few military-style songs made by a walking cavalry are not good at all. The scenes of the operation were good, but came to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Prices * 1/2 * (from 4) 47 points (over 100) IMDb 4 (from 10)
