Part of RMFTM episodes was seen as a teenager at the Cliffhanger Theater, a few years ago, at the local station after midnight, and later when it came to the Mystery Science Theater in the early 90's. Time did not help him. <br /> <br /> Certainly, I can expense the special effects that are extremely impressive for the 50th series of low-cost budget (IMO Commando Cody's flying scenes are better at George Reeves / Superman's television show). And I can also make a "commitment" for the ahem and resources for choreography combat. Except the boy playing the ruler of the Moon Man. It is incredibly bad. He looks and behaves as a foreign partner, not a despot ruler, but a partner coming to fix plumbing. Even a mixed dialogue works best - everybody knocking out their lines as a symbol of the subject, stops things like "meditation" or "introspection". Because everyone does this, the audience dips it after a while and even worries about my modern sensitivity. <br /> <br /> It's really irritating writing and planning. I do not talk about a flying suit with sunny air, or soda rocket boats or "high / low" and "fast / slow" labels. Even in the ends of every chapter, I was not even bothered by the sophistication of resolutions. I said that our heroes are better than fences and they have no accumulated memory. And in fact, like a clip, as an exclusive train, the sky repeats the same movements. <br /> <br /> Commando Cody and his sister Earth (or at least the United States) are presiding over many secretive high technology labs protected from an insidious alien invasion. There are no guard and security checkpoints at his office. There are even no locks on the front doors. Hence, the bad guys will come and Cody and his staff once at once (perhaps understandable), NOT SELECTION times. At the second attempt, they even miss a female assistant. And no one is clever. To further strengthen my mind, let Cody jump to his flying suit and face the trouble and seem to have failed to catch anyone. He does it again. Cody also sends the ship to the Moon (the female assistant comes to cook), stays about 30 seconds and immediately comes back and comes back. Cody takes one of the atomic bombs ... he immediately loses the bad guys because he is not concerned about wounding him. And that's why. <br /> <br /> And you thought that if Cody's efforts were crucial to rescuing the United States from Moon Men, she would not replace substitute for a few carpets, several helicopters and tanks, or twice local police. It was a military operation, but they behaved as an episode of Gangbusters. <br /> <br /> It's not a regular thing. I appreciate that developers have serious limitations within the context of stories with budget and time limits ... and I appreciate Cody as a really hombre (even if she lost half of her fists). But only "WRONG! WRONG!" He can not help begging! bandits simply do not have security measures on the ground when it comes to the lab or when the boat explodes, and there's no fence at the tallest place (!). <br /> <br /> Still, it's okay. The three "Republic Phantom Creeps" have a better structure, and the "Unforgettable Kingdom" has more atmosphere (hah!) And a better hero "Radar Men", but that's a good time. <br /> <br /> Why is the radar? They used Atomic Ray Guns, they did not use the radar. Title should be "From Atomic Ray Gun Men to Month"?
