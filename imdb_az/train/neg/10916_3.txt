You can see how the audience welcomes this movie for the in-house audience. As long as there was no interest in the foreigners, it was not important in this sense. The Germans are skillful and have described the Russians as heroes. The alleged romantic angle was plentiful and a distraction. The isolation room was ridiculous just how "love" a young woman glimpsing her. As it turned out at the end of the film, it did not go beyond me. I said that the Germans were described as companions and this was imitated in the swamp. Several hundred German soldiers were moving, and the Russians were drowning in the swamps. The Russians were hiding and the Germans stopped at the edge of the swamp and did not just listen. Probably, they did not want to moisten their boots, but I'm sure an officer could order about 20 or 30 people to search the water. But this story has come to an end. Also, the Germans rushed into the warehouse where the Russians were hiding in the attic and did not fire the roof. <br /> <br /> Some soldiers threw a grenade in the tent and did not fall into the ladder. <br /> <br /> Finally they cried that I saw some reviewers. Why? You knew that this little band would die, and they did not drown in heart.
