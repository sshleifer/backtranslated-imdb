At the end of the week, I saw this movie and, as usual, had the impression of the beauty and splendor of the Church-produced films, so little fled, informing the members and putting many questions to the investigators. > The film is 70 minutes from Joseph Smith's life. It is not a true biopsy because there is no realistic artistic work. The majority of episodes are concerned with Joseph's good behavior, baseball, racism, and laughing with children, most of which are sloooow. What a great one, was Joseph a nation, huh? Look at the rugs for his wife, Emma. Well, how do you open the ropes of 33 plural wives? There is nothing in the politics. <br /> <br /> In some of the movies, some information gives little information and is critical to critics. WHY Joseph is Born and Bumped? WHY is thrown into prison and why does this gang want to kill him? The film's speech is, of course, the departure of Yusuf and Hirum to the Carthage Prison (sliding over a United Nations headquarters over Nauvo's gates). But there is no mention of WHY. There is nothing else about Smit's shooting the Nauvoo Expositor, and nothing else but the destruction of the press to detect the secret teaching of polygamy. The audience should be surprised or dissatisfied with the Church's more groundless tyranny. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, I did not expect the Yusuf Yusuf to present the last biography of Richard Bush, a film prepared by this church. Rough Stone Rolling, but I was surprised and in fact I was exaggerating how little matter was given. <br /> And even worse, the substance presented is often wrong. Two examples were thrown on me. First, translate the Book of Mormon. In the film, Joseph shows that he reads from golden plates in two circular binders, in fact, the tiles are hidden away from the site. As it turned out, Joseph knew that he had been burying his face on his hat and looking at the vision. The second inaccuracies occur in the Carthage Prison where mobile storms are a cell. The church history shows that Joseph had six shooters and had been forced to jump out of the window before the Mason was shooting a few rounds before the signal (in the Times & Seasons report). <br /> <br /> Perhaps he was loyal to history by accusing the movie artists of showing the reality of the armed attack, and actually showed to Joseph: he was able to defend himself and defend himself. In fact, the film's impression is that Joseph is a good man, even knowing that everyone is beaten, thrown into prison, and eventually killed with cold blood. He was far from it; <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, but this is cotton candy that we know to go. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Burma, <br /> <br /> There are no credits in the film produced by the church, but the eyes can choose a few familiar faces. Rick Macy, Joseph Smith, who loved Thomas as a believer in Christ, Sr. and Bruce Newbold, with a solid methodologist, who, after all, is able to demonstrate Christian love to young seekers after the truth.
