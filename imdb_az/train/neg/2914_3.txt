The topic above is used to present the film "Gen" to the audience. About a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a gene mother. The film begins with the release of her mother to start her new job. When driving, we understand that the hospital is not as close as it is in a remote area. When he enters the hospital, he sees the body's death. <br /> <br /> Two police officers come to the hospital to investigate suicide. In fact, it will have to stay in the hospital because all the roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions. All communication to the outside world was cut off. There is no way! There will be worse offenses in a few days. Now everyone is suspicious of each other. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this idea is brilliant. It could have been really scary. Of course, the film has some positive aspects. I love the beginning of the movie. Especially when going to the hospital and taking his first mom to hospital. Players are good. Some of them, though, are trying hard to become mysterious and fearful. I think the last shock should go beyond the film. What I say was a good twist, but at the end we did not realize it was a parody, but when we saw what had happened, we did not understand it. The director did not fully explain that I did not do a good job. The most dangerous patient in the film is likely to be at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and suitable for someone who spends most of his life at the hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few things about the director. I'm sure he'll be fine. This is his first attempt. Some time ago I knew I was only 21 years old. Forcing me and her future films to make me feel even more positive. And I will not appreciate this movie **** *.
