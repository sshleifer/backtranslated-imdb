Is this "donkey donkey" promotion "Lordi Motion Picture"? I would like to say that when this "dinosaur" suit came up and showed the appearance of the lead singer, I hurt "Hard Rock Hallelujah" for myself ... even if I hate this song. "Dark Stones" are a young autistic girl who is in the process of being kept secret from the hospice by a protective father, and they are trapped at once by those people on the elevator ... It is quite surprising to find that they are not around anyone when they come in. The hospital is empty ... Except for the various monsters that appear to be stalking without any apparent reason ... They pass through dull, shocking corridors and jewelery with all group members of the heavy metal group - Many costumes ... I remember reminiscent of me "Meet the KISS Park Phantom", except for bad habits, darkness and nakedness and a completely shameless layer. Yes, do not forget, dud? I did not want to ... I'm just going to escape these Ghost House films as a fungus and not listen to Lordi because they are Gwar Rripoff!
