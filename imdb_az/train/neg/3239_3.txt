On the contrary, the whole series ("He Never Dies", "One Manqalda Mermaid" and "Flesh and Flower Blood" are exceptions with nothing except the exception ...) "The Devil's Experience" is just a straight blow, and there is nothing more realistic than the noticeable piercing scene (or possibly anti-climactic, how you looked at it), and the losers are really "careless" (sometimes more often) "sad") is similar to what is happening, and not just as an adulterer or a screamer. "Flesh and blood flower" is a fierce and strange description of fake "poetry", but the film also falls flat at the level of realism, I welcome Japan to push the borders and in the last 2 decades, we have come a long way to put a crown on the "extreme" film, but the "experience of the devil" is no longer just to see what anger is. If you had no reason other than that, watch it die, but I can give this film a generous 3/10 and it's just a needle scene ...
