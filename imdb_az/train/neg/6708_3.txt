Get back from the back or get back from my neck! Only a happy one will play your innocence, full of fear and revolt, when you watch. It is safe to say that the whole film is similar to each other and is zombie tribute, which is the most nonsense. We often get a name like "Johnny" and that Johnny does not go anywhere. There is no specific reason for us to leave the grave of "dead corpse", which shows that the film is completely useless. Without feeling sorry, her mother is happy to say that she is dead. Johnny then bites Eddie's arm. The audience is asked a challenging question: Why is the film forced to be corn? There is a response. Any similarity to all living or dead people is entirely coincidental. "Life" is a coincidence. There is nothing to do with the film "Dead". Show these to one of your lover and he will jump into the big fish and ruin his life. Blah !!!
