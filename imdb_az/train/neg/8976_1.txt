The first point to point out at the moment for "Ever Mozart" is that there is no characteristic summary in IMDb. The explanation is simple because there are no stories, scenarios, structures, or anything to remember the minimum structure of a movie. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most prominent and ambitious directors of cinema art and is one of the most hermetic films of this inaccuracies. I believe what he himself understood this story; but there are intellectuals who are elucubrate to justify or explain this mixed film, and are funny to read their review. <br /> <br /> My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Pulse Sempeter Mozart"
