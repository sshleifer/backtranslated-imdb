If you enjoy the original SNL player, and avoid any movies that you have seen, avoid this movie. This was my first visit to my friends and I waited more than an hour to enter a movie house sold. The theater was half empty 3/4. We refused to think that we would be better. After the movie ended, we were alone in the theater. In all theaters the film lasted only a day, then disappeared. He refused to comment on the film during Mr. Mayk's interview. The film was an in-depth joke that appeared after the release and closing of films in SNL episodes one day. We all tried to contact Mr. Mike by phone and mail, but we did not see it completely.
