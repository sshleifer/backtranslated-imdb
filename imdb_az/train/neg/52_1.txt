I was excited to see a Catalu√±a film in a Berlin competition. But after the presentation, I was generally disappointed and angry. Too much blood, often, is a lot to many things. The Spanish Civil War, as every war, was terrible. Jealous, many human behavior, absolutely unusual films and games, and homosexuals are also linked to doubts about Catholicism in Spain. But it is a catastrophic catastrophe that Mr Villaronga has attempted to do with the film's worst history. It's a shame to see Angela Molina in this movie. I will never go to see this movie.
