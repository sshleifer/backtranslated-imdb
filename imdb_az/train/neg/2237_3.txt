I bought this DVD from a friend, who I bought from it (and maybe it goes on ..) Even the DVD's cover looks as cheap as the whole movie. Some of the worst actors I've ever seen in my life, hitting and punctuation with a delayed sound effects, a very simple area, made me laugh up to the ulcer! With very few financial resources, I have to admit that I look quite professional. It was seen as a movie, it was 13 in most wannabe gangsta flicks that no one expected. So if you want a tired and inexpensive laugh, watch this movie. If you do not, remove it from the window.
