I recently saw Woody Allen because I was an admirer of his work, and the reviews of this film led me to wait patiently. They were right. This comedy is a mixed movie that can not decide whether it is a romantic fantasy or a drama about a woman's mid-age crisis. <br /> <br /> Alice (Mia Farrow) is a middle-aged woman who has marveled at the wealth of her husband, who is an uncomfortable, luxurious lifestyle with a very boring husband and two small children. This pretty secular plot concept is full of pioneers as an old Chinese folklore and the dreams of an old lover that flies over Manhattan with some magic herbs. <br /> <br /> It has become one of many countries to use social networks. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there are only a few real moments in the film, and the latter have a really modest touch on Pollyanna's. <br /> <br /> Instead, it's a great movie that has succeeded in combining comedy, instead of taking a serious look at ethics and morality of 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'. Or return to "Annie Hall" or "Manhattan".
