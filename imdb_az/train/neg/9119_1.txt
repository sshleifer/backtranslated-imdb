In fact, I saw this movie in the original version in the theater. It was painful for Peter Sellers to look at himself in a small way. The story was incredibly naked and hard to watch, and the latter was ridiculous. It was sad to see how the mighty fell. I will not be able to say that I am a great seller of Peter Sellers, but I enjoyed the Pink Panter series and felt that I was performing a great deal there. But this movie has never been. As I read, this film was against the advice of those around him. Fine, but still does not donate the studio that actually releases the movie.
