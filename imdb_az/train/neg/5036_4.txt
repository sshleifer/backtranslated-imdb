SPECIAL SPECIAL (1983) ** / ***** 86 minutes Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell <br /> Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new to a desert town and its surroundings he dies before he dies long ago. Detective Friday, 13th grader Dana Kimmell Nancy Drew should combine tips with her best daughter daughter. Local Indigenous Americans are thought-provoking suspects because they are concerned about the preoccupied urban population. <br /> <br /> These events lead to the killing of the murderer at the sixteenth birthday party of Melissa. <br /> <br /> This is not very memorable below the average slasher. Several times he has been prepared for a very sensitive television scene, along with the essence of the title of a hit character. The lines like "killer" will turn us into feathers. Adhere to the eighties slasher scenarios. Marcie names Melissa bad, but immediately develops a friendship. As you can see, Marci sees how difficult it is for her to know how Melissa will use makeup. This film will be used today with the 15-year-old mother character and the direct approach of the director. The Indian social commentary was not accepted seriously because it was not sufficiently developed. I was very surprised at the very high rating of this movie. Both the Sweet Eight and Ed Hunt's Winged Birthday, the birthday party have the potential to have a sense of pride, but I feel they are not delivered. But this is where the dark movies in DVDs are shining and hopes others will follow.
