"Plants are the most sinister and worse than all life forms," ​​a dopey victim in the "Seeders", a grim arrangement of "Bodysnatchers' Occupation", "The Day of the Triffids," thousands of older moovies. And why is the seeds more dangerous than plants? Because "the seed can follow us" according to the same rod. Yes, MooCow could only reminisce a terrible event that was just a calf, fired from the school all the way home by the terrible dandylion seed ... Yes, right. Unfortunately, in this awesome little turkey, the "monsters" resemble junior little ones, while others walk around like a bad jump. There is no sophistication of terror or inaction here. For unforeseen reasons, seed monsters are extinguished by 50 volts of ultra-violet lights, although they can go in the daytime, although they have about 1,000,000,000,000 times more uv energy. As you can see, this cow flop does not have much in mind. MooCow says that instead of wasting photosynthesis, move the algae on the ground. : = 8P
