The full title of the film is "Time: Race with Time". This is a race that nobody can win, but you can certainly lose the valuable "time" on these baklavas. This movie was curved and manipulative in a way that made K3G look honest. It was more than my trust. <br /> <br /> This is not as terrifying as Bagban or Black, but there's nothing that this movie has to offer. It is ridiculous, meaningless by Amitji's ridiculous OTT performance. The main "plot" is another bad example of the pro-poor propaganda of so many "family" BW films. If my father, who loved me and loved me, had made me like B Big B, I would have shot him. Terminal tells nothing to trivializing the disease.
