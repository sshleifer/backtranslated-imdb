This is really a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Some youths were forced to drop a television show directed to children and to treat George Lucas (that is, they drowned to appeal to a young audience). <br /> The Thunderbirds TV show was not exactly the most cerebral show, but it was really pretty, but it was particularly pleasant to watch and watch the models (sounds are not too bad) <br /> <br /> This is bad dump and bad behavior (especially with Sophia Myles's exceptions known as Parker, who seemed to be members of the game to be a clue about how to play their own characters like Lady Penelope & Ron Cook). <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus <br /> <strong> br /> Avoid as a pit of this debris. <br /> <br /> I will give only 1 out of 10 zero rating is not supported.
