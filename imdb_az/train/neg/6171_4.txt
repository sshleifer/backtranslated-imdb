Yes. It was not a surprise. Many people will tell you this. <br /> <br /> In some of the films there are many words "without a sidekut". <br /> <br /> "My son" says he started with a person who did not feel pain. We saw them weak. take 40 minutes of the movie and you can go to the stunning, impressive and dramatic eyeball scene. There are some really stupid scenes in this. and they sang on the sounds and rifles with a fake fake voice that made me laugh! I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> its strange.
