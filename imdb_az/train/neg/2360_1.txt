This will be the most baseless comment I have ever written, but I still have to do this to warn about the movie murder that Freddy has died. It's not just the Nightmare series's worst episode, it's always there, with the continuation of the worst horror of all time! The intense, dot and nearly death was free. The horrific 3-D end and top-up CORNY killing is enough to drive this "movie". But stop there, just to do bad, to add a terrific script, and a lot of cheese, and you have the spark of this guano! Freddie always performed two postmortems, as Robert Englund played. I would have been out of this too. This is not just a fan of movies, look at our shame.
