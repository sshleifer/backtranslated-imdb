I've compared two versions of Hamlet for the Shakespeare class and, unfortunately, I chose this version. Everything from the players (actors, direct transmission of the majority of lines to the camera) were shocked by camera shots (all mid or near shots ... no scene shooting and very little space). I watched it with a spring break and I want to say that I'm talking about 114 minutes of my graduation. No extension of imagination is advised.
