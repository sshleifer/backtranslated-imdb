Two houses, one street, a telephone booth, a car, next to a girl, a boy next door, and a zombie. This list of items is enough for a great horror movie. All you need is direct blue light, surround sound and .... Even though the Dutch director Van Rouveroy does not have it! <br /> <br /> I love to organize "bad movie nights" from time to time. The concept is really simple: you can win a little, get some movie friends and present it to the worst cinema. This peace of purity is one of the best in the evening. Guler trusted! <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, Van Rouveroy still advocates his film as a great success. To hear it, you must listen to the DVD's explanation. Again, it is an unbeliever and laugh!
