As part of the other nations that have watched this movie, I also wrote a nostalgia about it ... really watching again for an accident. Unfortunately, my childhood memories of this movie were completely unreliable and Paul's crashes are now a shameful exercise for banal, racist and simple drill films. The presence of the old processor Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas can not surprise such a bizarre scenario, horrible theme songs, and some unfortunate 'special effects'. Additionally, the stereotypical descriptions of the African and Arab characters, especially the Civil Rights Movement, have a painful look at the emergence. Michael Weldon's original Psychotronic Encyclopedia states that Pauline's accidents were originally produced for television, but inevitably gained the freedom of the theater. Based on the results, this is a completely convincing (and surprising) scenario.
