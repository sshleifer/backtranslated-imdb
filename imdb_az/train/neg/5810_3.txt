<br /> <br /> Gettaway is mainly a motion picture. And what's the move for! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and more. <br /> <br /> This is just a few days, a few days. chemistry But the film did not do it for himself. <br /> <br /> Gettaway really was really tedious at a time. The assassination shatter with one another's pursuit and chase, and Bassenger and Baldwin keep their big looks, no matter what dangers they may face. In fact, until the end of the movie, they are BETTER Starters. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not very good, and if there is nothing, I can not really enjoy a movie inside a movie because there's so much here. Gettaway is not too afraid and is not original and unnecessary in all manner of gruesome dullness. <br /> <br /> Bassenger and Baldwin give OK appearances, but there is nothing but grief and escape. Sometimes, more and more, after seeing the same thing again, it becomes old. It did not like it so much.
