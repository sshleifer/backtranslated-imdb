Do not make me mistaken, and I love many of Woody's films, of course, the greatest dramas of his late 70th birthday (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and the 90s of the 80's (Hannah, The Egyptians, and their wives) in fact I liked some of my recent efforts (Melinda, Else, Little Time Croissants), but it was terrible, though it could not be worse than Match Point in recent years, but how wrong . <br /> <br /> This was made lazily - basically Match Point, a cross between the Manhattan Murder Mystery and the Little Time Crooks, was all jokes - as Woody was on the way out. <br /> <br /> I know that most actors are queuing, I know that many actors should work with it, but at least first need to write scripts - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are better than that - and Woody <br /> <br /> < If you did not have very good Woody movies, it would not be tragic. <br /> <br /> After meeting with his wife, he did not want to meet with her. <br />
