If you appreciate the horrors of Asian horror, do not worry about Gavi. The film deserves to be celebrated alongside the A-listing, such as Ringu, Two Sisters' Tale, Cure and Ju-On (or good material such as Eye or Inside Sense). These films are frightening, with unexpected footage, rich character, and indecisive non-Western. <br /> <br /> Qawi has been cut off with her lasting hands and body of everything that has been preserving America's fears over the last 25 years. <br /> <br /> The film attempts to mix Asian dreams and Hollywood slasher flick, but it's a bad fit. An aesthetic resembles the other; guess what The criminals have no stories to lend Ringu to a bad child subpop, but the situation is hopeless. Clich√©s, crap characters, a foolish trick, a dull ghost, ho hum.
