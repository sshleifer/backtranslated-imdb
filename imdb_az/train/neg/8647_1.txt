Extremely enthusiastic. The camera job was especially missed - the documentary camera operators should not rotate around ALL TIME. <br /> <br /> The scenario is really convincing and the move is getting worse. Moreover, the story is different and creates an illogical gap. At one point, the lead will be interviewed by Osama when the lead in Al-Qwa suspects slammed his shoulders and wants to jump into prison. As a result of many flaws, I found the story totally unbelievable. The "master of the film" / the leading role is really a clever, foolish guy. The only interesting point is that filmmakers actually filmed the scene. <br /> <br /> Who is this kind of sponsor?
