This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm going up and going to Tape 4, but I'm pushing it. Now I consider myself a Masochist! Afghanistan? Come on, guys! Who forgot to hide the Sanskrit billboards? I thought the leading actor (George Calil) did not particularly care. Along with the shameless and cheerful camera shake, I used to think of the events of 9/11 as a reason to make the 9/11 victims a disgraceful and disrespectful "Larson Lunatic Implodes, near a screen". Larson's wife, Sarah, was strangely used by one of the terrorist planes on the agenda. The camera shake did not feel sick, it was a cold hearted stunt.
