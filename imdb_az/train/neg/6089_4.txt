I love movies about UFOs, so I decided to wait for EYES again after seeing I was a kid in the late 1970s. Now I have to write a review about it because I'm scared to forget about FAST. As you can see, the EBTS is not bad, though it is very boring and nondescript. Story is interesting, but straightforward. Actors are good, but their role is boring and a bit confusing. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> 1970 The Italian philosophy of TRUE is a strange one because in the 1970s, when there is something in the Italian genre that separates movies from a different country's genre, it is an astonishing amount of violence and sexuality. Due to the fact that the EBTS is almost incomplete, it is quite strange that it differs from the rest of the contract. I do not know if it's a compliment, though. Personally, I can use a movie without sex or violence, but I think the EBTS needs more violence and some sexuality. And special effects are not specific. <br /> <br /> The story itself is really interesting. It is part of the X-FILES and Antonioni's BLOWUP team: a photographer has accidentally taken foreigners in the filmmaking of the country. The aliens know that they are being filmed and continue to steal a photographer and a model and subsequently destroy any evidence available on the earth. The problem is that the model begins when a recently abducted photographer meets a man in the apartment (this happens before he is stolen). People take some negative and leaves, along with merchants who do not have any information from the real Negatives. The whole story is about a secret spy group who wants more information about foreigners and wants to capture the weak. Most of the film is about political intrigue which spoils the spy and spy diversity. The UFO element of the story is almost unimportant and could easily be replaced by any cold war McGuffin. Like the EASY ONE OF THE CREATION, these X-FILES are like LOT! I'm surprised that Chris Carter sees this movie. In any case, the best thing about EBTS is the creepy and effective POV shooting. <br /> <br /> Although it's the worst thing about the movie, I like it. When I see myself as a child, I am afraid of the impressive advertising campaign. And I have a video. The film could have been more if it was done properly. She is excellent ...
