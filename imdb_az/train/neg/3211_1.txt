And this is in the category of "awesome evil" - that is, a drunken pupil will hire a coup. I've been to a festival of philosophy and I remember that as a premiere of this movie, a wave of hysterical laughter waves. Other criticisms better describe the fecal nature of this film and I felt terribly worried about the poor boy of the production company, who was clarified to measure the reaction of the audience. He was a philosophy of drunken student audiences and I thought he was "blue blue" after the "serious" anime movie, as if the audience were in mood, and then the film was opened and spread over the island islands. <br /> <br /> The funniest and worst part of this film is broken down through a linear and predictable way from time to time with an unfamiliar line of thought. <br /> <br /> The artistic group said, "Take it very much and put it in one place." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> So, in a short time, there is a captivating audience and a few lying lips around (try and make sure you have alcohol to make it easier), and then film this DVD and enter into the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" mentality. There is no other motivation for watching something else than laughing, and it's not meant to be a comedy. THIS IS NOT MOVIE ALONE. It would have been even more challenging to watch for Colin Farrell than the "New World" because you would not laugh at a friend or two.
