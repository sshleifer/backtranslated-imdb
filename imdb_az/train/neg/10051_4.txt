I gave this 4 stars because there are a lot of themes that are already mentioned here. From domestic violence to sexuality and to many taboos. <br /> <br /> In some cases, I will not call such horror as my science fiction. <br /> <br /> It's dark, heartbreaking and hopeless. Fortunately, though, I was really tired of the "people suck" clich√© in the center of every movie. You know, I can not admit today's level of liberal art as a member of human race without hating it, but we claim that we are different from anyone in the package as a writer / director. OBSTACLES FROM HUMAN OFFICIAL! However, if you read this and believe that humanity deserves to die, get out of here, find the lake and ask your weapons to be tired. In this way, I will not focus on the next movie or I will write a book about my death. It's foolish, thoughtless and boring.
