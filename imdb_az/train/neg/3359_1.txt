They drowned this story! In the end, Nell takes all the heroisms and all the donations from Hill House to the team to get rid of such a nonsense! Heads are cut off, people cut their faces and the ceiling has become a huge part! What is hell? I love and love the original film, I read a book and love it! The reason why the original film and the book was so great was even scary even when you did not imagine it. There is no trouble. No ceiling hands. It's just a fantasy island where spirits really can kill someone. They can not kill us, they can not get us out of the room or get a knife on our heads. No. They can only make us crazy. All our senses are safe. Nell was an unhappy woman. He just wanted good things for himself. Yes, he looked at others a bit, but not many. David Self and Jan de Bont made this great story a crap! I hate to update this curse!
