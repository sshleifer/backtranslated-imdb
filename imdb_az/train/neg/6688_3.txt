This movie is terrific, but there are some interesting facts about it: <br /> In 1976, at Flagstaff, AZ, at the University of North Arizona, Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ. A good part of the extras in the film is then drama students from the NAU. At the presentation, I was in the first year of the first year, but for some reason I did not engage in production. <br /> <br /> In this film, there are two scenarios where the two authors try to escape, as part of their pardon ritual. trees. They appear in the movie behind, just do it. That's not the two actors I know from the theater department. These "stunt posteriors" personalities will at least remain anonymous on this website, even if they do not decide to "present themselves"!
