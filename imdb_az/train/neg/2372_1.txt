"Science Street Nightmare" -series is a stupid, rich and insulting connection! Part 6 is not as invisible as the author wants to turn Wes Craven's original organization into a big bad and tasteless joke as Rachel Talalay. This is not the worst entry of the "Science Street" epic; It has become one of the most embarrassing horror films ever to have dropped the fans of the genre! The story is dumb, the characteristic drawings are funny, the structure is all nasty and? the majority ?? The custom and visual effects resemble a Tom & Jerry cartoon. The sequences that Freddy Krueger's killers sacrificed are endless and uninteresting. Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a video game, and when we pogo-paste around the walls of a house, will we be figured out when we throw a jerk? The story returns us to Springwood and Freddi suddenly has a middle-aged daughter. You would think he would celebrate one of his previous adventures, but not? Springwood and Krueger have just got used to getting in touch with her long-lost daughter, who has gotten out of a teenager. One reason why this last payment is terrible is completely illogical. John Doe is promoted as a leading character but then suddenly dies, and the plan continues to turn into two dimensions! What's more, Freddy Krueger, besides five films, is beaten by two adults with 3D glasses, which kill nothing but teenagers! Do things similar to all, or are they? When I'm worried, Nightmare on Elm Street has always been a terrible overrated series, but so far even the weakest entries were at least a bit of refund. But "Dead Freddy's" is simply unexpected, and nobody should spend valuable time to watch it.
