EPSILON, a.a. ALIEN VISITOR, I'm not expected. This is an extra-budget Australian movie that has no special effects except for the accelerated movie and quick scene scenes. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Unusual (flawlessly speaking Australian speaking ability) from place to place or time - You can "blip" and change "faster" perception of time stream to people. <br /> <br /> An elderly grandmother, when he explains his two grandchildren with a story of a man who was 40 years ago, when he was unable to recognize the star in the sky, which was unclear on a "O" planet and completely scattered on the planet. He meets a man in a camp in Outback, Australia, and surprises him with his appearance. He is angry when he is aware of the "wrong" here and about where he is on Earth. Local people are known as metaphors for the most extravagant creatures of the environment and for the rest of the universe: Those who breathe evil air, but who do nothing about it, keep their heads as sandwiches. Another fun metaphor is the "frogs" of the Indians. <br /> <br /> There is a film about dialogue, because the embarrassed person is trying to understand his own psychology and his ideas because he is "strange". The person may be, perhaps, the ones who are ineffective or inappropriate. <br /> <br /> After a few days to meet with her husband, all of them are worthy of a tough ecological message and a decent sense of budget (they only play two key roles around the diverse scenes, never appears). The environmental message does not offer any solutions, but one or two terrifying metaphors about what happens to nature and man are painted. The logic does not depend on one thing: the rest of the universe "refuses" on Earth, but a place where the woman is mistakenly able to make some positive changes with the result of the film. What was the purpose of deliberately sending a battalion of aliens to pollution and waste?
