A mental effort is a summary for this movie. Good sixties, but no success. Maggie Smith gave a good performance which was fairly convincing, but not as good as it was, and the other players were just terrible! A terrible description. It was not very funny and, therefore, did not achieve its genres, because it is not particularly funny and dramatic. The only genre that reached the glorious level was romantic. Your target audience is not hit and the movie has sent messy messages. A very basic field and many key stories have never been drawn up or done, and people have questioned how good the film is and who it has targeted the audience. But Maggie was very good and the story <br /> <br /> 4.
