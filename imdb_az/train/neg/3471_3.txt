This film was a bit swiss cheese more holes. Ben Affleck was seriously trying to move in shape or shape in any way. She was hungry. Nothing about the film was convincing. The first problems were at the entrance - the man's Salvation Army gave Santa Claus every moment, but why he did not show it. And then the grandmother's head is really nice - and has nothing to do with the movie - it's not the same tone as the movie. There is no explanation for motivation to choose Affleck's house; there were no convincing reactions from the family chosen; and people will swing here and there for no reason (For example, Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's symbols are under a steep slope - this is an event that instantly falls in love with it) Riiiight ...) In any case, a funny moment two - but they were rare in the film. This is a serious need for another rewrite (or 4). I hope your taste!
