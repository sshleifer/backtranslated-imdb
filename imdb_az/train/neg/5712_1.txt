After sitting in this stupid meeting, I wondered if my husband and I were the product of an experiment to see if a computer program could produce a movie. It was unlisted and shaped. But the US propaganda thrown into your face - the disappointment - this is the work of a man. Call me a conspiracy theory, but they say, "We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect the Treaty," the invasion of Iraq and so on. They seem like ways to justify actions. Nicholas Cage, "use the Declaration of Independence as a grill chip," surprised me and my husband that he took all the cast-iron before each scene. The "reasoning" queue behind each plot and the new "clue" are really ridiculous and impossible to follow. There is also some kind of bonus side thing, Dr. Whatever-Her-Name - Everyone has decided to "never close". It appears only in the film, but they name it "his doctor" to give some weight to his character. At one point, Cage's character says, "Have you never closed anything?" and pans in the hands to poutily lower in the hands, as the camera is his child. It's really strange. The only benefit of this film is that it's a surprising thing to have a few laughs. It's really intimidating that most of the people watching the film enjoyed us. Creepy ....
