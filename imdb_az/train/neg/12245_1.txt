Why, why? ... did I get this one? <br /> <br /> I did not need any ink in the summer heat and the cover was cool. <br /> Of course, I must get to know better. This is really a very bad movie. Manufacturers are trying to cover it by knowing it's bad and adding some sexy / beautiful women and some sexual scenes. Yes, the nation ... does not cut it, it does! <br /> <br /> If you really want a cool movie about a really good, well-played and comic big reptile: get rent Lake Placid! (this is an order)
