I like them because rubbish / bad movies are not bad at all. It's so bad that I'm beyond words to describe it. At the start of the film, there is an instruction that tells you what to do in the movie. Unfortunately, the instructions and a lot of beer could not help the whole movie through the whole movie. A tagliner compares this with KILLBILL, which, of course, is foolish and insulting. Obviously. this tagliner had a plan to attract you to buy this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you rent this job, put it! Do not think if you're buying it! If this DVD is unsuccessful, do not play it, just throw it in the trash can.
