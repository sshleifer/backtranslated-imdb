Yes, I can honestly say that for the first time I had a film that did not have any meat or potatoes. The entire movie was just a salad without the main course. The story line was apparently laughable, the characters were one-dimensional, the realism was from the window and the animation was made by four-year-olds. Does it cover? I was not ashamed of a concept in my entire life. <br /> <br /> "I have never read or watched other programs with this character, but I'm not related to other observations." I needed more than just to create situations for a new person to find a solution.I have seen other anime (this moment I can say Anime) that they do great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them. In a few short scenes, he sees his train with Cremator and immediately becomes an aggressive animal of Hell.It was difficult for me to take into consideration moments without being presented as a weak and weak woman, led by her father, suddenly she was hated and can go to war with an entity that has been around for millions of years. It was absurd, and Lady Death's presentation was poor, and I felt that there was nothing more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman who had revenge on my mind. It just did not work for me. It is nothing more than a pancake for prepubescent boys who want to massively combine with the skin as they grow up while working with Cremator. Oh, I just feel sick, who is watching her. The same applies to the character of Cremator. Who was this casual person? The explanation they give is not enough, and instead of my development, I have split up more discreetly. <br /> Then, Lucifer himself had. It is a very sad day in Hell when we get away from character to show more violence and action. Let me tell you that I am fighting against the King of Hell and surviving. He was weak, his voice laughed, and he did not represent his image in my mind. She was in Disney's control and wanted to do it half-pc. It does not possess the nature of darkness and corruption that Lucifer is embodied. He was not a ruler of hell, but rather a missing man. How do you die in Hell while talking about living or dying? This was definitely a concept that needed more explanation. Most cartoonists are not worried about death, even though they did not think they were dead. They came to hell. I think the film is violating me. I could not get enough of the idea that your soul is in a solid body in Hell, but can this be me? or maybe this story is NOT CREATED. <br /> <br /> <strong> This cartoon animation was felt as it was in the early 1990s. There was nothing surprising about the filmmaking of this film. Why are we, America, behind the animation? It's great in Asia and it's a hard place. Because we do not use movies like Lady Death or use any part of the imagination. We are cheap and this movie shows it. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie was bad. The animated combination of sad voice work was cheaper. I've come across a movie that's hard to understand as long as it's in production, because I think I can do this on my credit card. Production was also a story. Nothing was improving, leaving all the big holes in the area. The characters' strength was missing and nothing was explained. <br /> <br /> I have wasted my time and I would like to warn others that you will not be able to find yourself in my situation when it comes to death, and regret that you've been wasting 80 minutes of this debris. <br /> <br /> BLAH! <br /> <br /> Level: ***** out *
