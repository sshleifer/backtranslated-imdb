A grieving couple may move into a boat on a mountain after killing the girl, spirits like the place, or anxious spirits of former occupiers who commit suicide. Julie Pyke (Cheri Christian) blamed her husband for her death because her husband did not open the door, and worsened due to marriage. Julie stays in a zombie state, with no emotion, nearer and thirsty, finding a surprising look of a girl who captures only the rod of a cell, drawing a close-knit prison. Although Allen does not see anything ordinary, Julie continues to paint and we know that something is wrong. A local worker, Jim Payne (Scott Hodges), appears to be in danger of being threatened by a very distant person who is hiding when his dead mother is associated with the monkeys going to Picasso. Meanwhile, neighbors who sell Pikes also find the victim, drinking alcohol on Mr Booth's comrade comes to return him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Allen will conduct an investigation of the history of the cabinet, <br /> <br /> Indeed, with the strangeness of every character, this strange story unfolds in the background many imaginations. Cheri Christian remains very important and missing, and you find it difficult to get in touch with her, even though you understand her situation. As we often remember, the player becomes frustrating because none of the symbols are easy to lock. Perhaps I'm thinking of being in their condition, but my anxiety has always been unable to cover the Piskos with its uncertainty. Cherry is cold and personal, I think it would be the same when a mother lost a child, but the frosty nature begged me to cling to me. I think the right performers can be in the mood of emotions, but when a humanity reaches us, they can catch the hearts of their audiences. The cause of this movie can not do for any reason. Maybe I could be. I would like to take care of them, but I have nothing in my heart. Anyway, as the movie goes on, Allen slowly uncovers certain truths and protects himself against his wife, and argues that his own daughter is among them and that she does not lose her little girl. Jim, in order to stop landing on this area, believes that the unbalanced neighbor must kill Pikes, a life-threatening danger. The dreams remain the central part of the film, their presence, especially Jima's mother, was built remotely. The finale shows how Allen is helping his wife while trying to block Jim's job. I had a hard time to come face-to-face with the students and their heroes.
