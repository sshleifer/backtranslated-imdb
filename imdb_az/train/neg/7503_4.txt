I would like to clarify one thing before blocking a movie that Spike Lee sums up a successful summer's actor. I do not praise this movie for its irresistible and unpleasant views. What makes this movie so unexpected is that Lee's SUMMER seems to be believed to be a publicly illuminating drama. For example, Quentin Tarantino's murder movies are full of violence, blasphemy, and other sleaze but can still be seen at a high level, as Tarantino does not try to portray these films as social art. He knows that these films are just worth the entertainment. On the other hand, serious dramas such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and SCHINDLER'S LIST are often unpleasant, but unpleasantness contributes to the development of the plot and symbols of the film, and links the audience with excitement on the screen with stories and characters. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SAM's writings, unfortunately, believe that it will serve as a social interpretation similar to other garbage epics, with its sensationalism and sleaze. <br /> <br /> SAM's writing is not a serious drama because its symbols are simply sticky cutters. The killings are mainly attributable to residents of the Italian-American northern Bronx neighborhood, with the emotional impact of the hysteria on the Son of Sam's murder. Instead, instead of introducing the locals as a diverse set of personalities, Lee takes off any negative Italian stereotype that he can only imagine. These men are ignorant, lazy, overseksed goombahs. Women are divided between weak, proud "good girls" (Mira Sorwin's Dionna) and naked "bad girls" (Jennifer Esposito's Ruby). Lee tries to tackle his own stereotypes and "rebuild" for the African-American stereotype against Hollywood. Several critics take care of themselves. For example, if Martin Scorsese was known as an American neighborhood resident, Amos's definition of Andy and Jemima, critics justified such obvious stereotypes. More importantly, one-dimensional, stereotypic characters are hitting any movie that wants to be a serious public comment. <br /> <br /> WRITING FROM SAM is very good, except for dump. But it's not a moving actor for the majority. Casting is only a matter of action or very little work with scriptwise. Additionally, there is a bad warning. Comedian John Leguizamo is very talented, but his Vinny character looks like an old, comedic embodiment of John Travolta's Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER. And the perennial "beautiful guy" actor Michael Badalucco is horrified, as serial killer David Berkowitz. Adrien Brody is the only performance that is of concern, but in the sincere, neighborly Ritchie. The only advantage of this film is Brody's performance and typically stylish Lee's cinematography. <br /> <br /> ***** From 1/2
