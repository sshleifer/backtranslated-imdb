The dubbing / translation in this movie is evidently fun, and it provides only fun inside the other dull and derivative zombie flick. I just did not laughed in my life as I watched Zombie 3 (and I believe I've seen a really bad dubbing in my life). Seriously filmmakers can re-create this movie and release it as a comedy and earn millions of dollars. <br /> <br /> But if you fall from your throne to dubble in a Fulci Zombie movie, it's not your cup of tea, THESE PRESENT DIFFERENTS.
