Luxurious, but inexplicably semi-realistic research, exploring the various personalities of two college roommates: a talented, but non-disciplined star basketball player and a woman drinking buckwheat, confused. We will not learn why these young people are friendly. They may share confusion about the world and their place, but it seems that there is nothing common. His directorial debut, Jack Nicholson, has written a scenario with Jeremy Larner, a book based on Larger's book - does not give us any clarification to the heroes, nor does it make scenes to identify everyone. There are very good speeches here (especially from William Tepper, who comes from a central role), but most of the picture (perhaps deliberately) is sketchy or uncertain. Bruce Dern plays a challenging driving basketball coach, Karen Black is in contact with an elderly married Tepper and Michael Margotta is off-putting (off-putting, top performance). Nicholson did not succeed in creating any special taste, preferring to have a characteristic interaction with the film's snooze; its scripts are also no help, and it is not clear whom we should betray. Small, random moments work (a supermarket battle between Tepper and Black, Dern, Tepper sitting in the dormitory, all the scenes in the court), but the third act of the picture is an exciting mix. She hopes to combine all the important B-ball games with a sexual assault, Nicholson does not show any style in her art (and the staging of these events is nasty and ugly, earning points for cheeseburger). When a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors, he needs to motivate his motives. Perhaps, the "Driver, Said," ultimately made a series of strong statements in the bargain, for the audience's decision and taste, he could have filmed the movie. Unfortunately, something strange is closer, dumbfounding as the rest of the movie. * From 1/2
