Show off every stereotype you hear about half-religious Mormons, and you'll see that the movie is playing with this ridiculous excuse. <br /> <br /> In some cases, Kurdish Hale's dreams have changed (thank God) and I hope that in cinemas we will not see one of its features. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is amateur (I think basketball scenes). The area was gentle and very unfunny. Indeed, you did not understand that everyone did something. <br /> <br /> There was sand in my eyes and a 300-pound woman sat on my vine, it was painful. <br /> <br /> The only reason I did not give negative ratings to this movie would not allow me to scale.
