I acknowledge that many of the comments here must be fraudulent. The film is definitely a moderate, even if it is not necessarily bad. "Dark Remains" is basically a Ghost Movie, with a premise that worries you about your own spirits and evil. The film consists of two stories similar to each other, which are later identical to each other. She loses a few children, she is cut in her bed. They move to a country house to escape the past and to estimate the house's haunts. From here Dark Remains really begin to very slow with some of the fearsome moments (the first ghost images are beautiful and the flashlight sequences also worked very well). On the contrary, then ... The woman sees it, the other ghosts that are killed in an accident or suicide are seen, the man tries to solve the mysteries of past houses, the woman falls into depression, looks strange neighbors. It was pretty much there, but it was nice to have its own feelings, so wait for it to bend. There is no twist, only a haunted house history story, a weird neighbor, a totally creepy prison and a dead girl's "Glasses" thrown along with many photographic ideas. The latter is ridiculous, because when you start and finish a movie, it's like a zombie flicker with a slow breeze and piano music when you finish it. <br /> <br /> For a short stay ... When Scythm tried to go anywhere and to come anywhere, Dark Remains could have been a wonderful scary ghost story. the film's main atmosphere is meaningful and contradictory. Moreover, never use abandoned prisons. It is so worn out and does not make any sense in this case. "Hey, this is a scary prison where you can shoot." In my opinion, many items in Dark Remains have been mixed up.
