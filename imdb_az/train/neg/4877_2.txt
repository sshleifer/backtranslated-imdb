Frank Capra's creativity was not spent after putting this movie down. Even though there are a few attractive moments and many fine artists, Capra's not only a feature film, but also a lot of footage shot by Broadway Bill (1934) from the first version of this story is obviously naughty. Obviously, he will re-use images in a thrilling, climactic horse race. But all the dialogue uses scenes with small actors and then brings back these actors and, for example, does not expect Ward Bond to be over 14 years old. Unless you want to see one of Oliver Hardy's latest looks, throw a portion of it on Broadway Bill.
