This British-Spanish joint production is one of the few films made in Spain after an unpredictable extraordinary success from the Italian Spaghetti West, and reflects the variety of emerging and emerging voters depending on the genre's efforts. Robert Shaw, Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Ray, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans and others. It is evident that this incoherent film of the film is a brilliant example. Most of the 1970s genre of film genres has become America's death and practically (or officially) exhausted these days. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie only because it was a good thing, including my favorite movies of the West, as well as all of its features, exciting moments - just after my father's A TOWN CALLED BASTARD's original rails I do not remember buying the publication. easily! The only virtue of the film (which can be said really) is its own eccentricity: For example, Stevens played a widow to take revenge on a betrayer who was betrayed by a revolutionary husband and was driven by Sutton, a caretaker columnist in a coffin; Savalas, a bloody thirsty colorful, appears to be the main liar of the film, is pictured very soon by his figure, Lettieri; appears on the first scene of the film, Landau, who appears lying lips side by side with the legendary hero Hero; Fernando Ray is the only one who can play a blind peasant, defining the rebel Shaw that eventually has only one front ... well, nevermind! As you can see, the plot is very mixed and goes away! The production team responsible for this film was behind other western tariffs at the same time as Western (1967), BAD MAN RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972).
