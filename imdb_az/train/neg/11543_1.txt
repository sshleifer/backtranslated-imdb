Although I've often used this site, though I've seen how other people evaluate what I think or just watch funny movies, after watching this "movie" last night, I had to write something, that's just helping me clear The movie was probably the most complicated experience I've ever had - the main characters starring Danny Dyerin (23? sure?) and Gillian Anderson (Leonard Nimoy will always be like Scully) will always be Spock there was no real substance - the first half of the film did not make the final cut, but we definitely want a little empathy with victims in a revenge film. I could not care less here. In fact, the only thing I was care for was a dog, the stag approached a close second. Both animals were terrifying than Deir (sic) and Scully. I believe that even if you're as good as script, thank you for writing to writers, producers, directors and all 90 minutes of life and some good electrical energy.
