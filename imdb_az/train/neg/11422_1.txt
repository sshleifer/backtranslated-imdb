I saw it in the theater and saw that yesterday I saw it again in the cables. I was able to re-recognize myself by feeling how rebellious this movie was. The entire set of heroes is the Naristian nanas who process themselves. The worst of all is that it has been designed to celebrate people for "finding oneself", but it strengthens every negative stereotype about about 20. Beautiful children are ending, jerky children are getting bigger, the best kids are getting better. Girls are all boys' toys. Only one character ("Wendy") sees that he is doing something far away for society, and that he needs to think in a long night's nightmare, a nightly night studio, romantic. This is really Hollywood's young American concept: permitting, independent, discreet, modest.
