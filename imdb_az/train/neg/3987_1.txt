Before I finished, I left very few movies, but I did not finish the trash. It was the burden of racism that was trying to pass as a legitimate movie since "The birth of a nation". The symbol was very small. I do not want any actors to have their names associated with this movie. Lee should have better things to put in place such garbage. I know that in my mind and in our brains there are better things for everyone .... paint is dry. I want someone to take a movie about international relations that is relevant to the topic. There is more depth in this subject than a bitter painter like Lee.
