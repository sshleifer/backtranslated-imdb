I would place my movies in an unwatchable garbage category at the top of my listing! There are bad movies, but the worst kind is the invisible ones, but you love them because they need to be good to you! The sequence that caused the shock of the day did not even create a rabbit. This controversial policy is that serious lyceum students are Marxism at night. The film, in its worst sense, boosts consciousness. Photography is harsh in black and white. Some scenes are left out of focus or taken from the wrong perspective. Even the sound is bad! Some people are calling this art? <br /> <br />
