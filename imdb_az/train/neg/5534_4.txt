I'm working on Horror Classics 50 Movie Package and ZOMBIYE'S REVOLT is one of the movies in the set. <br /> <br /> I also point out that I watched the seven-year-old daughter protecting most of these films from heroism. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main cause of the zombies in the movie is Clive Barker's Serpent and Rainbow and James Bond Live and Let Die funeral scene, not the Dead Dead Night. However, his title is less than a love triangle surrounding Armand Louque, anthropologist Claire Duval, despite the word "zombies"; in turn, is accompanied by fellow Clifford Grayson. <br /> <br /> I have lived in a really difficult period for whom I work for allies or arrows; <br /> <br /> I was shocked to see Bela Lugosini in the credits of this movie; but, of course, these were the eyes (White Zombie), which served as a mental control device for zombies.
