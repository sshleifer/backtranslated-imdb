I think this trash piece is the best proof that good ideas can be eliminated, why all American animators today want the children's good GI JOE versions of good stories? Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history, but they are unlucky to be Xtreme, and I mean to come! Tiny Toons was a great example of an old idea that could be upgraded without losing its original appeal, but this piece of garbage is just an example of a stupid corporate decision that only children would love to create a cheap stupid show! !! guys true to superheroes ??? the whole show only takes time to see the new version of Looney Tunes, but this time it does not sound too bad as a super hero, but the problem is that it is too difficult to copy a series of battles as the animated series, or the new justice league, the result? The bad examples of the flash (runner) or superman (who else bugs bunny) problem was not meant to be dramatic at Looney Tunes, it should have been funny !!!! As I said before this series, why is it so many people wondering why anime is all over the world ??? this show is dramatic and tactful, but this is a series of animated and animated scenes, if you want to see Tiny Toons in a good way, this is an example of a return to life, but a good story and respect the original roots. The show has already died, and I can make another wise decision.
