Another theory of the Loleralacartelort7890 states: "In fact, Americans use the aluminum-radiation alloy, which is not very well known, the exact specification is secret and why it is secretive, if they compete in a space with the Russians, then a new one that can protect the crew from radiation it would be a great mood to show that they have technology. " This is completely wrong. There was no "mystery" in the protection of the radiation in Apollo. Design and construction of the Apollo Command Module is open to the public for a long time. Uses a lightweight "honeycomb" from aluminum and stainless steel. All external surfaces (except, of course, except the windows) are covered with a heat residue made of a thicker layer of phenolic resin. <br /> <br /> These materials are actually better when they are in the cosmos (loaded particles), which is the type of radiation that is much higher than that of the device. It is better to stop ionizing photons like X-rays and gamma rays. <br /> <br /> Space radiation is a specific problem for long-haul space flights due to the great solar battery risk. But there was no serious danger to Apollo astronauts. The commander's module was well preserved during a short (1/2 hour or more) transition with Van Allen belts. They all carry the dosimetry because we know exactly how much radiation is given to each of them: more than 1.5 rem, usually less. Of the 24 people flying to the moon (12 of them are now), there are still 18. Only two people died of cancer: Alan Shepard (leukemia) and Jack Swigert (bone cancer). The rest of the survivors died of heart attack, pancreatitis (Roosa) and motorcycle accident (Conrad). These are pretty good statistics for a group of men at the end of the 70s (Shepard 86).
