I do not believe this movie is the worst 250 of the IMDB, and it's totally horrifying. When I first saw it, I remember talking to a college class, and two of them had seen it. We did not see all the other members because it was very scary. In some cases, when we saw this, they wanted to see something because they did not believe something. Do not look like them, only pass. I am sure that everyone involved with this film will prefer not to see them in this movie.
