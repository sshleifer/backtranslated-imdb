As for the first part, it is not horror: it is (light and humorous) fun. As with many evolution, action begins immediately with no explanation. But there are bulls, so I do not complain. And real pigeons. If I understand correctly, it is rare today among the girls living in the United States. This is, in my opinion, the fact that the main actress is Pamela's "Bruce sister" Springsteen. <br /> <br /> I thought without the first film, so I compare. Again, there are very little clothing (mostly pants) and comic hair, it's hard to say what this movie is about for decades. Again, there is a strange character, and this is a more visible pathology. Especially camp staff. Some mental rehabilitation resembles a summer camp. People are old: Most actors must have at least 25, but I think they will be 16 or something. Some of the "methods" used by Evil Dyke are incredibly unpleasant. In fact, it has nothing to do with the first part of this movie, and it's worse than anything.
