It should be a great movie ... Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson play as two newspaper writers. It focuses on Mike Nichols. Uh uh Sheer dull stingless! Inefficient and predictable! Slow and unfocused! <br /> <br /> This is a cookie cutter 'The boy meets a girl, the girl marries the girl, the child is caught, the girl creates' story. Now you have the original understanding! After two hours (only two were like six people). I was not sure whether it was comedy, romance, tragedy or a soap opera. It was carried out in 1986. I'm sure we've forgotten everything sixteen years ago. I hope that the damage to Streep and others' reputation begins to heal, and the emulsion in the master begins to decline. This is not such a bad picture. Not just such a good one.
