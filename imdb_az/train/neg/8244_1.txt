I think this movie should be shocked. But this is the only way to shock, how shocking it is ... and simply. This is a half hour an hour. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <strong> movie. And I (usually) like horror films. I do not have any problems with violence in this type of movie. But all the violence in this film is not over. It's not just a strange thing, it's not a spectacle. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie (if the above were not so bad) was Blair Whitch's project, shooting with cheap cameras. But (again) this does not serve any end. "Blair", which is quite sure, has a comment, that is, they are looking for a blair witch with a camera. There is no other comment in this movie: "Hey ya'll, we want to see it as Blair Whitch!" The sound in the film is something to be oppressed. Do not tell them that they talked so many times. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's as bad as the rest of the noise, and the cheapest euro <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My advice is:
