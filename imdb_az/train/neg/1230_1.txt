Words can not describe how this story (and therefore this bad film) is completely foolish! Basinger, Del Toro ... what did you think? There is such a shopping center and its parking space is completely full. <br /> <br /> <strong > Bouchinger's character is going to get a cup of tea and some packaging papers. <br /> <br /> When he left, the whole place was empty, and no one was heard by two guns? Even though he lives there, can he go to the nearest police station or at least the most remote and sacred place when going away from the naked? COMING! Even other people will not go to the crescent red tool box because of what they have seen in advance. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> >
