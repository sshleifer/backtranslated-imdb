For some reasons, a family vacation in New Mexico after a major highway to travel to an abandoned city in 1948 and the disappearance of a family that is in deep concern. The city of Weaver is primarily harmless, and the family has a tourist appeal after being locked in one night and begins to have a good reason to suspect that others have been exposed to the same fatal consequences. Henleys watches the Blair-Witch-Project-esquire video, abandoned by the last victim of the city, which demonstrates everyone's best performance in this movie. While Hamlin and Dey are better than supporting speech, the emotional effect appears to me "flat" throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Disappointment has appealed to most of the film because there are very few minorities and better directions. However, the plot takes an unexpected and unfounded turnaround, which does not give an invisible meaning. Worse yet, there is nothing in the film that does not fully understand what is happening, making this strange ending less complicated. It seemed to me that filmmakers were directly involved in the creation of scene streams, and they dumped all the elements of the story: plot development, a gradual explanation of the themes and characters that led to a solution / conclusion. <br /> <br /> For me, the most difficult part of the film was spent to create tension and interest on a consecutive part of the first three quarters, <br /> <br /> Mr. President, what happened to the original Weaver people? What was the relationship with the people at dinner? What did the sheriff know? <br /> <br /> <strong> For some fruits and strange events, I have to say a lot of things to assume some complicated comments I spent brainpower just to finish the movie without just answering one of these things. These are some nice cliffs for the end of a miniature on the pickup next week, but it is completely frustrating and incomplete for a single movie.
