First, just looking at the DVD box, I drew my doubts and read that they talked about a group of young people gathering from a lake that would find something. <br /> <br /> Like any movie on the first Friday, any movie was a little bit complicated. <br /> <br /> I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times. I just thought it would be a little better. He did not do it. Normally, there is something you can get from every movie. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a blessing and find something constructive for about 80 minutes. Someone give yourself a papercut or eat dirt.
