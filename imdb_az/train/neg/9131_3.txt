<br /> <br /> At times, I watched the 6 Fu movie ... Boris Karloff and all 5 Kris Lees. The last 2 Lees, both of which were directed by Jess Franco (and I use this word softly) was disgusting. <br /> <br /> Behold, I was watching it. Never Never. You know better than a bad movie? S *** is a really nice piece. And this is FIENDISH PLOT. Very good looking movie. <br /> <br /> And, of course, it's one of the worst works in film history! ALL production design, sets, clothing, music, photography, editing, !!! AAAUGH !!!!! The first minute of the film is so deceptive ... one can make a mistake for a decent film. And then they start to read "happy birthday to Fu ..." and goes uphill. Burt Kwouk (his master tells "Your face - is familiar") was the closest thing for them to be funny, causing them to extinguish the fire accidentally, Fu's elixir vitae, which resulted in his torture, grave and a sentence of cutting his ears. Someone liked what they wanted to do with a "camping" movie - it would be so ridiculous. RIDICULOUS, this ... FUNNY ... NOT. At least. <br /> <br /> It is upset, because it is clear that in the first few minutes, one has done a lot of research into the Fu Mancho series, many of which are "right." With a different script - either really one of FUNNY, or a dead Serious, they might - be - must - have a classic in their hands. <br /> <br /> <strong> There was a period in the late 1970s. in all terrible movies, all 30s of the classic characters were definitely animated. Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Tarzan, Only Ranger, Charlie Chan, and even Doc Savage. I'm not sure this could be the worst. Sid Cesar (who is the uncle of Al Capone, the FBI president - what does it mean?) Especially in any scene, he controls great self-esteem in all parts. The ideas in the film are not funny ... they often do nothing to the PAGE. We started seeing the "audition" dance routines, such as playing "dancing" the police officers to imitate the Queen and the Queen and dancing, dancing and cycling. How many drugs have been given to the writers of this article to force them to do any of them? <br /> <br /> I said it was a sober ... and all the talents, including Peter Sellers (Fu and Nayland Smith), Burt Kwouk in the movie Chris Lee Fu), Helen Mirren (in shockingly in love with the devil and the police woman who stole the last half-hour of the damn film). I'm starting to wonder whether everyone will not get a "fair" Fu Manchu movie, or will fans be pleased to say that Carloff is just one of them?
