We reached the ceiling of this movie with an inaccessibility. Basically dinosaurs came to this ship (after watching this movie) tested by a strange old fart called Neweyes. Apparently, Neweyes listens to the wishes of the children everywhere and decides that children want their desires to be brought to the modern times by the dinosaurs for their mysterious exploitation. Dinosaurs eat these products that make them easy (there were not many screenwriters). By the way, what would happen to any of the children in the world seem to be foolish, and Neweyes wants to bring dinosaurs to modern times? Why do not they want to save children from starvation? Disease? War? So come! Does not Neweyes have anything better with this power? Finally, when the dinosaurs are in the modern era, they begin to sing, dance, and start singing (especially when you are in a bad LSD journey, do I play another T-Rex golf and spin a Spider man?). They end up in the circus, and the Neweyes Brother Screweyes (???) sign a contract with the children of the dinosaurs. Why? Why do children sign an empty contract? Screweyes says if it's part of the dinosaurs ... Brain-Drain will let the kids go. The dinosaurs instead give away the bad Screweyes limb separately, and agree with its terms. Yes?! That's stupid! They could only insult him, leave the contract, eat it, then go with the kids. Filmmakers try to show that the dinosaurs finally fled and that a group of crows covered the Screweyes and that it was absolutely devastating, the violence that was the point of violence. Yes, it is not intense! We are not irrational, it is not fun, but contains the biggest hole in the grinding, stupid, weak writing and film. Even for a child's movie ... it's BAD.
