This movie is a continuation of the "White Zombie" because it is made by the same person (Halperin) and zombie features. Halperin, George A. Romero, from his day, does not hesitate to convey this. <br /> <br /> There is a man who can control the minds of the people of Cambodia, and his force says that the zombies can be released. <br /> <br /> This film is in the scene where it is really superior. Cambodian temples and dancers are very beautiful and zombie looks very strong. Unfortunately, we will not engage most of the zombies, and the love story plays a huge role in a fear film (although there is a subsequent reason for this). <br /> <br /> In the 1930s, we would like to see zombies attack the desperate city, but this film was not just delivered. And no stronger (like Bela Lugosi) had to wait to fight against our heroes. And Lugosi's eye? It's a nice effect, but it's never misleading in the movie ... why not create it again with the eyes of the new actor? Generally, a movie that can be re-operated with a small comedy and possibly one-day movie (especially when post-war era). Heck, if the smells have eyes, this movie has the hope.
