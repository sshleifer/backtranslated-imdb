A woman asked advice on the road to reach a mysterious city and heard two strange stories related to the zombie. But maybe the destiny is a very bad thing for him ... <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles is one of the worst films I've ever seen. In fact, I must admit that I was out of the wilderness because I was too bad. And there was a lot, I believe. It only runs for 69 minutes and still has tons filler. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> for the title characters, there is an evidence in the movie. More than the previous feature, why do you get more verbal moves on the entry! <br /> <br /> There are also information on the events taking place at the initial stage of the vote. It has been posted to someone else's cellphone for broadcasting on Youtube. Silent camera work, scratching over the print, vibrating lights ... When I realized that it was implemented in 2001, not in 2001, I had to rub my eyes. Even clothes and about three decades are obvious! <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the whole movie, if you are not qualified to review the Chronicles, go on. I think of your sitting, I will not even bring the first appearance of a blue-and-white stranger before giving and giving your excuses. It is so ridiculous that everyone should release it and honestly listen to your disc, rather than torturing your DVD player with this awful excuse. Do not be surprised if you pack your bags and leaves in the morning, condemned to watch the VHS cassettes for the rest of your life. You have been warned ... 0/10 <br /> P.S On the sex scene, does the female keep a massive sports column of a terrible 18 degrees type? Look, the movie can not get that part right ...
