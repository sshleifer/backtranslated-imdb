It was based on historical events, and we know that this documentary filmmaker has been freed to make it more dramatic - I live with it - but that was so bad! In the midst of an air crash, everyone would have been silent, no doubt a person would be panic, and no smooth flight, no passenger frustration! I'm not convinced that some of today's air traffic safety features seem to have OTT assumptions, but if you take your shoes before an extraordinary boot, healthy thinking is not a good idea! The shooting of this huge plane on this far-off plane was devious and fraudulent. In fact, it would have been an awesome look recently seen from the ground, it was disproportionate in the film and probably looked like an example. Rescue cylinders appeared on the front and middle hurricane gates, but no one was left out of the front, although the enemy was less. The captain returned to the plane after landing - why? this has never been disclosed. We know the extra opening is outside fuel, but some fuel tanks should be burned and the risk of explosion should be a real threat, but the evacuation seems almost slow, and everyone stands at the foot of sliding slides rather than as far away as possible, and I'm sure I'll do it. There are only a few contradictions, mistakes, and similar attitudes. I would prefer seeing the drama real-time and seeing the real-life of the aircraft. There was a potential for being so excited because of the failure of budgetary barriers, but surely there was a real danger that an airplane that did not lose all engines would not really be a big deal and would safely slip down for a bare landing! - Of course, the reality is somewhat different!
