The main feature of the film is that Jobson looks forgotten - explaining a story to you. Spectators do not have to think about it because they see it. The movement moves together with the most delusional narratives of the sensitive fifth posture of the purple prose. And here it should be unnecessary, because here is a beautiful toy and some are beautifully drawn and stained. Maybe Jobbo felt the need to support a basic story burning. And it could have been correct, there was no major truth: in the 1970s, Edinburgh did not have a delicate spot for the Velvet Underground and a soft spot for a sosopath. From a very clean and new look, this character tries to unite all that looks like cod intellect, all of which is my taste.
