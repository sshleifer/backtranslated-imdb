If there is hell, GRAND CANYON has a screen that has been played over and over again in an eternal round. Danny Glover, Alfre Vudard, Kevin Kline, Mary Louise Parker - would be hoping for a very magnificent actor to help Maryam McDonnell (the manifestation of her own films for eternity). But, no. As you can see, McDonnell also combined a series of other actors with a serum. All the work is ambitious, overturned, insulting (if you are deaf or if you are aware of it, prepare blood for boiling on an unhealthy TDD scene). GRAND CANYON is full of immoral, self-interested people, but never gives us any reason to love / understand / patience or even tolerate them. Without gene pool, except for rare, it would be better for them to lose them without harm. There are no spheres to speak, no character development (these people will never develop), no distortion performance, and there's no writing that you'll encounter in a movie. The best thing about GRAND CANYON? Her name. This is a great HOLE of a movie.
