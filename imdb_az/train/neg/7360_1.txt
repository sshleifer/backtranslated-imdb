This is one of the worst action films I've ever seen. This is especially true of the fact that if the virus "did not find a living host," even if the virus was actually found to be non-objectivity (a bank is talking about a credit agent as talking to a phone or scientist who is safe to access in a room) will not know), cheap sets (bank is built as a dungeon) and it's a bad move. This is a story of an organized criminal group that successfully stole a capsule of the deadly virus. At the same time, the prime minister, who decided to withdraw from the bank's security warrants, also lost a bank, informed the same FBI agents, and at the same time removing a terrible earthquake. The result of the earthquake is more than one. However, the results will not make a charming movie, but instead it's a z-degree dump from the start of the film. (Perhaps, in the packaging, some images on the screen were created by computer graphics rather than actual screen manuscripts from different types of film). Ron Perlman did it in Hell, I had no idea. I was ashamed to watch it.
