In many films I have seen in Warren Oates, I have come to a certain conclusion, here is a talented individual. First of all, I saw Mr. Oates in the 1960s television series Stoney Burke. Since then, I have been closely acquainted with my career, and it has been set up for great roles. In 1974, Sam Peckinpah gave him a ball billing in a film called "Bring Alfredo Garcia's Head". Without a doubt, his biggest claim to glory was his glorious role in The Wild Bunch. I always thought that any character could bring a certain magic, that is, I saw it on the flop. The film is called "Chandler", dedicated to iron detectives created by Raymond Chandler of the 1950s. Because this synopsis was a private Eye with a nose, it was immediately curious. However, I sat down patiently throughout the entire film and found that if there was a theme or a structure, it would have been a dull, flamboyant, slow paced, twisted, mixed saga if it were in a dark rear room. With some of the best supporting collectives and Hollywood, Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this movie had enough power to reach Mach 5, but that's where. As a result, one of my favorite actors remained in a weak vehicle and never stopped. **
