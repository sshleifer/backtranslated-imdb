This film causes the Canadians and the Brits to be asinine, moronic, and stupid. Men get stoned / drunk, and then they almost destroy each other on stage. Women Are Not Over To The Story? Do not understand why? Each scene is dragged as a compound or even worse cattle. As you can see, Canadian women or hulking controversial vulgar tramps or hippie chicks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Every character here is watery, infantile stereotype. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify" did not seem to need a shower, and the idea of ​​any scene is sex with George Wendt? It's enough to shut it down! <br /> <br /> Tracey is not a great player, but a spare moment, but his talent is wasted here. Do you worry about trying to get it? Or who Karl died? But who is actually a very excited character in the minds of those who are left behind? (Do not worry about comparing these two movies, though not as Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock's work), why worry about you? <br /> <br /> According to some of the movies, Karl is so upset when making the conditions of death glad. <br /> <br /> Until the end of this unhappy movie, I thought he would go with her!
