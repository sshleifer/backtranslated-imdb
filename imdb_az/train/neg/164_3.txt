I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but I was expecting it. <br /> <br /> I was interested in Enterprise's pre-hype descriptions, its underwater style and rough-tipped technology compared to the Treks used. <br /> <br /> I did not see anything interesting. this is a pilot. <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm talking about the events in the Caucasus. <br /> <br /> Vulcan Baba had a hell of an incredible shelf. <br /> <br /> But I do not think I'll shoot a lamp in this series. <br /> <3/10
