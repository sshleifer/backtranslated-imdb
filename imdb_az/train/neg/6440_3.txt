This was one of the worst Wrestlemania I've ever seen. It really did not really matter. Cardinal was clever, I thought it would be pretty good, but every match had just fallen short. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs MVP One of the better matches. Benoit took her. I did not think the MVP was big, but Benoit rescued this game. <br /> <br /> Kane and Xali Way, these two men are not mixed. Or maybe there is no mixture of Halal and any human. <br /> <br /> <br /> The Caucasus game. <br /> <br /> <strong> Melina vs Ashley I'm not the admirer of female wrestling <br /> <br /> ECW Originals vs. New Breed I was thrilled about this game until I saw it. Really really disappointing. <br /> <br /> Edge vs CM Punk vs. King Booker vs Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs. Randy Orton The worst MITB match ever. Just leave a great deal, but also for many people in the ring. <br /> <br /> Hope O.K. met Bobby Lashley. <br /> <br /> Batista vs Undertaker This was probably the best night of the night. Too good to see a good thing, very, very nice. <br /> <br /> I'm meeting John Cena - Shaw Michaels. People claim to be Batista vs Undertaker, but this game was good. I started noticing that I'd win every match of Cenan. It's a little old. Now I want to say that this match is the best of the night, but I'm a fan of great Shawn Michaels, so I'm a bit biased. Batista vs' Taker could have been better, but I was biased, so ... I was sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best matches of the night, and the vast majority of them came to a very short time.
