<br /> <br /> This film has shown that the Jewish racist hatred by David Mamet is more than I have ever met in an American movie. Stereotypes are above and above the ability to continue watching. Joe is also disappointed <br /> <br /> Mantegna, in a Jewish center in New York City, called a bunch of cleansing weapons in general, and gained a common sense. <br /> <br /> I am concerned about the fact that Jews are not "Americans" but "different". I think Mr. Mamet is one of the causes of hatred, not the same healing.
