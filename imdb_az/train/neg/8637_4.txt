A mystery film with some illicit elements of fear; <br /> <br /> Starts with a woman with a nightmare of her husband's bed, she goes into the room of her crying child and kills her. He wakes up. Then he dies in a hospital and pours blood. <br /> <br /> The wife of her husband wants to come in contact with her dreams (I think) and she wants to know who killed her before her body is completely broken down in her grave. <br /> <br /> Who is doing this, even how a mystery; will be figured out long before the appearance of most viewers. <br /> <br /> In any case, there is an element of horror: the killing of a murderer, the recurring imagination of a murderer, a nightmare, an egg egg, and then a few ghosts in the nightmare and actually broken in the grave there is. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised to see a sacrifice at the end of Fulc√≠n for Clive Barker! It's interesting.
