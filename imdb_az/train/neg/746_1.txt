<br /> <br /> Save the movie and save $ 8.97 in Walmart to get this DVD and watch the real movie so I'm an enthusiastic fan of HG Wells. It hopes to indulge and watch for three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to watch it because it was not able to watch it for a couple of minutes. There is something terrible. <br /> <br /> Timoti Hines says he has a $ 20 million budget for this production. Where did you go? He used the most to buy a new home? To fund his scholarship? Or what? Let me start with something really good about this movie. The book remains true and has some good performance. I obviously respect actors who want to make this a good movie. But good speeches were terribly afraid of a short time ... and I mean terrifying special effects. Any first-year student could have done a better job with CGI. <br /> <br /> For me, most of them should use a $ 20 million project that resembles the board stop cuts used by the advanced CGI program. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for amateur post production. She admitted to this film. My partner and I used the version of our Ferry scenic version of $ 1500.00 a day to create a five-minute event that looked better and more realistic than Hines's. I've seen movies with a budget less than $ 2 million look better. Very Good. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the special effects used in the original King Kong were more complicated and better than Hines's special effects in this movie. In fact, because of this film, there is a better estimate for the attack of the Killer Tomatoes. <br /> <br /> There is no excuse for today's technology to make a movie look like the 50th B-movie. <br /> <br /> I had a problem with DVD transfer. <br /> <br /> Another film about film shootings and film shooting was demonstrated. <br /> <br /> Generally, I would like to say that in 2003, I made a $ 45,000 project with better cinematography and special effects than this movie. /> <br /> I strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film organization or anyone who is a fan of WOTW to shelve this movie and watch the 50 foot women's attack. It would be easier for eyes to see.
