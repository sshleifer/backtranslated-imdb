I was reading articles about this Wonder Woman suit for this television movie. It should be noted at the time of the film's preparation that it has no traditional outfit. Producers were loyal to the WW concept of the comic book writer in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> I very much appreciate the other posters here for the film itself. Snoozefest! When I went to ABC in 1974, I was a kid, so I was right to evaluate a movie about a comic book hero. <br /> <br /> I have not commented on this issue either. <br /> <br /> While chatting with me :-)
