This shooting team did not have good access to the occupied territories, as the Israeli shootings dominated. I was involved in the mixed moments of mothers. The mother of Israel lost a child with great happiness. The Palestinian mother lost only one child living in a lifetime of childbirth and despair. There is no real chance of meeting anybody with such completely different ideas or at any meeting. The word "peace" did not mean the same to each of them. The Palestinians were free to peace. There was peace in Israel. Is such a film really worthwhile in such a disadvantage? I ended up feeling that I was following a senseless propaganda - both sides were incredible.
