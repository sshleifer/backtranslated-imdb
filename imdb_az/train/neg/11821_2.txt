I look forward to watching this movie whenever I look at the positive reviews for this movie. Wrong error. I've seen a 950+ movie and it's really one of the worst of them - it's almost horrible - editing, pacing, storyline, 'actor' soundtrack (the only song in the movie - the bare country melody is four times smaller). The film looks cheap and bad, and is extremely boring. Rarely I was very happy to see the latest credits of a movie. <br /> <br /> This is Harvey Keitel, the only thing that prevents me from giving my 1st account. It is at least a bit far from its best performance. Only for Keitel obsessives.
