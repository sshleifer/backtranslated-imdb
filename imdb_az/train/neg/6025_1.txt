The Right Left is a movie we need to help the Christians (and any other naive person) to feel like "thinking" and "believing" (not "knowing"), the right to know what we know. But at the same time I feel bad for small children because it's not a good movie. Does not help any message. I'm working in a video store and people knew the ONLY reason they went to see this movie because they were religious and they were thinking. In this world, which knows what will happen in the future, ANBODY is wrong, as long as they do not know what they are unaware of. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I have enough on this subject (just because I'm too then a film by a semi-talented television actor, thinking of walking in the air with the nose of these people, means something above me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself, you will stay away. I do not deny going to any detail about this movie (because it did not see it because AI) B - it was very shocking for my atheist-myself (because it was not) or CI really is not (it's no word that helps you figure out the movie) ) I want this movie to go out of my head, I do not want to implement it, I AM MEETING WITH ANY EXAMPLE from my head, I do not want Kirk to proudly say that he wants me to ask him for a message from the end of the film. there is something directly related to this movie floating in my head without seeing these films in my head. FUTURE FUTURE My peaceful anger ends. Someone in the world went to the theater to see what could happen to this movie. People, Animals or Rain Forest charities are given a Seven Dollar Plus, in the future (but not). then they think that they do not want to believe the "truth" that they believe to be true, but they can actually have the truth. LEFT BEHIND ZERO (out of ****)
