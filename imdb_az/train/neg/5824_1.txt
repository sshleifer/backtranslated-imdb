I thought it would be nice at least aesthetically. Slow, ambitious, and boring. I fell asleep right away. There are some worthy songs, but there's a song that finally ends with "Yaowwww!" There is a guy who says. When someone finds a random object on a wooden object. They say that there are some nice songs, but hte is not worth seeing. Go to iTunes (have albums), preview and select the best. <br /> <br /> Half of the film is a man who makes tea. Yes, this is a little exaggeration. But you see what I would say. It is said: THERE IS!
