I watched this movie just about 15 minutes ago, and I still have no idea what to watch. Basically I think that CD Roms, which is as real flash animated on the internet, is a film about the internet-S & M "star". He was killed by a group of his brother and two FBI agents to investigate the killing of a death squad. Big City, a US local casualty division, is also being investigated, although most of its work uses CD-ROMs, as it claims to be real, as "real". I know. Wow. <br /> <br /> Michael Madsen is the only film in the film that has all kinds of credit behind. The film is about 15 minutes away, and half of it hits a child for any reason that is apparent to the main girl. I will not even explain it to you, because I can not do it myself clearly. But before the final scene, we're curing a 3 or 4-minute installation of everything in the movie. Honestly, they were able to escape the final scene and even have the same effect as everyone else's eyes. <br /> <br /> Generally, avoid this movie. Because I love bad movies and love Michael Madsen. I actually used another thing for 80 minutes and were more pleased. As you play a game with a knife you repeat in your hands. It would be more entertaining for 80 minutes.
