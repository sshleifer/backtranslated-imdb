There are many bugs with this picture, but also begins with a clear and unnecessary script. Courtney Cox plays a comic book artist who runs to a small desert city after being harassed twice in the big city. She immediately stalked on a local (Craig Sheffer) and attempted to imitate Mickey Rourke of the third degree. D.B. Sweeny is a local police officer who is supposedly to protect and serve. In the meantime, the screenplay focuses on the audience who really is the good man? Logic stretches from the window in the first ten minutes and will never go back and there are more unanswered questions. If you think that Blue Desert will be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. Its part, like the whole film, is insignificant. - MERK
