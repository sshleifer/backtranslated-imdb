This movie is really a good piece of eggs in one piece. Unlike other reviewers, the main mistake about it is that the viewer does not care about the characters and the field. I sat down because I was interested in rokn'roll and bandwidth, but if I value it as a movie, I have to give her fingers down. A few warnings: Jason Behr is a good and good rock singer by John Livian; Despite his good attitude towards his parents, his behavior is strange to the audience (which is not), although his childhood traumas are not clear. Nevertheless, the idea of ​​using a scene identity for the solution of internal conflicts is interesting, although this film is not a new subject but has not been fully investigated. John Lennon's accusations were irritating, but I'm not a Beatles fan. In any case, Livien and his group, more than Beatles, reminded Oasis that there was something about them. Another frustrating thing about the film was that of a series of interesting, middle, and upper-level schools - with key philosophical thoughts, but left her thinking. Livian says "there was music before God" (advertising for Tia Maria in the 1990s, "Tia Maria"). Although it looks like a characteristic result, he does not know how to reach the audience, but he has the right. Fortunately, his bassist and friend, Dominic Monaghan, considers the mistake of this thought in response to the question "Do not know". <br /> <br /> In general, the limited power of direction and power can go to future projects either inadmissible or in an interesting and mature perspective.
