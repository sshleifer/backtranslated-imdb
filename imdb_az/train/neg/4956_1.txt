When this animated film was released for the first time, I was impressed that it would be at least half the size, and the guy made a mistake. I have to admit that watching this cartoon, I watched Batman and Robin all year ago with George Clooney. I watched several episodes and two of them used Batman's battleships like Jet Li right and left with Batman penguin and watched an episode that Batman's pop was re-started by Joker, as Jackie Chan was thrown into the air like a ninja was doing. When was the joker or penguin a match for Batman? Joker and Penguin interrupted by Kung Fu and Jackie Chan and Jet Li are pretty bad. It is really embarrassing, surprising, and surprising, reflecting the image of Batman in this show. The animation is horrible and the dialogue is horrible. Regardless of whether I have been a fan of Batman since childhood, I advise you to stay away from this show and stay away from it because you do not anticipate the true image of Batman. This animated film is more like a Wannabe Kung Fu Flick and I strongly recommend the Batman animation series, but if you want to see a classic Batman animated film, this cartoon is a piece of S-T! Get Batman: Do not waste your time with The Animates Series and this cartoon.
