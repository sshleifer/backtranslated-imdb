Lame movie. Not absolutely curious. There is no chemistry between Indiana Jones and the man from Black Hawk Down. The car chase scene is just and much more, and the name goes on stinging. They can drive vehicles several times, but they always end up in the tail of the baddies. The scene where Hartnett's family car had cared for children was probably foolish. It is a funny or sensitive thing that imagines Eastern philosophy and writer's thoughts. <br /> <br /> Some subplots were not even explored, they were just used as filler. Why Hartnett gets sick when seeing dead bodies, but is still burger on criminal scenes? Why and on what basis is the evil IA guy born out of heaven by the direct supervisor? Why can I take my family friends and then just answer their phones and act like Indian mysticism and then put waltz somewhere in your wrist without any slack? Although Ford appears as a fraudster and fraud while acting as a realtor, it will return to him (even when the producer wants to sell his house to close his commission). They knew that both of them were lying! But they said they would not go too. Stupid, just stupid. It is also one of the police films that they only burn in unusual streets in public streets that do not care for innocent people in the world. While people ducked up on the cover, they were just standing in the blast in front of the road. <br /> <br /> Scenario script was terrible, the movement schemes were boring, and the surface was an approach to a very miserable attempt. Ford and Hartnett have roots. Unfortunately, it fails. And Ford's Phone! Leave these damned things! How many times can you play a 2-hour movie? 50? 60? The film was frustrating with the midpoint! Every 30 seconds, this stupid rhythm will play! And if Ford did not, then Hartnett was calling! Full use of time, Ford's worst movie, since 6 Nights 7 Nights, undoubtedly was the lowest point of his career.
