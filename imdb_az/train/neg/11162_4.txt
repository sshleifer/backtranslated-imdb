Jack Black is a heartwarming character. This is a 14 year old frustrating indie movie. Do I have to write eight lines? Ana de la Reguera is a dangerous thing to look at; Jack Black's rough progress. This is a version of PG version of an indie movie. Really, it's like a brave film to explore Mexican culture. This film explores Mexican culture in depth. I just drown in cultural intolerance: Jack Black is just too rude. A white man like Jack Black is my most valuable emissar in Mexican culture. Mexican Wrestling culture is not the most different place, it's not a white man as I look for myself. I think Mexico's Jack Black is more culturally opaque <br /> <br /> I think IMDb has changed my mind.
