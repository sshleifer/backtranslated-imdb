I saw this movie when I was really small. This is one of the finest films I have ever seen. </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ p> <p> Like Toy Story, where toy toys come to the yard and Raggedy enters an adventure to rescue Bab and his new friend, Ann and Andy. There is madness here. Heroes, Looneys, a sea monster called Gazooks, and many tunes that are read by many pirates, all of which created the stranger of the film. Also, I do not feel Babette is disturbed and sad. <br /> <br /> Although I did not like this movie, there were some sweet parts. I loved the camel's song. Although it was a song about being alone, it was a feeling of friendship. Then it was Sir Leonard. While most looneys were just plain nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest. King Koo Koo, Dr. It was a small land that made Evil look like a serious villain. Also, there was Raggedy Andy's song, No Girl Toy. It was an absolute good song for young boys who wanted to move hard. However, honestly, even these things did not make the film better. <br /> <br /> Although I personally invite this movie, I have to admit that I have a lot of charming moments. See if you are curious, but only if you really are in a mood for something "really".
