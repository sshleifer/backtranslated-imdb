A very young Roddy McDowall, a father-in-law, is preparing for Flicka and is the only reason for watching the film first. This is one of those continuous films that lends itself to a headache headache when you know it, when the music is fastened and shaded down through the dialog. McDowall's next-generation "Thunderhead, the son of Flicka" is a little marginal than the original, but the pace remains slow and at least one or two scenes that do not cause a coma.
