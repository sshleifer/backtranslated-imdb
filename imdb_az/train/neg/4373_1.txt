I think that I'm blaming myself for the huge disappointment of the "Ivy's Parties". If you pay attention to the fact that the film was produced in the mid-80s, you know that you will not expect a cinematic witness when you see such a juicy and proud headline. There are many demented and sick filmmakers in Japan now, but Kazuo Komizu overcomes aggressive sex with all kinds of aggressive and frightening trials and nothing but sadistic abuse of young girls. Not even trying to explain a story, "Leo Sides" simply will not ask the most unloved admirer of the horror of the seventies 80, introduces a hodgepodge of slaughtered semi-pornographic sex and real poorly-groomed effects. Many photographers and fashion models are in contact with an occasional bankruptcy scene with an unusual old girl. She even empties her even in a minute (typical), and wishes to remain, even if she should share it with other women. I can not get it. Was this a general manifestation of fantasy? Because it's really clich√© and tyranny. In any case, return to the backdrop of backdroped photographs and entertaining models. A group of people who are surprised by the fog of their way compress themselves in an abandoned country house, where they are a more brave and ultimately a victim of a ridiculous sex-devil who kills everybody. The actress performances are amateurish, believing in dialogue and primitive and comedian weak and thirsty. I can show all of these, including the intolerance of sexual relations with women, but it is very close to translating the movie during an indescribably mean-spirited wrestling series. One of the men males, shoots and throws one of the girls and calls her naked prostitutes, and she cries for a long time, without using her panties. This consistency is definitely my bottom line, the absolute lower point of Asian exploiting films. Escape and even boycot.
