"The Older Elder" is in a world I do not understand. An e-shop employee can not publish and reprimand videos of a world and naked donkey that can tell the boss "f *** off". A world where the world is really a spectacular world of drunken slippers and other nations' cars. A world that looks good to a boss blows on her sexual harassment. A world filled with horror and insulting stereotypes of ethnic minorities. A world without any funny jokes! I was totally shocked by the chorus of the audience who loved this film. Every scene was thought to be a live sketch on a bad Saturday night - it was not funny to start and stretched across all rational thinking. Simply, the characters on the edge of Carell were unambiguously marked. And the romantic elements, especially Keener, were the scene where Carell found porn. <br /> <br /> I also found the "Aquarius" to be completely hardworking and over-extreme. Hated To Hate This Movie Hate!
