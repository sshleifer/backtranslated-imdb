The executive producer, Wes Craven, finances Weinsteins for this huge budget crisis: Bram Stoker (probably does not want everything for himself), the thrash-metal update of Dracula, and the slasher-styled blows and the rest There is nothing for our parts. Christopher Plummer, in modern times like Van Helsing, speaks not of one of the generations of Van Helsing; after he fled to New Orleans after he was stolen from the Van Helsinki cousin, continues to keep with the lugs from Dracula's body, which came out of the coffin. This is what New Orleans needs in the 21st century! Well-done, but with no original idea (except for racist victims), the film is both stunning and distorted and repeats itself after about an hour. * from ****
