I will not approach the RAW theory and criticize it. That is, not a site about the movie, and that the film will be given or not, but the site is not a philosophy of discussion. <br /> <br /> Saying this video is really a blow. After another, RAW takes a conversation title. Some are an archive video, so you can see how old you are over the years, and it's pretty cool. <br /> <br /> This is a strange comparison, but I think Sunday afternoon when I watched Barbra Streisand star car * Funny Lady * (Another really bad) movie). After some time in OB Barbra, I wish you to have an invisible scene: you know, "in the meantime, another character in the movie was up to something else ..." But it was about Barbra. Well this is video of RAW's * Funny Lady *. <br /> <br /> So, if your idea of ​​a good time is to look at many theories and perspectives from RAW, referring to its theories, it is gathered or thought in a naked structure that does not interest you, and then become my guest. I could not get it for 20 minutes.
