This loss of time is a totally unnecessary reconstruction of a great movie. Unlike Perry's backdrop, no new and original addition is added, which is a marginal interest. The documentary sense of the first film and its so effective effectiveness do not lose its relevance. Quincy Jones soundtrack, which is also very addictive to the original film that has been severely lost. I do not understand any high rating for this. Very bad. Why do anyone spend money or money so far and when did I spend watching it?
