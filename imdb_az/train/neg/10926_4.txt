Though the idea is more original than most Sci-Fi films, performance is not as usual. Practical mummy effects are not bad, and the "Gun Guns" character is inducing the top giggle, but realistic shooting is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin on the small screen. I doubt that this idea is entirely intact. Morena's character has some moments to look for "Tomb Raider" style shirts, for me at least 40 minutes. I'm not a high-tech movie, but when you see it, you can not deny the true beauty !!! And Adam Baldwin smoothes it like a man who wants to hate it again. If you just want to watch a few of your favorite Fireworks characters, spend a good time with a few subtitles, this may be for you. Look elsewhere if you want to work well and develop character.
