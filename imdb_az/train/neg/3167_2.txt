Henri, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd) and his fiancée Kate (Eva Longoria), are looking for last-minute measures to be taken. This is the morning of their morning, and Kate is screaming at the hands of those who are prepared for cooking requirements. The horrors of the horrors, the "angel" ice sculptures ordered by Kate came without wings. In a battle with a sculptor, a heavy "ice" girl flies to Kate and sends her to the Hereafter. Now, a year later, Henry is a psychic to explain to his younger brother, Kate, who wants to start and advance with other ladies. However, your favorite media is Ashley (Lake Bell) Henry himself, and his partner partner, Jason Biggs. More importantly, on the other hand, Kate returns to threaten Ashley because another woman is unable to get her hands on Henry. Can there be anything to bring Kate to heaven for goodness? This is a baseless romantic comedy, and I have never seen this most sensitive admirer. No, they are not cast as they try to work. Long-lasting fiancé is beautiful and funny as Bell, and Bell has an unusual style and humor that is contagious at the same time. Biggs also flips a funny theater. As for Rudd, a very talented singer (See Anchorman, Knocked Up or Clueless) asks for more than anything else and is actually the main reason to see this clown. His charm, appearance and easy intelligence make the film harder. But nothing can be turned into a groundless scrip and terrifying direction, absolutely nothing. So, if you are a fan of a dyed romantic comedy, think long and hard before hitting any money out of this money. There are also free tickets for you to fall into your lap, and warn that this movie is a close death experience for fans of love and laughter.
