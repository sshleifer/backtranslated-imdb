If it were some strange compilation Oscar Academy prize festival, this flick would have won all. All the gods have extreme special effects with perfect trickery, extremely good acting skills, and, of course, the famous superstar in every role. Yes, this is a scenario if the world turns into a reverse. Instead of appearing to read scripts from a teleprinter with a bad dyslexia, but also special effects are pretty bad, not only bad actors, but also the worst horror flick. For example, Satan's suits (as seen from this point of view) are the most delightful thing I've ever seen. When I saw a red black-black color, the screen could not put my monster back. <br /> <br /> Military operations against the people living in the Caucasus continue. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Thinking that IMDB received less than 5 votes, saying "It's a good shot, it can not be bad." <br /> <br /> I also will not use more words in this movie.
