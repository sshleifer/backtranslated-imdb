Really ??? <br /> <br /> Glad to see the brightest comments here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. This is a great miserable, berry, clich√©. I laughed loudly, and I would have been in history with many former military men. I could not hide anything other than BOREDOM. Yes, my history is like a straight-line "good old boy". This is not a compliment. I know an actor wants to work ... It's nice for others. But Ralph, come. <br /> <br /> Ralf had a painful anxiety. Since Ralph looks so surprising, I only give 2 votes. But how should I treat Ralph? Why? <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to watch "End of the Work" to heal and restore .... C1
