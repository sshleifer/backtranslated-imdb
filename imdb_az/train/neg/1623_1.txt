The creation of a television series in a famous writer's work is not a guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television released the "Racing Game" under the collective name after it became popular in 1979 with Dick Franc's books. Mike Gwilym Sid Halley, an old jockey turned a special eye after an accident that lost his right hand, replaced him with an artificial substitute. Gwilm was suffering from a defective charisma (and looked at one of the bad guys) while Mick Ford (playing Chico Barnes excitedly) encouraged me to think of a horse donkey when it was on the screen. For six weeks, this lesser dynamic duo focuses on unpleasant areas that are commonly used against the peasants, in ordinary ways - usually blackmail, kidnapping, or doping horses. Yorkshire Television pulled out the show, but it did not do any good. Difficult, sexual, immoral and recurring, often taken to the yard of swords.
