First, a little overview. This correspondent, Torch, is trying to get the story of a zombie epidemic and censor it on military and government. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div> If someone thinks it's higher than anything else by George Romero, it's enough for the reviewer to remain loyal to a mental body. The script was written by a sixth grader. For special effects, you realize that independent films have low budgets and some negative effects are acceptable, but if you want a scene with a fire, here is a hint: there are some flammable substances, a ready-made fire extinguisher and a fire! Add it on a digital basis and look like an explosion from a Nintendo 64 game. Imagine that you put it in a good way. In my summer theatrical program, cold reading of the writings, compared to this, is the father of Koca. I will not even go to controversy. <br /> <br /> What's bothering me, but when everything is finished and finished after someone has finished, someone says, "OK, it looks good, leave it." It even sends you down a cold to think about it, and one thinks that this DVD is good enough for free. DVD quality is not. This is not the quality of the Sci-Fi channel. Hell, this is not the quality of this movie. If you are presenting a project in a movie school this way, it would be a F., and even an F, like F. <br /> <br /> After seeing this issue, I felt I was using it. Blockbuster and the creators of this film have my money and I ask not to think about what they do with it. I have been the leader of some advanced, weak circuits in legitimate theft and 28 days later I do not feel good looking at the back part with pleasant memories. Just watch a movie Ed Wood and then say, "I did not pay much attention to it." This movie is the most terrifying film I've ever seen. I did not see anything by Ed Wood, but that's worse. If you are looking for a serious movie, it will give you a very bad headache, as in the ten feet. If not, you still write and recommend the director and ask at night. However, if you're really the kind of person who's really a bad laugh, I advise you to check it out. You will not be disappointed.
