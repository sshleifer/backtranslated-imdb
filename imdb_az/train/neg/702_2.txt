Daphne Zuniga is the only light that lights up on the sleepless belt and the light is rapidly decreasing. If you do not have it, then there is another reason to watch it. Five college students signed a memorandum of understanding to prepare an old dormitory. Problems occur automatically when a strange homeless person requests, and the group is a few people. Then a killer remained empty. Honestly, I wanted to say that I would enjoy it at once. It had a fair structure, and perhaps it was just Daphne Zuniga. The film is very slow and almost silent as a library. The majority of players are on the average, and moments in the "sense of the point" are so old news. Famous composer Christopher Young dubbed "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" into a recurring replica line for a better television movie. Still, the movie looks better than it deserves. So, outside Young and Zuniga, he knocks the bottom of the barrel.
