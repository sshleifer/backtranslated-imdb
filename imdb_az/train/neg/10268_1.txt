Surely, this is one of the worst films I've ever won! Field, I apologized, I said I had a plot? The most terrible moment ... was, do not think! The best private effect hidden under the bed covers was ... or we can not think for it. You knew that the murderer was right from the start. There was nothing scary about the whole movie, when you saw two siblings, Misty, a shower, and you saw Nurse Toppan coming out, there were only two miraculous bits. This movie should be watched just to get an idea of ​​how to avoid just a scary movie!
