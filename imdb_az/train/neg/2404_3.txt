<br /> <br /> 1) Adam Arkin is better than "Friends" than Ross Geller. 2) A huge cast is wasted (Kenneth Mars, Alan Arkin, Ed McMahon, Pat Morita, Louis Nye) with this amateur post. <br /> <br /> 3) The film suffers from a terrible slide. <br /> 4) Story is not even logical. Why does he want to break soccer? What is foolish violin music? <br /> <br /> 5) Not even funny. "Look at me! I'm funny!" As a group of accountants trying to improve. <br /> <br /> I love Larry Cohen movies, but the guy here has failed. It is not possible to wait for a loan. Frustration.
