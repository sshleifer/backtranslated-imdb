As long as you try to kill yourself, this film should not be considered. In my opinion, this movie can really cause serious brain damage. The heroine of the hero, Kevin, Amy, his bratty, ungodly conservative lover, Kyle, a dork of a sex-loving red shorts on the phone, Daphne, a dumb girl who needs to be "cool", a sense of dress and her overseksed boyfriend Nick, something hire an army able to realize innuendo. No, I'm not a deviation, there's really a movie going on. The film itself is a sexually explicit campaign of the 1986 Gremlins, and you will not find Gizmo trail anywhere. No, it's started by Hobgoblins, Wimpy Man (sorry, Kevin), to realize someone's wildest desires and then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed - Finally, they came face to face with a little sweets club, where Amy's greatest desire came - he wants to be a stripper! Look, I watched this flick through the MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot, he gained a smile from this cinematic train and also bleeding from two eyes. Not really, but I wanted to. Now, I do not give you more plot, because it gives me a great desire to draw a kettle in my brain. Besides, there is a plot. We must put a General Alert for a surgeon in this movie.
