This movie was different, and I did not see the typical gay stereotypes I used to see. But this does not change the fact that a story line is missing. I'm convinced that black gay characters are rarely seen and they're just not happy when they're on their own, and there are just a few happy gay guys who are showing themselves on the screen. How hard it would be for a writer to write a story with a start, middle, and last. Or a story in the spotlight. Indeed, it does not appear to be a point in the film, and although this is a low budget movie, there is no excuse for the lack of story or plot.
