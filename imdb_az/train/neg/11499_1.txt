Gadar is really a mute movie because it's a fake story. This is very unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol film targeting Pakistan. The purpose of the film is to deceive the audience to think that Pakistan and its government are bad, trying to hide their defects, will not work. All the songs and music of the film are bad. Most likely, Sikhs will love the movie because of their mistakes. I think only Amisha Patel is good at the movie. I can give 10 to 10, but at least 1 hour. Get 3 hours of your life and watch this stupid drum film .Disaster.
