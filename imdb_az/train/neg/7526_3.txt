B film kung fu flicks high grade cheese cheese. Bruce played "wannabe" Lee Bruce Lee ... I think. Of course you can show Bruce's fast clips and show you the proximity of your eyes and look like Bruce, if you look right at the right time during the winter day. You are laughing at the fact that the movie is not very good, but some cold-drawn scenes that come into the Dragon are mixed up. According to the film, Bruce Lee was killed by a dart while hanging on a helicopter. Of course, Bruce Lee is thinking of apologizing for being Bruce Lee's brother, as he is supposed to be his brother. (Bruce's actions and combat style are still very bad, not mimes). Bruce, go with the cowardly lion. The custody department kept by Kay-Bee sees you. Bruce does not find anything wrong with knocking a handicapped person seriously. To the end, the director decided to "shoot a flashback" for a scene just 3 minutes ago! Only single-cell organisms with a discomfort need to think that this film is fully understood. <br /> <br />
