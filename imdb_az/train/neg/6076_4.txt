Robert De Niro plays Gil Gilard in the FAN. Or Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? With this sort of problem, De Niro has played a very similar character in TAXI DRIVER, COMEDY KING and CAPE FEAR, and unfortunately the characters have been well-developed and better scripts. It's a little tricky to believe that Renard will start as a reflexive obsessive sport fan for psychological realization and implementation. <br /> <br /> The character spring is not the only problem with this script - I was thinking of Bobby Rayburn as the key character in a characteristic focus (I should have been Niro's superior, but with a slightly untouched UNTOUCHABLES) and then the story went back to Renard. It frustrated many sports fans thinking that baseball should be a bit more concentrated. It was meant to appeal to baseball fans first, but I'm not sure who should pay attention to the story of the producers and what story should they pay? <Br /> I agree with the FAN (especially the Soundtrack), but this is a very flawed movie, and it should be remembered that until the mid 1990s, characters SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, UNLAWFUL ENTRY and so on. steam a long time ago
