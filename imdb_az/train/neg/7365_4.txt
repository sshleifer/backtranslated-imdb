Not a bad, but so great heist film. Kirk Douglas was released a while before a safe cracker in a prison where he decided to take the case after leaving Mob. Circus gymnast Giuliano accepts Gemma. Mayhem causes. Douglas and Gemma soon followed up with a really triangular triangle followed by Mafia goon Romano Puppo and Douglas's infinitely patient friend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo continues to progress rapidly, and at least one excellent and creative car that is associated with Puppo & Gemma is the sequel to follow. Although it is an Italian production, many of the shots seem to have been made in Germany. Douglas is good, not just sharpening in a Giallo quickie. Very striking Bolkan exhibits spectacular performance. Music Ennio Morricone and cinematography have been developed by Tonino Delli Colli, who has the ability to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
