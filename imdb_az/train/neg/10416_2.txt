Before watching this movie, I would say that Katie Bates loved everything. Now everything is minus one. James Woods is very strange ... his character is not a player. Some told him that he was "poor" and that he was not sinful with dirty, ignorant, or clich√©s. Ditto for the stereotyping of Randy Qaid. The only paid feature is Henry Thomas, a powerful enough actor to carry this simple blur. If you love the country, you will use the decor. <br /> <br /> I am a serious admirer of both the independent and the exciting films, but it is simply scary.
