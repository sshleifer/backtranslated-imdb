The first half was okay, but the last half was really disappointing. Manufacturers acknowledged that they did not even have a clue for some, and this actually showed. I'm really sorry to write a minimum of 10 lines to send this post. Since the show really was not worth the effort, I did not want to add spoilers to match my words.

They eventually had a little cleansed and actually had fair drama. But to become a cyclone god angel in black, he was the same as the balmy, and the six were quite dumb.
