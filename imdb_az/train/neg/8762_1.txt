A scientist (John Carradine - unfortunately, does the dead know how to revive). But they come back with marble faces. <br /> <br /> It is an extremely predictable 1940s. When I was a kid, it made me foolish, but now it is choking me. I had to fight to wake up! Except for one, the player is strange. Such shameless drill actors! They are desperate. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about this: Carradine, despite the script, really gives a very good performance. There are some creepy moments covering a ghost of the Great Dane, who walks through the walls. There is also one of the worst-looking knockouts in the film history. However, none of this is sufficient to sit there. Avoid it.
