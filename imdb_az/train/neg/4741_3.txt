Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior is a very good, powerful plot, but is ruined by the cheese details along the film. I'm a young boy and I did not like this movie. I thought the effects were awful, but it might seem fun for younger children. Matrix movements have been devastated, you know, it was completely fake. It was then Yen Lo, who had temporary casual people and had a bad spirit that Wendy was trying to earn. Wendy and his Buddhist cousin Cousin Shen end up as a good movie at the end of the Yen Lo (and eternal destruction) at the end of time. Wendy learns a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. Ready for the next DCOM.
