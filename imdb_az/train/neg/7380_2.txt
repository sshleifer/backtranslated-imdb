I think about Seagal's time to go quietly at night. <br /> <br /> What I've been watching over the past few years seems to be the same as in the early 1990s. <br /> <br /> The secret bio lab gives a new kind of medicine, the adrenaline system to the point where psychopathic kills or something are. What Seagal should stop infection or the end of the world ... or something. Seagal also went to strike squads, such as jellybeans, every time he was looking at the orders of a new person, despite the character development, he was able to prevent Steve's elderly man from shouting at the top of his lungs, but why? It is always dubbed by people who do not like it. The structure and sequence of movies, usually movies, can save the total time loss, but this is not too close. As I said, it was not a lot of blood and direct warfare, but a horror film that was stabbed. If the problem was not really terrible, and Seagal would have looked at the place because the infected people had to have the speed of light, yet the 40-year-old 280 lb Seagal killed them all directly? I think that the only point in the film is the first 20 minutes that new employers ask Seagal to come to the strip club. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 2
