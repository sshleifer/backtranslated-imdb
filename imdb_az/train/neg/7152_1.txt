Based on a novel by a girlfriend, F. Scott Fitzgerald, when the columnist Sheila Graham wrote this bare story. Gregory Peck is a shameless pretext as a strong drunk or cursed alcoholic; Thoroughly and softly speaking, contradicts real Scott Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald's Hollywood Writing Period, a large number of writers who care about the delay in their lives, actually struggled efficiently while living in a quiet life and at a time when AA was not well known. Fitzgerald was not proud to repeat his twilight stories to support his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (college). The Chevrolet driver, living in a small apartment and on the other hand, made his life as 180 degrees as shown in this film. <br /> <br /> The actual film, run by Henry King, every 20th-century Fox film during Daryll F. Zanuck's leadership, was a great job. Dear was a poor exception.
