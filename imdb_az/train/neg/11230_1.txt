In the sixth grade, each teacher would have a good idea of ​​making this film a curriculum for a whole semester. There was something in this class with this terrible show every class. We watched this in English and wrote in magazines as one of the symbols. In math, we talked about diagrams and other maritime boards. We talked about whales about science (which was really interesting, so it does not cost 100%). Every day was tortured everyday. Not only that, but we are twice afraid of it every day, so we are watching in the hall. I realized that this was a new series or something, but it was like '93. Still, I'm trying to prevent it.
