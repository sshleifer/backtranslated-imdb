This is the worst movie I've ever seen on Starz on Demand. <br /> <br /> Why? Who knows! As you can see, anyone with digital cameras and anyone with any budget can broadcast television with a horror movie. To be honest, it looked horrible since I looked at the trailer - but I gave it a real chance. <br /> <br /> I'm always trying to give a clear idea of ​​low-budget films. <br /> <br /> If you know this field now, I'm sure, you read it Either you've heard this from Starz Request or have enjoyed this page for any reason. This incredibly bad "heavy metal" music video about a pathetic and brilliant girl who will get to know all about 3 minutes. I'd think it would look really interesting if it came together, but it really is not. In any case, he kills himself. Then he owns one. Then some killing begins. It is really unmemorable and as average and dull as possible. When you go out of the apartment with the first gun, it sounds like a very serious popcorn. Can you have the best sound effect? I found a better sound effect for free on the internet (non-copyrighted) ... right. Now. <br /> <br /> Other reviews do not deceive you by the 10 star movie it claims to be. Of course, film distributors or perhaps even the director tried to encourage them to think about bringing together this piece. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous.
