My husband and I are the parents of an autistic little boy living in the same city as the screenwriter of this movie. We were very sad that the KCC brought this movie to the Jewish Film Festival, as the person with mental disabilities was described as Frankie. After filming, we went to see the local theater. We demanded the money back. <br /> <br /> We will encourage a part of the screenwriter to apologize for the Open Media Program. <br /> <br /> We did not like to see Frankie - mentally and possibly autistic young man. <br /> <br /> Women in the Caucasus, such as Frankie, are a serious issue. <br /> <br /> The screenwriter must explain himself. Is he aware of families with disabled children? After weeks in the CCC pool, see children with disabilities?
