It's just the worst movie I've ever seen. It changes as 2+ hours and the box art is completely misleading. I hired him with my friends because we thought his poor man would be 300. You know, laugh and have fun. No. There is only one pain on this film. Then the movie starts and they speak a number of different languages. We think, 'Oh, it's just the beginning.' But no movie is released, and there is more of a book that you read in the broom book, and there are no hours here and the battlefields competing with two children in the playing field are competing. Take cinematography and this movie belongs to the trash compartment. Such films will lead to the world we see in Wall-E, which is a good movie.
