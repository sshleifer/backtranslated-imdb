Daniel Auteuil was 'better than Queen Margot'. Nastassja Kinski was better than "Paris, Texas". The biggest disappointment is that Chris Menges ("CrissCross" and "One World") and Goran Bregovic refer to the use of the same film "Queen Margot" for this movie (end of the film). If this were an American pop movie, I was not surprised; but for a European film with more independent actors and directors, a common approach that does not have any original ideas about child abuse is a very simple mindset and hopeless. There are bad guys who kidnap juveniles and sell them. There are poor children who hate people who sell them and wait for someone to get rid of them. Finally, there is a great hero who killed all the bad guys and rescued the poor children from bad guys. Each character is displayed in simple black and white expressions: good against bad. Moreover, from the very beginning I realized how the story would end. Is this the end of sexual exploitation? I believe that the problem of harassment and pedophilia is much more complicated than that described in this very original film. I think this movie is not bothering, but very disappointing.
