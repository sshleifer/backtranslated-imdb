*** Can contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you live in TOKYO TIME, strong prescription anxiety anti-depression and anti-psychotic drugs (this is a classic psychological group that kills all patients while filming movies), and then this film will be of greater interest. If the filming is another movie that has been dropped before and when all actors are dropped, then TOKYO TIME can easily be explained. <br /> <br /> This film is a lifeless, energetic actor. The new husband found out that he had difficulty opening his eyes at the scene where he had been talking with his sister. She speaks on almost every stage of her body, sitting on strangers with every part of her body. From the beginning to the end, his face is described as the best "nearest dream". <br /> <br /> Do not think about actors talking about each other's lines because these actors could not complicate any of the lines of dialogue. Everyone speaks with a smashing, loud voice. No laughs. Do not lie to me. No force. Nobody has enough energy to deliver a smile. <br /> <br /> There are also friends and relatives. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> It's best to watch the GREENCARD movie that has a similar plan and has a charm and energy. Or, for a non-traditional Japanese romantic story, check out the Long VACATION, which has a large amount of everything living in TOKYO TIME.
