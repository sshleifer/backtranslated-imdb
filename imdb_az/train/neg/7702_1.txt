I'm a black man, mostly in Black City. Of course, I have some very important mistakes about Tyler Perry's case. I know there are some people who feel proud of him because he tries to describe the positive image of Black and culture. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Repeatedly many times every time and again, my source is a source of blood. These characters are badly written and actionable. These jokes are so bad that really should be something funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Ancient sayings> Some of the character's references could have been, but it did not happen anymore. As long as there is nothing to do, children travel around and threaten with violence, and it is useless. <br /> <br /> If a woman is afraid of her husband's death, why does she try to escape while lying in bed? It was more important to leave her when she was. <br /> <br /> In any case, the characters in this area were very boring and over-bursting, and I was hoping to throw her out of the balcony, and then there was no. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> Then there are two lovebirds. A bus driver asks a woman to harass while doing her turn. I did not believe that. When I agreed to get more out of him, I really could not believe it. However, a cake-grower was forced to dump garbage in a window and make notes with a butterfly mega table from the age of ten. I do not use this term lightly, but this woman had only two modes. Moroz sacrifice and psycho annma. But he showed that it was a constant, regardless of the two faces. The bus driver did not want to buy anything. WTF - Getting married without the example of the goods! <br /> <br /> Then there is a family reunion scene. Here is the main load of flood, shirtless, extreme musclebound, b-ball, plus the subtle incestual tabuos for the great pleasure of Maya Angelu. When these fathers drag out their edges and call for a meeting, I do not want their elderly people to have a heart attack. All of these are merging, going rarely to groups, and then making a call. When they do, everybody leaves their job and is heading over to speak a lot - as a group of Pavlov's accusations - WTF! <br /> <br /> Then the film has the last five minutes. Because of this, we have seen a barrier to all kinds of abusive fianc√©s around the long-term victim and bad actress. Black men have a native wedding dressed as an angel and hanging from the ceiling - WTF! The sole reason for watching so much is not only the trials of pain but also the second betrayal of this story. You know what happens. Instead, Perry makes a testicularly unsuccessful way out and plays a safe, a ton of movie donations - WTF! <br /> <br /> If one day is given, I can write a doctoral dissertation about the performance of this film in any way. Even though I did not start with the rest of my films, Tyler Perry. I'll just say that. In my opinion, black boy D.W. Griffith's legacy lives. This mockery is done by a black man who will be praised for carrying out what Nezis is born and sells us to the river. I just want to dudes Perry's movies so I throw them in the nuts. Thank you so much, dude! Why do you continue with this comedy on Colonial America's 2009 rape and assassination of slavery?
