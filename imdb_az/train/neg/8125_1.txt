"The Bat People" is a really bad movie that is worth the treatment of MST3K, as well as the movie "The Terror Clown". <br /> <br /> We live in a mountainous terrain where there is a bare land. . Many things happen, flying, flying and attacking things, station wagons, mishaps in the ambulance room, and more! All this, plus the joyful mediocrity of the 1970's (hey, think of Mitchell here!), Has actually become one of the best in the "The Mystery Science Theater 3000" episode in The Bat People! Moviewise, it's horrible. "The Bat People" - more "The Bad People !!!!!" If you look like LOL, of course 1/10 !!!!!
