About a journalist who took refuge in a man to write about a new technique that Dr. Tarr had used with Torture Dungeon patients. At the same time, journalist is often referred to as asylum-seekers, and doctors are in the cage, not as often as they are. First of all, some parts of the movie are simply boring and just want to fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all wrong reasons (eg a man who thinks he's a chicken). I must admit that the story is really good, but the film itself is a bomb. The music of the movie is really strange, and it's like something you hear in some crazy comedy, and yes, there's a scene surrounding chicken men who dance, which meant that I wanted to close the screen. Follow this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Competitor: R. for violence and nudity.
