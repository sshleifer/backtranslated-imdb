The real star of this ridiculous story is a glorious technique. A visual cure for the eye, the film does not stimulate the mind and the heart. At first, I was interested in the idea that Dietrich and Boyer had left religion for "finding" their love-related skills. The following is a big disappointment. Boyer is the only actress in production and his suffering. Dietrich's beautiful wardrobe shatter its performance - sometimes the fear of looking at her - a sensitive mask. As a priest, Boyer maintains the form of the monastery's liking (reminiscent of Chartreuse's true story) - it keeps shocking and shocking the reaction of other monks to the organized religion. The viewer thinks that Boyer is better than the past. However, the following trips are very much anticipated.
