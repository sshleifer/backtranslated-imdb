This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson does not just have any action skills, but the script is incredibly slippery and naked. In fact, you have a serious dialogue, "I love you more". "No, I love it more." After half an hour, I started watching the movie online and could not get it anymore. His "southern girl charm" does not just work and is really boring; <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Read the scenario before accepting to do so Or was it a big gain for Pope Joe (Jessica's father and producer of the film)? Hopefully now she knows better than signing a movie like this. <br /> <br /> And I, the previous commentator who gave 10 to 8 of this film, probably suffers from a very unpleasant dialogue for me. with the film, or by Pope Joe to get the film a better degree. <br /> <br /> Yessica has plenty of money, right? Maybe you can get some actor lessons?
