My comment has nothing to do with the political feelings in the movie. In fact, they are quite compatible with mine. It's stupid and stupid to see me in terms of a movie, story, motto, or any kind of dialogue. Perhaps it is not the same as creating a motivating character to speak to a person who has changed the location of songs that should be told to Neal, the writer or the director. Despite the inheritance of Neal Young's symbol, a ridiculous story remains. The scene of the most childhood is where the devil dance in a bar, slips a tonic for a hero, then dance into the floor of the floor, the words transferred to the hero to the Young song. In some cases, are these two sleeps up to a scheme to go to the West Coast? Sorry Sorry, stay tuned and leave Steven Stills making the movie.
