The man reads this script and looks strange as he thinks: "It's funny, so it's not so funny that it should be done alone!" Who was this person? Is it really responsible for this person? <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be the best in every possible way possible. No one creates good dialogue and is not a favorite character. And the story ... <br /> <br /> I prefer Hulk Hogan's 2nd worst movie "No one has forbidden the capture". <br /> <br /> The latter is packed with a few minutes outtakes and still lasts 80 minutes. Speeches cast members' 'unpleasant' mistakes and laugh at things that are wrong with this "comedy" set. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie is funny. There is nothing. It's just going on. This is really naked. I love movies that are good. <br /> <br /> Amanda Peet is not released and is actually only half good thing, but this is about the wannabe movie. But this does not mean very little. <br /> <br /> Avoid any costs.
