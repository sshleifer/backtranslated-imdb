"Whipped" is one of the most horrific films of all time. It's part of a garbage dump, probably called "The Grinch," which forced me to stay in the theater more than any movie in 2000. People are a deep portrait of contemporary relationships, as they call it. This will be a movie titled "High Fidelity". Despite the fact that the film is honest and sincere, the "whipped" enemy is kinematic, misanthropic kinematic poison. Avoid as many scars as you can to see how far too bad a "comedy" can get.
