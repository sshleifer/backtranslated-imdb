I do not believe that I was watching more of these expectations. OK starts. This movie keeps track of the realities of the road! At least the first was somewhat realistic. It goes away from the first movie and even reminiscent of the Joshua Project. Anyone who knows something about computers will hate this movie. However, there is a good message, FOR ALL FRIENDS! The film makes it look like a bigger way than the older brother really is. It was very heavy. Even makeup on actors was absolutely bad. Some of the players are pretty good. Some of the players are really bad. The scenario was ok at several points and completely involved in other parts. This movie is easy to play every 5 minutes. As I said, I do not believe that I was expecting more. I think I'll pop in the original to return to earth ... Q
