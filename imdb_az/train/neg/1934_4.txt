After the withdrawal of President Truman's Armed Forces, this time the first African-American (Cuban Gooding) - this time racist philosopher (Robert DeNiro) through the deep-seas diving training program of the US Navy. If the program was not bad enough, we should live in New Jersey, Bayonne. <br /> <br /> The audience has nothing wrong with it. Robert De Niro activates and emphasizes Southern accent. Cuba Gooding, raised by a sad father, as a poor black farmer in the South, is the expected line of truth. Girls - one can hardly tell them women - Charlez Theron and Lonette McKee. They have small roles and mostly claim that men should behave in a healthy manner. <br /> <br /> Other good performers, Powers Boothe and Hal Holbrook, have more role-playing roles. <br /> <br /> In this regard. Almost everything could have been accumulated by a computer. The boat is called a ship. Robert De Niro releases outdoors. After a disastrous attack on the hospital staff, she was moved to the bust instead of her outfit. In the early 1950's, someone said, "I'm here." (Perhaps this was a general expression at that time, if so, "I am bad.") People are referring to each other in order - "Lieutenant", "Boatswain's Mate", "Commander" Navy are simple as "Mister" officer) or their surname. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding has a difficult set for hoe. Anyone in the sea seems to hate the outsiders, except for a boy from the Romans. He is respected by stutters and others in the class. <br /> <br /> Like the Animal House, the applicant's tony brotherhood resembles a scene where he wants to sit in a room with a Sikh, a black man, and a blind son. second class minor officer. She is trying to marry a beautiful woman who graduated from medical school. He agrees with one of their arguments. He wants only to be a doctor and must join him, leave the sea and live quietly. "And just let you go to life," he retorts. Yes. Yes, let alone become a wife of a physician and let life pass on you. <br /> <br /> <strong> Boka Raton, you can wave the golf course. <br /> <br /> Secondly, such actions were quite common in the Second World War. "Bombardier", "Airial Gunner," something like that. They were inexpensive as there were often some educational features. You've learned something about being a bomber or a gunner. <br /> <br /> In some cases, the technical details are thrown out because the writer does not know anything about them (except for the Boyle law we have learned in high school chemistry). <br /> <br /> In some cases, there are no extraordinary events in which there is no such film. If I accept mechanical problems correctly, I have considered it right. There is no help in this direction. The film is very close, many lose the dramatic effects they may have. <br /> <br /> Please note that emergency situations are incorrect. <br /> <br /> Why do you continue? Want to see a better example of this kind of movie? Almost anything will be done - perhaps heroine hero, except for "GI Jane". Test the scenes of training camps at "Young Lions". There is a Jewish victim. Or you can try the "Eternity from here" easily, who does not easily push the keys to sympathy and is a mature man who is actively involved in the conflict of the victim, which is a refusal of the victim and the "Cool Hand Luke". No easy excuses are offered, because easy excuses are very easy. <br /> <br /> Comprehensive and good work is not done.
