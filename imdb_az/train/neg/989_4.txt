Okay, I've learned about this movie and looked at the preview, it was a difficult day to read almost all the reviews and discuss whether I should watch it. Even before watching the movie, I was strangely emotionally affected. I was very confident if I was going to watch it and be worried for a long time. So I have to risk it, and watch it and watch what I'm thinking: it's just starting to work fine for me. Unfortunately, this was to move in the right direction. I had a history of aggression and I could not say why the people of the film were worried or bored. The scene of aggression was sad and intimidating, but did not really bother me with a dramatic scene. Then, as I came to the middle, I understood the drilling materials that happened. There was nothing to do for 5 minutes, but people walk without telling or speaking! Something is that a man has a hit of emotion, but this has not happened in this movie. There were about 3 pieces in this incredible look, where I see the main character of the Mayan species coming out of control, but I want to move forward forward. Then he engaged in hardcore partying, it was not so boring, yet a bit boring. Oh and, as mentioned, Rosario Dawson has done a great job. Take action until the middle of an hour's rush, so revenge comes to Maya's attention. Where the content is corrupted. I did not feel bad or did what he deserved, but the whole scene was really uneasy and I felt all the feelings after that. I really can not say whether or not to watch this movie because I do not know if I can find it. But if you choose to watch it, do not show arrogance.
