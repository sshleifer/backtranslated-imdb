This video was pretty cheap because the cover looked very nice. And it was nice, but the movie was trash. I can handle B-grade, sometimes using a good B (I'm a classic example of how fun the genre is in "Morning Nazi Killers"), but it was only mildly moderate. Incredibly boring scenes have shrunk very little by the sequence of good-cost cheap porn and entertaining sleep distress. This movie is very small.
