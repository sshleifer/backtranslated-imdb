This show is a perfect example of how CBC is involved in news, sports, or satirical comedy. Developing a comedy comedy, CBC has shown that the penguin of the Kensington King can combine "The Beachcombers" with the abdomen. <br /> <br /> Children are ashamed of major demonstrations such as "Children in the Saloon" and "Second City". <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I have not admitted to giving more chance than I've heard of this concert's first concept. Half of the concept is a direct attempt to break one of the many sitcom successes of Corner Gas in the English-Canadian history. The rest of the concept - cultural confrontation - is not genuine and is often used to record laziness. The choice of the Muslim religion as the basis of the "water beyond" symbol is a hopeless attempt to be "edgy" and "topical", but it is forced. <br /> <br /> Some jokes based on local reactions are insulting and insulting anyone else, especially those who are inconsistent with the audience. <br /> <br /> This show is "getting it" when creating a Canadian content, especially as Canada is a multicultural environment. Cultural diversity in Canada should not be presented in such a severe and compulsory manner. The CBC will be subject to change to offer a diversity of television shows. I do not doubt that CBC has enough sitcom talent to produce such a subtle thing. Corner Gas can be compared to the description of the diversity - that is. Aboriginal characters are not identified by their ethnicity and are not used to create their heritage lines. <br /> <br /> Therefore, their life and other characters have lived in a way that is more important than their own ethnic identity. <br /> <br /> Even the waterfall is unsuccessful. The player is weak, the comic pacing on the entire map and the places where I saw that for a comedy, even the suspension of confidence was far beyond. Derek McGrath, a talented gentleman who just stunned here. I doubt that the guest stars will be added (Colin Mochrie, for example, Anglican Archbishop) can save this dog. After declining CBC's "dreams", I decided to give the show a chance; but it was possible to stand in two episodes - my braincells can almost feel like shutting themselves down with each unsuccessful punchline. The time sequence is much more Coronation Street, Air Farce re-runs or Dr. Who There will even be an infomercial development.
