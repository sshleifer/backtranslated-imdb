Is this movie a joke? Comedy? Of course, this is not a serious tension? There is no idea that there is no humor, but there are no suggestions, but several times in a poor, weak, and terrifying script, the audience sounds loudly in the cinema. Assassination is acceptable - a promising young artist who just reached the peak of the murdered by an assassin attempted assassination. The murderer sees the work portfolio of young artists and decides to join the exhibition of his works. At the fair, the assassins meet with the dead artists and they fall in love. All are very predictable and the latter are so weak that no one will guess. The film is happening around and around Vienna, particularly in Austria, and shows what a beautiful city. Do not waste your time, film, direct, or even write a script!
