Of course, Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to anyone, even though my favorite, especially Knappertsbusch, 1951. The whole approach of Syberberg is very static. When the music suddenly begins to swell ... Sibberberg shows that it is moving simultaneously. Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. What happened to the film's correction? The result is tedious to watch physically. A follower can never be a spiritual one. Sibberberg has made a mistake to get back to the house and confirm that Wagner has gone straight. This decoration decorated with Wakner's "clever" reminders of antisemitism - will this movie be the watcher of a film that Wagner did not know in advance?
