This movie is simply horrible! It's slow to operate slowly, just to the point where you are not going to go and to the wooden characters. The best part is that Iron Maiden reads in some shows and shows it in a theater. it was worth the wait and wait, but that was it! The characters of this film put me on the bed. Avoid!
