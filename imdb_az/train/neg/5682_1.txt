This movie is incredibly ridiculous. I love horror movies, but this is the worst thing I've ever seen. I'm a big fan, but most of the deaths are not shown in this movie. It only shows us dead bodies and only fights death scenes that we see in this film. Graphs seem to be so obviously fake. The actors are terrific. None of them has any real emotion. Not only did I spend my time watching sh * t, but at the beginning I did not associate the actual beats with beaten animals. If I could rate it for 10, I would like it. F * ck this movie. This is a crap. <br /> Do not track it.
