As you can see, when you offer enough money to an actor, we will do everything. I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves earns, but most of the money should go into the face of his fans because he's involved with a ROTTEN movie. Special effects have worsened even worse than the B films of the 1950s and the impact of other players. The worst is the player's child, and in my opinion the second best performance. The English people are very emphatic and I think that nobody can even speak English, but instead of remembering the script, they remember words and try to make their characters "real" as well as real.
