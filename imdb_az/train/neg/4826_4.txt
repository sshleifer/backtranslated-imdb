I see what the principal is trying to do, but he misses the brand. The main actor was really good, but the adjustments around her mom will take you. The camera work, that is, lighting and exposure is an amateur type, which I can give, even though the direction is more freely available. There was a bit of a voice, and that's what you get from the movie. I see that this director will not do a good job in the future, as it is not quite right, but after 28 days or nothing, does not expect a good DVD movie, keep your expectations down and more. It was at least an hour and a half. Yes, if you ask me, the only one and the other player was pretty bad. But I'm a movie snob, so value it.
