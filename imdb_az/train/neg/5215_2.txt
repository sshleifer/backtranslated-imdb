The same old, "If you can not get funding for my project, I'll set myself up" monster movie. There is nothing new here. Jeff Goldblum is like "Fly". It keeps some look of human foolishness, but ultimately opposes the effects of his experiences. The player is pretty bad. There are people who are stupid on the road when threatening their lives without any reason. The boy goes back to the forbidden lab. Then he has a relationship with a young woman and her son. Undoubtedly, he looks good, but looks like many difficulties. It just takes a lot of time. Even his tyrannosaurus costume appears to be out of the rack in a Star Trek convention.
