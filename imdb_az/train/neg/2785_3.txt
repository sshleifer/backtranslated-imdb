I know that some films (which means that European films) are very bad films, because they are non-American and are considered as a great movie by some "critics". I saw the 8.1 IMDB account for this movie, and realized that it was selected in some major festivals. Do not cheat this! Skip it if you are not one of those who love such foolish movies and then say great art! The film contains a funny scene followed by each other (a similar Italian, a film that I think, terribly FIBERICO IL RUMORE DEL MARE (I love the sound of the sea). The problems with these films, like other bizarre films, are not just boring, but as a camp. I would like to say that when we move, it is terrible (I want to say that the soap opera level), the story is not a surprise (this is a combination of several stories, endlessly: SHORT CUTS, MAGNOLIA is not a realistic character, but rather a realistic character (some really strange - sees the girl as a hilarious zombie, etc.) for a long time, and at the end the director opens her emotions. At the premiere glance, the public was laughing very loudly that this cunning bad dialogue and scenes were good after a movie ... It is an insult to the cinema and it only raises the high ratings because it's in a "other" language, in which case Spanish is a strange world ... 3 / 10
