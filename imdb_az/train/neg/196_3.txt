This movie is wrong on many fronts. As in the past, Alamo's mythology has been described much more than history. Generally, many poor actors who are forced to work in the Hollywood squares are poor in production, giving the impression of a civilian project. It was the biggest flaw for me - I know that the real Alamo heroes' age and common personalities and the backbone ensemble of television actors chosen to describe them will never be able to avoid convincing misgivings. <br /> <br /> Texan, I grew up with mythology. Then I got more information about the history. I can take a decent product from the perspective (though I prefer more historical accuracy), but it never gave me the opportunity to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> <strong> The versions of John Wayne or Fess Parker are a little less true.
