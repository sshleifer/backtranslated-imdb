Spoiler. <br /> <br /> Firstly, nothing happened in this movie. Secondly, it is not scary. Third, there was no movie in the worst movie. Let me see in detail. Is the sound built by Beavis or Butthead? I'm sure I'll go with Beavis. The movie slowly calms down and you've been forced to make enthusiastically (I've watched it at home). Then, Beavis, apparently, is exposed to some really loud sounds with terrifying and shocking images, and the volume is forced to re-size it. It happens many times until the end of the movie. Beavis laughs vulgarly behind the two-sided mirror while watching the test band every time they reach the barefoot. If you have kids and watch the scary movies after falling asleep, this is a big mistake. But this is a big mistake. Have a Think? I'm going to shoot a horror film, a 19-year-old girl who screamed at her lungs before throwing at least one suit in the shadow of a wall, a cat thrown into the camera to scare the audience, a scene with a strange or strange ornamental foil with a manicured laugh Like a monster (Lost in A la TV's Space). These people did not try to frighten me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
