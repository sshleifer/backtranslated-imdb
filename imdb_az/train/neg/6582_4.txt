Geez is another lifetime film, but not one of the worst films in the world at all, is far from the best. In my view, the main problem is that it is clear who is responsible and that it is generally predictable. Even worse, some flashbacks ended up confusing and wondering the viewer "left, how much should I care?" Something I love is going to show that they are not as simple as "good guys are good and evil guys are bad" and sometimes bad and bad than good and bad. Hadley did not do what she felt was just because he thought he was the right to be his family and eliminated the competition. As for Alicia, it just proves that a victim is not always a good person. Someone really says "it's coming," even "it's a painful, terrible death." "Burning Bed" is a great example of this, but unlike the "Burning Bed" terrific man possesses what he deserves. But Alicia "came"? <br /> <br /> Some say that she did not agree with others and is not in the law at all. <br /> <br /> As for the action, it's a mixed bag. Some people do well as Mia, but others are indifferent to their role. They were basically wooden or simply not convincing. Music was pretty cool though, and some scenes are beautiful and vapors, especially girls / girls. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> will happen. But I would not be surprised when it comes to the end. If they say Alicia, they say that people say that I think, I think, "YAY! I woke up from the coma!" Hadley was responsible! and we want the accusations to be reduced! "Hadley will never be in jail as long as no offense actually occurs. <br /> <br /> Well, at least once in a while worth checking out!
