The word "True" in this movie was my ringtone call. A title card has been called more often when it calls the American Civil War a "war between states." <br /> <br /> How confident is this movie? <br /> <br /> Jesse James - the thief, slavery and murderer - is described as a quiet, subtle pair of boys. There is no mention of less slavery than the documented truth that Jesse James and his brother Frankin are actively fighting to maintain their slavery before the war, and poorly-worn mother of Jesse James. According to this film, all the Civil War soldiers were really struggling to decide if Missouri was the northern state or the southern province ... it is ALL. (Missuri: This is a candy mint! Breathless mint!) Black people are not completely out of this movie, except for the wishes of a pair of beggars, one of them is a "HELPFUL PROTECTOR" sign, instead of a very handful of manuscript. (Some of the 19th-century newspapers are wrong with 20th-century fonts). <br /> <br /> This movie has a strange flashback structure. There are some impressive stunt slides (and some nice work done by loud horses) and an excellent fit. I drew a dialogue line: "Some of these guys will never eat beans." The film corrects a few facts: Agnes Moorehead Pinkerton agents (here called 'Remington') hides their right arm after Jesse's mother, where Jesse James's real-life mom has suffered an injury that requires amputation from her lower arm. When some mistakes were pardoned: In the missing days, the real Jesse James accidentally hit a portion of the left finger, but Robert Wagner (where he played a major role) did not have a stumpfinger. I saw a picture of Jesse James's true spouse; <br /> <br /> If Hope Lange appears to be seen in this movie, Jesse James could have been more in the house. <br /> <br /> There is so much revisionism here, and most male actors wear the 1950s hairstyles. But many of the errors in this movie have been blocked. Jesse James's teacher, William Quantrill, is often remembered, but all actors make a mistake. After seeing Jesse and his wife pay $ 18 for a rental, we see a two-story home (soon to die). In fact, Jesse James was a simple one-storey cottage for $ 14 a dollar (1318 Lafayette Street, St Joseph, Missouri). There is no upper floor ... When Jesse James was killed, his wife, Umid Lange could not escape from the top as he was here. (She was really in the kitchen). <br /> <br /> A sustainability error: Robert Wagner (a pair of doubles) affects the falling work when binding a bone in his jaw locking behind his hands. <br /> <br /> Scenarios have some strange and unnecessary palm boots. After Northfield's robbery attempt, Jesse said she was expecting to go home with her birthday. James Gang (September 7, 1876) has two days since the birth of Jesse Jamesin, the actual Northfield bank raid. (Maybe next year's birthday.) Later, when Jesse and his wife look at St Joseph's house on a good summer day, when Jesse says he is planning to do what's happening on Christmas Eve ... but in real life, Mr. and Mrs. Jesse James 1881 On December 18, he moved to that house ... this event must be Christmas Eve *! These mistakes were completely inevitable. <br /> <br /> Some fantastic characters here are not logical. According to this film, the Northfield bank raid was failing because one (so-called) figure was missing to cut telegraph wires. <br /> <br /> If this really happened, it would have prevented James Chiang's escape ... but the robber, who was unsuccessful for other reasons, would not have hurt himself. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Hunter (Frank James), Moorehead, Alan Hale Jnr (like Cole Younger) and the role-playing actress Marian Seldes is a rare screen. I've been disappointed by the actor Robert Wagner who is usually playing a low role. In other places, Wagner has shown an impressive set of characters, convincingly describing heroes, immorality, and ethically uncertain characters. Here, Jesse can not decide whether James is described as good or bad ... so it is not uncomfortable. John Carradine phones are briefly played by Jesse and his wife as a so-called fighter advocate. In fact, Jesse James was baptized in his childhood by a clergyman, a Methodist minister ... but perhaps this is a topping-up of the second baptism. <br /> <br /> Jesse James had no Robin Hood. (Robin Hood was also Robin Hood, but that's another story.) Jesse James has never had a paperless example that he never shared with his family. After some handling, he had even broken the wound with the rest of his band. In this film, Jesse promised to keep away the paths of robbery forever. In fact, at night before his death, Jesse James and Ford's brothers stole horses that Jesse plans to use with the Platte City bank robbery the next day. In preparation for most of her robbery, Jesse James hacked horses from local farmers ... the same erroneous folk (in her mistaken legends) was probably the beneficiaries of her magnitude. <br /> <br /> I was sad at a scene here on Jesse James's brown, and he denied that he was pleased with an oily paint that tastes good. <br /> <br /> 'True (not too much!) Jesse Story James deliberately accuses the murderer of a theft, and at the same time makes injustice on the Civil War. A good fit for a very stunning stunt job and a few nice players, I'll rate this legendary error movie from 10 to 2 points.
