For the first part of several seasons, I thought the Apprentice was a very interesting and interesting show. The merger between Real TV and a 16-week job interview was innovative, and show producers succeeded in maintaining the show and "not there." <br /> <br /> The new season is nothing more than 6. in comparison with a great joke and has nothing to do with it - in general. In the previous seasons, they paid more attention to business-related tasks. Now, it's important to note that racers are expected to do everything to keep them on the show (lying, trash, backstabbing, etc.). It may be fun to watch the room, but there is a low point of entertainment - Sometimes you are surprised to see a repeat of an old Jerry Springer episode. The show shows the most earnings and most of them are a showcase for companies that are naturally neutral to pay NBC for promotion. About half of the half of the contestants living in tents in season 6 are what? It's nothing but foolish and has nothing to do with real life. <br /> <br /> This season, I have no respect for any of the contestants, and all of them seem to me as righteous. There was at least some honesty among competitors in the previous season, and now competitors seem to be killing their mother. Although Donald Trump's massive egoug is bigger and bigger for each passing season and seems to be honest, I can not see anyone wanting to work for a healthy mind. <br /> <br /> R.P. Apprentices. According to him, please, NBC, take advantage of air show as soon as possible. Just watching is very embarrassing. The apprentice was once a big television show, but now it's a great joke.
