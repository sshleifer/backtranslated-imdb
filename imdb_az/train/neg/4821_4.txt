Idea movie (based on a story based on a story about a group of scientists from the Canadian desert to try and find Bigfoot). (Catch one and then a tracking device). A bunch of wandering around the many scientific mumbo jumbo wilderness is really a mixed-up movie. There are some attempts to create tensions and fears, but there is nothing else to be seen except for some beautiful views of the wild people to be perfectly honest. This exploit film is a perfect definition, it promises you a lot, looks at Bigfoot, but in fact it gives little. Recommended only for insomniacs
