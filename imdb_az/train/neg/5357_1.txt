I do not know what to start. This film shows that this cheap Saturday morning used to be back in the 80's as it was one of its children in the 80's. Sort by Captain Power or Power Rangers. <br /> <br /> It is a spouse that is packed with bad digital impressions and is really "secret agencies" and slysers who call it cheerless. It's a terrible direction, and now it's too little. <br /> <br /> In some movies, one of the most funny scenes starts early. an explosive device in a car. For some reasons, even though the device is explicitly stated as "remote exploded", bad guys decide to drive themselves to motorcyclopedias. This chase continues. Always ridiculously and totally meaningless bike stunts with bad guys. Standing on a motorcycle, wheels, and so on. At one point there is an accident, and one of the assailants is dropped out of the bike, but we see that they are thrown into the car by bicycle (clear cgi), but the horse disappears. Then, after a few seconds, the horseman and the bicycle return ... apparently without getting injured. At this point, despite the fact that an explosive device inside the car, the attackers decide to hit the agent during the past driving, and then blow up the car. Which was clearly seen with cgi. Voting sound? <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> ">"> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; <br /> <br /> Why Savini and Todd will never know this movie, only I can do what they say - for someone who has a blessing or blackmail for somebody ... probably the last one.
