I'll tell you what's going on, and some of the money people would do well to destroy one of the best shows on TV. Is there really a need for a large screen? Did you ask the fans? With the actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears and Kiefer Southerland re-creating the "Rocky Horror Picture Show," all the fans were interested in how they would feel, produced all the music and drama. Did you want them? This movie does not have the same originality. Sometimes the original was sometimes dark, but Bo and Luke were always beautiful, they had difficulty because they were always in trouble, and their main purpose was to help the people passing through the city. They did not see the original show in any way unless it had any significance for the people who filmed it. My big question will break them next?
