PROM NIGHT (2008) Nelson McCormick starring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis. Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) witnessed the death of the whole family, in the hands of a slightly troubled teacher (Jonathan Schaech). Now, he is preparing a great deal with his heartfelt annoying friends. Once they start killing each other because the killer escapes from the prison and nobody is worried about not informing Donna because it's important for her balloon to be cut off. <br /> <br /> Parties: There are some good laughs because of horrific dialogue and dumb behavior. <br /> <br /> For example: <br /> <br /> Everyone does not want to tell Donna that she has escaped from prison with something strange (not so great). Their reason is that they do not want to embarrass her in front of all her friends. LOL <br /> Thoughts: Let me begin by saying that I'm a great slasher fan. Usually I can enjoy the bad ones. I even love some PG-13 horror films. Tourist TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was rated PG for the first time. I'm also enjoying POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). <br /> <br /> There is nothing in the film that PG-13's precious film does not enjoy. <br /> <br /> First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I love slasher films that do not even have the story. They can at least be entertaining. This is about a teacher who is in love with his student, and he kills the whole family. A few years later, he tried to help him destroy his own offspring and kill all his friends ...? Then there were subplots who doubt that I was thinking about everyone. Claire (Jessica Stroup) is struggling with her lover, she has cramps, and I can not care less. This should be a lifetime property, not a PROM NIGHT reconstruction. <br /> And then ... a slasher movie with these terrible death scenes. I'm not even scary, some of my favorite ladies (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, original PROM NIGHT) are not that cowardly, but still effective offenses. There are half of the characters in the same room where a woman is stabbed several times with a knife wound and screams at the pain of a bad actor. I'm sure that 10-year-old girls were afraid, but not me. <br /> <br /> I also hated characters. Donna's non-realist sensual lover Bobby (Scott Porter) had never met a sensitive comrade in my life, unless he was a gay man. Then Donna's annoying friends are Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis) and Chris Chris (Brianne Davis). DEATH If you think the characters in PROOF are disturbing, try watching this movie. And gave me flashbacks for Usher performance that started with Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and DJ (Jay Phillips) THAT ALL THAT. <br /> <br /> All return to the predictable area, there is a terrible soundtrack and great disrespect to the original materials, and a stinker.
