This is a complete rehab of the next movie. It's a totally senseless movie. Basically, he took each sailor of the first film and, at that time, edited it in Omen IV, except for the IV female Dajjal. Even the first one ends in the same way! Music is very busy and interrupted, and it's highly anticipated because it's pretty much a copy of Oman. It was not a terrible movie, it was not afraid, there were worse films than it was, and it did not come to a complete end. Since 2006 Omen is worse than remake, it is even more meaningless, and that's why. Someone found a weapon on your head, and if you chose to watch it later or the 2006 anniversary, I would choose it.
