Diane Silver is not sure what he thinks about this movie, but has nothing to do with Richard Wright's novel. <br /> <br /> We have read this past novel AP Writing for English 12 and only watched the movie. I thought about the chance of lightning during the recording of the period and checking the clock. Of course, heaven was completely clear and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie ... and then I wrote article 5. <br /> <br /> Wright's novel is very realistic, psychologically mindful and behind a killer. Silver's film has turned a victim into a victim, which is not what Wright wants (see, "How Much a Wizard" 454). <br /> <br /> I want to make this short and sweet: Unreasonably leave Rafael Lambert's words, skip the film, and read the book. In 1986, adaptation is not thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> Dream: Now I have to write.
