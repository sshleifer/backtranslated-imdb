This movie is very bad, she wanted to vomit me. Poor production, a completely laugh zone. Why would you separate a verb (or a damn funny) movie in the name of God? The sets are laughable, the effects are not even ridiculous and they are cunning. It's a mystery to see why you're watching the dump. The National Lamp once made the House of Animals, and people still think that it is full and absolutely cheerful. Now they fall to make TV movies like this lump ****. Name your movie and it can be used precisely to describe the movie.
