I did not hear about it before showing it to my local DVD rental owner; In the 1980s, I decided to protect myself from becoming a scared fugitive in the UK. The film went on a drunken, amateur and ugly look; sound recordings are very bad, that half of the time is not clear, but it gives a new meaning to the wordless word! <br /> <br /> As a result, the film is a tedious formula for finding a shelter for a three-year-old young girl and a large number of unemployed families living in an accident. Soon, one of the girls goes to search for help and is never heard; again something else in the bed, after a long time forgotten. The hero feels the most interconnected with the three residents of the house: a biblical mother (unfortunately, a tolerant lady), her blood pressure (and patience), and sometimes a strange brother. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the man hates she remembers the dining table reminiscent of the mother (it is impossible to say something unusual, as a way of grieving). The film's mother has a goal of sparring competitions - it's as unexpected as strangulation ends, but it's too small for the mouth to dump its bad taste in my mouth), or the inevitable feeling of spoiling 80 minutes of my time ...
