I acknowledge that we are an admirer of the original stage production. I have never seen a movie version of cables and I have not been waiting for my reminders because I'm full of the original show. <br /> <br /> This should be the worst translation of the Broadway show. They changed the story, changed their songs, and lost their soul. Waiting for a trip down the memory strip, scandalous Music and Mirror, Ballet and Salam Twelve, Salam Thirteen. No! They did not slander music at an almost unknown point of view, but they added songs and drawings (Salam Cassie and Michael Douglas), who did not participate in the work, and "drama" where they did not need it. There was enough way in the original. If you are an admirer of the original Broadway show, do not worry. I apologize for having spent my time and watched my memories of my visit.
