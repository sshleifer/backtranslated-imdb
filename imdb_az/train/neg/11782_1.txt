The Danish movie "Slim Slam Slum" surprised me that I was the worst movie ever seen. I did not think that bad bad movies would go above my black list, but that's worth the gold. It's not funny. It's a bad move, a bad movie is shot and the story line is bad. The only positive thing to say about this movie is that it has three girls. I really believe that this flicker has the potential to knock out the worst Danish movie with another Danish movie "Stjerner uden Hjerner"! And that's really something. Congratulations!
