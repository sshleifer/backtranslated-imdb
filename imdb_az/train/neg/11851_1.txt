It was a disappointment - none of the original nuances. The British are only able to make a movie that is really bothered by any of the top-notch American version. The original series gives great attention to creepy stories, as well as lighting and settings. <br /> <br /> I've watched the series several times and still have not been fired. <br /> <br /> Another weak adaptation to the "Cracker" legendary matching line. Rejoice with those who like BBC BBC or the BBC, and like Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and Judge John Deed. Follow the original "Touching Evil", look for "Gwane Wire" rather than Robson Green's really simple and elegant performance. Hollywood needs this actor's attention!
