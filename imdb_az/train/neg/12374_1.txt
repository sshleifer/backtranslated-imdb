I do not remember to see such a dirty murder / mystery movie. This film has a complete film for a bad film, a medical examiner who investigates her husband's mysterious death in a car crash: bad behavior, drill story, lack of humor and drama. I remembered that this film was seen in PAX, a television station that sank a television channel for its unique and campaign films. TV movies, of course, do not have a big screen-shot or film-like shooting. But all the drunken taste of this movie hit. The creators of this film got the opportunity to make a big television movie "Reception for Crime"; <br /> <br /> So if you want a good recipe, do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie can only kill your TV appetite. <br /> Level F
