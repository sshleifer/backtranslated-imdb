Something hysterical about this movie, according to the director, is difficult to find a distributor in the United States. Because most of them could not reconcile Christianity and contradictory messages that seemed to be against America. <br /> <br /> If a minister is praying with homeless in Egypt or wanting to "enjoy", this is a "Christian" movie. One can interpret the fact that he is really ridiculing to the religion with all his material advantages in Plenty of Land, and that he can make a best-esteemed mission, a bread bread, and a Bible verse. Can it be unhappy or unhappy? Very useless homeless missions? How Many Psychological Vietnamese Vets? We think that American paranoid patriots are a "Plenty of land" as the agent rescues delusional generating a pill "pink"? Maybe there are many psychiatric patients? Of course, there are not many people in the film who are concerned about the main symphony-based Palestinian policy. Of course, if you work in a German homeless shelter, you know that in an unfortunate, remote land, peace will be more troubling than personal healing. Because the world knows how Europe's "abundance of quantities" will grow. /> <br /> In fact, I agree with the headline that the United States is a "Plentiful Territory", and this is about the abundance of poor scripts, amateur surgeries and well-directed movies. Life is too short and one, even an American, does not have much time to watch this piece.
