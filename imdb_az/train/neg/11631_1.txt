Today I wrote an article in Uwe Boll and Hollywood with anger. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has produced films based on one of the darkest days in our nation. 911 has changed everything. It accepted our security. It has changed our understanding of human and human evil. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the sides exchanged views on a number of issues related to US President Barack Obama's visit to Azerbaijan. death and destruction. This film and, along with it, cause controversy among the cinemas and critics; of course, should be reflected in the main press. Hollywood sank down a new one. It is lower than the low-income bosses performing the worst heirlooms and the insulting tyranny. Behind all this is Uwe Boll. I'm very angry about this movie. Why are the memories of missing families considered disrespectful? How do they encourage the lives of brave men and women who endanger their lives to save the trapped in the towers convicted on this guilty day?!?!? How to dare to capitalize on a magnificent national tragedy in the 911 World War and a tired world? How about ... courage ... they? <br /> <br /> For those who have their mouths to think of this morally fearful transvestite, I say with all my heart a heavy heart: Remember. Think until that day, and see if you are an illogical and moral person. Think about that day and ask if it's a shame or injustice for the life of this movie that day. Imagine the pains of family members of loved ones. Think of the day in which these two aircraft lost. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself, do you have a soul? <br /> <br /> Think. Remember. Respect the memories of life lost in 911 without seeing this movie.
