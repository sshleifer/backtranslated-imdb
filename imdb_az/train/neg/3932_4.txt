This little horror film is actually the best of Reny Harlin. The story is quite regular, but the atmosphere really makes it alive; In fact, the dream story is almost the same. The real horror comes from the establishment of the prison, and Renny H. does not provide details on how bad the situation is, as it is in the case of a leak-in-the-hell helmet (with a sadistic guardian). Viggo Mortensen is normally supported by many genuine prisoners leading role (there is no nice guy in this pens).
