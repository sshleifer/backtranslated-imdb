This movie is very important because I was offered this idea: sometimes you get sick ... sometimes you have syndrome ... sometimes you want to have Goldfield syndrome ... in this way I do not remember the dull movie ... and you you would not remember Adam's "superfluos" Sandler ... sometimes rented another movie in a simple way ... <br /> <br /> What is my voice? From 10 to 3. My suggestion? You are not an admirer of bogus romantic comedies or Adam Sandler ... (Adam Sandler has no admirer, there is a joke ... I want to hope for it), save yourself ... Who is a good man? Drew Barrymore. Perhaps.
