Part 1 followed on 11/7/2002 - Dir-John Bianco (Dir-John Bianco), a very clever gangster family film in Brooklyn. The only thing here was an attempt to show that the flame was a lot like a network. It's the only attempt to shoot a good movie. The rest of the film can be predicted and cheaply prepared. In the bars and floosy joints, you may find it difficult to hear some of the scenes being photographed due to the poor quality of your DVD player, and some of them are hard to hear from the bad sounds. The player was pretty much characteristic of your favorite gangsters than Vinnie's "Knuckles" and "Cornish" titles like Jimmy's Tattoos, and the plot was very much followed. So, look at a better gangster movie before putting it on one of your coins.
