1) I'm not an armsman, but I see a difference between the US in the IIT and the Second World War in the armed forces. It is possible to see individual personalities armed with the M1 Garand (invented in 1932!), But it's not the original 1903 Springfield (a Silent Death) that privatizes UCII. Difference - M1 can load 1.5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire rate! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield requires re-loading after each shot. Small difference! 2) The German army has borrowed money since 1940. Especially - helmets. By the end of the WWI, German helmets hit us, and we do not see anything like this in the film. If we make a little extra search in the archives, how true is the "true story"? Unfortunately, how much "direct" directors can be for cheap propagandistic purposes?
