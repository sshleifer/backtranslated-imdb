I really was amazed at the high appreciation for this movie. I found it was completely miserable. When it comes to some things or people, the mother gets "vision"? And one thing he touched twice was his vision ... It just looked so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was terrible. It was very annoying. <br /> <br /> The girl playing the name Lori has done a good job and worked with many supporting players. <br /> <br /> I love LMN very much and when it comes to the movie, I think it is very clear, but this movie has a ridiculous structure and has moved to the top level and not just for me.
