This is a better story about a married man to get rid of the embroidered embroidery, and then the "brutal" of the unwanted bride. At the same time he is able to become a sexist and racist. For example, a woman who respects a soldier can not fully comprehend how she is going to fight her husband's wife. Or why his team members feel so good about themselves that they want to get a "real person"? <br /> <br /> Despite the events in the Caucasus, US military forces would likely have for the first time lost their eyesight that it will be very difficult to grab this whip! Then, he prevails in India's fight against bodyguards, and one-third of his first knife is beaten. Some second wind. Later, he successfully negotiates with several bloodless Indians (as is all this), now his "spark" after rejecting it. Do not think that he possesses zero diplomacy and has been negotiating with them for years. And he just denied attempts to deceive him to keep his desires and keep him a catch - Yes, right. <br /> <br /> Finally, none of the women is convincing in their role. Madison is simply a non-realistic success. Fleming corrects her hair and looks at many things, but it's completely untrustworthy as a flaming tomboy. The only reason you root for it is that Madison's fugitive father is closed and wants to be dragged onto the cliff before the end of the film. There are fewer obstacles to Madison Fleming's ability to cope with and to see women as puppets similar to each other. <br /> <br /> Although you see them all as a baby, there is no tension. <br /> <br /> The total waste of time. Even the scenery is boring. Give this a great miss.
