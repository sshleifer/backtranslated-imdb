It was not Michael Madse's fault, but it was also difficult. This movie was just terrible. If you want to be laugh and bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words can not describe how strange it is. Sorry. Cinematography was dark. Not all other players are known. While watching it feels like a mild porn, but there are no nudity or hot scenes. This film has been subjected to sexual harassment because the underground S & M killer. The player was worse than Michael Madse's parts. He seemed to want to laugh. I hope this is a good movie for a bad movie. This is something I'm not proud of. The B film for the cable is not so, it's more than F and should never be shown.
