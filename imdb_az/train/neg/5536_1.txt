The revolt of the zombies has no irreplaceable character. I was tired of those who argued that it was not that bad, and the impact had to be more than a fist in 1936. I suspect that this is not true: the IQ is not as sharply increased in the last 7 decades. In 1936, the average viewers were likely to be squeezed by today's mid-size viewer. Why? Just try to watch the first scenes and think about the pauses between what's going on, how terrifying they are when they are approaching, and time to work out, as it seems that every extra shot takes two seconds. Pay attention to absolutely unnecessary dialogue: "I am now going out of the river / outdoors / reading my book". "You?" "Yes, I am." This type of exchange occurs several times. Normally I like to be a great admirer of bad movies, but watch the actors listening to their sequence and elegant lines without murmuring, and all desire to laugh out slowly goes away. Such incredible, boiling hot time adventures are far from the energetic, creative thinking horizons and conquer the Plan Nine From Space, or Santa Claus. Those who claim to be the ones that are more exciting are more interested in having fun. This film is not bad in the sense that the jaw is surprisingly open: it is bad that your eyes are slowly approaching boredom. Which is worse.
