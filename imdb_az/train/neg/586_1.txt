After my thought, the Manda in the Black Sea had two roles: WHY Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy? It's not the same as Spur and Harrison as described by Douglas. Perhaps he knew how badly the plot was - Jessica came back after finding Jim to be chased by another man. Without any involvement of any girl, she could not wait for a long time and compete. For a Disney movie, Jim and Jessica have a very bad part when they get married, plus many unnecessary parts - too many LAME. My family members are very insulting the viewer's intelligence. I will stay with the first and try to forget what I have seen later!
