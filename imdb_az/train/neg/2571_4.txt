Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers think that this figure will not go wrong. But what can I say? This was a terrible arrogance. The movie is about Peter Sellers, as an elderly gentleman, who suddenly contacted a very strange young man in order to avoid the hilarious hippie at Goldie Hawn. The film is amazingly different and I do not understand anything about it. <br /> <br /> Coca-Cola's poems called "Peace" are very interesting, but that's a lot. Only when I come to people who want to watch this movie in an extremely novelty movie, it is almost a definition of one. In my opinion, this is a sign of more time than anything else, so around certain experimentalism and non-traditionalism, the quality of the problem is completely flooded and there is simply no direction to write. <br /> <br /> Peter Sellers, in particular, had a great deal of blows and flips, like Dr Strangelove and his career, such as silence films and magic Christians, were very similar to each other. in context and style, but there were a few funny moments in the film. It's a trifle, and I'm sorry that most of us like Peter Sellers are in this movie. Not recommended for everyone.
