I'm mostly out of the movie, but enough for the plot to be watched. It was very unpleasant for me to speak directly, and it was not logical for some places. The only reason for watching this movie was to see CHACE CRAWFORD! She was very hot, but her hair was strange. But it's still not hot. <br /> <br /> Along with this, CHACE was not really prepared for the movie, though it was hot. In my opinion, conspiracy is not bad, but they are like every penalty they throw me. <br /> <br /> Is not it difficult to express your anger every time you say F? <br /> <br /> <strong> Is it difficult to express your anger without saying "F" every time? I found the film in a hollow and dramatic way. That's why they just cut scenes with CHACE. LOL In any case, a die-cast fan of a specific cast member like me is never worth the rent. Yes, the iron was hot. The girls were hot! But CHACE is the best!
