The head of the New York family, Jane Gail (like Mary Barton), works with Smyrner's Candy Store, her sister, Ethel Grandin (like Loma Barton). <br /> <br /> Lady Gail and police officer Matt Moore (Larry Burke) should rescue a young woman who is protected from virtue after Mrs. Grandin has been kidnapped by dealers for buying and selling women as a slave. <br /> <br /> There is a difficulty to support "Traffic in the Souls" - it's not a good thing, and it's not a rare thing to have a "benevolence" of a young woman threatened by sex traffickers. Perhaps the subject may be supported as a film that claims to be more customary (the first time it has been filmed in the film). After all these years, the scenes of the city of New York are the main attraction. The prisoners' panorama behind the bar is memorable because nothing else will be able to move the cameras. <br /> <br /> Traffic in the soul (11/24/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
