There is another injustice and slap in the face of gay guys everywhere. This shame in a comedy hell does not have to offer him. Once again we have an attractive 'straight' hero, probably no woman will be interested in her. Yes, it's true! And we will get acquainted with a "sympathetic, attractive" gay friend, in fact a fat, balding, ugly old man, so it should look attractive. Even though I did not feel attractive and I am an oily, ugly old gay guy (but not gratefully thank you)! No matter what the talent that operates here, it was thrown in a bad script and in a terrible direction. Mr. Sneedeker should be banned from the singer, but he is different from the many other hackers in Hollyweed.
