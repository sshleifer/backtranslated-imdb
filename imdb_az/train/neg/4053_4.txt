if .... cinema equivalent of Sgt. Pepper's: Baby boomers have been raised as the peak of creation and have been valued as a more intelligent job by previous and later generations. Children of the middle class now appear to be super people as seen from the internet and see Harry Potter's books / films as a great opportunity for the boarding school's perspective, more important than the contemporary issues. In fact, many scenes appear to be so far and exaggerated that they point to Pink Floyd's Wall with an inspiration. <br /> <br /> When reviewing a film, it should not make a single individual approach to any movie, and there are some flaws in which this film's cemented history has been viewed by others. Lindsay Anderson was generally known to be an admirer of Luis Buñuel, who was very smart for his good. And, despite a simple narrative through the first and second acts, cod Buñuel's last part of the hostage taken by surrealism and the efforts of symbolism. Anderson could not do this job, because of his very clever cynicism, Buñuel had never seen jovial in his work. I did not find a critic criticizing the "Trasher's Drawer" championship, and still look at those who long for this film. <br /> <br /> The English public school system has been strong for middle class (for the upper crust). studied at home by private teachers). And Lindsay believed he was a modus operandi to check the public school life boxes, so he kept the middle class charges. Homosexuality, generation knife, cold shower, etc. In fact, they encountered such a topic in a great British movie, like HAD .... only brought them to the forefront. <br /> <br /> The Caucasian version was a very funny puppy of this pump. <br /> If it is strangely strange and can not be explained simply by modern (especially American) eyes. Anderson to avoid Mick and Kieth from damaging African chaos, some Kudos and latent homoerotic overtones for several coffee beans. Missing points to know, creating symbols that destroy, and promoting a revolution that does not come to nothing.
