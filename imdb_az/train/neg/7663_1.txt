Tara Reid, intellectual, is a dollar store, Christian Slater (usually great) like Constantine and Stephen Dorff ... it is also STEPHEN DORFF for Christ SAKE! I personally would like to express my gratitude to the casting directors for this work and effort. You are children. My only humble opinion of the film is to reach the public, but it's just watching with your previous choices. A film about the most brilliant neuro-physics in history prepares a pill to treat all known human diseases and should be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I love you, I knew. Seriously, though, I owe me $ 7.50.
