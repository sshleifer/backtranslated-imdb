The full wasting of time .... This movie is not a comedy, it's not a drama, it's not romance ... the youngest comedy! The story ... should be more than one turn in a row ... but it is very heartwarming! When the movie is over, I watch the movie better (say "Fight Club"), but this turn-over is worse than the movie .... When I watch a teenage comedy and I'm going to do it too often, I'm awaiting bad deeds and a lot of horror ... jokes are so great and there is no nudity ... Only meet one .... I have to accept a very good look ... girl, and that's it! And she's all dressed up in the movie! Acting is bad ... like soap series ... Do not waste your time! There is a better story and some pornographic pornography! <br /> <br /> (I apologize for my poor english)
