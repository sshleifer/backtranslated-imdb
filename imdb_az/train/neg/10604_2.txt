This time the hero of the first film has become human and this time uses fist and foot combos against a computer that is fighting against super-universal soldiers and ready to seize the world. I'm pretty sure that Jan-Claude Van Damm is a team of Double Team who is convinced that it's no longer safe to make a breakthrough. But this has infringed on his credibility forever. Universal Soldier: Returning is not as dull as Double Team or Quest, but is still a terrific, original, and one of the styles and flair of any pair of stars. This is simply done for children who love professional wrestling. When I look back, even the motion signals are not astonishing, and that's why this film is worthless. <br /> <br /> We have another word on the Van Damme assembly line. <br /> 4 (Bad)
