The final combination of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is actually a mistake. The scenario is weak and presented poorly. There is only one life in the film. There is nothing wrong with hearing Eddy and MacDonald would have been better than just giving a concert for their final films, and everything else in Turkey was just cooked.
