I have not seen the first movie and if there is no such thing as this one. <br /> <br /> Just a few hours before watching it, I'm struggling to remember something about it. <br /> <br /> Let's remind, the main plan seems to be a very disturbing group, since 13th of the week it remains in a house with an elderly woman who protects her and is full of wooden boards. <br /> <br /> Some people die, finish the movie, and I start a law training against a person who sells this movie, because I do not want compensation for the missing time in my life. <br /> <br /> I will pay 1 pound to get this movie out of my hands ... oh I already gave a "friend".
