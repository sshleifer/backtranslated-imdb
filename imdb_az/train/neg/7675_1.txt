Could there be some movies that are still free of charge? Answer: Well, that's one of them. The terrible "House of the Dead", directed by Uwe Boll, has now drawn a bit more talented eye to another video game adaptation. Do not these guys get it? For everyone who can not understand, here are the headlines for you: DO NOT FIGHT YOU with VIDEO GAMES! It is the bottomest standard operating here. Set design and special effects are weak. In contrast to the video game (which had a terrible moment), the film has unexpected resurrection weather, no danger or danger. Pacing and scheduling would be better used as a mixed and script paper paper toilet paper. The main sinner is the director. Uwe Boll uses a camera with a monkey grace and skill using a brush. In an unexpected moments in Hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans, he left the audience unobtrusive and boring. Why this person was originally placed near a film, first of all should be one of the greatest mysteries of contemporary cinemas. Avoid all costs.
