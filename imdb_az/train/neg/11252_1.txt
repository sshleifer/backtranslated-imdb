"Sky Captain" can be seen as respect for comic books, pulp adventures and movie sequences, but at least the magic of the best of these genres. According to one co-ordinator, the use of the film depends on whether or not the films are aware of the effects. I do not think this truth is correct. The expectations of some of the movies, fiction and serials that someone called "Captain" were quite different. Especially for having fun while having children. This film is almost deprived of all the charm and magnetic attraction. Of course, we know that potential can be gained and exited, but there must be some tension and drama. There are ten minutes to prevent the "Captain" law and the catastrophe to Paltrow's peak, and when they fall five minutes, they run away from their goals. They take time for remote images and unnecessary conversations and an enemy hostile 30-second disaster. Of course, we expect certain conventions to be included, but a good director would have kept the sense of urgency. <br /> <br /> Such films do not necessarily expect "sense". One of them expects to have fun, exciting, and inner logic. There is almost no "captain". When Law and Paltrow are followed by winged creatures, remember that they have reached a great leapfrog passing through a log bridge. How do these creatures come to a perfect safety when they reach the other side? They can be FLY! It does not mean anything for itself. The bridge is unnecessary for them, so where is the run? <br /> <br /> According to some reports, filming is "forbidden" for "winged" creatures. <br /> <br /> I know Paltrow and Law have played some kind of "types" in the past, but both were pretty flat. Only Giovanni Ribisi (who showed great nuance here) and Angelina Jolie had to give an oomph in the role that Omid Celiley might have been able to handle a little while, just as she was given the chance. <br /> <br /> This film was a great 'eye', but there are many ways to attract CGI's attention. CGI works well in nature or when used for science fiction when used to create scientific or magic splendid creatures. It is worrying when used to replace natural areas. There is no sense of miracle. A CGI mountain has no nature and no fears, and is a prominent mountain. I know that the design of this film was intentional and it should not necessarily look at the truth, but not in such a way? It just did not happen. <br /> <br /> When it comes to weak and clich√©d scripts ... respect is not an excuse. Even though the film had some excitement and dramatic tension, it could still be unpleasant. The "Last Samurai" could have been predicted as days of the week, and I'm no fan of Tom Cruise, but the Captain drew the world's most spectator and adopted us its rules and ways. <br /> <br /> <strong> I think the Sky Captain did not do it in the least. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a similar approach to films about 30-year-old and 40-year-old comic book heroes. Original (Jay Garrick) Flash or Green Lantern (Alan Scott) comes to mind for such a cure. Perhaps the better, more recognizable and completely different characters, this character will do for a better movie. It's hard to be worse.
