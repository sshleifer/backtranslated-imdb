Although not one of the most embarrassing production in the 1970s, GAOTS really wants to be really important. Tragic truth is that it can not help at every level, but it is completely empty without laughter. Ingmar Bergman's film creates a desperation for earth's elements, wandering on a shady path after a city in the wilderness, pontificating as a UC. Berkeley coffee torn. Almost every tarradiddle dialogue here is so bad ("Life itself consists of very small sections like pomegranate, but is it beautiful?") After the end of the entire absence of the eternity (well ... OK ... we are nudity and soft is being treated with a soft sex scene) has an extremely anticlimactic confrontation that ultimately covers a pair of people who are giving a natural scene and have quite a tough folkloric performers with acoustic guitar. <br /> <br /> Nothing interesting or interesting in this REFLECTORY FILM. Larry Buchanan is a poor example of Bergman's respect for his "Strawberry Needed Lubrication". Every "golden apple" is bad, but casual casual gaps make it memorable. 1/10
