Activity, violence, sex, and coarse language are all things that symbolize throughout the film. And everything they do is useless. Mark L. Lester is known for violent (undisputed) films (Commando, The Base). Story is strange, but stupid. Actors play their foolish characters very well ... I say foolishly, but I'm telling them that they're a very bad actor. Another low-budget B series action movie. When you see something like the same evil movies as the Delta Force, the Driver, the Patriot, the Holy Place or Misbegotten, you do not rent it, and in the meantime, the movies I've recorded ... I give it from 1 to half.
