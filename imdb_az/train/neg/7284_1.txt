Amazing! Wow. I read about this movie and did not see it, it sounded terribly and my guard is feeding it in St. Louis. Where should I start? The National Lampoons tried to pursue the success of Animal House five years later, but they were completely abducted. <br /> <br /> Short film # 1 <br /> <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Animal House Boon). As it turned out, he did not come back, so the guys at the National Lampoons were supposed to say, "Hey, we're going to shoot a movie?" Peter "looked like this, I do not work very much now, why not?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < </ strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> Leave her, find her. They are very strange that they are really happy marriage. So she follows her, goes there, and Cooper is responsible for children. It is certainly burnt home, loses a few children and lies with an assortment of New York bimbos (always including young Diane Lane). Once the wife comes back, she wants children and the movie ends with a coin flip that will decide the fate of children. The idea was actually quite clever, but the director stunk. If the heroes look like they fall asleep, they get up to the DPI. <br /> <br /> Pretty girl, recently completed college, lives her life not sure what. So when she gets a prostitute, she starts sleeping with some mega-rich guys, gets paid when she dies, and she does not stop lying in the world's most powerful man, Fred Willard (Ooops, I'm from the United States). Once again, it could have been ridiculous, and although Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry, in real life) was not afraid to be all naked, his player was terrible. <br /> <br /> Short film # 3 <br /> <br /> I do not believe so far away. Here with strange police Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone thinks young, naive, really can help people, even though he's been hit for a thousand times. Nagurski really did not just care. Those mugams watch the attacks, name them, and never interfere. He considers the world illicit, and if he does, it will probably argue. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of a taxi business) has come to the police to call him a criminal offense, but his lawyer has to protect him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Once again, it would be funny, the performances were deliberately collected, but there was no goodness or energy. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi are ashamed of their names in this shock. I think that the writing was not bad, there were ideas, but the execution was suspended, along with the attempt to rescue Iran in the hostage crisis. If it were part of the movie, I'd like to raise my name, it was terrible. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this trash is that Dr John's account of the movie (repeating repeating "Movies") is more than an hour and a half. In the class of this movie, show "WHY what you should do in filmmaking". This script was shelved because it was bad.
