I had a few months ago on the Family Channel and took some memories of television shows coming from my youth and decided to go with my 4 year old daughter. Besides, I have to get some psychedelic mushrooms to go, because it's just strange! It's just something awesome, forgetful melodies, not a musician, but the glowing effect and the collective principles that come from the stars, seem to have been prepared as a good acid ride. Speaking of Flutes, English children are too old for this crap ... "uuuuuugggghhhhh" with Krusty the Klown words, what was it? If you are a great admirer of all Sid and Marty Krofft art, go for it; Otherwise, stay away from the distance, unless you want to be looped before watching.
