***** WARNING, SHARING USED USE THIS TRIPE. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If the Gospels offer good advice to anyone living in the UK, Channel 5 has a comedy of the elderly 80's reading a book at night. But in this film, I'm in the process of recovering from a seizure about reading some of the comments. In fact, I'm shocked that someone actually said that this movie was real! We can say that the Cold War has never been poured or I should be grateful that we can give Commie's borders in a different way ... I found this movie on the most exciting pretext, perhaps this is a movie that is funny, who knows? <br /> <br /> I do not know that this movie is not only scary, teeth are terribly horrible. <br /> <br /> I'm not an admirer of Bill Murray and his trash is justified by my feelings. Do not make me wrong, I'm Ghostbuster's darling, just three years after this movie. But it really puts Bill Murray into the truth. I can safely say that I did not ruin my time so much, as I see Delta Force's first run of the Delta Force, though these two films are more than you think. For 1 thing, both have the terrible motion signal and the second one from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> There are some things that these guys should be in the US Army. However, around their camp, Willy nilly, women around the camp are allowed to deceive Military Police officers and then shamelessly foolishly at Generals Quarters. Talk about Random! This film is scared for me. Now, do not take me wrong, I'm not a feminist sympathizer, but these two women really make sure they fall into the heels that are in love with two characters shortly after their arrest ... Two times, just for insulting women. The truth is that a bad-haired, fatty bum (Winger) and her unfaithful Ramis can simply enter the sweaters MP's underwear, both of which are not tolerated by love, ridiculous. Then, there are training areas to meet Squad "Phycho" staff threatening the killing of anyone who touches him or things, and then a very overweight block (played by the late and great John Candy), angry control classes in the army is not afraid of paying $ 400. "Giant Toe" (WTF?) "Drill Seargent" was not able to create pi at Murray's loyal beer factory, which was a great deal of complexity. Let's start with the people who say "the way to the road" by uploading "scenes in the battlefield" to serve the whole scene! "always, etc .. The scenes are then taken to a scene that shoots shooting bands in an attacking skirmish course while some of them are shooting into the air. Birds passing through the attack rifle, with bullets a clock tower with pepper. (Yep, he said that this movie was casual ... Miraculously escaping ...) Finally, the two-hour hard staff, some wise words from Murray (Do not deceive, Miracle!) thanks to the rank of the opponent in front of the retired "General" to any soldier, all of them will give a great pleasure to their two young daughters, and really arrest them ... Everyone laughs though it is a bit unbelievable. Then, the new Multi Millions Dollar prototype armored vehicle in Italy (which is green with many interior cars colored green house) and selects them to defend it, "This is what this army needs!" Directly ... <br /> <br /> When Murray and Ramis decided to steal this hidden prototype of the Military Vehicle, the newly acquired and some of the most horrible finals that can get a little Hyperactive MP Girlfriends in Germany. Captain John Larroquette then finds and carries out a new retirement mission on the vehicle's search mission. Later, they were detained in Czechoslovakia, where they took the "wrong turn" route and ended with the Soviet Union. (As it has never been seen before ...) So, an attempt to rescue Ramis and Murray + Birds begins. A great fight here pushes heavy loads of ships and tanks. By coming up with them as "national heroes", you can call them "pussies" and so on. Calling down the Russians and so on. Last. True. There is no court in the court, nothing. They just drove a prototype military vehicle, a Warsaw Pact country, and caused an international event that could have caused WW3 almost! <br /> <br /> This film is a terminal disease. I know it's his comedy, for which there are all actors, but where is he in hell? Should Channel 5 cut those bits? The only payout feature in this movie is the routine use of the naked women shower and the female mud wrestling. (I said Random) This is, of course, the fact that it's a completely malicious film. This film should actually be directed to the 9-year-old grown-up man, and, unfortunately, we have to watch it. 10 to 1 star - Total Tripe. My advice is a little more useful than your time. As yourself Castrator ...
