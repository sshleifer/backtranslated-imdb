It was the worst movie I've ever seen in WorldFest, and after that, I received the least applause! I think this is just a recognition based on the amount of well-known actors in the movie. It's great to see J.Beales, but only a few minutes in the movie. M.Parker is a better actress than a permitted part. The rest of the game is difficult to judge because the film is ridiculous and predictable. The main character is not entirely complex and therefore hollow to watch. There is no real emotional depth in the story. A returning movie about an actor who can not get a job is not too original to me. There is no police development. <br /> <br /> I feel like one of the many plain films I've seen in the 90s ... And these are not good at the standards. <br /> <br />
