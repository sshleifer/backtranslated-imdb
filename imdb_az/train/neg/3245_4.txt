David Mamet's first startup movie, the movie of a person who realizes by many, is regarded as a movie that questions everyone and everything else. <br /> <br /> This movie was first seen for the first time and I did not realize how good it was. <br /> <br /> About Margaret, a female psychologist, the most-sold writer in the film. Margaret was worried that she would not be able to help her profession and really. A shark called Mike (played by Joe Mantegna, the sole reason for watching this film) is trying to help the patient solve the gambling debt and try to correct it. He finds that Mike is a professional trustworthy person, and he immediately falls victim to the trick he is talking about. Interestingly, she goes back to see her and asks her to show how her artists are working (as a subject of a new book of psychology). All events in the film are made by Mike and Margaret by his cronies. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> is an idea to deceive 80 thousand dollars. <br /> <br /> Firstly, big bending toward the end is much more than expected. Any scene in which certain men acted was a staggering movement and a strange line. Not only this, but the audience (and the main character) knows that they are dealing with men, so is it a great surprise when you know that Margaret is connected to her? In addition, Margaret is an intelligent psychologist who is a specialist in reading people, but he allows himself to dupe himself very easily and remembers that Mike is an artist. Secondly, we believe that Margaret has been linked from the beginning, but for the outcome of the case, he must do a few things that he does not predict that men can do. First, he decided to help the patient solve his debt, and first let him meet. If he had not seen it, he was like that. I have to say that only a psychologist would take the patient to solve the gambling debt is quite unfounded. Not just that, but what about the possibility that men would think they would go to the right place at night? Did they hope that they would come and see them every night? Something else could not have been predicted: Margaret returned to see Mike again and asked him to teach her trade advice. What is this happening? <br /> <br /> I also ended another problem. Margaret sees that she is bound and decided to take revenge on Mike. At first, Mamet believes that the console will go to us, but this is coming to an end, as Mike's last weapon is a weapon in the airport baggage area. I felt unfounded and impartial to finish a movie about the concert artists who continued their trade. <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie feels empty and unfulfilled. And if you like Margaret's prediction ahead of time, you will find this revelation as unsatisfactory.
