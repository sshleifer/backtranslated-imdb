I really did not expect much from this movie because people from Parkersburg WV lived. This city is entertaining and there is also this movie. The film has been refreshed several good times, but has dropped out of all the extravagance it has put in a spot to show. It would be good if this movie really works, but nothing happened. Stay away from this movie, if you are not from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing every day you see it. The dialogue will put you to sleep, the player winked at you, and Steven Soderberg should not lose some confidence after a similar incident. His unexpected movie is surprising. What's yours and this is a 73-minute tour of Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without a narrator.
