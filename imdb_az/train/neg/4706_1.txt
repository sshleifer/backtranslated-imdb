Indeed, this film is a breath-taking breath. First, the group going to hell will go to see or listen to a group called "NAKED BROTHERS BAND"?!?! The name is simply not terrible, musicians are so, they can not even play anything! Also, the lead singer sounds more girly than Geddy Lee and the more sounds he gets! They are not just terrifying musicians, but terrifying actors. Under the guise of an unhappy film director and subtle organization, this should not be the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> I would like this website to use less than 10 LOW POLICY because it is very generous by giving it a 1/10. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure you can tell this. a comedy movie. If you are looking for comedy with music, "Strange Al" Yankovich go to the boy, because he does something better than this untalented tweens.
