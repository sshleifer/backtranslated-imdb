Carly Papa plays JJ, a newly-acquired cook critic, his majestic, obedient mother moves with her. JJ fears this type of incident and blackmails the owner of the restaurant instead of looking at Alex's "maybe" immortal restaurant. Alex's daughter falls in love with her mother. There are many problems with this movie, the characters are universal in size. JJ is a self-serving, abhorrent character, mother's surface and shallow. JJ's colleagues in the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic. The main message that more than 50 women can not help herself is bad, bad, bad, without the help of a person. Acting is straightforward, the scenario is extinguished. Only grace-saving films are recognized by New York City. And I will not recommend this movie.
