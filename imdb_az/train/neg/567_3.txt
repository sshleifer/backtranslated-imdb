This movie is one of the most horrific films ever made. How can Jon Bon Jovi play in the movie? She kills vampires with her guitar, not a singer, but an actor? What about terrible plot? Oh, God, this movie is really sad. In the end, the king of vampires played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade), surrounded by the vampire army, but when the "fantastic" slayers come only to 4 vampires! What happened to other 10-15 vampires? Sunscreen What will happen to "Finally Away" when Bon Jovi hit his head with a shotgun? This is not really "NO". In a 100 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a vampire is not killed by A SHOTGUN? This is really the lack of originality!
