... And do not release the older one. I will not give a direct reference here or do anything, but at least to say that this movie is miserable. Do not worry if you are in military training. I put on a DVD with two friends who wanted to watch a little fascinate / flick rhythm. <br /> <br /> The first "bomber" scene has big flaws and they continue to show and continue to be bigger and bigger. My two friends, I saw some of the mistakes of the movie in any way not related to the soldier, and asked me if we were asking for some of the things we asked for. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of this movie, you will not be able to take into account the mistakes and the mistakes that occur again. First, I'm interested in 2/10.
