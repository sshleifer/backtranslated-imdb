An absolutely strange debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays an alcoholic family man named Cecil Moe. Cecil holds a phone book, names a publisher, and calls it in the middle of the night. She goes to the groom's home and discusses her problems. The preacher teaches Cecile to respect the word of God and to be in the heart of Jesus. Makes things better. Ahh ... Everything in life is easy. This "movie" seems to have been made about $ 500, of course, it does not help. 1/10
