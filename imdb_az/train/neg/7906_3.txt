Carol Burnett did not invite Korman because he was very funny at the show. He was good when playing secondary characters in Mel Brooks films ("High Anxiety" comes to mind). But he is not a man who can shoot a movie on dueling roles. This is mainly based on the tradition of "Critters" and "Ghoulies", "Gremlins". This is not a very good knockoff with "Ghoulies", or much lighter tone because it is not as dark as the film is. In fact, it is very light and foamy and, unfortunately, many jokes begin to fall flat. I would give 3 for a score, though that's just a movie that is worse than the Gremlin beat. If you've been watching Mystery Science Theater 3000, I know that you know one of the "Hobboblins". In some underground places (I just saw this movie, I do not remember everything clearly) there is a man and he begins to make a good friendship. However, this vitality is becoming faster and, of course, more spawned and this movie. The sugar department misses more than hits and this is nude to see Korman playing a really bad brother role. One is best to skip, but then you just want to check for the shot.
