This movie was very powerful - a powerful cast, a powerful idea and a clear budget. I'm not sure where everything is wrong, but each of these elements is flawed. The story went anywhere, the heroes were at least empty to say and the result was a very boring, meaningless, loss of a movie. I hated it. According to other voices, I am here in minority and should be of some sort. But I thought this movie was terrible. There were high hopes, but it was very disappointing. A special disappointment was Jody Foster's character. One kind of strange "corrective" creates a good idea. Jody was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and went anywhere. Denzel had the same character he always played in Washington - a welcome, but new thing.
