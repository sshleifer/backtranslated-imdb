To be completely honest I have not seen many western films, but I've seen enough to know that it's a good thing. The worst West of this planet ever since. Are there first black people in the west of the desert? Come on! Anyone who thinks it will be cooler than a wall-walled movie that everyone likes, it's never too late! Secondly, on that day and in older women, especially black women, they were not inclined to carry guns or use weapons. Third, the Asian chick speaks perfect English? If the setting is west, Asia is not yours. Finally, the bad gay chicken movie has begun from the very beginning. Now I'm not mistaken, I'm not racist or white, but after reading this, I do not celebrate, but this movie, this movie is the worst presentation of black men I've ever seen!
