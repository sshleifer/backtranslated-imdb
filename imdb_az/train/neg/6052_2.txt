Despite the drawbacks, "Smoke Nose", the masters of the Horror series, have been delighted with an episode of John Carpenter's Season. Yes, the story looked like an inexpensive cross between 8MM in the MADNESS NETWORK, but it was still very good for budget and time restrictions. Together with Pro-Life, low budget and time limitations show more than anything else. As always, Carpenter is also directly directed, but the quality of written and whole production, and it gives a total and complete trap. The scenario is not always clear, the message is fuzzy, and when you look at them, the story is full of cunning gaps. Perhaps he had rewritten the Carpenter script, which could have been a valuable episode. Instead, it's just a mixture of the hardest Carpenter fans you can find the smallest flavor. Truly the worst Carpenter ever did. 2/10
