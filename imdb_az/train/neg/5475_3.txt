Tyrannosaurus Azteca, the famous Spanish researcher Hernando Cortes (Ian Ziering), comes to Mexico with six men from the best men, including Rios (Marco Sanchez), and they steal some gold in the name of the Spanish and possibly even some gold. Within a matter of minutes, Cortes and his men have been at first glance at the local Aztec oases for a few minutes after their capture and detention. If it were not bad enough, several Tyrannosaurus Rex live there and the local people are trying to win the Spanish bid to help the local people get rid of the problem of the monsters, but it's coming up with a different secret agenda <br /> <br /> Brian Trenchard-Smith (one of my favorite watchdogs, Turkey Shoot (1982), (all at once and all-compassionate), and even more widely known as Aztek Rex (whose title was changed when the Sci-Fi Channel was released) sounds like the original name Tyrannosaurus Azteca. foreign movies) is still another 'wrong' and 'cheap' learning Sci-Fi channel, and you really need to know it. During the expedition to Mexico, as the real Spanish Conquistador Cortes, despite the fact that the film did not make an effort to date precisely, the story tries to do something a little different here, but ultimately, Tyrannosaurus Azteca still has only some "poor" With a bunch of CGI computer graphics. Even though there are cliches already predetermined in the centuries, I can not say for sure that the character has ordinary cardboard tracks, stupid decisions and mischief, heroism, something behind, eating and beautiful women are all here and easier to do. The film moves at a good pace, and if one thing is interesting, there is one or two half decent moments, though it is predictable, intelligent, boring, and does not really enjoy any level. The story is not good and there are many gaps, which is a kind of movie that will be completely forgotten in a few days. <br /> <br /> Now that I've seen Sci-Fi Channel's 'Creature Features' and usually the CGI computer effect is awful, and Tyrannosaurus Azteca does have a few good-looking effects, but then they are generally destroyed by the fearful effect they shot straight. Here are some nice effects: there is a sharp heart, a person's feet are soaked, some blood leaps, a person holding his own intestine after the dinosaur's attack has a cold shot, several dead bodies have been seen, and one has been stabbed with a spear. T-Rex begins to eat a few people. The production values ​​are really cheap, the Aztec structure looks like one of these parks made of Styrofoam, and this Spanish people should have been arrested in the worst closed prison in kinematic history and likely to keep them down to mans. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Today, Tyrannosaurus Azteca is not really much better than any other cheap Sci-Fi channel 'Creature Feature', despite the almost unexpected and unusual situation, the main idea is that the key statement is it enough that you will enjoy it (probably you will never guess).
