We watched the DVD tower for something we watched last night. NetFlix was on a quiet Saturday night and we were in the mail. I did not hear it first and realized that it was borrowing from a friend. It was called a jacket, as the "Big Onion" was demolished, but it was worth seeing the star shooting. Boy wrong! Not just like "The Big Chill", it is almost characteristic of the character. Bill Pakston's character is William Hurt's ("the place of all times") spoiler warning - and, of course, he's left behind to care for the old place (cabin / camp). Kimberly Williams = Meg Tilly; sex women Matt Craven = Jeff Goldblum and others. and so on. They did not have enough character to find an interest in me. How did "Unca Lou" find these characters after 20 years? Of course, when Perkins was falling, it was not a funny thing, except when leaving his bed the first morning, it was a sign, and I missed it. When I finished, I asked my wife, "Do you have any favorite characters in this movie? Have you been there?" He replied: "No, I still think ... No, I can not think."
