After seeing this film joining the cinema, I thought it was an original concept for a tension set by computer companies in the competitive world. The whole star movie was a message that this movie would probably be good. But when you did not go to watch him in the first week of your freedom, he disappeared for the 2nd week, and I thought he was afraid of something. I waited impatiently for the release of the DVD, and then rushed to the house for a good evening watch. When going home, the movie was better than the movie. The direction for a start is terrible. All this has no idea and the director is part of it, so it may appear in the film. In the future, I would not hurry to hire him. Secondly, the leading role is completely wrong, as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe normally has a cool character as the Way of Sacred Intentions and Weapon, but he must be a bumbling hero who tried to show the description by slipping when he was running and geeky friends, but he just did not look properly. Female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani are not fanciful, but what they do is not the best of their performance. The only point in the movie is played by Tim Robbins for him and his fire and mysterious ways to drag the film. The final point is that this movie is another thing that fills the trailer with the scenes you do not see in the movie and is just part of the DVD erased scenes. Some of these scenes are unfamiliar, though they fill important gaps in the story.
