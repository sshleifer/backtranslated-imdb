I read the book Celestine Prophet and hope to see the film. Let the movie be given in a concise way. Many of the most exciting moments in the book are not included in the film. The best "B" movie. Many events, symbols, character interaction and encounter in the book are simply changing or not happening. The flow of events in the book is softer, embarrassing, and fed by the appearance of a child. Character development is very weak. Identities of the ancients differ from the books. The move resembles a "B" horror racer. I understand that it will take six hours in the film to present everything in the movie, but the base screen has missed a lot of points. Casting was very good.
