The "lies" are a storyline that is less than an excuse for half an hour and half of the half of the screen, which splits into a hip and sex hits between a 18-year-old woman and a 38-year-old married man. A story with a mix of comedy and drama, which has very little production value, including apparent sanitary devices and softcore sex, "Lies" is often an unnecessary affliction. Approximately 2 hours of work, subtitles and very few items, "Lies" are simply not recommended. (C-)
