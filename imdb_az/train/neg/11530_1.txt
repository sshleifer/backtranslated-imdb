Over the last 10 years, I worked in three different indie professional wrestling organizations, run multiple wrestlers (including two consecutive wrestling stars), have worked on 2 different wrestling TV programs, and made noise and commentary on many wrestling DVDs. I have never seen the quality of my husband's foolishness, talent and skill and the quality of Splatter Rampage Wrestling. It even exploits its term explicitly for this list as any type of wrestling. The cameras are shot with nine cameras, most of which are fighting videos playing in the back yard of children. The sound quality is bad, the video quality is poor and the player is heartfelt. "Wrestlers" wear suits with hand-drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with different ingredients and mimic the movements of the half wrestling. Sometimes "matches" are on the grass. Sometimes trampoline in the back yard. ALL of the wrestling skills are poorly executed and carried out with a shameful lack of ability. In short, do not worry about this stinker. If you were interested in this DVD as an entertaining or academic (and in my case), you will be very disappointed.
