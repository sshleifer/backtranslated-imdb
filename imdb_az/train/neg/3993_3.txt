This movie is not as great as it was expected, but not as bad. In my opinion, the PG13 films are not scared, so I knew I'd be bored throughout the whole movie. There was no doubt that there were terrible events in the hotel room, but we did not see anything at all. I did not like it very much because it was too twisted and shifted; old and repetitiated. I did not understand if Cusak had everything in the room or not. There is no explanation for what has happened. The film is just drifting and when you finally have it, you still want to keep going, because I'm waiting for someone to say what the movie is. What I wanted was a special effect. Other than that, he did not have much benefit. Maybe it's just me, but I think it's middle level.
