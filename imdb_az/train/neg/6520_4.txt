Bondarchuk was an inexperienced director with only one painting for a successful WWII story adaptation, even though he was not a young person when he was given the task to work on this project. Bondarchuk, of course, was an operating star already ten years, but his skills were far behind the camera and he was not ready to produce this scale product as a director. In particular, in group scenes, frequently in unsuccessful camera positions, demonstrations of naked different qualities for the director, as seen in the transparency of the transparency of the actors, their devices, silent sounds, and radio broadcast announcements. <br /> <br /> Vidor's "War and Peace" was the main reason why the Soviet government did not spend on this production. The release of the picture of Vidor was much squeezed by the USSR. Of course, Bondarchuk tried to boast the Hollywood movie's greatest strength and to find his own Audrey. His last choice, Lyudmila Savelyeva, is a pretty, beautifully colored, dark-haired, really like Hepburna several times. Unfortunately, Kirov is not a dancer or dancer, so I'm not surprised that the most pleasant word I can find to describe his performance is "terrible." <br /> <br /> Soviet actors, while speaking the same language with Tolstoy's symbols, would have been better understood by foreigners, but this proved that War and Peace were not so often. The Revolutionary Depression shook the upper layer of the Russian cultural land and the War and the Peace world grew, so a great share of these great Soviet actors participating in this production seemed to have been more likely that the Americans had performed Shakespeare. Of course, American actors, of course, they can not play incredibly, but you know what I mean when you are witnessing cast members in the adaptation of Bran). Only three of the main characters are Bondarchue's Pierre modest, but he was too old for most of his time and felt his place in the early stages.
