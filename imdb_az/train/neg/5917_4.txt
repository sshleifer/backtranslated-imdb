This film wants to think that criminals are the product of modern society. So, thieves, abusers, and murderers (the murderer of this film is worse than three by James Woods) can they be given a complete report for their deeds? An interesting concept, but it is very difficult to put on the screen intellectually and emotionally. This is where the Killer: Criminal Magazine is too short. Although the film tries to impress Pancham's behavior, the viewer does not feel that Panzram is a sinner, not a victim, because of his influence on his fierce youth and disability. Undoubtedly, the system is corrupt, with a bullet that occupies all the sick places of Leavenworth Prison (most of the film), most of whom are prison guards and sadistic bulletins, and the prison director's megalomaniacal despot. But why is Henry Lesser (Robert Sean Leonard), the monk's new prison jailer, regretted Panzrama? Even after reading his awesome diaries? The film offers some explanation: Small witnesses Panzram is beaten up for pulpa by the most sadistic (and stereotype) guard and is affected by Panzram's intelligence (although this is exactly what he thinks is so clever). Undoubtedly, this film is not enough to piss a human being like Panzram, though this film is trying to reduce the crime and to emphasize its identity. Lesser right, Panzram is quite loyal and saddened by the viewer that he is above all the tricks he read in the diary of Panzram for the Little. Does this person have Lesser little friend, so does he value the value of everyone who is just looking away from him? <br /> <br /> I can present Monster about Charlize Theron and Christina Ricci as a film that remotely controls the same subjects. more integrity and coverage. BTW: Killer, shot for television (not good)
