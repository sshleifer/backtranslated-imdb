The "Hidden" part was full of popular appeal of the horrible magazine of that name, but the subject of labor rebound was associated with the congressional investigation of the day. However, despite the A-grade B-movie and some good script ideas, the film is released for approximately 73 minutes. This is the whole way of producing a cheap jack. Whatever it takes to get out of weak production, some ideas from the thirsty director, Sidney Salk. For example, a few days of layout would help reduce the sequence of horrible studio sets. An elegant helmet such as Anthony Mann could do anything with a thick-skinned outfit, but Salkow only behaves as a pay-day exercise. Brian Keith's typical low-key style does not work here, just like wooden and lethargic, but also religious man Elisha Cook Jr, goes wild like a wild-eyed drunk. Obviously, Salkow is not the director of any actor. However, you should give Beverly Garland a small amount of this sauce that you are playing with characteristic darkness and selflessness. Too bad, he is not responsible. My advice - beat the biscuits with 50 fashionable jacket jackets, regardless of whether you are entering funny bar girls who do nothing else.
