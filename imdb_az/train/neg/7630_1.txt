A boring movie about a dull city in the '50s. How can anyone think that it is classic? The girlfriend, who loved his production career, was buried in several films that were superior to Cybil Shepard's ability to move. In my opinion, this film gives Peter Bogdanovic an idea of ​​how bad the future films will be. Cybil Shepard's career started diving after several films produced by Peter Bogdonovic. His career is not up to "Moonlighting" when it comes back. I imagined that the poor character of the actor's "Graduate". I noticed that this movie was not shown in the United States. The only place I was watching was in Europe late at night.
