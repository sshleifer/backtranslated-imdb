I'm not sorry to send a brand below 1. But I believe I'm watching and watching this nervousness. Every part of the movie was terrible. Music, movement, direction, story, everything, just everything. In fact, I laugh at different points in the movie. In particular, I did not want my hero to go to the hospital on a slow motionless path and to remove the panels from the hands of the nurses because ............. is good. Because. Product placement? Everywhere on the cross (crucif?). If you believe in a Christian and very easily agree, you can enjoy this movie. If you love this movie, you really need to get out of it.
