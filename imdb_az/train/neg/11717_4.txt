Many topics or parts of the story are identical to Leon, and then the other parts are perceived as other films, but I have a familiar feeling about the whole movie. It was nice to watch, but that could have been! If the story is more original. The theme is small girl, the worst killer from Leon, just tweaked a bit. The opening scenes are really good :-) It's strange that people are fighting in the kitchen, in films :-). The biggest problem was to remember what parts of Nikon were Leon, and if they were French or American. If you do not see Leo it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> When you love this movie, I can advise Leon. <br /> <br /> Thank you / Rick
