Certainly, many people have such a similarity, but I found Jane Russell's forgetfulness and a few memorable music numbers, especially the codswallop that infiltrates, infantilising, and reasonably attacked (but later has an inventive dip). I'm not deceived by Monroe - she was playing a terrible blond, but she's just dumb. Russell is not quite convincing when she never claims to have been in the gymnasium, but she is beautiful. People are not interested in surprise, as it is a trick. It's not a betrayal, but I'm afraid that if it's a classic, God will help us all.
