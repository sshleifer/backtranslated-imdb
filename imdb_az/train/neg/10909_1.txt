This is a very bad movie. I laughed one or two times and the story was given to me! Maybe it's a funny joke, it's stupid and it's boring. Through the short film, I fell asleep and wondered when it was over. <br /> <br /> Nobody behaves as a person, everyone is insane and ridiculous. Rob Schneider, who acts as an animal, is not something to pay. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Tough, movie. From the very beginning, we thought it would be better; but even worse. Stupid, all the way up to the end. I left the theater and remembered the film forever. <br /> <br /> The writer and co-founder of this film is Simpsons TV writer, but it's The Simpsons (which sucks !!!)
