In the early 80's. There is a suspicious old-looking group. And there is a maniac stalking around. Yes, this slasherville. <br /> <br /> This movie is called Pranks. Why Pranks Called? I did not have the best of ideas. The idea of ​​a perfect game is not just a great game in a balance, just as someone hit the base with a baseball bar; If it is based on truth, it's actually a lot of trash. <br /> <br /> The film belongs to a group of young people cleaning the bedroom. They know that a psychopath is empty. They are scattered in the dark to fight this development. <br /> <br /> Pranks are a bad slasher movie. The DVD version I looked at was one of Vipco's. It looks like a fair piece of violence. DVDs make it even more meaningless, because it's a waste of time-consuming movie. Slasher completes only bad for movies and videos.
