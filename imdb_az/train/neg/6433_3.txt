It is difficult to find a film that looks like a political devil king of Senator Joe McCarthy's still a vast mythology. Boyle (like Joe) is a complicated, but historically inaccurate description of the Wisconsin Senator, cartoon McCarthy accepts many as real. <br /> <br /> Meredith is as good as always, just like the intelligent Army lawyer, Joseph Welch, who dropped McCarthy in the Army's hearings in 1954. <br /> <br /> McCarthy and Cohn were concerned about the dangerous situation. In the Army and in 1954 Army hearings, in the cigarette used by the Army, McCarthy and Cohn tried to get mutual benefits for the staffer, the committee investigated began to be used to escape security breaches. , David Schine, while serving. <br /> <br /> The film is a polemic based on a broad agenda that has been spreading to many people for decades, and the "red dread" is basically fake, and McCarthy, HUAC, and so on. they have always gone from wrong targets, innocent liberals, accusing them of danger and / or security, violate constitutional rights, munist. People who know very little about the issue are still convinced that McCarthy and the "red dread" are so far back in the wrong way - Clooney's Murrow hagia is an example. Bad information has spread, people have not swallowed it. The UK's "The Guardian" newspaper recently described Budd Schulberg as "Hollywood's writer" by McCarthy as "McCarthy's" as McCarthy, "denying McCarthy's" Hollywood as a HUAC head ". and did not show little interest in Hollywood-type policies, whose research was restricted to the US government's weapons alone. <br /> <br /> Mythologically unreasonable about the "Red Dreams" At the moment, if McCarthy and the United States do not estimate the size of the US and US spies, it will be difficult for the public to make mistakes. Former Soviet and US government documents have already exploded. <br /> <br /> One day, indeed, some really brave Hollywood spirit will capture a film telling the truth that American men and women have secretly assisted Stalin and applying the evil system of the government. In the Western world, maybe Joe McCarthy I can give my career accurate, but I will not breathe. Until then, the famous idea, which is familiar to the media, is this mythical, drunken liar ... "Tail gunner Joe".
