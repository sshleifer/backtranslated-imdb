The film is a common twist. Eighty-two actress and actress Salman Khan has a head of meat to attract only female audiences. The story is a crap. The characters are very bad sketched. Explains the story that is not available. Not editable to speak. Ajay is like a devious rock star ... it's a dream. The film drags to the decadence point. About Arjun It is absurd to have Manna come to London, to love her lover and play in Wembley (regardless of Wimbley's dubbing). It is very painful to watch Salman Khan's move to the top level or to be fraudulent. I remember seeing the good movies from Producer Vipul Shah, but not one of them. As you can see, all the best managers are falling to the Box Office mania ... Mumbai has created Media Morons. This is another movie on the "Want" line with a singer like Salman Khan, who is not in the Best Indian Cinema. Titanic is Winter Cruise, so it's good for Indian Cinema. In a positive note - I love Asin's character as Bharatnatyam, then the teacher dances in the Western style.
