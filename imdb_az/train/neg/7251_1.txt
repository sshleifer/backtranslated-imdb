I am announcing all of the great westerners! Bright first effort! I'm not sure what a good movie is, but I have to do something different. If you believe in great western or good movies in any genre, nothing has happened in this movie! The player was poor at least and could not care less about each of the characters, making the whole movie groundless. it was too great for storyteller producers and they should try their hands to pull down low-budget trash as you look at FACT or FICTION programs on science-fiction issues. <br /> <br /> Please look elsewhere if you're looking for a good movie, a great western, or even half an hour and a half.
