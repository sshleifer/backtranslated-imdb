I love hard work, but it's really horrible. The player is naked, the script is bad and the atmosphere is unavailable. Plan is as follows: a deformer gardener Charlie Puckett kills people in a small American city. This is not true - this is plot. It's original, eh! The movie "Night brings Charlie" is not strangely enough, if the film will not be scary, at least bloody. Considering all the costs of this cheap piece debris. If you want to see some good slasher flicks called "Silent", "The Burning", "The Prowler", "Just Before Dawn" or "Humongous" - do not waste the precious time with this waste of time.
