Well, first of all, if you check the Zombies uprising as if it were a very early dead Dead (1968) movie, forget it. This is more psychologically about the "zombies", which does not only consider their will, but also implies the will of others. The "zombies" here are largely metaphors for commitment to a state or authority, such as at least during the war. <br /> <br /> During the First World War, the "French Cambodian" quintet heard strange stories about zombie - so-called Angkor Wat, zombies - and zombie armies fairy tales to eliminate enemies easily. Armand Louque (Dean Jagger) brings a priest who knows the secrets of the robbery, but he will not speak. Thus, Louque is the head of an international military contingent at Angkor Wat in an archaeological expedition to detect the mystery of the zombie and destroy the information that has a chance to "wipe the white race" before the zombies. <br /> <br /> Strange things about the revolt of the zombies seem to have been decided by the writer / director Victor Halpery to change the game plan while writing a script. The film begins as a zombie / military metaphor, and maybe it has adventure elements, but after about 15 minutes the gear changes and turns into a more triangular story of love. <br /> <br /> Halper's will and power (and Nietzsche "will have power") with an subtext. The film is interesting at this level, but the script and editing are very small. <br /> <br /> This is one more old film that I will not be surprised if there are no missing images, especially when talking about a scene dialogue, even though some of them are even edited or cut. <br /> <br /> In the middle of a romantic story, Halper's zombie continues to touch the subject, but zombie material means little. Louque discovers the secret of the zombie, but it does not pay much attention to the audience. Halper has begun using the 1932 White Zombie movie overlapping images of Bela Luko, but does not reveal anything to what it has to do with it. There are huge gaps in the area, including the story of life. The promising, exciting characters on the front wheels disappear for a long time. <br /> <br /> If you are a great admirer of the old B-B, the Zombies Revolt can be worth watching at least once. all this is not bad and if you have a good idea, you can create an interesting story in your mind to fill all the gaps. But this is the second time I've just seen this movie just five years ago, and I can not remember anything about it - it's not entirely memorable.
