Somewhere, on this site, someone wrote that you need to read them to get the best version of Jane Austen's works. I agree with that. However, we love the adaptation of great literature, and this writer's holidays, without good writers, remind the actors that their role is difficult to bring to life. Jane Austen's current version of PERSUASION shows us what to do when you are not a good base for a well-written adaptation. This version has not been compared to Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. This version retains the essence of the era and the limitations of heroes (except for a strange parade and kissing on the street street). In 2007, an Twitty Anne appearing on an anthropomaniac will be shown. Considering how the other heroes were drawn by Austen's beautiful characters with a few carefully selected simplifications, a crime was not much developed. The sequence of events that are meaningful in the novel has been completely removed, and Anna's bedroom, Mrs Smith, and her poor schoolmates, walk around the Hamam. Captain Wentworth's character and intelligence force, Rupert Penry-Jones, did not write to Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds was able to convey more and more with an eye and much more than P-J could not do with his pose. Generally, the 2007 version was a disappointment. This novel dropped a costly melodrama, which was disputed. If they want to bring our contemporary emotional to Austen's work, they must do what Shakespeare's adaptation is: adapt it to the present day. At least "Bride & Prejudice" was removed from history and local settings and was fun to watch as "Clueless". This is not PERSUZI, but they will not be able to say anything else.
