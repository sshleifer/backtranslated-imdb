After good watch, this is not a bad movie, I can say, yes people are worse, there are a few good points in the movie, watching drunken teenagers, horrifying deaths, and a great deal to win the favorite-looking rats eating some science experiences The rats to eat these drunken dumps, which I could expect personally, a drunken timber, a cunning doctor, and yes, absolutely no shame, a girl in thong inner dress, an uncompromising jocks, i can'nt personally, was a good premise, The first part of the film, despite the scientific explantation about the rats, was a small back story, but I think it was almost destroyed when the drunken horny teenagers came to the game, in my opinion, the rats were lost, the name Brenda was too fake, a cGi rats, it was like a guy dressed in a wardrobe suit, this pretty shocked, dumb id i, but not completely afraid,
