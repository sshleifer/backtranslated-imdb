This film, II, escaped from a camp in Germany. About the British War Soldiers from the World War II. <br /> <br /> I'm hoping to dig the "The Wooden Horse" hopelessly. The subject was excited, could have diminished and adrenaline fuels, but the "Wooden Horse" was explicitly explained. It is a collection of straight and bad event events with no stop and excitement. The first half soldiers declare that soldiers have won a tunnel, but the events are not so clear that there are enough mistakes and close shavings to make shade. The latter half of the film is even worse; only a single cat and mouse move from one place to the next. And the characters can talk a bit and the action movie can be more action! I was disappointed by the "The Wooden Horse", which lost the potential to become a great film.
