The musical version of the "Les Miserables" applies to the same difficulty as Oliver. Instead of composing the game's settings in stylistic times, they simply wrote Broadway-type melodies that were simply unidiomatic and stylistically curved. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, do not blend well with some sunny sources that play a role in dramatist's obvious brutality and unusual activity. <br /> <br /> Oliver's boycotting does not help the issues: at the front of the timber and very valuable, there is less than anything here. <br /> <br /> Faqin fulfills the traditional rules fairly well, but melodies that are forced to read, have little time in circulation. <br /> <br /> Two huge production numbers, "Who Will Buy" and "Think" are inconsiderate, despite all the kitchen sink thrown. <br /> <br /> The darkness, despair, and immorality of most of the romantic romance do not bother to sex and choreography. Although I consider the novel to be classic, I have to admit that I am concerned about Mr Dickens' consciousness, as he has to propagate a negative vibration in his works. This may be because of the longevity and the joyful personal life of a regretful person. <br /> <br /> All the talents of this production on the camera or on the back can overcome the non-constructive nature of the material. All this is an anxiety for me. <br /> <br />
