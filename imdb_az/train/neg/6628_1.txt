The scale would be happier if it were negative. Sushmita was beautiful when she saw her and Nicholas Kotar√≠ had a bright future, but the producer and director destroyed any taste in this story. The choice of openings, the choice of lighting, and the good thing are afraid to remember what the story is. Well, if songs and dances did not lead to the fact that your ears were not cut off at first. The film was prepared twice in about 1.25 hours and was as good as the "Seven Samurai", but the director and writer did not go to this city, and even the "urban population" wanted finally to find a backbone. This film is unsuccessful at many levels: editing, writing, photography angles, style, lighting, script - any aspect of this movie - it was common - probably the food that was eaten was bad. This bad thing has been seen when I have not seen Spider-Man (Bollywood) movies for 6 years.
