Bradykes is responsible for at least two of the most boring and clich√© films I've ever seen - one of them and Camp Blood. <br /> <br /> Toys are terrifying, pressure is crushing, and everything about this movie says "you can do better, seriously". <br /> <br /> I bought it for 1 manat, but remember that you can not afford a 71-minute price. Even in this expensive basement, it would be good to avoid this turkey.
