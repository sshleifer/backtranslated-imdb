If you love the first two movies, I'm sorry that you do not like it. This is really trash and unnecessary plain video, probably television was subsequently made. Still, righteous, but well-known scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family and has his own company, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately, his wife wants to get rid of the sculpture, Wayne is so stupid that her sculpture and herself are excited. his brother. Then he will reduce his wife and brother. Now adults need to find a way to get a bigger outfit. Repeat only one or two new things, namely the other two. a toy car roller coaster, dipping swimming and so on. Pretty poor!
