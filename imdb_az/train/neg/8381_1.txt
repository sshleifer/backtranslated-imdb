Spike Lee, Carl Franklin, Billy Dukes, Denzel, and many other talented black-and-white directors who are credited for their well-deserved credit. Once upon a time (15 years ago) Jim Carrey has Wayans Brothers, a very lively television show "Living Colour", which began his career with others. Now we have the folly of replacing humor and overall out gags (toilet humor) as a standard operating procedure. People may not be as described in the "little man". Is a baby full of toothpicks and tattoos perceived to be just monthly? The baby comes with a shade of five o'clock, so it is getting darker. The baby came into sexual relationship with her husband 's wife, Darryl' s return .Oh, yes, that 's just fun. 'Little Man' as a master criminals is the planet's most stupid place. She holds a large stolen rock in a woman's bag and then has to follow her. Co-star Chazz Palminter, why Chazz offers the best line: "I'm surrounded with morons." Without a Chuck Jones cartoon, based on Baby Buggy Bunny, without a loan. It's too stupid to even be laughing away. Damon Wayans, a hint of how bad this film was, emerged on Jay Leno the other night before the BAT awards, and he recalled this terrible film. Hollywood stops green lightning garbage from Wayans Brothers. When they accused white men of all probability.
