this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I love Japanese movies and the 80,000 euros dragon movie of the same director is a masterpiece. In fact, I would like to love this movie - it's easy and easy to tell, that the story is a terrifying actor. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> The effects that the director uses - such as the overwhelming impact of a continuous blow and slow motion - foolish-bogglingly slow and adding to my growing nerves that the actors are overacting wonderfully. was a result of a lot of additions, which were absolutely unnecessary, as an hour spent to cut off statue sculptures in ease and declare not to worship anything. added something to this area. a partner Japanese movie buff and I was always checking in at constant time. we did not believe that this movie was terrible as it was. and the final was terrible. I thought the director would at least try to reward the viewer to watch it, but, unfortunately, I made a mistake.
