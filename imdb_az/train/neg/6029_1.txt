<br /> <br /> If you are concerned about where the majority of the theories of conspiracy and paranoid ideas about the UN, Israel and international issues are concerned, this is not an unusual Hollywood movie, but a biblical link . Instead, this film was developed by a company that has a political and religious agenda (Cloud Ten Photos). As a movie, the latter results appear more and more on TV program clips (complete with lighting through church windows while playing family prayers and boards). For key audiences, it's hard to believe, but many people just believe as they say in the movie. And maybe, the film is important. Probably not a short description of the strange ideas of many citizens. So you see it as a social / cultural document. If you are uninterested in any media, you should not be warned about the negligent attempts to propagate and manipulate the film.
