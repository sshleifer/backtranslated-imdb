Unhinged is followed by the typical area of ​​the early 80's slasher trend. Dangerous Young Girls. I have to give the filmmaker a helicopter for a few previous trips, in fact, you think the quality of the production will be a second. Watching the "unhinged" was like holding the warm-up of the amateur player class. Some of the heaviest, worst-burned, overlapping scenes are played with the gusto of a Valium overdose. I wondered if the players were not putting cards on the camera, and that the actresses would not constantly change their eyes. Two main girls were clearly talented for the obvious T & A factor. Laurel Munson is as exciting as watching the main chick Terry paint dry. The two naked scenes create a teenage excitement. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle, the naked / creepy daughter and mother chickens, were stranded to compete for the worst Operations. Long stays, strange expressions, accent on wrong words, everything is there, and those who love bad movies are a joy for us. The scenes can suddenly move away from black through the Mack truck. The cartoon lightning collapsed between the fires without even worrying to show the heavens. Eight people look at the eye. But I know it grew up on me. I'm sorry for that. I wanted to hug him, boo-boos kiss and make it even better. There is nothing in the end for the damage, but I also shouted. I have a theory about all the "forbidden" consciousness and I hope everyone who chooses to do this is doing material abuse and humor. Try it otherwise.
