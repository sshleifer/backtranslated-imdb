Shiri Appleby is the smallest recommendation that Elle, a well-known buffy clone, is a devilish girl. But I'm going to myself, and you see Lilith Adam as the first woman to be God's friend. But all uppity is a bad feminist, as long as God escapes from Edender. A secret command known as Fath, but not killing him, is now a scientist who injects Lilith's blood, freeing it from the above-mentioned Buffy-Clone, which is forced to fight with a madman Lilith (now well-publicized) with amnesia. <br /> <br /> If the previous paragraph sounds like noisy, that's it. The film also does not appear to be a laugh about this for a movie with a plot ending with mat, general, and theological. This bargain cellar was a pilot of a lousy-CGIed movie probably a failure. <br /> <br /> My Value: D-DVD Extras: Writer / Director's comment Platt and writer Chris Regina; gallery of galleries; Video Effects Examples: Before and After (and will also bring some trailers, but do not cover DVDs for other movies with a "stupid idea") "<br/> DVD-ROM Add-ons: Final photo scripts and Deleted scenes transcript in PDF format
