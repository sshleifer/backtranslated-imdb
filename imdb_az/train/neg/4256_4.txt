The promotion is really a step from the original film's story and special effects. Jason Scott Lee is considered as a vampire hunter (if you remember him, from the movie Dragon, Bruce Lee Story). Jason London helps a child with a girlfriend like Luke. Long ago Dracula's body was stolen. Diane Neal is as good as a woman who takes care of Dracula's body and Stephen Billington is great as Dracula himself. Gerard Butler made the original film count by giving a better performance. Roy Scheider performs a castle in this movie, and he does a decent job as a teacher of Jason Scott Lee's character. This trilogy is the second result and a good start. The last film is in the air when the series does not leave a good note.
