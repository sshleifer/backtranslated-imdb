The film itself is not too bad; many comments have paid attention to the obvious defects of the script, but may have to wait. Indeed, it gives me what I like, even though people like Justin Timberlake are filming for films and, moreover, for such films. Before I watched it, I did not hear the name of a man, but I understood very clearly that I was just anxious. The sound is twisted, it's a bad violation of the Legolas, the posture is terrible, and it can not even properly coincide. He said that I was glad that he jumped out of the disco because I hoped he would only be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey. I've been very bad. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> .
