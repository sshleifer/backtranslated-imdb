First, to give you an idea of ​​my taste in films ... <br /> <br /> Comedies that love me in 2007: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Glory Blades 2007 Comedies I hated: Evan Uluca, Brothers Suleiman, Successful Chuck <br /> <br /> After coming to the 20 minute mark, I did not follow my first instinct and have to close the Hot Bar. I knew this movie would not make me laugh at once. The scenario is completely scary - I did not know how this monster reached the 6th grade in IMDb. <br /> <br /> This is not a relationship with Will Farrell, and it is clear that Andy Samberg can not do much more. 5-10-minute sketch on YouTube or SNL. Ian McShane and Isla Fisher did not know how to make this movie ... they owe it or not. I do not know if it will be a silent movie, but at least it would be funny. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ This It's the 4th movie I've ever been forced to get to level 1/10.
