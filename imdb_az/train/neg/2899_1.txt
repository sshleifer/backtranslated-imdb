Serious hell is a movie about what's just foolish, I'll give you 0, but the worst 1 you can go to "terrible" is seriously not watching this movie, but the guys from 10 to 7 do not know how bad paradise is with you , I can make a better movie than this, I can hire other unemployed people, I'll make a better movie than this, this movie was very bad, I will not watch a movie that Steve Carrel re-played, the line below can be downloaded from the internet or I do not waste time leasing, it's the worst film of the worst century movie ever, but I'll give it a second
