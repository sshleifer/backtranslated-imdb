In this film, many things about Brenda Song's character are wrong. I do not think the girl is a bad player - I was not honest. I believe he's got a weak line. <br /> <br /> It just shows that he should be a "loose, rich girl" and that he is playing on TV, though it's funny, he can not have a dry smile here. <br /> I really did not know what to expect when I really sat down to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> The film was afraid to start. Wendi's reaction to Shen was absolutely natural. That is, a man who claims to be a reincarnated monk should order a medallion and feel how he is pursuing your claim that you have to fight the "great evil" and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know this movie is completely artistic, but it still has a structure in Chinese culture. As you can see, Wendy's entire "warrior" was a woman. If I were wrong, you corrected me, but I suspected the monks would be just fine. Certainly, they may have worked in some way, but they did not give any explanation. <br /> <br /> Therefore, they have been helping for the most severe attempts by women in Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> However, let's continue. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character is more unbearable as the film continues. Yes, he is adolescent and is approaching home. So who wants to fight badly during homecoming? When the problem begins to show itself "bad," Wendy does not seem as confused as he should be. He is extremely careless - even for someone like him. He is not interested in his teachings. I'll use it as an example of this conversation Åžen: "If you do not win this fight you will get worse and everything will be fine". Wendy: "Let's talk about pressure, well ... let's talk about something else." Yes, come Wendy. Let's dance when you need to study properly. Sure, of course, allows him, but his character is an excuse. <br /> <br /> When talking about it, he said that he was better than he had cooperated with, and he should not train. <br /> <br /> <p> Sheen told Wendy that she was destined to die for her as well as for her grandmother. <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy's actions more spotless. <br /> <br /> As a screenwriter writer, Vendee's return home and this "great battle" is the same day. Do you know what Wendy did? Need to Find Even? Yes, he will go to war, because when he tried to leave for homecoming, the monks (Shen were trapped in the body of coaches and teachers, saying that he was fighting a strange man) told him that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br/> <br /> Sen went alone to fight, so he went to rescue him. <br /> <br /> We first see a semi-confrontation. Finally, the big evil goes out of Wendy's homecoming's opponent and embodies the fragmentary parts of his former fighters. <br /> <br /> Do not ask questions. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Wendy becomes a "panic". Then Shan goes and protects him from this man - forgive me for forgetting my long Chinese name and keen to kill himself. <br /> <br /> Wendy keeps shan, who desires to raise the real thing to a high level. <br /> <br /> He shook the title of the article. <br /> <br /> Now, Wendy is very far away, and she has grown very fast. <br /> <br /> Because it was his "fate" and I would not give an excuse for saying that he had "power inside". <br /> <br /> Has he ever been healed? No, the worst ... Has he ever been resurrected? So Sen has risen from the dead. Then Wendy and he fights with that guy. <br /> <br /> He easily loses his way. The worst part is jumping on one another and at the same time it is destroyed forever. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> # 2: What a Victim? Did not he go home? Because the girl did not sweat and even blood flowed. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> , I made a movie based on my comments. A part of the critic, in any case, breaks something. You are definitely looking bad, but if so, pay attention to it. <br /> <br /> Many of this movie is bad, but something funny happens when you never really expect to be too big. <br /> It's almost as good. I do not know if anyone said that it was nothing, he would not be afraid to watch it.
