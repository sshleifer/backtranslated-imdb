Devil Hunter acknowledged that DPP is in the "Video Nasty" list but has not really been. Many films in the list of God (and DPP) are only known reasons, and this is not an argument of the gang; there are not many of the bans that are banned here ... it's a shame, because we did not believe there was ever a "shopping list." The site actually gives the film a decent base - or at least a better base than at least one of the most obscene movies - and an actress kidnapped and dragged into the Amazon Forest. A hunter is then hired to find him, but he is guided by a man who is called "the devil" along the way. The film is whirling for about eighteen minutes, and there are really no really cool scenes. Jess Franco is a real shame that ends up winning such films, because people have clear talents; such as Diabolical Dr Z, Venus Furs, Faceless and his films, but unfortunately his best films are only stones in mosquitoes and Devil Hunter is part of the shit. I've seen this movie entirely because I've seen everything on the DPP list (just go two more!) So I want to know, and so I've seen the majority of people I've seen. But if you are not looking for Nasties; There is no reason to really worry about it.
