I did not like this movie. I thought the actor was not very good and the story was boring. Saves a 20 year old computer day? I thought it was a little farther away for a movie. <br /> <br /> His shame came from the original film of the 80s, rather than surrendered much longer than expected. This movie could have been a 21st-century version of the old film. Do not watch this movie you want to watch! <br /> <br /> Even if the older computer did not come up to the agenda for the day, it would be a very unpleasant flick.
