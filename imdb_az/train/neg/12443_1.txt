- I realized that the occupation of Star Creatures was meant to be the parody of the 50s fantasy films. I understand that none of them is accepted seriously. My problem is that none of them works. A parody should be funny and it's not alone. I'm not in the process for a whole job, so much smile. Generally, I am enjoying myself, but I did not find any entertainment in the Star Occupation. <br /> <br /> - I knew that I was having trouble since the beginning. With one of the lamest gags that can imagine the appearance of two "stars" - a water hose that can not even control that it takes two years. These come as Bowery Boys wannabes. Why not everyone moves on Bowery Boys and wants me persona mime out of me. Shortly after the sad start, movies are like comic chases, Indian, vegetable men, decoder rings, and other unfinny bits. <br /> <br /> I've already got a double DVD with the Bee girls occupation. This film is the Academy Award winning more than the Star Creatures occupation.
