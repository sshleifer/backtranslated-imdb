True! An average of 9 people for some people, but less than 12 years! When I first looked at this video I was 11 years old and I did not see the quality of my animated film in this kind of youth or the classic characters we love. Only 2D here is everything! Belle, I agree, is not even beautiful, but a woman with a straight look with her colorful skin does not wear the same bright blue dress with any seductive dress, and the wardrobe at least spoils. If I do not want to listen every day, her ears can bleed! Lumiere was genuine and elegant both in the original and in the Christmas edition, but here she is a woman, a mischievous tweet! Cogsworth, despite being a miserable homeowner, is famous, a complete shadow and the most characteristic that I do not want to say! She always closes the terrific sticks that are so tough to her, and because of this clock, it must be used to come back to the unforgettable two films in a timely fashion! Poor, poor Mrs Potts was not brought by Angela Lansbury (one of my favorite classic actresses), but Anne Rogers, who holds no character from Mrs. Potts, has no fault for her! He did not do his best! When the animal starts to shake, a microphone sounds a fake fake, with no extra rush, screaming or banging. I know this is a third feature only after two films, but of course it will not be good, but I'm sure that more contributors will not damage the Disney artists who have such a remarkable result over the years animated styles. This is good, I think, sometimes, sometimes, even though I'm fit. It's very difficult to recommend that you read it, because it depends on your age, but what you are talking about can not be a thing of the past about the great movies! In my video, the text on the back cover said "do not brag about bright animation!" This is a nice little flick, but also very weak for something, and in other words, these 3 words should be saved for the next release of the original!
