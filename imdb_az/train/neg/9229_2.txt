This is a film about filming. Such films may be entertaining, but they need an item. It did not happen here, I'm scared. Koppola did not inherit her father's skills, unfortunately (she did not even have a sister who could shoot a movie). Let's see: The leading male actor, like a director, has a frozen sword and is somewhere in the same voice, the leading female actress does not give a testimony to the actress, Changes, plot maybe with a direct linkage element, the movie in the film's ideas should be older than the paleolithic rocks ... Is that enough? <br /> <br /> I am sorry for every moment I watched this movie. A walk with the dog is a great fun for this incredible naked film. As if Fran√ßois Truffaut's effort was driven by Dick Ceydi ... <br /> <br /> Brazil, some of the other classic SF movies? You really should be joking ...
