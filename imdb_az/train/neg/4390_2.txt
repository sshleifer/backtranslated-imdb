The TV guide described the SEVERED TIES field as follows: "An acute arm stops a trial" so I thought immediately about a goal that would have an idea as in this thought, or a hand or a body like someone's body parts transplant acquired. Both organs are tested and tested, or are more precisely tired and tested, as I would be wondering how producers would bring the story closer. In fact, at the beginning of the film, I was thinking of making an arthouse film like PI for B & W photography use, but manufacturers seemed tired after 20 seconds, and decided to make a splash comedy similar to Budheyb Olie. I say very little to say that I did not like "I" and did not like my beloved beloved, and these films use exceptional rubber while screaming for third world condominiums.
