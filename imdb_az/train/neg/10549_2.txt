The film industry is a difficult task, because decisions are made and everybody has a personal life. This delicate attempt to make a "delicate" film about the film is a very original essay. Anouk Aimée and Maximilian Schell have no better proof of the difficulty of the industry without being strictly attached to this belief. Concepts are composed of the speakers: "Do I have to make a studio movie that is a lot of money, or do I have to make an indie item and be faithful to my artistic commitment?" "Please do the last, please." Or: "Our relationships are not only professional, but also specific, is it a very complicated situation to manage?" "Yes, this is my darling". Insipid dialog boxes include palm trees, hotel lobbies, and American movie posters (non-American film presence in Croisette). Recurring sleep sessions are inevitable, and 100 minutes of film feels like age. Jenny Gabrielle does not give a glamorous idea of ​​justifying his presence in the framework.
