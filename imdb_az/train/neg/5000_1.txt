This is probably the worst excuse for television programs, oh, I do not know, what is it now? Nothing has happened in this ridiculous series. Sometimes Britney and Kevin are drawn by themselves, but there is no good detail in their personal lives. In most cases, foolish, jockey treats small debates and white debris. Look, I love Britney's music as the next baby, but this show is a clean breeze for a Britney-like nation, watching its clip on its nails (yes, it's a real episode). These two disciples were thankful to God, for they had mixed one another. This show is TOXIC!
