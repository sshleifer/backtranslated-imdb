The polyester was the first John Water movie I saw, and I have to say that this is the worst movie I've ever mentioned. <br /> <br /> "Talent" in the water group I'm sure he tried to eat, and Waters wanted to say the lines he wrote. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Everything about the movie is terrible, moving, camera, edited and 300 lb by transvestite Divine The story about a woman played was totally absurd. <br /> <br /> So you are like a very funny or poor Francine. Her son is a decisive and compressing woman who is not suspicious in a grocery store. Her daughter is the most cunning prostitute in the city. <br /> <br /> Francinein's only friend, Edith Massey, is the worst actress ever played. <br /> <br /> Edith looks and sounds that she reads a chess card and has not seen a script before filming it. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Later, he lives happily.
