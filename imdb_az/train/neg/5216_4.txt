'Metamoprism' is a story of a respected young scientist at a local college, studied by college financiers. <br /> <br /> This was my first thought after the film's subsequent results. "It's not good at the middle of the eighties, it's not bad." Of course, in 1990, I understood that it had reduced it to '4', but decided to keep it at a moderate level. <br /> <br /> Metamorphic appears to be a good movie trying to get out of the hopeless way several times. It's a miracle, not functioning, largely empowered. You can even see the casual glimpse of a modest quality. Pacing is a big problem with the movie. After thinking about watching for ninety minutes, I realized I was watching for just an hour. Reeves reminded me of the nature of Matt Dillon's "Wild Things." The heroine of the female is OK, but does not always distinguish itself. Here's a 'rogue girl' role and the actress can do with her, but it does not seem too obvious. There is a child actor that the director can not decide whether he is cheerful or strange. <br /> <br /> Pacing, as I said, is the worst problem with this movie, Power Ranger blush up to a final battle with the bad guy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Once again, say: 'Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack'. He will not bring you back, and there is nothing to buy from you.
