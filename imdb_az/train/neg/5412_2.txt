Pyare Mohan can be included in the blacklist of one of the worst films ever created by humanity. The film, which has emerged after the extraordinary achievement of Gara, is a culprit of a disabled brotherhood. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are people with disabilities simply cartoons. Despite the fact that she reflects the betrayal and feelings of a woman with a disability and has given her part of the world, Pyare Mohan shows the monkey, which looks like two desperados who have a disability and who have no difficulty in bashing the world to protect their love. Anu Malik's music is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi, a promising starter with Saitia, unfortunately, loses balls in Indian cinema. Fardeen Khan was not acknowledged as an unacceptable actor and deserved to be banned in the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are pretty good people in the nightly troubles in Thialnd and there is no one to save them - except for the above-mentioned desperados. Boman Iran is quite acceptable, like the tyrant Don Tony. Avoid movies if possible.
