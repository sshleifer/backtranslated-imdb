The first look of 2010 is included in The Blue 2: The Reef. The story is about two divers, played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort, who want to explore the hidden treasures under a local reef. One day after the discovery, several couples from David Anders and Marsha Thomason are approaching. They tell the seafarers to try to get them to explore the reefs and to find a rare document about Columbus's hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> Next day, they will not find anything in the bottom of the bottom and after a day of diving. Over the past few days, and two mercenary divers have found that they will kill a large part of a huge deadly area that can not be saved. They were hired to find two large containers. One has a nuclear reactor and the other is a nuclear power plant. <br /> <br /> In the film there is a story about another person (brother's brother) trying to burn something with his girlfriend. this story was a waste of time, which included a lot of steam sex scenes amongst couples where it was a complete waste for me and no need to be shown. <br /> <br /> Besides, there are some good underwater photos in the movie, and the colors are well-nourished for the reason they have 4 children. Blue 2 is just one step further. If none of the original gamers or characters go back, it has a calm area, stupid characters and a dull peak.
