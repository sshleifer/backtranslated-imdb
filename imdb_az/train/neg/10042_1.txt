Such a long-awaited film .. But I was disappointed by my friends who went to see me and the movie on the first day. It appeared to be a motion picture of a trailer, but it turned out to be a life and comedy (a bad comedy). One thing that is worthy of appreciation is that it's acted by professional actors, making some part of the film very good. I do good, but I do not think it can save the film .. India was shot in a beautiful way. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) They all saturated with color. Nevertheless, the way in which I felt the inner beauty of these places was to find places where these places were and where I could go. <br /> <br /> The sequence of the action was very chestnut, and no one could do it. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR/> > <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Instead, Akki (akshay kumar) used very well, but they did a lot better. <br /> <br /> The 90s have had better animated scenes (the first area where the car falls has to be 'flying better' should be the way to the lake. ). <br /> And for about 20-30 minutes on behalf of the movies, viewers are sure to make sure I've forgotten the name of the movie.
