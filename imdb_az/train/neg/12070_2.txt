I've bought one of the 50 movie collection collections of Horror Legacy and still look at them to find a good HORROR movie. Sometimes some of Satan's Devil's or Devil's Bat or Big Alfred Hitchcock's films (some of them are horrific, just because Hitchcock focuses on some horrors and suspense), but it looks the other time <br /> <br /> <strong> Like the Ada Monster they put films and they are easily forgotten and because they can not accept the truth that needs to be done. <br /> <br /> So we're a Westing game idea. Rich, but brutal and insulting father played by Carradine (this is a standing feature) and has left her heritage to her children and servants who still hate it. Carradine always performs a good performance as always, but he leaves mostly silent writing and flashback sequences, leaving us to sit with mediocre / terrible spots. The remainder is superior to the scenes. Considering that these 70s are an independent film, lighting and effects are quite limited. It is difficult to create a lot of tension that the viewer does not see as good at some scenes. Some of the actors like Igor and Elga, like slaves, are at least at a loss, and at the end I am ashamed to admit that I am still abandoned for a negative fool, but still a little happier, it is quite clear that it is not enough to improve the quality of the film. You do not intend for the symbols to be unhappy or tyranny or psychotic, but it leads to a new level and makes many unwatchable. Death scenes are pretty bad and the decline is not really there. You will probably enjoy 20 movie packages called "Chilling", which includes films like House at Haunted Hill, Horror Shop with Jack Nicholson and Night of Living Dead. This is a good.
