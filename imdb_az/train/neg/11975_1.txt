How did this talk for a while on television? This is horror. Someone wants to hit me. It's fake than the 1940s fantasy films. There is a better stroke than watching this nonsense. When I go out for the first time, I watch him and remember him. I thought it could have been interesting, and then I saw how completely insanely, ridiculously foolish. It was very bad that I really took my pocket knife and put my hand on the table. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch all these and other reality shows, they are the cancellation of the network and the elimination of a quality program that requires some ideas for creating.
