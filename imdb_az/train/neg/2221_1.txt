We're sorry, but when it came out in 1978, that could have been terrible, but it does not just stop in the modern era. The only exciting scene in the entire movie is Michael's opening scene where his sister Judith is wearing her Halloween mask. The most lucky moment of the whole film is when the parents need to see the son killed his daughter. The film will downgrade it and it will not last for about fifteen minutes, but soon after, the audience has lost all interest in the story. However, there is no character development, and people are not always so great, though Laurie is such an exceptional hero. I do not want everyone to be afraid of this movie, but if you want a great horror film, you can watch the Shine or Rosemary's Baby. These are two of the best two films ever made. Halloween, of course, is not their queue. Roger Ebert has given these four stars, I do not believe that this movie can never be so high.
