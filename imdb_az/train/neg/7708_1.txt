The only aspect of this movie is that it's the least favorite celluloid garbage dump, a single line of an agent trying to inflate tomato-eating tomatoes by wearing a tomato suit: "Would anyone ask for a ketchup?" I urge everyone to use this movie sedatively with sleep disorder; better than demarol's overdose.
