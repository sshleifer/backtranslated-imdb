You just know that John Carradine (when reading a synthesis of script and plot) on a funeral funeral within just 5 minutes of the movie will not go well with a movie. The story is the final will and promise of his character. His property is divided between four children and servants. Children will share $ 136 million, but if one dies, that share will be divided between the remaining parts. If all the children die, then they are divided among the slaves. In order to be consistent, they must live in a family property within a week. <br /> <br /> There is very little logic about the nature of the deans. They are a powerful and serious family, but the real problem begins with the drowning of the dog. From John Carradine's noise, we expect Maciavellian cat and mouse to be the cause of this movie's ending. <br /> <br /> This journey is painfully slow and meaningless. Sitting around people, playing in the pool, darting, fighting with "fish pots", dramatic conversations with silk cravats men, regular collisions, false circus music, strange flashbacks expression, fault-german, horror aesthetics of 4th grade and dramatic intolerance. This leads to an unexpected and unpleasant end. You will still be happy to be alive, but it can be too great to carry pain alone. <br /> <br /> Share children, share. <br /> <br /> - Celluloid Rehab
