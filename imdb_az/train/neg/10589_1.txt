Universal Soldier: Return is not the worst movie ever. No, this honor must go to a movie that is trying to make some kind of statement or to try to get some artistic legends, but it's a pity or an attack. But perhaps, no movie I've ever seen worked so little and returned as a Universal Soldier. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fantastic / moving trailer that does not really offer anything. Imagine that it is as bad as any movie I've seen. The area is terrible and predictable. Special effects are miserable. In short, everyone who is connected to this movie should be ashamed of themselves. USA: Boat introduces cinematic masterpieces that have laid the foundations of the previous Van Damme tariffs. Some movies are very bad, they are good. Tell me you're not one of them. I'm not sure what else to say here. I do not doubt that many people are thinking of seeing this movie, but they are not in the situation yet.
