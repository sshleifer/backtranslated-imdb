Shortly after seeing this movie, I asked the mentality of every actress and actress who played a role. Elizabeth Shue is a spectacular actress, why would she cover such an overrated opportunity? There is a need to provide a loan where the loan is. Some moments in the film were unexpected and very modest, but for Kevin Bacon's character, Sebastian Caine's haste was in trouble. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, male or female.
