Music is a very personal idea that I do not love, is not historical innocence. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abas was the general manager of this operation and was staged. <br /> <br /> Abbu Abas was re-established on board the ship for the release of 50 terrorists in Israeli prisons. One of them was Samir Kuntar, an amazing terrorist who could be found on Google by calling "klinghoffer samir kuntar". Abil Abbas was responsible for many terrorist operations, never with Achile Laura. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < They always emphasize and exaggerate what Israel has done to hurt them because of their horrors. But they never describe the damage the Palestinians have brought to Israel. The film used by the horror of Saber and Shetila (very bizarre!) Uses the images and does not say anything, for example, the common belief that Israel is responsible for anything that the Lebanese army did. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, I was shocked how a person could handle terrorists. adding that the murder of the hostage should not be considered a human being's favor because he is trying to mix 400 innocent hostages against hostage terrorists and is a supporter of Zionism. Imagine how insincere your spouse is, spit on terrorists who hit her and throw her body into the sea. I hope that no one in the world is so cruel (wait)
