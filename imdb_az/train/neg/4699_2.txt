Wow, the Naked Brothers Band. What can I say? Almost this show was just silent. The first point is that they do not have the capability to play instruments. No. 2: They were saying that they were famous in the trade, but they did not hear it before anyone showed it. Look, I do not hate this evil, I'll give it as 10 to 4, but it's worrying me that everyone is such a great talent, and Nat writes profoundly profound words. Deep in my ass! Speaks of heavyweight wrestlers with inner emotions. Wow, what he says on the walls of a bathroom, and it would be much deeper. And they did not recognize themselves, and asked their parents to make a bad show of celebrities and their children. I think it will be canceled soon.
