60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton NBC mini-series (later released as a full length video / DVD), and about the 1960s trapped in the eyes of a white family and a black family. The first half of the film is directed by Dutton's Reverend Willie Taylor, perfectly performing and spreads the story line among families. However, Dutton's character will die from the half and the black family is completely forgotten in the second half of a totally boring, inaccurate and obviously terrible. RATING: From 10 to 4. Unrated (later PG-13 for video / DVD version).
