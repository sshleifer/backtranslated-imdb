There was so much hope for this movie because I really liked the original. Apparently, Disney is trying to perfect the art of malicious flat DVDs. They deserve a razzie. Several, in fact. I thought I was worthy of the thought, but the music was terrible and the story was not better. Great music used in Disney's own films. Mary Poppins, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, Lion King ... even Hercules and the Notre Dame Hunchback. <br /> <br /> I hope this film is not good enough to put it in cinemas. Walt Disney Corporation is not an indicator of the future things.
