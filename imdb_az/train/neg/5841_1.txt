The following spoilers, however, will never read or you will never know the awesome destiny that Rodentz expects to lease all. <br /> <br /> A one-month-long night at a research lab, a major medical breakthrough can cause fatal consequences. The chemical composition for "hunting and destroying" deadly cancer cells was leaked to the building basement from the hazardous waste disposal system. Now, rodents participating in laboratory experiments are not only rats that are transformed into modified species. Biologist, leading biologist, Professor Shultz, found that adding a new enzyme now restores the "hunting and destroying" formula to neutralize the deadly tumor tumors. When the three different degrees of the new mixture are applied to three different rats, and the others inflict the wrong "Waste Hazard", shocking side effects result in a night-time terror ..... right ..... <br /> <br /> Seriously, is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Everything about it sounds like "low budget", horrendous game, some of the worst special effects I've ever seen. The heroes are clichÃ© morons and they act in a foolish, predictable way: just looking for a cat in the dark corridors, looking for cat, falls and falls as the "rats" are flooded in a small room and so on. /> <br /> Although some movies are cheap, this movie really gets a cake. Every corner is cut off, repeating previous shootings, pulling everything to pull the LAB corridors from different angles (it reminds me - why these two are working in a massive building?), A music workshop on a children's workshop and special effects can be given. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the worst part of this rotten bull's meeting - special effects. Just horrendous. The rats produced by the rats are so fake and different at each stage, because the most horrific computers in the film space have been created. And this giant rat costume - OH MY GOD !!!!!!!! Seriously, should we believe that the freaking beany baby is a monster? It's just miserable ........ Well, on the plus side, somebody's budget, some look pretty cool. <br /> <br /> All actors suck. Nobody cares about or knows what they are doing. I spent a lot of time looking at, just take my tip, trash. 1/10. <br /> <br /> About DVD: Transfer is silent, sound is effective, and there is a footprint on the disc with the director and two of his friends. Despite the film being shot, it was a question and comment. Three of these sub-human primordial bones are so stupid that they must be institutionalized before they can hurt themselves or others. I do not want to spend more time on readers or mines because I started to remember more about this movie ..... DVD rating: 1/10.
