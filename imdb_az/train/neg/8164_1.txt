I saw this movie in my real movie theater (perhaps $ 2.00) with my brother and my uncle. I used to think that we were about 11 and 12 years old and really into scary movies. When I was able to choose the movie (and perhaps it did not do it again!), I remember that I was very excited and then disappointed! Not just dull and scary. I recalled that one of the recipe was silver spoons Corky Pigeon, and all this was good, just someone I knew. I've seen poor movies before, and this is always the worst case in my opinion. This is something I can remember, our most earnest, non-intrusive, $ 6 loss of the team and the loss of the movie. I read some of the analyzes that say that the cost of an hour is, and I say, "Each of them," but I do not even bother. It is good that it is not even bad.
