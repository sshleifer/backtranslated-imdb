*** SPOILER *** If you think about watching this movie, read it though it's a waste of time. (By the way, the conspiracy knows so well that when you read it or at least it does not make any difference) <br /> If not Coyote Ugly !! No money for tickets or VHS / DVDs. It's a typical "Chick-Feel-Good-Flick". The area itself is incredibly fragile, the American dream is a ridiculous and unfounded version. A young girl from a small town has achieved great success in New York City. Any depth of the film, such as the "tragic" accident of the father, the "difficulties" associated with Violet's lover, and so on. Some failed attempts failed. McNally (Director) tries to awaken the audience's goodness and does not have the chance to succeed in this attempt to grieve sadly and act accordingly. Particularly, Piper Perabo is totally unsuccessful in one of the "Jersi" fears of singing in front of the audience. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about Coyote Ugly (and quite funny) is John Goodman, who represents the smallest track of the film's hope. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that Jerry Bruckheimer produced this movie. The first "60 seconds have passed" and now ... What happened to such great movies as "Rock" and "John Air"? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Two finger down (3 out of 10).
