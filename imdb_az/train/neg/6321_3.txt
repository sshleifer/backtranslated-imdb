In a million years, I can not betray anyone who wants to watch this movie. If not one of the worst conditions (at least), but basically, it was 20 years old and usually run. Earlier, an actor found out where to find and tried to find it popped up. So yes, because a child does not love nukes, stopped playing a small league, it gives great media attention and a quick solution to the cold war. Last. It was a fantasy to be sure, but to enjoy John Lennon, in such a way. Because we are replacing terrorism with communism, we are afraid of our hell, this film really has nothing to do with these days except inaccuracies. Writing, acting, and filmmaking are not developed in the same way. For the reason that I appreciate it at a high level, I watched this movie about 50 times in the age of 5-6, and there was a lot of space in my heart, but now I understand that mustard. So if you have a large number of laws and if someone decides to look at this movie, there are better ways to spend your time, but you know the ones that are even worse. (I'm gonna quit John Q.)
