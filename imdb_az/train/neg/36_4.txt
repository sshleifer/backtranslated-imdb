This movie was only 75 minutes long or even too long. The jungle horror movie problem always shows that people are walking around people (walking, river, or rocky cliff near the lake) to pull the pace of work. The film has always been breathtaking with bloody eyes and always sounds with a very reverb for the big wave of ridiculous and naked native zombie. Eurotrash lovers will engage in bad English dubbing, unequal female meat, and many monstrous makeup treats on wolves and native extras. It was a light on this eye for a zombie / lilac flicker, but I probably did not see an uncut version.
