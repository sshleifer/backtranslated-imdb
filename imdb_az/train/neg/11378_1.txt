The teeth in MST3K should see the dog's film. Basically, about a dopeyli hack actor who can not go to any concert in Hollywood. And it's strange with the taxi drivers. So what does this generous actor do? Her hair is blonde and one is L.A. the surfer starts to act like a friendly, naive hope this role plays a role. Many of the laughable scenes of this movie laugh at the head of the place. When the actor's friend's lover breaks his heart and cries, "How do you do it to me?" As with some lines. Why does he cry? She was blonde on her hair and she was a friend on the move to get moving concerts. This movie does not give any meaning to ALL! The actor playing Benson's governor is similar to that and plays a stereotypical right-wing politician with many sincere comic dialogues. This movie will surprise you and trust me. Are you talking to me?
