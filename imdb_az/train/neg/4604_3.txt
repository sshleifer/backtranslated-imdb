It was really painful for me to follow this movie in all ways. An Incompetent artist turns out to be a talented person? This movie was full of absurdities that I will give the film if I tell them. Norm Peterson should be in the same position as George Wendt agrees to make this film. The act was miserable and the story got worse. As a smart and thought-provoking person, I did not understand where the writer came from and where he went. Each main character had impatience, there was a sign of unhappy and funny events, and then the film ended. An absurd movement following a dialogue is not a movie, it is just a train crash.
