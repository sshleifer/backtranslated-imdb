Ethel Waters and 7-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr. (where not billed on Jr.), Rufus Jones would be one of the worst representations of my African-American stereotypes for the president. it was seen early in the talk era, and therefore it would not be worth seeing. Ms. Waters here is "I Blue I?" and "Under Harlem's" Mr. Davis showed us that his childhood experience was a showcase for his superstar status. Here is a good tape dance that is a small man with decades of experience. So here, if you are prepared to ignore the negative remarks of the president, Rufus Jones should give a good pleasure. P.S. For the fourth time this time I saw and heard the song "I'm glad you killed me" by Davis in the movie. It should have been a very popular song about that time.
