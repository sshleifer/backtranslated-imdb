Thunderbirds (2004) Directed by: Jonathan Frakes Player: Bill Paxton, Ben Kingsley, Brady Corbet <br /> 5 4? 3? 2? 1! Thunderbirds is GO! <br /> So Thunderbirds, my childhood began to be my beloved. When I heard a Thunderbirds movie shoot, it was ecstatic. Thunderbird 2 will not wait to see Thunderbird 2 to save people. I just did not expect it. Then, in August 2004, the film was finally released. Critics panned, but I still wanted to go. After all, when the heart was in the same place, everything was important to me. I sat in the theater, the only teenager in a 50-member meeting. Everyone was above thirty, under ten. Perhaps the most spectacular theater experience I have never found? Tracy is working on the youngest member of the family, Alan Tracy (Brady Corbet). She wants to be able to save people as the rest of her family, but she is very young. One day, Hood (Ben Kingsley) finally gets the chance when Thunderbird 5 (at the space station) captures the rest of his family. <br /> <br /> Trust me, as the structure is called regular episodes of Thunderbirds, it is necessary to abolish Hood's chaos and save his family before Hood stole money from the Bank of England. when you read on paper. After being filmed, we have some confusion. First, the film was designed for children, it was like a very original show. But Gerry Anderson treats us as an adult and has given us very advanced areas for programming children. On the other hand, he is trying to make himself a part of the Spy Kids franchise. The latest product, Thunderbirds series and a movie that wants to appeal to children's fans is also missing. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: true"; Part of Kingsley was exceptional as The Hood playing very well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> The movie was fun while watching the movie. But when the lights went up, I realized that the movie was pretty bad, it was $ 8 lighter and lost two hours of time. A sinful taste? Perhaps. Nevertheless, Thunderbirds is an unforgettable mix. Instead of going to a big "go", I have to advise you to stay away from this movie. The rest of the film would be an incredible movie worthy of Thunderbirds if it were about ten minutes. <br /> <br /> My rating for Thunderbirds is 1 Â½. <br /> <br /> Thunderbirds - stars.
