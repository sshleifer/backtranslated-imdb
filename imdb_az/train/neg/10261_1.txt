Wow, I've seen it in T.V., as one of the "scary" movies they make around Halloween. This degree is G? It was not worth watching or watching this movie. Also, other people say this is an oral, but I do not think so. For an oral one, you need something called "humor." This low budget bug-fest did not have a humorous lane and it did not make much sense. You have a monster (in human rubber), which is largely a rabid, killing people, killing people, and not seeing a violent or bloody incident. <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> They have a very bad purpose. Then the soldiers FLEES! Wow, did this movie hurt the US military appearance or what? Even though it is difficult to kill, the monster does not do anything except confusion and roaring around. Oh, and sometimes comes out of a second mouth and trembles. <br /> <br /> <strong> What was the deal with the clerk playing to attract the wizard's monster? It was difficult to understand many dialogues for poor sound quality. Also, why did the wolf come to the wimpy boy for a long time? Why did not the monster get into his closet when you had a chance? Do I insist on trying to figure out why I'm illogical?
