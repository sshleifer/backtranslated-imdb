Goofy Griswalds T.V. a game prize winning "pig in the pig" is a great prize and all of Europe fly somewhere together to manage a foolish disaster. All ridiculous, unfunny money-spinning sequels throws a lot of this. Harold Ramis's 1983 film was an average misadventure that the family went to "vacation" one night in America. <br /> <br /> Hughes scripting (with Rob Klane) this time with Amy Heckerling ("Who Wants to Talk") is a catastrophic "comedy" Horrible and Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca are forced to accept the offer as Chevy Chase and you wonder what Beverly D'Angelo has done with a deadly project. <br /> <br /> Even many powerful Michael Palin procedures can not be raised to any level that can be called fun. <br /> <br /> But as it can not be seen, the "European Vacation" was lucky enough to provide a second sequel! Undoubtedly, this can not be as unbearable. <br /> <br /> Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
