In this film, John Heder was absolutely horrible. For the first time in a student film, I felt I was watching a bad college student's move. Anna Farris paralel to the course, not good, not terrible (plus cute). Dianne Keaton should be better acquainted. Jeff Daniels was the only savvy gesture in this film (although his part was bad too). <br /> <br /> Generally, I avoided it at all costs. I'm glad I just did not pay for what I saw! <br /> <br /> Dear John Heder, if you do not have the courageous work of some of the players, will be replaced by the typical role of 'dorky kid'.
