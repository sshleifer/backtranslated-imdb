Steven Seagal .... How can you be a part of a terrific movie? I've rented this movie because movies are usually pretty clean. I've lost a lot of respect for being in a terrible movie like this. Very, very weak taste! I'm also ashamed to rent this movie. Steven, I believe that if you act in such films, your career is over. My husband and I watched a lot of movies because we can always get a "bad man" with a few manual maneuvers and clean it up ... and the language is pretty clean in your movies ... something else. I'll think twice before hiring another movie.
