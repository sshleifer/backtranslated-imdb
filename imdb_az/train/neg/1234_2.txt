Yes, as I expected, it was not a visual load, but nothing else was added to the original. I was surprised that the story line was dramatically changed compared with the figure of 1968. At first, it woke me up, but eventually amazed that the new layers and queues were probably invented to present us with a typical Hollywood product, and (b) made the whole story impossible! The story of 1968 was breathtaking and did not include a storm or something like that: everything could have changed a bit when it came home after a long journey. The earth could have been in the hands of monkeys, for example. Like many 'old' films, this is a basic component (hell, some people who do not understand these words these days). In the Burton movie, an attempt was made to turn everything into a motion picture, but what cost? Of course, there are lots of pictures and lots of time and money have been put into the design of a monkey culture (even monkey music!), But what? <br /> <br /> Firstly, disbelief is very difficult because monkeys have many Hollywood-human features. I particularly appeal to Ari and the slave trader. These features include emotionally trained emotions that are clearly demonstrated by irony, sarcasm and "subtle" feelings. This is the ape that monkeys need. <br /> Secondly, people are TALK. Of course, we will never forget how to talk to people, but it is very remarkable and stressed that the speech of the monkeys and the transfer of fluid / human role in the 1968 version. Charlton Hester's throat wound is essential to his survival and is due to his repetition and <br /> <br /> Thirdly, there is a need for a new twist in the new movie, where many talk about the inaccuracy of ads, because Capt. Davidson Hollywood is a all-world-and-a-good-end-for-everyone-and-still-make-the-lounge-bar-for-a-cool-diet-coke character. O God, will they never learn? Once again, there was still a man! They needed a hero! Scenario writers are starting to think: we need a boy ... why a boy will be lost ... because he tries to get off a monkey from an electromagnetic storm ... incredible! But it is necessary to show the audience that they respect monkeys. Because in this contemporary and politically correct period, we will not be able to have a xenophobic ape as the 68 character of Charlton Hester. Let's give them a bubblegum version! <br /> <br /> Fourthly, it's all right to say that the 1968 film, which transformed the reality of the 1968 movie into a modern version (whose mother's ship had crashed in the age of the planet and developed the community of laboratory monkeys, where Hester's monkeys just reached the earth) in a way. Second, the battlefield comes as an anti-climb. Because this film has added the first two Planets of Apes films in one space. <br /> <br /> <br /> For the cries that come with that? (a) Davidson collapses with TWICE on a runway, which will undoubtedly be a delicate one? Who would he believe? Could pods really manage small descent (Davidson simply flies into space) and not just run away from the ship, he could handle at least once safely descent? And what about this end? That is, everything in the original film has been found to be on the earth. But here: the whole film is on a distant planet and suddenly there is monkey culture on earth (where there is a statue of Thade)? How come? The monkeys of the long-lasting planet were technologically advanced, flew to the storm and colonized before the mission of Davidson's departure? Why Thade Worship? Stupid stupid is foolish. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter is even beautiful and beautiful as fluid, but I did not want to wait less. I chose a monkey like Estella Warren's man, but maybe there's an empty wire in my head. There may be many unusual things, and maybe the evolutionist monkeys Tim Roth Thade (beautiful!) and Ari's home monkey (former general, but I forgot his name). <br /> <br /> The peak of 1968 was added / changed, but not in this way. It was simple and clear, and no additional explanation is needed. It was a nice language - cheek and cartoon. Do not refresh everything ...
