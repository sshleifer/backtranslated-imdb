From the very beginning, smuggler John Dillinger (Warren Oates), after being identified as an egomaniac aggressor, a robber from the 1930s was relocated to a farmhouse and was covered by the FBI. The second team, Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), investigates the situation, sticks a light cigar in his mouth, takes two .45 caliber automatics and goes alone into the house. Bang, bang, bang. Purvis, alone in the house, took the hostages and carried the dead to death. Head of the Caucasian Muslims Office: Pretty Boy Floyd's death dramatically. Multiple violations of the civil code. Tommy is very afraid of guns and pistols. <br /> <br /> As history, it is bad. I remember Melvin Purvisi as a FBI hero, but I guess it is partly due to his name. Melvin PURVIS? <br /> <br /> We all remember that J. Edgar Hoover had fired Melvin Purvis. Because he was a competitor to the public's attention. <br /> <br /> This image was written and managed by John Milius. He is the man who has been contracted to be shot in one of the animals' production and must be killed by a predecessor. <br /> <br /> Milius is Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders from Henry V's "Saint Crispin's Day" in the Spanish-American War and so on. <br /> <br /> Exciting, and full trash. "I knew that I would never commit it, and I did not try too hard." <br /> <br /> So kill everything and God corrected them. <br /> You just love it.
