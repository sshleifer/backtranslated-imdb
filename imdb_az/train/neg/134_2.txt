Far from the movie, it was super-smart. At present there is a contact rhyme with every horror film. Valentine makes attempts to become ZERO's original. What are valentines? A bunch of people who share the same heap messages one year ago with the same people. Valentine's nothing original. <br /> <br /> I just saw one of them and here's some of the movies taken here. <strong> <div> style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> Valentine's good they do not have the chance to become a movie. Every fear movie should have a "surprise" killer, people are not interested in themselves because they turn their emotions into a single turn. <br /> <br /> Usually, a beautiful girl turns into a bad B-ch, and then she is a dangerous woman, and ten and son. <br /> <br /> Normally there is no horror movie (my book) once again in Valentine. They tried to fulfill PG-13, but failed, so they were edited. <br /> <br /> Do not disassemble it unless you hate yourself. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (3) -J.Leonard Rollins -
