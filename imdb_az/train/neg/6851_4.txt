Feh. This film started in an exciting way, but soon the gamut escaped from the mix. It's hard to say what's happening in the first twenty minutes or more, because it's a lot of scattered scenes that happen at the outset. Gentle then comes two romanticisms (both pusses) between two living creatures. The revenge of the deceased girl is really the most vibrant human being in a sad film. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This story is a little bit interesting. Because, as the sixteen-year-old girl of the deceased priest was trying to raise her daughter from the dead, there is no doubt that all the other dead would return. as well as a healthy human being, and most likely, everyone's murder has begun. Japanese mystical night of something like a Living Dead. But this will not happen. Even though this non-faded priest is in a small basket combining his head, he tells these unwelcome youths that if he ends the ritual of the treacherous, he only shows it and is the only dead man. The mass rising of the dead, the body of corpses, not nothing. The priest turned the girl's soul to the land of the dead and saw that a man's husband washed with her because she broke her waist as the fragility of the pistachio (I love to sing at this point) and kissed the girl, and she went to enjoy it! Robitussen breastfeeding, spineless, has the longest introspective scarring during his last spell when he leaves the village. An unfortunate horror, a real heartbreak, is, in my heart, akin to the high level of cheese in Japanese, and no screaming is better than American filmmakers. I'm very upset.
