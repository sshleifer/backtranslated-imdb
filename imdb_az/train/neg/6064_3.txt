So so. It was as good as John Carpenter's 1st Horror Masters season, the opposite. <br /> <br /> He is still a fearsman with Cigarette Burns, but Pro-Life is perhaps the worst thing I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This creepy atmosphere is very pleasant, though it's running less than an hour. <br /> <br /> The main points of the vote are: <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> How did you describe Carpenter? He is truly proud and speaks for a long time as his best work and praises the scenario. And in a statement he explained to the last section, he explained that he did not feel important to correct the mistake and that he was there alone. I'm afraid that the old master has completely lost his touch. <br /> <br /> I really hope that I'm really wrong. <br /> <br /> I would like to leave a positive note. Talking technically, this movie is the top bumper with effective lighting schemes and effects.
