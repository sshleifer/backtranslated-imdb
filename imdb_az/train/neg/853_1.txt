Okay, honestly, I do not see everyone thinks this is so great. Not really. There were two good things from this movie. 1. Jackin's performance was very good, I beat his hat for him. 2. Danny's performance was good. No one was more ridiculous than that. Stanley Kubrick was thinking of preparing Shelly like Wendy? It was so bad. He was scared every time. The problem with this movie has come to an end. I would have been more respectful when Kubrick ended up in a different way. And the whole film was just stupid. The problem with the film shows that the book is better. So do not see that we read the film and I'll be much better. 3/10.
