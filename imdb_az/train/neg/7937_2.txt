After 30 seconds, you realize that there is no real budget for this cheap knock-off. The story is taken from major films like "Chainsaw Massacre in Texas" and "Hurry Eyes." I also like these films, even when they are replicated (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But it's hard to follow Side Sho: Actors are really bad, dialogue is unattractive and music is foolish and totally inappropriate. Do not worry about what happens to the heroes. The so-called bad guys are also very stereotypical. So what's the blood and the abdomen? Some are cheaper, and the move is very weak. 2 points, just for the snow and blood, but even for the abdominal ponds, this is not worth the money.
