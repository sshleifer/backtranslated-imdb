I went to the movie as Sneak Preview in Austria. I had no idea what I was seeing. The story is very normal. The film has been for a long time, I think it would cut the story to 1/2 without any problems. What kind of movie he's on the drill-night he wants to be more bored! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is okay. The film tells about the US Coast Guard, how they are trained, their lifestyle, and the problems they are facing. Because there are not many effects in the film. If you want to watch it, then you do not have to spend your time and money on the Cine. It would be more effective to watch it at home when it's on DVD.
