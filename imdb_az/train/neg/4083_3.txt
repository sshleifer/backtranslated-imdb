I saw this movie when it was released, and my worries about it were all these years. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> If you can say one character, "my heart flies" they say, with the wings of the pigeon shooting on the screen, the heart of the true human being will be shown. <br /> <br /> This process takes some neat tables, but in the end it's an easy exercise. <br /> <br /> Although I like the other viewers in this movie, it's important to know that each of the viewers is not involved.
