I've had "Sorrows Lost" at the New York Film and Video Festival, and I've been hoping for this movie. Unfortunately, this is another Visual FX calling card. The story is pretty bare. <br /> <br /> <strong> Is it important to ask the rich glasses to have better stories? technical production equals FX! You can not just face the cool FX on the shirt, 5 years since the "405" splash. At least this short, fast, cool, and even a little funny! None of these can be called "unhappy."
