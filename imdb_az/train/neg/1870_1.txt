I always love the project about big comedies and symbols, but I feel like it has become an emotional soap recently. If you look at the draft bill / posters, you will now see two officers / kisses or friendships, whereas promotional pictures of the bill will show something of a criminal offense long ago. This proves that it has changed dramatically from a beautiful Police drama to an average TV soap. When I'm watching, I feel like I'm watching a version of Coronation Street Police or something similar. I still say that as a police bill and that I'm interested in something like this, but I really miss Bill's greatness. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ font> <br /> <br /> Great characters are now gone (I still think a few) and I'm not saying that a new character is poor or nothing, because they do not necessarily have only their difficult images, personalities and scripts <br /> <br /> These days, the only police on television One of the programs Bill, these days, will always be something very interesting to watch within the bill, but I've lost a lot of uniqueness (if there is the right spelling) and will now be classified as a terrible, non-real TV soap. <br /> <br /> It comes to watch police officers laugh well at the fraud - 2/10
