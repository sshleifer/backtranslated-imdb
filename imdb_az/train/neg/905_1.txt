A married woman named Stella (Bette Midler) is pregnant by a wealthy man (Stephen Collins). She proposes to marry with commitment, but she turns her into a straight line and decides to adopt her. <br /> <br /> I saw the silent version and sound version of Stella Dallas, but things went on until Jenny (Trini Alvarado) became a child. No one was much affected by me (and I cried easily), but if they were prepared according to the date. In 1990, trying to correct it was just a stupid idea. I think that Midler had enough strength to accomplish this after the incomprehensible success of the "Beaches". It was bombarded. The story is laughable and is dated according to today's standards. Although Midlands and Alvarado have good performances, this movie is really drifting, and I'm crying until the end. Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason (both good players) do not support roles. Sand and boring. Indeed - who thinks it will work? See Stanwyck version 1937 instead. I'll give it 1.
