Hammerhead is a combination of mad scientists and killer shark movie genres. In some sort of casting, Jeffrey Combs plays the above-mentioned mad scientist who develops the vitality of human / hammerhead sharks. Unfortunately, this creature actually turned this monster into a life to prevent his death from cancer. Or something. <br /> <br /> A group of scholars are invited to the special island of the scientist. They are used as shovels or shark mates. For some reasons, the IT director was part of this team. Who knows? Fortunately, he turns out to be a skillful rabbit hero Ramboesque. I think you learned how to handle an assault rifle as part of a day job with the 1st support. This is a normal day for IT guys, and it is likely that someone is calling for attacking armed attackers by setting up a network connection. Or maybe someone planning to build a PC should be planned between physical-shooting hybrids and location-based human-sharks? In any case, it is beautiful and protects the day. <br /> <br /> The sweet shirt man creates a bit of a lie, but in this film he is generally judged by his influence. And the movie is moving at a good pace. Of course, if you're buying a movie called Hammerhead and expecting a man to be a dramatic drama about a sensual conflict that has become a land-based killer fish, you really do not need anyone to have your sins. There are guns, gore, girls, and even a blast helicopter. Some say that it's not a waste, it's not bad.
