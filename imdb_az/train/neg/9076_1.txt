This, of course, was the most stupid, most dangerous, and most repulsive film I've ever seen. I wanted to delete the VCR, but just as I was in a sad car accident, I literally accidentally found the STATION and lost it until the end. On the screen I'm not prude to oppose the comic descriptions of sexual antiques. There is something about Animal House, Porky's, Mary, both American Pie films, as well as the notorious Freddy Got Fingered, which I found pretty enjoyable in terms of their own. Mamie Van Doren's floor sponge bath is the most terrible look of the naked geroter since The Shining. Devon Sawa and Jason Schwartzman were definitely made out of incredibly stunning performances, and the film shot me out without the giggling once. The only useful purpose of the film is an example of how to draw a general picture. Oh, and it will also serve as a grass fertilizer.
