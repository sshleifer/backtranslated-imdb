I first read "Lorna Doone" 20 years ago and I absolutely loved it! This is a classic romance dating back to the 1600s, although the western country traveled in the 1600s for a few days traveling from London and harder to comply with the law and order. Unfortunately, this version of the book requires some freedom from the story, and in my opinion it was incredibly disappointing. Operational and production values ​​are good, but it was terrible as they talked about the story. Why does television adaptation do this? Why are thousands of fans of the book wanting to change this story? One of the great secrets of life! The BBC has prepared an excellent version of television in the early 1990s, and I am still trying to follow a copy! Get my advice, read books and do not worry about this rude version!
