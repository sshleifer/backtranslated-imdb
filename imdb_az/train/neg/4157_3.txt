<br /> <br /> Erotic, terrible, thirsty, I thought well, they are all things that the movie does not happen. When I decided to look at this suicide of modern bulbul and me and my suicide bombers <br /> <br /> But it's incredibly ridiculous, sound effects and bad dubbles add it to being one of the biggest comedy I've seen in recent years. But this movie does not even become funny and is one of the great achievements of movies, and even becomes a comedy without attempting to entertain. <br /> <br /> A strange man in the movie, Santa Claus crawls on the zombies and shouts vampires on the ground. Do not believe in vampires and zombies when the vampires and zombies do not fight, and the vampires do not fight? Whatever good, there were more defects in this rental than anyone else. Like it; It has been swept away by creating zombies like many other actors, like an average tourist through America. The whole film has only four zombies. Another problem is that everywhere you leave a store. You will surely see zombies in the woods or in the background. In fact, I believe that they just creep around a forest because they did not have a fairly high budget to shoot a movie in a wider location, or the director did not want to shoot a different film in his precious time <br /> <br /> Actually, the director was so entertaining that he was dealing with an event that did not have enough time to engage in the work. is big enough or even an editor. And recalling that it was a difficult task to recall the eight members of the eight casting members as different people and to try to avoid the remarkable action, changing their name, and accidentally kicking the film makers. The only reason that this "movie" found in our bag was how weird these things happened because they have mixed with Freddy vs Jason. <br /> <br /> Yes, we laugh tonight, but even at night, we put the gas masks in one way and put them in our heads. <br /> <br /> But I'm sure there's a lot to lose when it's healthy ...
