Matt Cordell is back in a deadly third round, although I'm not sure if everyone is looking at this point, except for logical MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in his last breath, is a warm thing in the footsteps of a few miscreant people who are resurrected through voodoo and now Cordell is engaged in the firing of a civilian officer. I missed the extra-quickie part of this early 90s, but it was nice to see that Cordell raised the number of corpses in various, horrible ways. The problem is, the overall film is quite static, and Cordell is simply not Jason or Freddy. Interesting was pretty fast, even the great B-filmmaker Robert Forster was like a swollen doctor with her brains. Together with the first film of the series, it is also funny and intriguing and interesting.
