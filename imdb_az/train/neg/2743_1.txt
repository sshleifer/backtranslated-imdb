I have not finished this movie, because it's so strange and unnecessary to watch. I watched him stupid and a room filled with children who were not laughing in humorous humor. The director, Bob Dolman, grew up with sphincters and sex organs, and grew up to clear the true story. THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM FOR KIDS! Along with the fact that the content is so great, the film is just a bad stream and there is no discovery behind it. How much loss of a perfect story. Do not waste your time watching your movie while you're reading it when you're small, for it's a bad thing that's frustrating you. Instead, buy your children's book.
