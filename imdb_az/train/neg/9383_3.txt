MANY FATHER FILM ........ and I say it's so bad ... Scams predict, and it's cheesy, the creativity of the war and dance scenes for the time is not the only reason I'm not the only one, I can not afford to watch a def movie ..... When I watch the movie, the idea behind the movie was interesting. The city bamboo looks like the happiness of the city, but I think it would not have been a bit strange if it was not so badly depicted on the screen that it would be at least a bit better. Although the scales are sometimes estimated somehow, the dance I can say at TIMES is pretty good, the break-dance battle twist was good ..... If you watch the movie pop and dance scenes and create your own dialogue maybe maybe 5 ... lol
