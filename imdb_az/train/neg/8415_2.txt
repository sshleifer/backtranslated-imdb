It was longer than the Command of the Ten Commandments, the Lord of the Rings, and the Matrix Trilogy. My oh what a nightmare. This is the biggest hip-hop form of 2006. Its scripted and not clich√©d is not a moment. Movie tracks can be made gloriously and bring real excitement to the audience. Dreamgirls, the Chinese Water Torture route, endless musical kits, shady player and poor directing choices (seriously, Mr Condon, was forced to make an old Billboard census? # 58 ... look at the rising up in his charts and show him again on Billboard ... and again .... and again)
