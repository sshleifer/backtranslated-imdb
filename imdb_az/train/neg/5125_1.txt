As a young pastor I heard good things about this movie. Then I followed it. Acting was not good. It's guilty. This is not the message: Give Jesus his life and everything will change - you will fight better, keep it beautiful, stop dark, start touchdown and even play. Because Jesus genuinely turns all the American athletes into terrible mice weaknesses. The coach pointed out why the striker was trying to figure out why he had scored. But wait, it's not all. You will get a new truck, increase $ 6000, and you and your wife's infinity will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice. Then you will win the state championship, because God has shot at a distance of 12 meters ahead of the weakened area - and less than the wind - all this has been said, "God wants." Then you will win the state championship next year. <br /> <br /> I'm away from this movie: God can do everything he wants. it wants to do it - and make our lives better, easier, and more comfortable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win the game. What is the Bible based on this gospel? I wished that before knowing Stephen's death he knew the key to such a safe life. Someone was not killed by Jesus before 10 of the 11 apostles. Many difficulties would have saved them.
