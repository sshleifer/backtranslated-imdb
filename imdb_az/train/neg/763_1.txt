I love Columbo and have seen most of the episodes, but this is undoubtedly in a very bad condition. An eye-catching, lightweight, meaningless, dark shadow that frustrates time-consuming Peter Falk's acting talent. The 'plot' like this seems to be seen as going along with the slightest clue in the formula of the formula that ensures such a brilliant success. Part of the meetings I found very striking (or unhappy) was the character Peter Falk introduced to the guests, such as "Lt" Columbo. If manufacturers demand Columbo's first name to be hidden, why did they not throw it out because they were ridiculous? As I said, these potholes and all the right Columbo fans would be good to avoid it as a plague.
