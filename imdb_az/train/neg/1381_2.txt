The gentle spoiler here. I'm breaking this movie so I have to follow me. <br /> <br /> Jet Li films fall into one of the two categories: organizations set up in Hong Kong in modern times, returning to films and movies during Triangle or Triad during the Shaolin era. Each genre has the best and worst films ever. The 'Twin Warriors' Jet Li is the worst of the 'Shadows of The Evil Cult' in the Shaolin era. Or, in the past, the best 'modern' Jet Li movie 'Legend Fist'. Jet Li plays a soldier who has been deported and gives him a human defect, but reduces his life. A pacifist librarian plays "in his new life" in exile. When his old coral team is on a horse, Jet Li becomes a vigilante to stop them. <br /> <br /> He takes a very smart cardboard mask mask to hide the identity of the police (and the public) from the public library and to hide his captive captivity from his ex-spouse. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was dubbed and something similar happened. Why does Jet Li take a pawnshop and hold a library employee? Is there a love story among them? Why does not the police chief care about the black mask's true identity? The area is just flat BAD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Life is superior to heroic, heroic, heroic, heroic, and martial arts. The film includes many blood, haemorrhage (cut body parts), explosions and extraordinary martial arts fixtures in Matrix style. Unfortunately, this movie is the best and only selling point. Jet Li introduces the "Black Mask" if you want to see a hero hero playing in the style of Miss Impossible. The rest of us are the true disappointment for Jet Li fans. This is one of Jet Li's films, not Jet Li, why he does not have the charm of his song, nor the chances to surprise us with his impressive, but realist martial art. <br /> <br /> In general, Özzy Osbourne's Chinese champion is enough to bend me in the movie, unfortunately, "Black Mask" proved that this rule is exception. Indeed, the film's antagonist, dresses, long plain hair and trademark sunglasses look like modern and old Ozzy Osbourne. However, the poor is not long enough to give a glimpse of the screen. I was deliberate for Özzy; besides the man's appearance, he also sought a shelter for a satanic look. Ozzy Osbourne's cunning gimmick can be done more! "Black Mask" was the first Jet Li movie to be shown in the US, but only a writer, director, or anybody was concerned about giving and developing the character of the movie consistently! <br /> <br /> After Lethal Weapon 4, I'm so glad I stayed so far. It would be nice for Jet Li to accept the whole time as a singer and actor. Jet Li wants to see the worst 'Black Mask' and 'The Evil Cult' hire and make it a deliberate and unwanted double feature or horror. Otherwise, join in actions that use Jet Li's talents and have semi-well-thought-out and acceptable areas. 3/9 stars.
