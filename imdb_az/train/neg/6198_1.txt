This cowardly and offensive film interested me. Heroes are young, often displaced young men who are hanging around in the seaside town. Robert has an outsider, but his soul can be music. Instead, Clay makes a strange journey to Robert, who wants to travel to mystery and ecstasy and enter the wrong crowd. Clay believes in "repetition of madness" and ends with Robert's murder as a strike. How realistic this life experience of this young filmmaker is. No one can save the poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that young British men are in control. The Iraqi insurgents were given a very bad attitude; During unnecessary graphic aggression, we are exposed to explosion and war patterns. The film shows that the peer group of men has pushed extremism into its restrictions. London's young bombers are parallel to Clay's contempt for contemporary men. Gil says that men can not only help themselves from the terrible acts of violence. The British film industry is a miracle to invest money in films that defend divisive propaganda when we run out of London's latest attacks. This is Clayin's first film, and I'll be happy if it's the last one.
