The film was very interesting for the film "horror" prepared for television. I really interested in the film's story and mystery. But ending was a general agreement. The film progressed rapidly and it seemed to be a very climatic end. But guess what the end is. After a few hours and a half after the movie is over, the audience is just wondering what's going on. Why all the unanswered questions in the movie left unanswered. There is no explanation in any of the main points on the beach. This movie is nothing but a trace of a crime and then identifying who it is. I'm so glad. The producers of this film just ran away from the money and did not finish the movie. A Real BOMB!
