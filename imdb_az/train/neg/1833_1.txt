Please, somebody refuses to speak to Ben Stiller in any movie. Write to the studio, hell, or even your local congressman. Then I got more laughter going to a funeral. Jack Black seeks to do something about a comedy about the accusation, and maybe the biggest actor of his generation, Christopher Walken, appears to be simply ashamed to be there. Styles is a fascinating personality, but now even somebody proves to be fascinated by a comedy to drive it out. He was surprised to see why this movie was kept bad and that there were dollar cinemas after a few weeks. I warn you, tell my friends, do not watch this flick, just horrible, worse then Gothika (personally, I never thought I did not mean to say it), Worst Plan 9, Please leave Hollywood, in your movies, to go to Ben Stiller, it's not funny, a god is a terrible actor and brings others together. The film below is the 1st degree because there are no allowed points, so the board says, I'll give it a Zero.
