The first part of Cuba is part of her life. For many unrivaled battles and very different wounds, the Chemistry ministry (probably remember that Che is a doctor). Castro ends as the revolution has gained; Che never goes to Havana. The second part in Bolivia predicts what China is. <br /> <br /> When I thought this would be "epic" (I did not know anything, but before the start) there were many different battles and many things that served many wounded. Of course, I thought of the great epic of all of them, David Lean's Arabian Lawrence. And then. <br /> <br /> Do not be racist but unlike anything I already mentioned, there is a very different character that is different - unknown Spanish actors wear "Che" beards and all wear light fatigue. The result is that the Cheic, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a very small role) can not get to know anyone else. <br /> <br /> Though Del Toron is terrible, Peter O'Toole is the only visible character of Lawrence, but no Alec Guinness, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, and others. You will get an idea. <br /> <br /> Other symbols can replace each other, resulting in a loss of reference. When the best helper of Cheyenne is killed, you will not feel regret because you do not know who you are. <strong> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < div> To be an evolutionist and Jesus alone, on the morally justified, the only thing that we learned about Che was married to five children (another close to the end). What was his motivation? Full cunning. <br /> <br /> Maybe Soderbergh deliberately pleads. Like Soderbergh's Che, Lean lets us know anything about Arabian mysterious guy Lawrence. But at least Lawrence was a friend (Sharif) and united (Guinness, Quinn). He was courageous as he was dangerous - he had human qualities. At the beginning of this year another war epic was a Mongolian. Che gives a spectacular look, this is a wonderful life.
