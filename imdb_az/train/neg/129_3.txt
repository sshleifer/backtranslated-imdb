I'm really interested in one of two films: Lena's sex experimental side, and the other half does not care about political / socialism. Whatever the principal's intentions, both of them do not really come together. The guide should have left only a romantic side of Lena and a separate film for politics. There is a strange blend of political / war rallies, Dr. King, serious political interviews, stinging tits, and pubic hair. The film is similar to a fictional documentary than a movie. Apart from exciting sex scenes, you're bored with watching this movie. Unlike many other reviewers, I can see what barefoot / sex scenes are. If you want to see a real porn, I'm sure there are better options. Common nudity is a great distraction from any area. But I think the player has done a good job. They played their part as a believer. Meanwhile, there are so many things I used to enjoy in American movies.
