Acting was not very good, the story was full of returning and transparent characters. On the one hand, it is the result of the struggle between the right-wing Flemish bloc electorate and the people of Morocco, living in Antwerp, Belgium. Policy Analysis? Do you have some sort of Belgian West Side Story or Modern Romeo and Juliet? The film is not strong enough to just answer questions (for example, it was the director's questions). However, some scenes could have acted as an actor in Kenwach, set up in Antwerp. After all, this city was the starting point for the extremist right-wing Flemish Bloc party and struggled with many problems and conflicts among different populations and cultures. It is difficult to shoot a film about this situation, and it is, unfortunately, not successful. However, today in Belgium describes a story about a very real and complicated situation. Several overseas viewers should see and use this, not a real film that reflects the importance of a successful movie, a country of 10 million in Belgium in the 2000s. <br /> <br /> Dries van Dongen
