This movie is a very bad attempt to make money with a classic theme. I loved the Superman movies, but I wanted to shoot it myself. Very vulnerable, ugly special effects and zero-equal area. To summarize: Superman leaves the Earth, because scientists have found a part of his home planet, some have gone, dwelling before something else (duh again), in a spaceship (?!?
