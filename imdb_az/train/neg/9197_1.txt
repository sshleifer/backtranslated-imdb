Some movies only know that they will be worse than one frame. Even if you have not forgotten Ed Wood's work, you will never see a review of the "Plan 9 out of space" and only the INFORMATION you will not see the next movie. Just as he tried to sound like the City of Sin, when Uwe Bolls saw the first shooting of the mastermind, the House of the Dead, with the man sitting in front of the house, the movie starts out like this - the first start character says that each everyone dies. You know, to walk around you. Then I begin to introduce the remaining characters with characters with lines like "Karma .. I think Foxy Brown" or "Alicia .. before me ... we have left ... I read and she was fence". <br /> <br /> In any case, this group of 20 people, who could not get out of the real paper bag, was settled on a small island in the middle of a few tents, one port-a-potty and the Pacific Ocean. Our crew missed the ferry, but fortunately we can find a way to go there: a fishing vessel taken by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? S Man, who wrote this article?) And the sidekick Simpsons Cpt McAllister, a whispering boy and a hook who knows what he did last summer killer. <br /> <br /> In order to shorten the longevity of life, the network gets into the island and finds nothing but bloody t-shirts, and then decide to flee from hell. <br /> <br /> At this stage, the movie is rock-blown and then goes downhill to all speeds. Some kids in rubber suits begin to run around, there are some screams and shots, our gang goes home to meet another brigade, goes out of the house, Cpt Kirk and some female police guns) and then decided to return home. Throughout the line, S.W.A.T. team, Enter Matrix, Rubber dresses begin to crash like bacteria, and I've paid money to see it because I started crying. <br /> <br /> There are shots from every few minutes to add insult to this injury, and this crap stops and they have a nice game for a few characters after their death. <br /> <br /> Hate this movie. Even this does not fit the popular category "Worse yet." It's just bad. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> <strong> The reputation of being terrified. Do not do it. There are bad movies worth watching. This is not one of them.
