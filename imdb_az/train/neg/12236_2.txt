Unfortunately, this has not happened. It's predictable and is a click. Screened chemistry, which is as attractive as "My Girl", is nowhere to be found and it is a style and complementary function. Writing does not want to be asked, some "memorable" lines are just as shocking as "listen to barbarism." "My daughter" tries to recreate these feelings created by the audience and results in many failures. Perhaps the hardest thing I have to do with this movie because of the greatness of the first movie, but it is very correctly insulted by the original quality that the taxi service provided. Undoubtedly, this is a must-have of the "Maska son" approaching one of the worst results of all time. In either case, old words sound sounds right; "If not broken, do not do it."
