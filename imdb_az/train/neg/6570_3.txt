I have never seen Charles Chase very funny, though his character on the screen sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, who is very funny. (Charley Chase reminds me of Hen Broon, who talked to Scotland's Sunday Post novel). In Chase's best films, I have to praise her more than her laugh. I'll give Chase a credit for his best films - Mighty Like Moose and The Wooden Wedding - a fandom inspiration that is sensitive to it ... but even I <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <strong> "Hard", "unusual", "hormless", "naff" rose to the young justice court. Oliver Hardy presents the best performance in this film as a father who does not accept Chase as 'mollycoddle'. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Leo White, Eslinay also for Chaplin foil, who works more like an opponent as here. <br /> <br /> There is an action that covers the time of Ingersoll. I was interested in marking the name of the brand in dialogue names: an early example of product placement? <br /> <br /> Of course, a big flaw in the "Homing to Order" is Rosemary Theby's falling like Rose: it is a standard issue, but theby-flat-chested, shawk faced - is physically wrong. Theby (Harry Myeris's wife) had a successful career as an actress with shields, but never was an incredible place. Film historian William K Everson is very interested in one of his movie books. <br /> <br /> Because I'm 10 years old, say 'married to order' and I'm kind, Charley Chase has something everyone gets, but I suspect, but it's missing.
