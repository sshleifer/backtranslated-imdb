This is the worst piece I've ever seen in my life cr4p. However, it became known. Sarah-Michelle Gellar could not stop with these terrible movies. I think that in the movies everyone agreed with something that after the shouting "SHITE" the loans were accumulated. <br /> <br /> The worst films did not do this on my list: <br /> <br /> 1. Return 2. Cabin Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> <br /> Silent Hill 3 The reason was some scary scenes, but the rest was definitely cr4p. It did not mean the same as the cabin fever, but it returned to that list. Worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever
