I did not feel as though I was being harassed as I did with the adventures of the future, but the BELLE Magical World is still BEAUTY and BEAST's antithesis. Like CHRISTMAS, BMW hates its viewers despite such excessive levels. Ugly, ungrateful, strange, and insidious. One of the stories does not work. These are not the characters we love from BATB, they are a lot of people. I did not want to break it down, but in a few minutes I refused, because nobody in the right mind would accept this cover seriously. There are three stories here. The "Perfect Word" is an overwhelming, great work of forgiveness. "Fifi's Philosophy" recognizes Babette's name is really Fifi, and he is a secret James Bond villainess, and if Lumiere accepts that he is a fool against women. "Broken Wing" (or "Shattered Wind") is probably the most horrible type of gang. Animals Hate Birds? WHEN? Do not watch this video - every single copy of this video deserves to be discovered. BEAUTY AND BEAST is yet another kinematic classic, a passionate passion for love, art, intelligence and human soul.
