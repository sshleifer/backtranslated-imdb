I have this over the VHS, I think they (Television networks) should play it every year for the next twenty years. That is, we should not forget what we are and remember to not repeat the same mistakes. They are not here, as some people put in the director's seat. This movie resembles Rappin as a voodoo music for those who can not read or move a song. <br /> <br /> This movie is very entertaining, as you try to teach 'kora' to drive a city bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood (Peebles) left the new prison and returned. Of course, when it comes to committing any offense. <br /> <br /> John returns to the old street and dances along the way and greets the old women and their peers while telling their comrades. <br /> <br /> If I was sentimental, someone had written a drug written by a doctor for glaucoma cigarettes. In both cases it was weakly directed, scripted, moving and even produced (never thought I'd gone) with the 'Hood' sat in life. Although part of the story, the wannabe chain fight sequence and dance numbers, friends take care of their neighbors, and want to get rid of the gettou down and clean. <br /> <br /> Forget the Sonny spoon, Mario could win an Oscar for it, compared to this Rap. If you feel good about yourself and want to embarrass the quarter, make sure you first swear it. <br /> <br /> Please, be careful. (There is no better chance next time!)
