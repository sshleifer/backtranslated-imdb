Wow, it could have been a good movie, shut up with Brittany Daniels, I think I think we'll be back in the flash, but the movie starts again with kids. It would have been better if the film was not acting. Almost the player was terrific ... Although he was able to deal with weaker actors, I thought he was doing his best ... Actually, he was destroying the film for me .. Gemini were just some of the actor skills .. The movie was a shocking one the result is drifting. We all saw lower budget movies worse, but I was very disappointed, thinking that I was thinking of drawing up to eight films to think. By the way, some reviewers said they had snow and things. Have I seen the same movie? Yes, it's eight out of eight, and so far only one is good.
