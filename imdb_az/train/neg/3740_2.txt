Immediately, this movie was ridiculous. Did not have paid features? For example, the best thing about this movie was the beautiful background decoration. Anyone living on the East Coast must know that South is not as beautiful as the ones in the West. I knew yuta was useless, but perhaps Dalton could not bend the English accent, so they were forced to give an excuse by saying that he was a southern city. It was easier to turn the acceleration into South. Of course, the film has a twist on the earth, but the fraud of the earth could not pass me. It does not seem like there is a meth lab in the gut ... Why is it beyond me to think that writers should think like in the South? <br /> <br /> Something else in action is always a puzzle for me. Why do they always make a "cocktail" sound when cartoon pushes an automatic pistol? In this film, any sound effect was a "choke-out" stating that 9 mm was loaded and ready for fire. Of course, the weapons were armored and that was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Finally, pyrotechnics were WAY from above. However, this film was targeted at a certain 'market segment' ... It seems bad. Each actor can move, but this movie was naked.
