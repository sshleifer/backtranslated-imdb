Apart from the two capabilities that are better than the average actor skills, this movie is really bad. Cheap production values ​​do not help. Of course, you do not realize that if your production values ​​do not try to convince you, they are capable of starting production values. Even if it's for a B-movie genre like myself, this movie really is silent.
