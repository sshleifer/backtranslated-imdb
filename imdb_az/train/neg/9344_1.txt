As others have mentioned, this film is a burden for the mindless or masochist. <br /> <br /> We know that Scotland is one of the most striking places in the world. But such humorous or flawless realism films do not differ from trains and pickles without a good dose. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new, inspirational, and thought-provoking about this movie's scripts. <br /> <br /> How does this movie win some Bafta? The English movie industry is also bad. The Aussie movie industry is currently pretty bad, but unfortunately the English industry is even worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad that I will not rent it from the weekly section. <Br> <br /> Give yourself a blessing and give this movie a great deal.
