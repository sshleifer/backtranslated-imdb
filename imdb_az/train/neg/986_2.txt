This movie had 8.1 IMDB ratings, so I was more than expected. It starts in a funny and pleasing way with energy that feels spontaneous. But the film begins to drift before crossing the road and everything can be predicted for everything. The characters in the office were welcome in the first three parts of the movie, but we know them a little bit; they become cartoons, not the true man. It's the same story I've seen hundreds of times, just a few different terms here. And just because the dialogue did not go beyond the limits of a love story could have made another commitment worthy of love! <br /> <br /> The heroes have controversial and incredible motivation and, unfortunately, also work with the Dead Letter Office. Hopefully, this movie will end with Dead Film Bureau.
