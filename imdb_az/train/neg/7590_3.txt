Fabulous bodies, beautiful colors and camera work, ambitious dialogue, banal plot. Prima donna, Camilla and often seen flowers are Dumas' novel La Dame aux Camelias, Garbo and (in my opinion) Robert Taylor's Camille, but at least the Verdi opera La Traviata. Beautiful, not very good young ladies, for one reason, come together to die of infections, loved, disintegrated, deadly tuberculosis ... They give empty spaces inside Opera and foolishly unrealistic dialogue, but why Hayak, Don Sutherland, why a good performance of LA in the 1930s, a deus ex machina earthquake that killed another woman easily and why this beautiful song in a beautiful Turkey does not leave you alone?
