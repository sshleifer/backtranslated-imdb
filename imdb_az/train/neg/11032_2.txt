"I Love New York" is another piece of VH-1 (MTV Networks). The most ugly, Eboniki speaking, crazy opponent - and his mother - it's an easy decision to give a show on the network. Many will claim that this is a show. True, the previous show is not as bad as the "Delight of Love", but it is also bad. <br /> <br /> Keenan reminds me of Ivory Wayans's "Live in the 90s" show. boxer Mike Tyson signed a dating affair called "Love Connection" and chose "Robin Givens" for a date. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mike has spoken well of how history is, This show reminds me. <br /> <br /> The man is chosen and given names, more - (I think that a clever man would not allow an intelligent man to think of a smart woman), his mother - embarrassed to appear on television, giving him a name that is gait. However, these are <br /> people who live in the Caucasus, is it fake as new implant supplements? Network for 15 minutes fame at the time of announcement and hundreds of thousands dollars? (Well, you can not hate them to try to make a money) Perhaps a miracle - who wants to be over an hour with this woman? Or wonder her mother and her next show will be at WWF! <br /> <br /> In any way, this is a train crash that you've seen a few times, so shock is low. <br /> <br /> No bumping or turning is a more exciting train crash than any other. Complaints for the lowest common denominator and the "end" of reality are another nail to the immediate end of what is to be done.
