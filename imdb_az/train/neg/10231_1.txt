Of course, I am very surprised that he has spent about two hours on his debut proposal based on the brilliant interpretations of Steven Smith. Are all of them written on his palsy? Lack of movement, irritation and use of music, the script is simply terrific and the actors are the best mediator (except gardener). I think we need to support the efforts of a young filmmaker, but I'm brilliant, saying that he will not encourage him to repeat the same mistakes, that is, to write his own writings and continue to use the same actors for another. Yes, the first movie, low budget and so on. - I'm doing it, but there are also members of the community, and it's not just scratch.
