MEN'S CLAIMS! <br /> <br /> I sat down late and watched this movie, basically, I liked and appreciated Singleton's "Boyz's Nail" as well. But I have to say that this is a big disappointment, and everything is what I hate about clich√©s, the so-called "message" movies. <br /> <br /> The game's main weakness (pop stars and models do not necessarily make good players ... pay attention), difficult situations to swallow (the victim of aggression turns into a night-time pleasure?), but all this strengthens every kind of stereotype you can think of the worst. <br /> <br /> In the second half of the film, he has become an animated film of his characteristic, and maybe you have not lost yourself for a single player. <br /> <br /> Causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, only the sensitization of the consequences of these problems ends. This message is contradictory, with a sense of confusion and lack of common loyalty. As for the film's results, I found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative, and mildly insulting. <br /> <br /> If I am afraid to recapture this movie again, I would like to repeat the "Ali Learning" movie, then go to "American History X" ... just because Tyra Banks did not watch it then go to a job.
