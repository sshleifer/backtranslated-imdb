I read it. We just finished the class at Hatchet and this movie is not like a book. (1) Brian is actually eating wolves in the book. (2) He did not know the pilot's name. (3) Her mother betrayed her father in a stationary wagon, where everyone could see. (4) Mommy cheating hair is not black hair, but blonde. <br /> <br /> Now for the non-realistic parts of the film: (1) You can not shoot a window from a window with a twelve-year-old fist. <br /> <br /> The child playing Brian was a terrific player for the player. <br /> <br /> However, I believe that the decor was effective, though I doubt that the director would read the book. <br /> <br /> If you do not read this book, Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, but if you do, start a complaint letter to the director.
