This effort was like a strange television movie ... I do not recall being released in these theaters ... If so, it died quickly. Looking at the DVD, it was clear that this movie was supposed to be much more than the comfort of our bedroom ... Ed Lauter is an art critic, a longing lane? There must be a fun turning point ... I did not see Ed because he was the longest yard ... except for Pompeo, he acted more or less than Baldwin's head ... He was a girl of the zero charisma Pompeon's daughter ... played every scene as a beloved beloved beloved ... I deliver any 3 year old slow line I have not yet seen ... <br /> <br /> The sad scenes gave my wife and headache ... very fast cutting and opening-bashing ... If you want to shoot a scene in Barcelona, ​​shooting to exploit the beauty of your several WIDE fonts, right? The whole story was fairly usable and overwhelming, but hey, we have a "Life Juice ..."
