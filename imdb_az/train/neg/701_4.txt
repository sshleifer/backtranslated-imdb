During the Christmas holidays, a group of colleagues remain behind to replace the dwelling and apartment buildings. <br /> <br /> A deadly, chuck-wearing psycho to make the job a little more difficult, the band's halls are dropped by offering a variety of fierce ways. <br /> <br /> 74 'video nasties' were listed in the 1980s in the UK, and Dorm, the blood-poured Dorm, gained a good reputation for the first time. The term "video nasty" has a few obviously strange, violent, gender, and so on. It will consider some of the images. All this is a fantasy fantasy. So after hearing all the information, I settled in Pranks (sub. Title) waiting for a sleazy slasher experience. . . and what he wanted to do was, however, completely unsuccessful. Sight, the movie is not great. Kinematography, gore (except several scenes) and overall direction all fail. It's not very nice to watch.

He is excellent. . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Subgenre: Slasher <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: There are some fearsome cold weapons, for the most part. . . but nothing special. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> <strong> Killer (s): Nah. <br /> <br /> <strong> According to Qafqazinfo, Perhaps yes, there was not enough care and it was as clear as the nose on the killer's face. <br /> <br /> Final decision: 3.75 / 10. Bah! Humbug! <br /> <br /> The three-
