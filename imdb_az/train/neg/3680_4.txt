I clearly remember the morning of 18/6/02 precisely on Tuesday. When I heard a terrible explosion, I tried to convince myself to get out of my bed. I went to the kitchen where I looked at many neighborhood views in southern Jerusalem and saw the pillar of a smoke rising from a far-off corner, and the smoke eye was followed by a minute's sirens bend. I remember hurrying in my bedroom, taking my binoculars, competing up to the kitchen and looking at a bottled bus. The bus was still near the merger station, which fell on a terrorist and killed 25 passengers by pushing a TNT device to the school. <br /> <br /> My close friend's wife sat on the back of the bus and made a seemingly arbitrary and senseless decision to save her life. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that at least one terrorist will not want to do anything about it, and it's just a matter of time before you shoot a film about it. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film has been united. <br /> <br /> The Haim Buzaglo (Hmmm, Haim Buzaglo, the film's author) controls the best part of the day with its best-selling competitions on the empty word processor page. Meanwhile, her girlfriend, who is a field reporter for the Israeli trade channel, decided to make a single piece of debt on an old face officer. <br /> <br /> Like a dejection, buzaglo is known as "what's happening on this earth with this warm babe meets me" because of a little paranoid, she is asking for a special eye. progresses in the investigation, his observations go to the game, and then to the lives of his actors. Meanwhile, metamorphosis from a comedy game has become an indictment against the fidelity of the Israeli society. <br /> <br /> As for the film's film, the film is, first of all, turned into fun in angrily editing, small cartoon symbols and invalid dialog boxes when it comes to solving the issue. <br /> <br /> I am referring to characters who are deprived of any truth dialogue and any part of reliability that the writer / director is committing to a "meaningful" film while saying "cardboard heroes". I do not talk much about it. I have not done that homeless naked men rarely go to the theater. <br /> <br /> This film is the first part of the current trilogy, Haim Buzagli said. I sincerely hope that the other two films will be opposed to the events taking place at the beginning of my vision, the world of characters that exist in the universe, and an attractive thing. /> <br /> From 10 to 4 in My MoviesOmeter. <br /> <br /> PS This film was an event in the belt leap. It was shot in ten days, the entire cast was free, and the whole movie cost was about $ 12,000 (not I lost zero or two or twelve thousand dollars). Blair is surprised to receive $ 34,000 to complete the witch's project.
