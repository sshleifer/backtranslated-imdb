Sometimes I talk about really bad movies .... Sometimes people (even talented people) combine with good intentions to create a movie and, for any reason, come out as a disaster. <br /> <br /> So, when I hear this movie, "Killer Tomatoes Attack", "Out of Space 9 Plan", "Manos-Hands Fate" etc. , "Rachel's Attic" was considered the worst film of many people for ten years, of course, I just did not see it. <br /> Boy, I regret this decision. This movie is far from bad ... it is bad that it is not even pleasant as an ordinary movie. Operation, shooting, scripts, etc. The lower budget is worse than porn movies: the sound is completely terrible, the plot is completely incomprehensible, "to move" laughs .... it's everyone's time and money. At least in porn movies, there is a porn to break up monotony, in this funny nightmare there is a man trapped in a rotten apple and has a crazy tea party. <br /> <br /> Lighting is non-existent. many "scenes" are likely to happen in the middle or in the dark. "The writer-director" (I use terms freely), David Tybor tries to kinky with captivity scenes ... but if the results are not very painful, the results would make them laugh. There is nudity, but it is a poor quality that actually acts as a sexual suppressor. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there is no information about the shootings of this film, film shoots and defects. I know that, despite my negative words (or maybe), seeing that garbage piece is not as bad as you claim to be ... even if I said it is worse and you're absolutely positive with regret (and buying and or you spend on lease).
