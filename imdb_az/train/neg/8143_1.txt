In 2006, I was dissatisfied with seeing this movie as part of the Vancouver International Film Festival. I have been participating in this festival for more than 5 years, and sometimes I've seen some bad movies. However, the 'First Bite' film has just arrived. <br /> <br /> While approaching casual, strangely disadvantaged food, the film offers a large number of canvas and stylted characters until it is a blessing to end the scene. <br /> <br /> The key actor David La Haye has failed to show any character development across the film, describing a cheerful chef from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Sub-areas, such as eating disorders, have been developed so badly that they are not compatible with any context that the movie has shown up to that point. <br /> <br /> The subject of Mysticism is to hide a film that has nothing to do with it, and it is totally heartwarming.
