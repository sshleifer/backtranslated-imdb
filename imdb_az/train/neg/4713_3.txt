My rating and Johnny Test can be guessed by this research title I have not liked. Now, I think, I know what people will say: "Do you know how bad it is? Have you ever watched it?", I watched this show several times because I'm learning movie and animation, and it's about my first animation I want to talk, because this is one of the most important things I've ever seen. The first two seasons or the first season were handmade animations. <br /> <br /> So it was a strike in my eyes, but it was a strike in my eyes, but it was a beautiful show to look after after hand. See the story of the show. The Dexter lab works very hard, but there are differences because there are two instead of a red-headed scientist and both are women. There is a talking dog (why?) And the parents' attitudes are somewhat opened. I have other people, but I do not think I can not write it down (I do not mean curse, I do not know if there are any restrictions on the words). Although everything else, Johnny is a DeeDee character. It's getting harder to become Dexter, but it just comes as a knockoff to my heart. <br /> Finally I want to talk about jokes. Do you remember some jokes that lie in the Dexters Lab? Yes, a shouting joke or two might be good, but it led me to check back at Dexter Laboratory to get back and joke. The Johnny Test forgets all of this, just about 50% of the time and stops music when it's a stupid joke or a liner. It's not a comedy, but a foolish comedy (I know some people's thoughts.) Three stooges are foolish comedy? Watch it and Johnny Test back and you laugh more than the first choice. Sometimes jokes, like Chowder, are based on strange situations that make me mad. <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify; comedy in any form, shape, or form If so, watch this show.
