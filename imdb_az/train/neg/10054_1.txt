I do not admire the first Superman movie that Richard Donner skillfully performed. <br /> <br /> In Richard Lester's Superstition 2 ... It's just something absolutely disgusting that brings us to the same film, Richard Donner. <br /> <br /> Superman's world, Kufr is required in strong doses, but Superman 2 extends far. It does not matter to Superman 2 that the screenplay insulted the intelligence of the first-year student. In a sense, there is no structure because there is zero motivation for the characters to operate, unlike the original superman of the characters. With or without his powers, Superman is the most convincing way of power (or lack). There are so many things to criticize, so I'm not going to be worried. I condemn this movie ... perhaps the Lester version slapstick is more appropriate than a moronic script based on this movie. Super-Duper is bad.
