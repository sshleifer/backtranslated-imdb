This film is distinguished for three reasons. First, taking advantage of the success of the two "Superman" series, these low-budget features have been released into theaters and initial appearances such as George Reeves and Phyllis Coates' Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is reused in the series. At the edge of the city of Silby, six miles deeper oil penetrates into the 'Mole-Men' surface. Secondly, the majority of the people, in contrast to SF occupation films, play a dominant (and controlling) force to promote propaganda and tolerance and difference. against a fierce bunch of segregator vigilantes. There is no 'gentlemen' here! Clark Kent, a well-educated and self-confident, helps in a hospital dress ("I'll manage it!") To shoot a bullet from Mole-Man! Like the Superman, he is gentle than Clarke against the sad Lois, and as the "Nazi Storm Soldiers" argues against the guards as the voice of consciousness and tolerance. <br /> <br /> Thirdly, you will see that the animated film Fleisher does not link to the "live action" flying in Superman's Adventures of Superman's two-series animated flight.
