<br /> <br /> Ang Lee's "The Hulk" is a funny book for a person who thinks. Hulk appears for a while (about 40 minutes), but then we see the conflict of the protagonist. <br /> <br /> Now, compare it to Edward Norton, where the conflict has no effect. her personality and excitement turns her into a Hulk and shrinks her pulse at 200 pounds (183 instead of 197, exactly 200). This reviewer was explained by the application of these mystic chlorine in Phantom Menace, which says that the mystical abilities can be measured by a blood test, as strong as the "force". In 2008, in the film, all Ed Norton's Bruce Banner was to hold his pulse less than 200 as it was watched by a wrapped device. <br /> <br /> Erik Bana's Hulk is a record for people, especially physically fit, with a very awesome run up to 200 pulses. The memory of his mother's death and his role in the early life of his father drowned. It is calm on the surface, but when there is a hulk under it, there is a great anger and excessive rage. But Hulk deliberately does not kill even the attackers. Basically, he just wants to get away with Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). <br /> <br /> In 2003, the film has visual impressions, but in the event of necessity incapacitates its hammer and keeps a critical scene, a fighter jet. <br /> <br /> Unlike the 2008 movie, when the refugee camp was trying to turn into a camp, attention was paid to how Hikmet Ed Norton Bruce Banner felt about Hulk (and many) it can. For him, Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment. Louis Leterrier, directed by Ed Norton, will not add any emotional dimensions to the Banner-Hulk link. The story can be summed up as follows: Banner is watched and Hulk starts butt, Banner drawn and Hulk kick butt. Repeat as needed. <br /> <br /> The only thing opposed to the 2003 movie is likely to be incompatible with comic books, such as the version of 2008. But as I'm an admirer of comic books, I'm not like a film fancier, but after reading the 2008 edition of the day I choose a loyal, but wholehearted movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe Ang Lee had read more novels. The "Iron Man", shown in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that is in harmony with the roots of comic books.
