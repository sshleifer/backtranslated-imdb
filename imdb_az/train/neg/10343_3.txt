Until the end of the 1990s, the Golden Age of Disney animated films died. This show Quack Package does not have to be DuckTales's spin-off because the show has nothing to do with DuckTales. About his wife, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, they have trouble with Donald for his uncle and are talking in hip-hop lingo and completely different than DuckTales. I choose smaller exhibition sisters from DuckTales. There are people in Duckburg and ducks are the only animals in Duckburg. Scrooge McDuck has no clarity. Stories are repeated, the plot is boring, but the animation is good. If you want a lot of rifles, I advise you to do so. If you want a better Disney show, "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
