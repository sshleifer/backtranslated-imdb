Okay, above all, Steve Irwin is in peace. You've been loved by many fans. Now ... this movie is not a movie. Steve was a TV program called "The Crocodile Hunter", which involved malicious acts, bad writings, and misconceptions in the capture or teaching of animals. Fun as an animal seeker / expert. Millions will miss it. But the whole movie idea was a big mistake. The area was so broken, it almost did not exist. Casting was terrible. Acting did not even give elementary school actors at school level. Direction should also be wrong. If you can not get a good performance from your performers, you should first be good, though the script is bad. I could write a better post. I wish I did not see this movie. Of course, watching for Scooby Doo Live Action, I watched with friends three dollars ($ 1.50 for me, $ 1.50 for my son). My son, who did not discriminate so much, welcomed the film, but he still did not want to see it again. If you want Steve Irwin's favorite memories, get a series of DVDs. Avoid this movie as a pest. If I were Steve, I would not want to be remembered for this film. Respect him: Avoid this movie!
