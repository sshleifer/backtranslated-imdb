This film is also funny and painful. "Cinemagic" almost captured me. Whatever it is, Cinemagic is not an innovative technical procedure. As a result of the accident, they "developed" and used it because they hid the "monsters" very foolish. And I do not think that the writer's "Pink" is Sid. <br /> <br /> If you're really looking for $ 200,000 for 9 days, this movie is good for a laugh. It's fun; at least I can say about it. The bat / rat / spider is highlighted.
