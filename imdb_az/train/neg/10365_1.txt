Terrible. This tension must be buried. What a scandal. Terrible writing, the characters are convincing. Terrible Schlock! Take some B-stars out of a badly written POS and give them some credit, but it does not result in failure. <br /> <br /> If you do not have to write ten lines on this movie, I will review this word, ending with 'sh' and ending with 'it'. <br /> <br /> The terrible ending is delayed. Who writes this post? The ending of this film is very weak, and it is weak that it does not have anything to do with the storyline, or it's fraudulent. Probably depends on the number of people in this movie. It's a good thing for the actors to go out because it's a career killer. They will see something difficult for them. At least there is no one who is as important as future investors. <br /> <br /> Because it's very important for me. <br /> <br /> This is back.
