<br /> <br /> Ela Longoria proves that she will not be able to shoot this horrible romantic movie. comedy, and more, that she really does not have the time to comedy. It is like a ghost returning to the ground to discuss his acquaintance with his widow. The fianc√©e Paul Rudd brings everything that is kinematic energy when playing drippy and seductive and paralyzed by Lake Bell. I was really sorry for Bell, because he seemed to have some funny talent and often worked hard to do the job. Unfortunately, he opposed Jason Biggs to create a film that is tolerant and drifted with the rest of the castle like Leo DiCaprio at the end of the "Titanic". <br /> <br /> His "Dead Body" actually cut me off because of laziness and effort. I began to think of all the interesting projects that I could not finance, because big money turned into a similar violin. Seriously, does Hollywood think of such films as good? Do you think that the filmmakers are really stupid? <br /> Level: F.
