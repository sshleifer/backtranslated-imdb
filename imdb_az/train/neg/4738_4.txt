I loved watching the original Azumi with a mix of live action manga, charming story, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), A beautiful moon called Ueto, which perfectly fits the part. So I hoped to see Azumi, but eventually I saw that I had lost a lot of tickets as Azumi 2 had landed, but they are totally two different films. very slow, moving is not very exciting but at the same time not choreographed and not a lot of character development. It's actually managed by the same man who is responsible for further downplaying the monster franchise of TOHO (if possible!), Ryuhei Kitamura agrees with some other former reviewers, but there are some beautiful Japanese wooden scenery we look at while slow, and we present very briefly. Fighting with the Spider boy (straight Monkey episode) in the Bombay Forest, onl, was killed very easily without a fight. y memorable battle scene. At Azumi 1, we were in the stage of climactic combat with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us Azumi cape! The end of Azumi's grief was unbelievable, but the moon is still not doing well. He looks great on his paw ... but where did he get him? I do not think I'll see it again and again! ... regrettably.
