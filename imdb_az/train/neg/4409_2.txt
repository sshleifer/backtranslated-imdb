Is it a regular, routine western (directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, so any wonder?). Army Colonel Brian Keith talked with smarmy bandit Dean Martin, who was murdering Colonel's wife, Honor Blackman, who had never found the place where Goldfinger played Pussy Galore. Fist-battles, shooting, stagecoach robberies, and Denver Pyle's a supporting role ... in other words, is not entirely new and original. Speaking of a small monoton, Keith begins to branch up with a prostitute ("Shocked" after she's released in the TV's Family Business), otherwise this low-lease material throws Keith's lover's talent, and is bad news for Dino. Writing and many low-cost humor in lowball humor. * From ****
