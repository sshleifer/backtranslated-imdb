I hoped that this film would be similar to the "The Gamers" prepared by Mr. Gentlemen Productions for a lifetime (this is highly recommended). Boy, what a disappointment! The film is shot in a fake documentary style known by the office, but it does not convey it. The reason for this is partially effective, but rather the writing and direction. True, it may be ridiculous to use each song's clich√© to play a role, but it's done in a highly predictable way. At the start of each scene you will know what will be the "joke". Perhaps the biggest problem is everything from above. There is nothing flawed in this film if it had a "heroic" nickname or 80s style of fake heroism, it would not have been much noticeable. In some scenes, "No, I wonder why they thought it would be funny," but the way of implementation implements all the joke with a joke.
