'60s is sometimes a fun movie, most of the entertainment is laughing at the movie. It is very incomplete and contains a lot of boring elements. For example, switch between black and white and color. If done correctly, it could have been quite effective, but it was a worry because it was done in a bad way and was already affected by a very bad experience; Most of the film was feeling alone. It's not too bad for a player made up of a television player, but it's obviously a bit terrible at other times. Most of the events did not relate to each other and ended in confusion. How did this family end up in many major events in the 1960s? The latter was very pleasant to my taste. Because it was hollywooded, everything was going to get out right at the end. I advise you not to waste your time in the 1960s and do something else. I'm glad to see it in class, not in its class. I'm convinced that the best part of the film is that of Bob Dylan's music. These are my illogical thoughts about nakedness. Hopefully, I will take my advice and stay away from it.
