Everyone is confused about the subject and does not realize how the movie was made. Snow, the silent man is good, the winner is missing - well, the cricket aspect is great, but the film is generally moderate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm sure the movie is more interesting. The songs are just popped up, and I have to draw the scenes from the same angle to show different angles. <br /> <br /> Even if it moves well. Expected.
