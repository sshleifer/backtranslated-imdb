First, there is nothing wrong with learning Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah, and other prophetic books. There is nothing wrong with taking this movie to try to present the gospel message. So, my effort with this film is not about his sincerity or desires. As a Christian, I am convinced that despite being an amilianialist, I will face a great deal of difficulty and will return as Christ has said many times. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this film at a low level. No matter how much I appreciate this movie, it's not sincerity or message, more precisely, lack of production values, terrible writing, mediocre behavior and miserable FX. This film remains there with the cheesiest scifi feeds of the 1950s. No, this film is part of the 9th Plandan Outerspace. <br /> <br /> In the Apocalypse genre, filmmakers have only been unsuccessful in trying to film the movie for the last time. </ p> </ font> </ font> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ b> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < is not one of them. The crew of the MST3K was not lamped this time.
