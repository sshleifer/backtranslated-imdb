This movie was terrible. The first half hour is very similar ... well, apologies for not having articulation, but it was just a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene was photographed at Clockwork first! Probably the Clockwork poster on the hero's wall was a tribute, but ripoff is a more appropriate word. The film was shot right from the Kubrick classic and was filmed by the new director. Blind director. Unfortunately, when the murder of Kubrick is stopped, the film gets worse. As one other commentator puts it, the depth of this film falls below your throat. Arrogant, self-destructive, and eventually meaningless. <br /> <br /> If there were any real character development in this movie, the heroes touched a nerve. I did not feel anything for this man. I think I'm alcohol, so if anyone can feel something for himself, I will be. Terrifying character development, dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> This is the worst part of the movie. For the movie "Alcohol, 16", alcoholism is a challenging factor. Look at the first paragraph - it was the spark of A Clockwork Orange that could not stand on me. A more favorable address would be even better than "16 Years of Violence." <br /> <br /> Just give yourself a blessing and avoid this movie. Do not take into account our advice and take it anyway, drink it. Trust me.
