Only Dark in the Dark plays the most favorite role of all time. When I look at the PC screen all night, I remember trying to escape from this kiosk, and actually excited when the monsters came to charge them in a surprising way. Think of it now - I'm tired of the movies made from a computer game. I do not recall a story of success in this new Hollywood genre, and some have enough fun to watch. And still a great fan of the game, I could not resist. I'm logical, if the movie has a field that resembles a game, that would be good. <br /> <br /> Man, 90 minutes of my life (seemed like 300) would never come back. If I had this chance, then I would have to rebuild my sock. This is not so in the category "not so bad, funny". You would even think that Christian Slater was less meaningful than joining with this sad bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I do not complain about her existence. However, the purpose of putting this dwarf into a leading role is to have sex scene - I've seen more of her body at press conferences - and I fully understand and support (hey, I am a boy!). <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with that. Do not waste your time doing it for you. The story's reliability is below, "I did not have sex with Lewinski." <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Kids, I suggest the worst movies One of the few hooks above 'Street Fighter', Video game. A better story, acting and more exciting. As for the movie, there are spoilers here - it's STINKS! Wait for the pc version.
