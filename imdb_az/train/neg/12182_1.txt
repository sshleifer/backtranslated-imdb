Where do you start? I think it's too insult to the original Annie with Aileen Quimnn. I love the movie Annie and I was expecting it to be a brilliant movie, but I was very surprised! Annie appeared a few years before I was born, now I'm 25 and Annie is still one of my favorite films. So I was very excited to see Annie 2. , any characters were authentic? very poorly written, directed and acted. It's not a movie I want to see again, and any Annie lover, I advise not to watch this movie because it will be very disappointing. It is not a bad thing for young girls to perform, but they still do not compare with the original
