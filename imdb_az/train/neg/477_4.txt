<br /> <br /> I read somewhere that when Kai Francis did not refuse to pay, Warner Bros responded by knocking him down to the rest of his contract. <br /> <br /> He decided to take the money. But his career was damaged. <br /> <br /> This is what explains what's happening on the Comet on Broadway. (Although Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter have not disclosed what that is). "Ludicrous" is the word used and targeted by others for the form of this film. Murder claim. His rich vaudeville career. His success in London. Last scene with her daughter. No sense will not lead to a logical subsequent part. <br /> <br /> Both teams and suits seemed to be the B-movie. And his hair! Turner is showing a lot of movies this month. Look at any one and give yourself a blessing.
