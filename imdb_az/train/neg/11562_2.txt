Rich widow Anthony Steffen (as Alan Cunningham) is a sadomasochistic lover and British Lord. He brings the red-haired women to the heart, scatters them and kills them. Black stripper Erika Blanc (like Susie) temporarily gets away. Mr. Steffen is dismissed by his wife, Evelyn, who died from birth. In therapy, she decides to marry again after she meets a beautiful blonde Marina Malfatti (like Gladys). At the end of the film, they will be able to dig a few tombstones. "Evelyn at night came out of the graveyard" is at least a great name. <br /> <br /> ** La notte che Evelyn usc√¨ dalla tomba (1971) Emilio Miraglia ~ Anthony Steffen, Marina Malfatti, Erika Blanc
