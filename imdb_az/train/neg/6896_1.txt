Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow my judges to rate less than 1. What a shame. This horrible movie is so bad that I really have done a damn thing before it's over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> Daily comic book style, but in reality there was nothing like this. The most similar thing is the dog pad under your shoe. <br /> <br /> Why is it so good for video stores to spend this kind of talk worse than regular gaps and secondary school drama classes? Leadership is beyond me. We rent movies to see something better on television. Judges are worse than the worst SciFi Channel. I'm going to return my money from Hollywood Video.
