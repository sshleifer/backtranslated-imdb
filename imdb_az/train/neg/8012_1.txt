As a lesbian I always love movies and gay lesbian films. But with such a similarity, it is enough to block any audience. <br /> <br /> I was expecting something to happen - everything! to make a sense of meaning. What happened. It was trivial scenes, in any way it had nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> After an hour or more of this nonsense I just quit it. <br /> <br /> 1 Star - it's not even worth it.
