So, we see the extra pictures of the Brando movie ... interesting, but not exactly Oscar's worthwhile things. Susannah York was a tough one. A new area where Lois found Clark is a little unbelievable because Superman does not realize that there are gaps in place outside the actual bullet. The real bullets would penetrate their clothes and then throw it down, but do not forget ... Listen to Donner's version of Leecher's version that makes it even more logical. President Zod "accuses" Washington's monument when it was originally on Rushmore Mountain. That line tweaking that scene was pretty absurd. Supermann's "freedom of press" line was delivered better and was silent in comparison with "going away", which was closely related to the truck's stop at Clark's previous scene. Then it ends with "returning to the world to restore it." This turned everything around in the film and surprised exactly where the rocket was designed for Hackensack, since NJ, Zod and the company did not have more.
