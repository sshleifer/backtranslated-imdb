I'm thrilled to be supporting a movie with a Christian theme from everything I read about the movie. Everything about the movie was very kind. Especially writing! Without a good record, a movie has no chance. The writer / director said in an interview that he did not want to co-ordinate the topic with the subject. Believe me, this is not a big surprise. I was waiting for the teenage / young adolescence to open, but it never did. I'm very disappointed with someone who's been divorced. This movie would have been a comfort to me when I first went to the emotional confusion that my divorce could bring to life as a Christian!
