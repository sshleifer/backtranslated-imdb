There is no question in the film about who is in the commanding staff training: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays a soldier who is committed to military discipline when creating a new kind of soldier. But it is not as tough as unfair or hostile. They even change their views on the value of women working in the army. He is difficult, but at other times he is an open mix of coaches and pastors, perfect roles in other films. His character is the basis of the action in which everything is transformed. O'Brien's role is natural and plays gentle. This film helps two things: O'Brien's performance and spectacular special effects.
