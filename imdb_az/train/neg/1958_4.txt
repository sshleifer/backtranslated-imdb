What to start. This film began as something that seems to be dismantling the "Dark Waterfalls". An old, treacherous woman living in the forest presents teeth to children. I know? Then it changes. In "Dark Waterfalls", the dummy killed the fairy only when you saw it. In this film, the dummies killed you, no matter what the fairy. Why do they need a rockworm, hippie girlfriend, or Bubba and their sister? I do not know if the movie was already nice. Manufacturers seemed to be sitting around and decided that they needed to put more people in the film, so the dance would kill fairy people. Although a beautiful blonde girl is unlikely to be described as a bubble head for a change. Okay, I rent it, but I will not offer you a purchase.
