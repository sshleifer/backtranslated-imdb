At the beginning of the film, beautiful scenes of photography and fox were beautiful. However, the story was very slow and boring. And then the little girl begins to fox, it leads to tragic events. We live in the forest and often see foxes. Everything that everyone needs to know is to put wild animals in the wild and use them remotely. This film sets an example for the children who will watch it while trying to make an animal a wild creature. I do not think the purpose of the story will be. After the terrible events with the mother's fox, the little girl still wanted to play with her sets. Will he never learn his lesson? There are other scenes showing predatory animals to touch, which is only added to trauma to children watching this movie. This film was a disappointment. And what a terrible story he says. The last narrative dialogue was so stupid, then my husband and I screamed on television! I absolutely hated this movie and I never recommend it to anyone!
