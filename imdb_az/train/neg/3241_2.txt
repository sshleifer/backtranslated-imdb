This film has a potential, but the really bad one is Lindsay Crouse. I have never seen him anywhere else, and maybe some other Crouse fans, as with something else, but his performance in this movie is poor. <br /> <br /> It is robotic to convey it. When he sent his lines, he tried to make sure that the lines were correct and that he simply read it at the top of the list. So his voice has little entertainment. I do not believe anyone who plays one of the leading roles in a movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color" : red; "> <br /> <br /> However, I liked the story where it went, and I continued to look at it. The first part of the script is a good movie. But the latter also caused disappointment. Perhaps, if the player was better, he likened it.
