Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired master thief who is forced to "play" when his younger brother faces death because he did not order his younger brother, English criminal Raymond Calitri. The job will include "lift" up to 50 cars or Calitri within 24 hours. So Raines collects a group that will soon rely on and identifies the task being handled. But police leave it and some cars on the list are not easy. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan and Timothy Olyphant. Everyone is worth more. There is enough horsepower to boost a Porsche 998 Turbo. Trouble, this is a lot of situations, not many car parks, rather than excessive characters, not enough pleasure. Without a doubt, it refers to Bruckheimer / Simpson, with noisy noise and window slippage, scattering, and the bonkers scripts directed by Salsa by Dominic Sena. This is basically H.B. Halicki's 1924 indie film, the same name as the proposition for the film based on the adrenaline-fueled cars. Potentially unsurpassed potential. There are one or two high-stroke moments, but accurate, but not welcome. <br /> <br /> According to this film, first of all, never, first of all, is not implemented. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Automotive fans will receive something like this, But not really, it is very poor. 4/10
