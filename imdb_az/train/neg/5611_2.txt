I personally found this movie horrible, first of all it was objective and provided one side of the discussion. The only people we know, Billy Grahm, have managed to become many people from the Revolution. Secondly, the very existence of Jesus (Yeshua), devious Christianity, and Mel Gibson's scenes from The Passion deviated from the point of view. As a result, the director contacts with the former director of the Conservative Private School to intervene and tries to trap him into teaching the children in the faith. Oh and Techno Music made it even harder to watch the movie.
