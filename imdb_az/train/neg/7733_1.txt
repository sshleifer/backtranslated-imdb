What a shame! It's been checking out that I found a James Garner gem found out and what turned out to be a stinker! The quality of the production was good, but the plot was undoubtedly naked and I'm honest, I've been living for just over a couple of hours and now I say a lot. The film really has no irreplaceable quality, and if it does, it will give Hallmark a bad name. There is nothing for those who insist on knowing who you are, and that's not a good thing. We are exposed to an old bird woman, one of the most terrible creatures to walk around the globe. This is really the only lover of the only person she can agree with. He drags one after another into confusion, leads one to another embarrassing state and proud all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief it was! It does not take time to watch, so give yourself a blessing and skip it; you'll be glad if you know how bad it is.
