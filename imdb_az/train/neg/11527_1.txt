<br /> <br /> The film begins as a comic heroic movie. Not the boy's parents, but the 1st girl looks mad at school. Nothing in the film is surprising, there is nothing you can not imagine in the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us whether he is not a good actor or any actor in the world can keep such a scenario. Maybe ten-year-olds can enjoy the movie, but it's a little bit of violence for young people. X-men, Batman and Spawn can not move without thinking. All of these names are better. Finally, I've been in the last 20 minutes! It would be good if there was a good thing, it was computerization, but that's not a costly tree! So my recomendation: Although though you do not see this movie!
