Karl Jr and his father are now running an army far from an island. They catch a stagnant trio on the island. After a while, he would fight with whom. (well-resumed) It would be good if someone would see it remotely or the production had been prepared for up to one week without a week (I could have had overexxgestering, probably only a few days). The terrible dubbing did not bother me, and if I were really drunk, I suspect some might have been a little laughable .... maybe. But, in just 78 minutes, the movie still feels a long way .. Oh, I know ... 78 minutes. <br /> <br /> My Value: F <br /> DVD Extras: Bonus movie: "Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence"; and Trailers for other Shock-o-Rama movies
