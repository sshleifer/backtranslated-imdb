This british movie is really terrible and it's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is out there, though he's already sleeping. The idea of ​​a bomber on a train is good ... but this train is over for the majority of the movie! No action, no action, just a static train. The area where the train is parked is empty, so there is no danger to anyone. In fact, this is a tension movie which can be used in a film class to film a movie. Full audiences know that there are no characters in the audience, perhaps a fact that the director really does not know. SPOILER: There are actually two bombs on the train, but we only believe in one. After the first bomb has been broken, he feels that there is no reason for watching the movie. But in the last minute, there are two people who have no motivation for his actions. And when the bomb gets up, we are confident that even the classic "ticking bomb" does not have a consistency sequence. A good 10 minutes or more Glenn Ford's French spouse is spending the time thinking of leaving him and then wondering where he is. It is such a bewildering character that we do not agree with it, but then there is nothing emotional about it. Most of the other characters are lacking in personality and no one has any problem or problem. It's only 72 minutes, but it's been a long time since it's so tedious and boring. Do not waste your time.
