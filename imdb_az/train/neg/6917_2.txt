The story of a man (here the writer) who has sold his spirit to the devil to earn his most passion in life is success. The powerful "Christmanish" message (our only wish in life is to find love, respect and good friendship) and a very long test, an unfunny script to understand ("go home and write better"), the laughing lines agent Hopkins's devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is no sexual or evil) scene at the end of which he beat up for all the bad things he was characterizing. Actors (Baldwin is also a director, Cattrall's role as "Sex and City", and Aykroyd with some comic lines in limited role) is not bad. P.S. Not a well-known Greek movie, Alloimono Stous Neous, but a brilliant adaptation of this myth (the spirit of the devil to restore the old man's youth)
