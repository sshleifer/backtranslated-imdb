It is a film that attempts to retune the history of Thailand, located in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought through the line of Thai films that I had Thai actors speaking of the Thai and martial arts traditions. Yes, there is none. This film is entirely in English, full of Anglo actors and production values ​​are so terrible funny .... but not funny! Who can we blame for this trash? The majority of players, dialogues and kits were pretty bad. Some of the battle scenes resembled choreography by a local tram club. The special effects were also very bad, but only a few people were pushed to the cheapest animated screen. A few thousand addas have a great, epic-style open battle scene where he goes to a pitch in his suit, but when two troops meet in battle - HA! What a joke! There are several beauties in the film. Unfortunately, they did not show a bit more skin. At least it would be something to thank for the kids. Please do not worry.
