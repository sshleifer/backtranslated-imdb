As an army veteran, I was deeply hurt by this movie. It is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam War. I know that real SF soldiers say that they are disgraced by this misfortune. It would be better if you were shown as a movie satire or even a cartoon. However, I have been accepted by many people, especially abroad. Silly was judging me and the Americans in this movie everywhere I went to Europe in the late 80s. Is it real? Hmm, let's see. A crazy, muscle-related kretin leads a prison gang for a secret mission to SE Asia to release some Asian POW. In a fierce battle, it kills about 500 enemy soldiers with a M-60 machine gun, and never heats it. And do not miss it, running a 32lb weapon with a handle. I can continue, but I'm headaches. I gave it a bit better than Rambo III.
