What was the worst film of 2003? "There's a cat on the hat?" "Gigli?" Uncle Mais! I have suggested that this is a strange little movie that started in the beginning of this year. Badly written, filthy, and worse, if I behave badly, "Order" is a black hole in the movie - even the smallest fun movie will not be able to escape even the horizon of the event. <br /> <br /> You know that manufacturers believe their audience will not be smart enough. They first changed the name of the film "Sin Eaters" because the Americans believed that those who were guilty were too stupid to understand what happened. <br /> <br /> Therefore, they're called a total headline and a picture of Heath Ledger's picture is enough to get you there. <br /> And, hey, what do you know, they were right! I saw my old girlfriend, Heathin, and dragged inside. Congratulations, manufacturers, acquainted with your target market. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Heath is his instructor. Perhaps nobody in his right mind will believe that he knows the smallest things in religion and that he will have less celibate nuns. Only one member of this order is a comic alcoholic fat. As I did not want to see the return of brown spirits on the big screen, my humorous attempts reminded me of all the paintings I had seen in my lyceum, imitating Monti Python, that Python would be funny if they only read the lines. <br /> <br /> If I speak again, there will be a danger of creating spoilers. Undoubtedly, it is his creation that spoils this movie for me.
