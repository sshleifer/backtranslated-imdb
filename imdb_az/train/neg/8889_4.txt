This is the first of the BBC series I've watched, and it's the same if all of them look like this. The full text of the game is practically in all other departments of Romeo & Juliet, and it goes for it. Alvin Rakoff reveals himself as a technically and fearsome director. In the past, even a class student made mistakes in such a way. For example, ask Ibrahim and Baltasar to make the first shot of the opening scene or the nurse into Friar Lawrence's cell, ask him where Romeo is, and if he asked if he would see it openly, he was blind. And in the end, because each player is wrong and some are good actors. Rebecca Saire I always imagine it looks like Juliet, and she does not look like a bad actress for teenagers, but her passion does not have any passion. Patrick Ryecart is even worse than Romeo, not as dull as Juliet, a very old and even invisible way to look like Malcolm McDowell and Chucky's puppy. It is not possible to put them together and to feel nothing for each other. Probably the main story of the greatest love story written. Alan Rickman first plays Tybalt on the screen as Darth Vader, the complexity of Shakespeare's design, a great mistake that no hero is a hero or a devil, but all the flawed people. This Tybalt seems very important because we do not believe in the sadness of the characters after his death. As for Paris, I used to think of Spaceballs as "Prince Valium." Only Celia Johnson tries to make the Nurse a character of justice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In 168 minutes, this production will not empathize with us symbols, because we believe in the role of empathy in characters. The best screen version is still Franko Zeffirelli. But to be fair, this BBC is not as bad as a crime against Humanity, which is a retrospective version of George Cukor's atheist backbone or Baz Luhrmann's long-term MTV video. 4/10.
