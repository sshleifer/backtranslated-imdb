I ran away from the start, but I saw most of them. <br /> <br /> In some DVDs, a friend stayed in a cheap room at FIE. <br /> <br /> The eighties are too short, and still many are still too long. Most of them have forgotten to be funny! <br /> <br /> Racist / sexist / "homophobic" humor on people living in the Caucasus, using racist terms for many stereotypes or people who have sketches. <br /> <br /> And I'm having trouble ... The logo of the Tunel Vision network is a mouthwatering mouth with an eyelid inside it. The mouth is opened and closed on eyelids as eyelids. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment there is. Most of the actors went to better things and were happy that the bomb did not get them back.
