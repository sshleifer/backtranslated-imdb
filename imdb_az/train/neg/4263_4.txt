Dream movie The performance of the actors is poor. Sets are good, it would be better. The story is also weak. The ranks of the battle are terrible. The voices and the quality of the movie are bare. The history of the Kazakh people was not very bad. More Kazakh actors played a role in this film. It should also be in the Kazakh language. Kuno Becker and Jay Hernandez are Spanish origin. I can not get it. The Spanish people after playing the Turkish-Mongolian people. This film is a shame of Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibrahimbeyov disappointed me. One of the world's most beautiful directors. The director of Czekh is complicated, because he is not a nomadic origin, he does not know the true spirit and history of immigrants.
