Although Leon is beautiful at SNL, it's only in a minute. As with many SNL skits-to-movies, it can not fill 90 minutes. There are some cute moments (you see on the trailer), but most actors are spent. Tim Meadows does his best, but the plot does not have too many points. Farrell has a bit of it. Farrell can be the most funniest man ... but not in this movie. What a shame.
