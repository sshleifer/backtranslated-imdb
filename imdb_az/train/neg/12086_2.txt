... this verson does not mix badly with Bard. It is also a terrifying minimalist product, Hamlet's Dutch cousin expresses a clear Spanishman (Ricardo Montalbano), and Maximilian Schell is never as superior as before. Most of the dialogs are useless and the MST3K version has to point out that the outputs are too long. * Duh * does not hit me like an incredibly humorous. Often behaves badly.
