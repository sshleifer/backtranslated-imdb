Someone praised Atlantis: _The_Lost_Empire_, Disney adventure for adults. <br /> <br /> This script is not for adult thinking, at least I do not think. <br /> <br /> This script is a live action movie that shoots someone else as a crap that you do not sell for adults. Many old adventure film "crack team" was better (think _The Dirty Dozen), but this motifdə Atlantis is one of the worst films. The character is weak. Even the rear part of each member's stock is seen as the stockholder and is mistakenly the best. My dad is a tomboy mechanic who always wanted his son, MD / Medical Man, even if we did not see it before, we've already seen the mixed-up quarrels. Don Novello (Fr. Guido Sarducci) is linked by a friend to a friend playing Vinninin story about a flower shop was demolished and completely non-specific way. <br /> <br /> Only the main character, Milo Thatch, has any depth voiced by the young Atlantis-foolish academic Michael J. Fox. Milo's father, who has grown up his search for Atlantis, also continues. On the opening scene, his father shows many young Milo who knees out his lips over his head. <br /> <br /> And while the characters were good, the best part about Atlantis was a voice. talent Maybe Milo's depth is not as thicker as Fox's charm. Commander Rourke did not lose anything called by James Garner. Although Rourke is a very rugged military type, Garner simply shows his breathing lifestyle to his characters. Garner's vocal performance is a high point. I'm sorry to say that Leonard Nimoy, King of Death, is not obligatory. Əlavə olaraq, Don Novello, yıxılma mütəxəssisi Vinni Santorini də bir və ya iki yaxşı, komik xətt üçün diqqət çəkdi - amma hər halda Ata Guido Sarducci'yi sevdim. <br /> <br /> Also good things were Computer Animation. COMPLETE PROGRAM animation, that is. Character animation is not as bad for Disney since the minimalism that brought Don Bluth out of the door. Character animation does not do anything if no plain characters are already created. <br /> <br /> Apart from landscapes, buildings and vehicles, there is nothing to impress. <br /> <br /> This area was the worst. Some people say hackneyed or trite. I am not sure of that. Any used area can be transformed into something new with appropriate treatment. Shakespeare often began a famous story and composition and was only famous for putting a new coat. Thus, treatment is something. <br /> <br /> <strong> Despite the events in the Caucasus, the area was bad. The bridges of the plot are cut as twins and are not the last. <br /> <br /> Milo, Runic or the Celtic symbols were incorrectly transliterated and our problems had begun when we realized that we had to read "Island of the Island" on the "Irish coast." The authors of the book need to know Irish "for Ireland" or Eireann and not to see the great, Latin Hibernian. But more than that, you need to know about the assassination of the Viking island Island and the island of Greenland Greenland. <br /> <br /> Therefore, writers are forced to require the English version of the runic version and post-roman history. Long before it was supposed that Atlantis had fallen into the cave. <br /> <br /> Writing is more reliable without the tips and less technology available compared to Milo. <br /> <br /> 2. Shepard was written before sunset Atlantisin magazine, or caves, or the King "in the eyes of the King" could not do anything about anything false. It was written after the sinking of the land, but without the technology of the Miles expedition, Leviathan did not sing anyone. So what more can you learn about this from now on? And why it will be written in Atlanta? <br /> <br /> Automatical writing and neat or astral travel can explain these things. But the deception and the astral journey do not require hepard to write to Atlantis. So, some sort of autos must be. Since no one can read in Atlantic, crystal beams must have the spirit of spirits coming to the surface. That would be more meaningful. But it could also be explained in the movie: Milo could discern that this force had brought him all his life - in dreams. This film should be investigated. <br /> <br /> 3. The Atlantic simply should not understand modern languages. No one expected the true Hindu-Europeans to talk in Europe, according to Romans, very difficult "c" or "French" ("sh", few!) 4. The present Atlantis before the disaster they have read it when they look but still are unable to read what they use or work on similar machines. <br /> <br /> 5. Massless Despair shows a significant defect in the film, which seems to have nothing to do with culture until Milo but it is not a good science fiction that leads down to the end of Atlantic school systems and is the cause of Atlantis's illiteracy, even if it is not a constant struggle to survive. <br /> <br /> 5. How to handle the machine because of the inability to read or work on the subject but it is not so young that the circulation of desires - But anything else ** HARDLY assigns to his father Deification! The foolishness of my kashakim was almost indefinitely clear of the existence of his people. A group of Catholics was killed, and when it was not boiled with the previous lava, the Giant Robots were not there to protect them until they could not get anyone to kill (where not many killed, massive slide in culture and progress). <br /> <br /> The author Kəsakımın after breaking uniqueness, Kida Atlantının tried to connect to the image of his father in a period of great kings! <br /> <br /> Although Milo was the only one who could read Atlantis, Rourke and others knew enough to find the book of confusion and find a page on the crystal - he would be a crystal and some stylized astrology or "sun diagram 7. When Milo's father talked to Rourke, he did not explain what Rourke was reading as part of Milo's book, Milo, probably not a horny page in the book. did not find the sign, but left the page that Rourke had in his hand - nothing was just "something that was not right." Milo would not suspect anything until Milo's head warned that someone in the word "crystal" would steal someone else. "<br /> <br /> 8. the crew "double cross" is not a character change. We have learned that Winnie, sweet, Audrey and Cookie went along with Rourke from the beginning. However, the "ur sowing change. "It was a change and better motivation needed. <br /> <br /> 9. Instead of filling the area where the sequence is different than the one we missed out of the silver lava. This fluid; <br /> <br /> <strong> Gambling events in the Caucasus. Last STINKS! - and there is no other meaning to shudder political integrity. The cease-fire has been restored, Atlantis is already a weak force, so it requires coddling. The giant robot guardians and those who turn blue lightning think that we are less afraid of them. Technology is superior to us and definitely in the early 20th century. In the end, Milo should teach Atlantia to read, why? The whole idea is not to leave their little quiet, attractive culture, to send it to a hyper drive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Pulp. The film fails to agree with this idea. But there were also many dima novels, because they just had to pay to see the subtle symbols. Pulpa stories, in any case, are part of the so-called "adult can not sell". We have become a little more advanced and our pulp needs to grow. Lost Ark Raiders have never lost his sense of pulp and run away very badly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the 10th to 4th movie is pleasant,
