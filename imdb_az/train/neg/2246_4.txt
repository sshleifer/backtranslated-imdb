I have never seen the original Judy Garland version in 1954, so there is no comparison. Also, for some years, but I did not find this story suddenly or romantic. The story tells the story of two lovers who have their musical career in the opposite direction. John Norman Howard is an outrageous rocky star on an enemy who is romantic with Esther Hoffman, a fresh, talented new performance. Key role actors Kris Christofferson and Barbra Streisand have enough of their role, but neither their chemistry nor the plot has left a mark on me. The film draws attention only from one point and is a great performance of Streisand's Oscar-winning "Evergreen" song. He really has a strong and spectacular voice.
