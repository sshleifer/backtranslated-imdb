The director, equipped with chains and leather, warned audiences that they wanted to see a "skillful" film on Thursday at the SF Framework Film Festival. Experimental? Leave the camcorder to the rear seat of the car, allow the tape to be erased and all points in sight. An uninterrupted past road show manqu√© starts nowhere and the audience is out of place. The violent violence that opened the movie drove more than one boss from Castro's theater. I would also leave, but my cine-buddy had to go home, and it was able to see the worst of the meridian until the last. When it came to the lights, the audience was very kind. Tidy applause. Former questions of the producer where they are satisfied with the product. Avoid this movie!
