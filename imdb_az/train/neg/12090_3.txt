Although I can see the potentially irreplaceable features of this film through its intruder, although the painful long nature of the scene structure is so much to ask from many viewers. <br /> <br /> This made it even harder to describe the mother, who was the first to win the first place in Cannes in 2001, with huge gaps in the scenario "your father is dead today." I think it's a shock. Probably this year's movie for the movie Noir was frankly hopeless for a sadistic thing like this movie. I understood long sight as a device for as much as possible to disturb the viewer, but when I adapted to non-basic character, it was too far for me and I was totally distant from the story. <br /> <br /> This is a film for the most influential admirer of the film and a film that does not expect any happiness to watch a movie after its end. I love movies like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for Dream" - it was more of a concern, but at least it gave the audience something to adjust and pacing. The slow and painful silence scene to watch these teachers was just too weak after the scene, so I found it tiring - I would like to love this movie at any time.
