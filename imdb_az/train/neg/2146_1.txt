I'll just put it here, and this is the worst outcome for a classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney published one of the greatest films of all time. Get away from great songs now, add a similar poorly populated television show. "Put together and what do you get?" I saw Crud's biggest load. After seeing it, I figured out for Disney. I had to end with Cinderella "and then lived happily." this is no trash. This film did not deserve such a continuation. I thought it was like a "twist of time", but it was moderate, but it was better. Also, what is Anastasia? He went to parties like Iago, but did not help anyone.
