<br /> <br /> So actor is bad, James Spader is a superlow. he reinforced himself with his brown cup and his strange thoughts, but that was not what other players felt. You do not get the feeling of recognizing each of the main characters. The development of the site is slow and boring, and I probably know what will happen within 30 minutes. There are a lot of ubertallented people that score scores for music / ultraboring music, a coke and credit, but that's a big shit. In the early 90's, some special effects are good. If you like Slimy Aliens, shakes and thrills does not know what this movie is. its a dull combination of its Thing, Alien 3, Alliance and some Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay production was really bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Everyone, but if you're a cold night and want to look at something, slowly it will take time.
