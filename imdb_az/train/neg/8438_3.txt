I was not the worst Laurel and Hardy ever better than Laurel and Hardy, but just. Fox movies are a great deal of freedom on DVDs and people who can not get to know L & H will be able to get acquainted with more WORST products than their classic comedies. <br /> <br /> Once again, the children have a romantic structure with a calm feeling about a boy who invented an invisible beam. She loves the daughter of the bosses who hate and who prefers some slick guy. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Fox even think it's incredible. The only scene that works for them is to hide from bedroom windows at night and Robert Mitchum is a more bizarre scene where Stan tried to sell "classic" bad guy Stan. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Do not forget about this and see if you can find a "Copper Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Outside Boy" copy.
