We found it on the shelf of a local video store, saw the "Coppola" loans and was thrilled. This film was one of the only moments of raising interest. In my opinion, it would be an attempt to try a film that failed in a failed film or a grueling film. In general, all the production seemed incredibly amatuerish. Particularly terrifying, especially in scenes shot in the small bar; The dialogue was pretty strange, it was incredible. Very disappointing.
