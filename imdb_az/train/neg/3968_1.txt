If you have seen a movie by Brian Avenet-Bradley and compare it with feedback from the IMDb, you know that the majority of comments and votes are fraudulent. TRUST ME: You'll be bored! People of the producer group write their own views (sometimes confess). But that's not enough: If you do not have a negative comment on the movie, always click on the "Never" button. That's why negative critics are always placed behind sensitive ones. <br /> <br /> The film itself is bad, bad, bad: bad mood, bad lighting, bad script, worst ending. Now believe it! <br /> <br /> Brian Avenet-Bradley can be a very good businessman. Otherwise, they can not be disclosed to people who still finance their films. (Okay, they are cheaper but, nevertheless.) But as a creative person, it is a complete failure.
