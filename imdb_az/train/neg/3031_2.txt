Tony Scott destroys everything that can be of interest to Richard Kelly's clich√©, perverted, angry scenario. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model that appeared and became a prize hunter. <br /> <br /> The problem of this garbage is not a very long story, and Scott is acting as a reminder of every stroke's excessive graphic styling. <br /> <br /> Everything in Harvey's chaotic life makes us indifferent to everything. <br /> <br /> You just do not care about Harvey. Knightley plays an indifferent, barren hairdresser who has done nothing to secure our respect. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <div> He punches unpleasant people and keeps his clothes and inhibits when he calls the situation, but he is not at least real. The film is boring. It sounded so much and I ran to one of the most frustrating source music scores I had heard for a long time. The Scottish "True Romance" summit with the Domino gang going to meet the two-person bad guys in the last twenty minutes is again inevitable! surprise! <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>. This is not an artistic, brave or experimental piece; <br /> <br /> Mickey Roarke looks good as a grizzled bounty hunter, but the "Povest" progresses. <br /> <br /> Kris Walken is transformed into another embarrassing crowd, and Dabney Coleman is always strong, used in small quantities. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by this layered, crafty surface of this movie. No matter how difficult it is to lift, it is still in a round.
