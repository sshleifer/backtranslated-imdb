As an Elvis fan, I do not understand how this project will be done. The worst Elvis movie of all time, completely unfinny, ridiculous and many mistakes about the King. Come on, Elvis has a tomb in a public park? One word about Suspect Minds in 1958 ... and these are just two examples. Mike Starr is funny (like a special impersonator), Tom Hanks is surprised by the crowd, but the boy playing the Elvis. Then the movie becomes entertaining and more boring minutes. minute If you want to see some ultra-cheap, crazy, but totally funny little movie related to Elvis, I really recommend this mess "Bubba Ho-Tep".
