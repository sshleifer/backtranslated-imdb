While remakes someone's classic movie, remake is always inconvenient compared to the original. Also, there is a chance that the arrangement is quite different, so it is not too close to the audience. <br /> <br /> Well, in 1973, the television version of the "Double Compensation" has almost the same scene and dialogue as the work of 1944. The main difference is that repetition does not have any energy. Fred MacMurray was largely as authentic, dangerous as insurance agent Walter Neff; Richard Crenna just looks tired and tired of the world. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray's boss Barton Keys; A good actor, Lee J. Cobb, was squeezed by court proceedings. Samantha Eggar is a mistaken, dear, stubborn Phyllis Dietrichson; Robert Webber, Robert Barber, Robert Barber, former director of Robinson's Norton and Richard Fiedler, is a very polite and sensitive, taking the role of Porter Hall as an important witness, bringing some life to the film. In particular, Webber improves Norton's role in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> But after the start of the film there was no life, no electricity. This is a never-ending movie.
