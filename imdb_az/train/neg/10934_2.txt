Above all, I'm saying LDS or more precisely, I'm Mormon. So when I watched this film, I gave the benefit of doubt. I often find it difficult to find something in every movie I usually follow. And that was an exception. He has an irresistible moment. <br /> <br /> Still, it is very important for me that Halestorm was ashamed of our church! In the Church of the LDS, meetings are called "dresses" and the basketball court is in the "culture hall". At any given time, these two names are one. The church is never named, and "standards" refer to what our Church is doing. <br /> Am I wondering whether my guides are really LDS or LDS wannabes? This movie has a lot of potential! Indeed, he would have shown our church in a positive light and would not believe in the things we offer or offer to the public. Instead, it was only slightly fun and very much. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Dear Mr. Halestorm. You can do better!
