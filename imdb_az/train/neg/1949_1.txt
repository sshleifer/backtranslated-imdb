The animation appears to be seen in 30 seconds and looks more like cartoon than cartoons. The series has been an admirer of Scooby Doo since 1969. I did not think of most Scooby Doo cartoons (I talk about audience films, not audience films). They were very nice, and many would like Scrappy Doo to be irritating, but this series is pure garbage. When I saw the animation and heard the characters (and I use the word of release), I cried. Also, Mystery Inc. was a team and seemed to be the opening of only one of the bread boxes to praise one another without any crew, someone eats the best and only the rest no one wants. The new Scooby Doo was even better. If you plan to have a Scooby Doo TV series, enter the elements that are long-lasting. All symbols, quality animation. They need to put them in the bottom of the boat.
