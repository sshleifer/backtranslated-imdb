<br /> <br /> Probably the worst Bollywood movie ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is full of silent and trivial humor. All films were chaotic and less directional. There was no adaptation to the story. The airport was taken to a shopping mall. <br /> <br /> Repeating the same story, "please, just act with it!" Even song and dance were both trivial and bad choreography. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie is that there are hot holes around it all ... but then most Bollywood movies are out there. <br /> <br /> I'm not from an Indian fund. <br /> <br /> 2/10
