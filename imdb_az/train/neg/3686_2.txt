I'm surprised that everybody (and even critics) thinks they think this is a good movie. I saw that the most klichel thriller was. We have a 'good guy' (or girls in this case) who has a 'bad guy' who wants to do something or meet the result. In this film, the "good girl" should use her intelligence and skills to defeat the "bad guy" and save her day and relatives. Use charisma, heroism and even luck to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where is the starting point? A young woman named Lisa Risert meets a young man at the airport named after Jackson Rippner (beautiful name). A coincidence leads to another, and soon the fate will bring these two together. Sitting next to each other, sharing the drinks, comes together in every respect ... Is there any more strangeness? Are they related to each other? Can the 'tale' cause their strange and casual encounter? <br /> <br /> Yes, as it's gone, unfortunately, yes. Jackson needs help to bring Lisa out of a room to assassinate the National Security Director to help her. If he did not, his father died. <br /> <br /> Of course, despite the fact that Lisa is behind this defeat, and why we are learning the exact cause, Jackson explains how this situation will happen and why she helps her in Lisa. <br /> <br /> Of course, with his elegant plans, she stabs her on the neck of her bad plans, and travels over her chairs and shoots with a hockey stick in a field. Oh, and before that, he set out on a Miami chase with a wild chase and stole a car he used to throw on the man who ordered the killing. <br /> <br /> Yes, thanks. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's strange that a person like Jackson, who can handle his hands with high-tech weapons, needs a hotel manager's help. Is not he able to bomb the building? Does leaving any third party make it and its group safer? Why does Jackson explain to someone who is threatening the characters like him? Does it make it easier for them to stop them? <br /> <br /> The actors have done their best, taking into consideration their film. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still actors to look at. Also, I believe that Jayma Mays will be someone who will see more (will be playing "Lover" Cynthia). <br /> <br /> Both of them are more than 2
