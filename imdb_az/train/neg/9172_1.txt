I'm going to see a movie about the zombie, I do not expect oscar caliber outputs, or write to the Godfather level, but I do not expect actors to look at their stick cards and the tension to read the dialogue as it is written 10 minutes before the actor reads the camera. This movie was just terrible, I really got up and stayed for about 25 minutes and went to the next door and I watched Cold Creek Manor, which was not very good, but it looks like Citizen Kane, compared to that purple. Moreover, the girls were very nice, probably when I was sitting for more than the first five minutes, the only thing I actually left after being hurt - there was nothing to keep my interests.
