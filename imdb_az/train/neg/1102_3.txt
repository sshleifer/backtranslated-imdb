First, I have to admit that I have not seen headlines in both films I've seen by the director, and may have missed the points. My cheek is not bad, but when I sat down with her two movies, I did not even try to learn. Samothari is very cool. The road is very cool. Ten different storylines combining together and together. The size of the Prague (small, really) in a city that is so unusual. The main characters are between 20 and 30. Jobs and only one job. The best character is the young Balkan girl. Here, immigrants every day reflect their emotions. About it. Only great character. Everyone takes his own life completely. How can I deal with this obvious skill? Maybe there are interesting lions with Japanese tourists, but need another stereotype in the film? If you like good music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh others' folly, watch this movie. If you like, irony and dry humor is not an imitation to the original Jarmusch. And under no circumstances look Ondricek's film, Septic (Whisper.). If you do not use homophobic stereotypes.
