OK I am not an American, but in my old Scottish thought, Steve Martin has never been and never will be funny, because our posters are in the South direction. Phil Silvers, like Sergeant Bilko, was a funny man, undoubtedly turned into one of the most comic and unusual comedy comedies in the perfect way for experienced writers and directors and other heroes working on a series of talented teams. Everyone could not dare to try to repeat the character of Phil Silvers. For sure, Clouseau, an inspector of the Martini Peter Trafficker, in my opinion, was attempting to take another attempt to revive an inaccessible career. Some of you say that "Steve Martin puts his stamp on the character," I'll say "balderdash", when his drawings are valuable to the future of Silvers and Sellars, for a long time it will be forgotten
