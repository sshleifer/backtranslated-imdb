Awwww .... yes, it's heartfelt and all the failed family are taken by ABC / Sears and have their home "repaired." The place where the humanist appeal ended. <br /> <br /> Every family could afford a very luxurious home, compared to ten needy families, each episode of this show. Habitat for humanity should shake their heads as an unbeliever. For example, do a healthy sixteen year old boy have a jacuzzi in the bedroom or deceive his bed with a "Low Rider" hydraulic? Do the mother really need it to load an outdated, idle and rusty old truck, and some of California's best customers are "pimped"? A new job would be pretty good and would be a third of the price. Do people really need a sixty-five-inch plasma screen in every room in the house? And then there is a question of who will pay the increased property tax and utility payments. Someone still wins after the zaniacs in "Make Up". <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than just buying ABC's rating pill and sponsors.
