"The Secretary" is one of the "excitements" that one day, during the day, when watching something else. The area is a kind (a demented woman is jealous of anyone who succeeds in her office and decides to do whatever it takes to stop them), and I have taken many television films <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Mel Harris is one of many actresses who appear to be a "mother" in many television movies or as a kind of "victim" of ill-treatment and abuse. In this one, she becomes a victim of joy and mental secretary Sheila Kelly, she is not a very good choice as disgusting. Sheila Kelly has some good career moves (Singles, Breaking In and I guess, Law and Order), she is also overcome by a string of rogue TV movie roles, and this just adds. <br /> <br /> According to some information, this means something. <br /> <br /> This will play in the network for a lifetime (I have seen here), but it is a concern to watch it if it is not too boring for your words. It will not be more exciting to you ...
