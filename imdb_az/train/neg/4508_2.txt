Andrewju, I agree more. My daughter is watching it right now and I find this movie horrible. Chinese girl laughs: "We're doing all this for a man!" <br /> <br /> I think that the struggle between these women and the tragedy does not have any intensity and that these men will not be challenged. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < BR> <strong> I'm sure there's something like Chinese, but the faces are not the same. <br /> <br /> In any case, the dialogue is very secretive, American. <br /> <br /> After the European Union's commitment to Europe, they would do better. <br /> <br /> I have to add that most of the movie fans are in America. Imagine, but not surprising. All this is written for you, not instinctive, passionate. I think Chinese actresses are cute, but could not say that they were a good player in the movie. Yes, cinematography is great, but I really do not see these characters as complex, profound individuals. <br /> <br /> I will go to Japan to see the real thing. I'm sure it would be great to see it.
