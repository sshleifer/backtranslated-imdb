This movie is not bad compared to the original two versions of the original. It is run by the 13th Glory Martin Kitroser on Friday. Acting is really bad, but gore and special effects make it exciting. Screaming Mad George (something to create an effective artworks for the movie) is something that you liked about, its effect is so off-the-wall and strange that they just keep watching a bad movie to find out how bad it is to get it. The movie is not really all that strange, but the dreams of the toy (!!!!) are in the middle of the middle there are many spectacular eye-munching scenes Mickey Rooney is probably not too enthusiastic, but when it's time for money? If you love the 4th part 4 (I love all 5), perhaps you'll be like that. I liked Matrix! Enjoy.
