T.Z. Post, a college professor, received an error message stating that he received $ 750,000. Now through financial means, he reduces the cost of $ 4,000, and finally decides to go out and live. After sending his luggage to Chicago on a train, he travels to the traveling group of Vaudeville and will make a good decision to show on Broadway. Show night, poor Professor. To avoid hiding from Post Creditors, you must resolve the relationship between your girlfriend Pansy and floozy diva Eleanor and continue the show. After watching many Keaton silent stones, this is a pain to sit one, but I felt it could be much worse. Supporting Durante, Todd & Selwyn is sometimes very frustrating but still willing. A pre-Charlie Chan Toler is as good as an angry show director. 90% of the screenplay was written by MGM as it tries to pass the poor man as Marx Bros. In the meantime, Keaton's drinking problems, this film is a sad moment in Buster's life. Rating-3.
