Undoubtedly, this will be a cult film even. I'm pretty sure I loved Gram Parsons, and I did not expect much from this movie and bought it for less. It could be smart and moving. He has created grammar and has been deprived of music that has more dolphins than cheap dogs. There is no background in the grammar or the colorful people of the time. The characters I did not meet with Gram's admirer and all the versions of his "next adventures" I heard. Rock and roll are full of fairy tales, good, but they should be taken with salt. Though over-exaggerated, they can be great stories. But this movie made a good story and became a companion. Stealing any dead body and subsequent results should never be a tale, but as a rule they are bored. I do not want to steal every single copy of Grand Theft Parsons, take my head in the desert, and burn all of them.
