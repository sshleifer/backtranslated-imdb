I'm not a regular audience of Springer, but I review his show and I think the show is a good guilty pleasure and a good way to kill a while. Indeed, I will wait for this film to be "Jerry Springer Uncensored". First of all, Jerry appears in the movie about twenty minutes. The other hour and twenty minutes builds a lying infantry on trailers - rubbish, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley is a trailer-trash prostitute when lying (with a very unusual-looking, chain-smoking, drunken Michael Dudikoff lying in his action hero's identity) with his stepfather (hot-looking HELLLL). Mothers find work, go into battle, want to go to the Jerry show (not Springer). And then there is a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take him to Jerry show. Symbols collided. Blah, blah, freakin 'blah! Trash has rarely been BORRRINGG !!!! Why would I be interested in Springer's millions of fans of Hell, but none of them checked the movie. Yes, it's completely clear now! If you love him or hate him, you will hate this movie! How can I explain it? It is a common mix in the form of a movie (if you have called it). It's done in a very bad way, with only scenic scenes and after a while the plot disappears and is just on the map! Imagine an expected soap opera that has turned into a comic fare. It rarely laughs. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is the hot girl-girl scene. It accepts the risk as it is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My Account: 3 (10)
