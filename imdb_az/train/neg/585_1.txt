From the original film, Snow Snowy, I've seen the best, almost perfect. The story of a lady and two stories in Tramp - a rich girl / poor boy and ability to interact. But later, it is not just a headless attempt to win the name of the original, but also a terrifying, over-scattered Disneyfied blend that is best proved in the form of "Rambo talks to Black Moon". The Black Stallion without the charm. The young hero has been back for over 3 years and is suddenly on the horse Superman; In an original, good movie, he was real and convincing, but just later dropped the cartoon. I was not disappointed in a movie, and sometimes this thing made me very angry - they missed a very difficult clich√©. Brazen Audience Manipulation - Do the studio presidents think they have set up horses in order to make all their work happy with a horse-loving audience? The confusion of a movie.
