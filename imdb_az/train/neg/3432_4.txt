A murderer at the scene of the last killer was killed by a murdered trader. In his grave, plans for the resurrection of the grave were gathered on the grave. This, of course, works and he wakes up children out of the penis and returns to the old ways of killing all new zombie looks. One of the two police officers claimed that she had a little nude about the shadow of the city and had a narcotic problem. Both of the original religious members are trying to stop the murderer by resurrecting the other kind of dead thing. They think they leave, but the plastic baby puppet used in the original resurrection comes from the tomb. <br /> <br /> The player is thrilled and one of the cops is the same person as Dr Vincent Van Gore's series of ghosts, and he's also terrifying. The other cop fights just to get horrible lines. Now I am full of low-budget movies, but this movie is just scary. If the eye ladies and their nakedness were not easy, I probably would have slept. The victim has a portion of it, but more than just some of the animals put into the victim's stomach. On the other hand, the zombie makeup looks great, and the penis penis she uses to harass her victims is sometimes funny. There is a half-decent scene where the killer is in love with a sex puppet. The Chipmunks is the stupid thing I've seen in a movie with a puppet with noise. <br /> <br /> The latter is extremely bad. You can expect the killer to fight more. God knows that they have made enough money to continue. <br /> <br /> 4/10
