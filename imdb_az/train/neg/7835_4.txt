Man, I would love to like these shows. I'm starving for good television and I welcome TNT to provide these "opportunities". But, unfortunately, when I come to Cinematic Stephen King, I think I am in a minority. Because the king is brilliant as it is written, it's just that Iran does not translate well into large or small screens. With few exceptions (very few), the King's experience can not be captured with the same effect as the stories you read. Many people will not agree with this, but I am convinced that in the heart of hearts, the story of the best director is a pessimistic reminder of what they are reading. The reason is simple. The middle of the King's wisdom is in the minds of the characters in the story. He shows their inner thoughts, feelings, and sometimes shattered and unrealistic views. In short, King Panavision takes readers' places in places where the camera can not accommodate. As a viewer watching the movie, we remain less than half of the data compared to the reader's speech. It is not a far-reaching extension to claim that it is a character in a King's story, but when a film is shot, it is limited to a smaller voyeurism of the same character. During the time the King wrote, Hollywood will try to shoot everything that comes out of the word processor. I do not blame cinematographers for experimentation, but an incredible amount of talent and surface works that makes Stefen difficult to adapt to the King. The task is to turn from gold, or to some Zen art. Well, next time you have better luck.
