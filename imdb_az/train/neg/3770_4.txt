The author was intent on making Warren Beatty's live action cartoon by Chester Gould's famous comic poem (Beatty himself, a square jacket detective) - something quite unusual and complicated from Warren Beatty. Unfortunately, the picture is a mustache, fun, but ultimately tedious. Dick Tracy is trying to bring down the Mobster Big Boy Caprice, who is supported by his lover Tess Trueheart, but helping to spill out by the Bad Breathless Mahoney. The first half hour or so, the Oscar-a-prime artistic design and design design is great to win, but things do not arise in a characteristic way (with no real sting in the story). Al Pacino was a surprise surprise Madonna, who was nominated for the Oscar nomination as a very bad boy Caprice, and Best of the Original Song by Stefan Sondheim's "The Best or Next" award. Thanks to Beatty's vision, it's very hearty, but the picture is very cool and calculated. There is no heat. * From 1/2
