In 1972, after his wife set out, Elvis Presley got acquainted with Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a happy cheerful, long-haired, lovely, figurine beauty queen, is scheduled to fill the vacuum in Elvis's life. After Elvis's divorce ended, Linda was settled as a live companion and travel companion of the legendary performer until 1976. <br /> <br /> This is a look at their love relationship and friendship. Linda loves her lover's needs and desires. And even by handing her with her swallowing medications and presenting her love affair with valor. Sometimes this film is dark and dark; <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> It's not tempting to hit the trigger. Stephanie Zimbalist Linda is not worthy, but she does her job very well. Supporting staff includes John Crawford, Ruta Lee and Rick Lenz. This two-time tracking is enough for me, but do not let it stop checking this details. For most of Elvis's fans, this is not an advantageous presentation.
