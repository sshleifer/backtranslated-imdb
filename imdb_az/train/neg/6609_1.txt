Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believed that people would remember the dialogue in this ignorant extravagance of a movie? <br /> <br /> In an attempt to re-create a classic film that succeeds in smashing everyone's mind while watching the original film, following a couple of days after the encounter with his wife.
