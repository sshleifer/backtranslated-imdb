This third Pokemon movie is very abstract for repeating the pursuit of little children and entertaining the elderly children. The story of the movie - dealing with the loss - was destroyed by the return of a young girl's father during film credits. Team Rocket gives you some fun, but they're not really part of a small area, so they do not appear often.
