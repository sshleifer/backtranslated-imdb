Failure to comply with the resistance of Maureen O'Sullivan with the terrible fake ears of Afrikan elephants to the African elephants, with our badly twisted principles acting as an artist from the strange "strange African people". "Tarzan! Tarzan!" there is nothing about this film, which is a classic title. <br /> <br /> 4/10
