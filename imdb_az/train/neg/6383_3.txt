Gayniggers from outer space is a strange foreign movie, strange foreigners with strangers. To be gay, their purpose is that all human beings are gay, and only the universe. Thus, women or "female creatures" are primarily afraid when they live on earth; finally decide to eliminate all the women on the planet and release the male population. <br /> <br /> Needed to be a racist with a racist, homophobic, and sexist story, it's a shocking thing to film. However, there is a substance below it. According to another reviewer, there are several jokes, other than the names of the characters (for example, ArmInAss); I think once I laughed at a little gay joke. I think that the film was quickly brought to the market by an illogical science fiction, but then it was enough; I did not want the movie to end (and a short movie!). Not bright or particularly well-written.
