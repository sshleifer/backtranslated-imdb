King Maker is a film about a number of realistic events that occurred during the Portuguese torture in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Although suits and art are appreciated, the film will still not affect the audience. . Particularly moving, very weak. Some actors are trying to put down their tears, but they are extremely worried about the real and fraudulent accents. The storyline was also very dumb and very foolish to be true and seemed to be a lesson of history. <br /> <br /> This film has not been able to capture criticism and centuries-old weather, and has tried to fulfill the Elizabeth's Asian version more. The costume and art aspect gave the film a fresh breath, but the performance was extremely weak and the actors could not even give a natural twitch. In short, the film sounded more like a hullabaloo than a script.
