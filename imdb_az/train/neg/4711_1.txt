I hate this show! I watched an episode, and I knew this show was really terrible. Story lines are both bad and written and the jokes are really bad ... Dexter Lab and Johnny Quest are just one sh ++, the second is blond hair, genius sisters and talking dog; stay home and have a clever, busy host ... Oh-my-flippin'-God! Their grandfather is a gay-crazy home-maker, so gay! Even if my dad is the host, I personally die! <br /> <strong> </ strong> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <BR> </ strong> <br /> <STRONG> <br> <br /> Lame, Stupid and above all ... Â· F ** K UP! I can tell the nation that this is definitely the worst cartoon series EV-ER is in my list! If I have one.
