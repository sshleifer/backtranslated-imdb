What a terrific show. Fans of science fiction regardless of quality. It gives me shockingly that, like an exception like Firefly, is shocking me, while Battlestar is spawn off a spin while the garbage is like Galactica. This spin off the show is miserable in every direction. Guidance, adolescence and thirst. The characters are cardboard stereo for everything in the Sci-Fi series. The story is bad. Dialogue is worse than the start of a soap opera. Direction shoddy and the sets are terrible. Caprica is a loss of film, time loss and effort. This is a never-ending spin.
