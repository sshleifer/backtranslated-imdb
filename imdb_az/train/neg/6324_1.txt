I spent eight years in cinema theaters in the 80s and 90s. This was the worst movie I've ever shown to the public. It's a bit of a bad thing, it's a great, inspiring film. Even the great Gregory Peck failed to achieve this terrible piece. Jamie Lee Curtis, who is also an out-of-the-box film, has clearly demonstrated what he is learning to do (he still works, but does not improve). <br /> <br /> Sorry, and here spoilers will not happen because international nuclear disarmament fears children are afraid to play baseball! <br /> <br /> Even showing on the Nick and Disney Channel shows that it's not fool enough to try to convince us. <br /> <br /> It's not worth spending time watching on cable TV. Movie rental is not worth the price; your dolphin would spend on an extra microwave popcorn package to go with the other movie you choose (because it could only be better).
