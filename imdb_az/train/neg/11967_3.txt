Considering the risk of showing similar sexes in the early 1980s, Personal Best could do better with Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) to play the same sex relationship with Cahill's more experienced stage. <br /> It seems to me that the creators of this film have taken the same sex with two attractive women to attract the audience. Also take into consideration that the few jumpers jumping from the jump up to 90 seconds. This random scene is very important for the film, and it is simply to catch the audience interested in this mild film. I guess the producers tried to get into the drilling area and the worrying situation of the film (in 1980, the Oregon Track and Field competition). <br /> <br /> This view may seem harsh, but that's true. The abuse of Muriel Hemingway's corpse and the same sex breach broke the credit I would give to this movie. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
