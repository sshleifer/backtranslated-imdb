This version is very strange, I'm scared. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood, but William Hurt's tired, shooting-action style is completely unhelpful for the courageous passions of Edward Rochester and the poor Charlotte Gainsbrough toothbrush looks like a bored, desperate teenager! I do not believe that Eduard's marriage proposal scene was erased by the end of the book, one of the most moving moments in the literature. I finally appreciate the use of such a young, flat woman to play character Jane, which is supposed to be a secular 18, but with 70th edition of George C. Scott and Susannah York, if you would like to see a version closing the novel's personalities and passions. York was very old, long and nice to play Jane, but nobody touched the path Rochester did to the character of Rochester.
