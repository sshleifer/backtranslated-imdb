It was just terrible. I read this book for school, as I did in all the tests! My teacher was forced to follow me and the other 20 people, and this was worse than Leonard Part 6, Out of Space Plan 9 and Hudson Hawk. What made this movie so scary was a good reason to kill himself. Above all, Hallmark has been made over. Secondly, the player was strange. Thirdly, it differs from the book. Undoubtedly, I myself wanted to be away from myself. Basically, it would be better than watching the main Instinct 2. Take my advice, do not watch this movie. No one will want to watch it. It was horrible. HORRIBLE!
