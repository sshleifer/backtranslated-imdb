<br /> <br /> The cheating pad, hood and very small hidden print to cheat this movie deceived me. <br /> <br /> It really started well and drew me. I really liked it. From 1/3 to 3/4, the film has begun to throw things that have not been set up and given no meaning. My first thought is, "This is not written by a man who describes a story." <br /> <br /> Thinking I had left part of the movie during the last 1/5 of the movie, I started watching part of the movie again. All this BORING, ANNOYING, DINOGLU did not mean anything; he did not say anything and listened; <br /> <br /> Avoid DVDs labeled with video clips and level road construction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am a Catholic.
