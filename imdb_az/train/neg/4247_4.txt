<br /> <br /> A young man working in the film, Gilbert, documents the documentary film. Estelle Rolle (Anne Bancroft) is an eccentric, feisty, and, above all, an obsessive fan of Greta Garbo. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; /> When Estelle suffers from a brain tumor, her son decides to conduct a study of herself: explain with Greta Garbo and bring her to her mother. <br /> <br /> Anne Bancroft is exactly where the south-decoration Dark-Mame mode, this bold version of the movie, for the people who open their mouths and stick to their ideals, and always end up in jail, as an open art on the edge of the film, and every scene is loaded with bare loads, each one is a liar, the rest of the hero is equally as a one-dimensional, but very little interesting.One of Ron Silver's likely like a telegraph like a flat and triangular film of his love to try: he is rich in Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher), but oddball co-worker Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks), and this is another problem: if one-dimensional characters are an interesting and seductive story, they can survive, but there's nothing here. The speed of the film is glacier, it is imagined by extraterrestrial materials that are absolutely amplified, and when the film line is sequenced, it is both plodding and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Harvey Fierstein, who is attempting to remain indifferent to the post-partum period of the film, is a worthy statement about the character of New Yorker and the role of a gay New Yorker, but since then none of the characters it was not as real people, and the film was trying to present me, so far too little, too far. The film is my 25th Lumet film and it is easily the most-watched director, but beyond a few boring runs (Looking Undefeated, Anyone?), He did not care about the depth of pain that Garbo had to deal with. <br /> <br /> Tier 25 4.5 / 10 (C / C-) / # 21 (24) in the 1984/23 class of Lumet Films
