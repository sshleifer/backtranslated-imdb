There is no artistic value in this film to win every prize. Well, it's not worth the audience. Taking into consideration that one of the prizes is for cinematography, but sincerely dissatisfied with the camera actions at least. In each context, you feel like you're getting a "full picture", like someone "sowing an image out of the way." The story is miserable. Yes, I will be honest, I will not be able to watch the whole movie. The part I most sucked was when I saw a partner of coaxed soldiers in their barracks for partying and drinking. <br /> <br /> These and many other similar scenes reminded many of Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and stay away from this.
