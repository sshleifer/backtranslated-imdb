Finally, we got to Starlight last night on television and it's all about what I said. . . Amazing! Wow! It's hard to know what to do in the beginning - incredible hockey special effects (look at the laser beams that strike Willie's eyes!), Cunning action, terrific dialogue, incompatibility with stock cartoons, or ambitious ambitions develops all the productions. This is really some sort of experience and we need to thank for it. I present Jonathon Kai as the true successor to Ed Wood!
