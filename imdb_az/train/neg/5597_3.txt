At least I will say that the film is meaningful, but it's bad. The majority of things are not good (just think Sky did not promise anything) and do not watch it. All the scenes that should be meaningful are really simple, as it came from their parents. There are many cornice details in the skirt of the shoulder straps, the girls' buzzing magnets and the terrible d√©cor of Gods, and the music ... and the clothes ... and everything else. Real life never came to this movie. The boy says at one point: "I'm not gay, I'm not a brunette". And not aware. Even the interpretation is terrifying, I quit after talking, as I enjoyed Ng after the interview.
