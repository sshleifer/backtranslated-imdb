This film reflects insensitivity, straight on the rectangular scale 11/10. The accuracy of accents and the density of sparkling spandex trousers are simply striking. Yankees do not expect too much chance to "dance" with the indigenous people, even though the original Scotland is quite colorful. <br /> <br /> There are several infectious songs and dance scenes, but the plot is very cheesy and linear and dialogue is often too weak. Also, I doubt that everyone will not want to be shot in a Scottish village in the 18th century, not in New York, but in a gay town. Perhaps, after leaving the Brigade, he did not offer such a sacrifice to get into hell from the rash. <br /> <br /> You can watch it for a nice alternative-reality look. A Christopher Streed Day-parade in Scotland looks like LSD. Other than that, I'm just going to do this for Hollywood.
