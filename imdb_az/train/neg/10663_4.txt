The film had no waste, except for some dull scenes. Women's shooting gave a better show than the laughing men. <br /> <br /> But Krista Allen really sounded in the movie .His voice was very intimidating and sexy. The scenes in the bedroom related to Krista were shortened, but they were intimidating and sexy. Krista <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was not that good and that was not a good thing. In the last 5 minutes, which was an interesting part of the film, it sounded as baddie. <br /> <br /> It's not as good as an action star. That could have chosen a better post. I really think you're doing it for the money.
