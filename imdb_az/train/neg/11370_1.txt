This video is a great way to mix and manipulate Americans about Islam. Unfortunately, people who do this believe that the American people are very careful about believing it, and maybe, as an American citizen, everyone should object to that. If you want to know the truth about Islam, do not let anyone tell you ... QURAN is the public! you are reading yourself and you can decide if it's true or false ... <br /> The video uses many audiovisual strategies aimed at manipulating and coordinating things that are not even relevant. The music used at some points hints the public to hate what they see, even though they do not understand what's going on there. They use outdated images from their original content. <br /> <br /> I would like to make a reflection to complete the comment ... Do you think you can make the same movie with every single one? the world?
