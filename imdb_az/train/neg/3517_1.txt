I do not know who wrote the script, but I was furious since the very first moment. Why would all the possible decisions be made in the mountains, and why the most dangerous decision? Why are the criminals silent despite the fact that criminals earn and earn a large amount of money from a bank? Why is the main criminal helicopter hitting Stallon, captures his money and flies like a hostage chick? And more complicated behaviors. I would give this movie 5 points for a beautiful performance and beautiful scenery, but because of the illogical nature of the characters I can give this movie one point ...
