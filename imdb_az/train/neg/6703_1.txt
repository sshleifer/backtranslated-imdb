I noticed that this movie was hit by many insults. Perhaps some of them won, but that was not bad. Yes, I will be honest: I do not want to see this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I do not hate this movie, I tried to explain a story. Like a drama, this movie can work really well. I only think that the filmmakers made a mistake when they created it (if they wanted to be a comedy, they should add more funny bits). By rewriting, it could have been a big movie. However, as a satiric, it did not work with this current form - many scenes did not fit into the context of the field: for example, the robbery scene is a little bit in the story. Still, it's not the worst independent movie - the worst of the 10 worst? This is controversial.
