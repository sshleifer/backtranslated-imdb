Horrible, ignorant, ill-thought, career-killing (where talented Angela Jones is now?), Deeper debris. No wonder Reb Braddock is focusing on something else - everyone with the help of his first film, Quentin Tarantino, who has the ability to make his first film based on his own writings, feels like this, that it is a story worth telling the world, a second is not worth the break. In terms of conditions, speeches are good - actors fulfill what they say and do good things. But these should not be the first thing to do. <br /> <br /> From 4 to 0.
