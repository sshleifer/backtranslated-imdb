This is the most boring, worst and useless movie I've ever seen. The structure, which has some philosophical aspect, has come to me as a very bad blank of the matrix: a lot of clich√©s: a single wolf, a well-groomed, psychologically disturbed, lying in a gun ... + a fine worker and shy, but a well-known scientist , you add 2 cents and you, Robot! FedEx, Audi, Congress and more. I was very worried by the obvious advertising of some brands. This is worse than a movie commercial and, unfortunately, is the poorest place to end in 30 seconds. If you have some free time, watch a good TV program or read a great book.
