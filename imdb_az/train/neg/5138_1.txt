I watched SCARECROWS because of the buzz around. <br /> <br /> Everyone who loves this film can not imagine it because it's bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> Behold, who does this movie, does not know anything about horror. The whole story is a failed marriage of two genres: action movie (weapons and criminals) and horror (living shelters). When killing each other by suicidal laughter, the two genres automatically cancel each other because first of all they are carefree criminals and criminals, and secondly, because they are foolish criminals! The zombie heroes do not work here after leaving them. What is horror? <br /> <br /> But this story is so badly built that if genres are better than this marriage, it can never be true. Simply, there was a group of super-criminals and heroes here, just for the reason that the filmmakers were thinking of. The worst of all is the fact that kinematography is terrifying (like TV) and all the boards of the dialogue have been informed about the CBs, and as we look at each other, it is like hearing the dialogue continuously. Radio show type. This part was really BAD. The Leader was to be shot down when he got such a foolish idea! <br /> <br /> As I have already mentioned, criminals at SCARECROWS are incredibly stupid. For example, when something suddenly appears, when something big with a large open mouth and straw comes out, others say, "What medication do you have?" They ask. he was unable to kill him after hitting a bullet (he was "zombiefied" by the scorners). Get the freaking clue, morons. I did not see such stupid people in a movie. And then there is a girl. One of the scared wounded that he had killed him shortly. When he finds his father with a spoon "cross", he blames criminals on a shameful scene (bad behavior), even though criminals can not do it. What was that? But the scared one is the greatest weakness of this very weak flush. They are not scary. Nothing about them is disclosed. <br /> <br /> Expert Wesley will take a 30-second fear face, but will not do anything boring. Stage with the head talking on the refrigerator. <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst films I've ever seen (and I've seen so many movies these days!) Here's the same weaker SILO KILLER or SCARECROWS, and I would like more SILO KILLER. Yep, SCARECROWS is bad.
