How could good actors like Jean Rochefort and Carole Bouquet be so involved in ... well, such a thing? I can not get it. Terrifying, multi-ball play (but with a few leading roles), jokes are dumb and totally funny ... I will not talk much about this movie, except for a few tips: it will be time and money loss.
