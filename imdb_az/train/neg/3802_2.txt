Actors and actresses know that they can take on different types of movies - hey, no one wants to get typical - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should get better acquaintance. "Angels in Outfield" is a movie that appears to be missing until everything comes to a magic day or saves it. Should I not tell you exactly how it ended? The film is simply low running (examples of high runs are various fantasy films from the 50's). If these films had some political recommendations - or at least they presented us a new look of life - they would be good; It's just meaningless. It is closer to the north than the Anglo-Saxon. Also Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey play roles and I suspect they do not want to repeat this topic.
