The first Azumi movie does not deny commercial product; a popular gentleman's adaptation and threw young, attractive actors and did not have a budget department. <br /> <br /> "Azumi 2" did not have everything that really made it beautiful. The first thing to set an alarm bell is the lack of fashionable Ryuhei Kitamura. She accepted her original style, beauty, and most importantly, her heart, not her own vision and kinetics. Although the first is a simple hitlist, it has a clutter confusion, with many stretching characters behind each other, potentially destroying any sympathy or pathos. Gone is an effective interaction effect between leading characters; Azumi and his cohorts are often dropped from a bunch of stroppy teenagers who argue in a forest. No description available; Anyone who is watching, who really lives and who is interested in death, will be shocked. The same thing applies to the bad guys here. The last battle - in fact, all battles - are absolutely free of any tension. They are directed to weak choreography and depth - not to talk between a few and a few - they are treated with meaningless sense of humor. <br /> <br /> The spouses are trying to keep themselves in a very difficult position, and even if they are united, they should not enter the country in the original of Joe Odagiri's Pete Burnsian antiques. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Head of the Caucasian Muslims Office: Azumi is now a complete murderer, that is, he can swing his sword in a slow motion; Unfortunately, no name style is now combined with a character, and Uetoun's model does not look any better. Although I know it, it is not possible to re-capture his character at this time, when it is unclear that everyone is ineffective, the film's error, and the general idea of ​​the film. . Less Than About Chiaki "Remember Me Kill Bill" Kuriyama's performance is better; <br /> <br /> In general, it was just a big disappointment. Any essence was ten times better in the first movie. Clean, unpleasant - and terribly boring.
