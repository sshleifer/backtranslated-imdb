I will not give a rating to this movie, it's not worth it. I just looked for Pfieffer admirer. I love him and will follow all he has done. Even in this hue, he was disappointed. Every scene in it watched the audience ... waiting for something to happen ... nothing happened. There was a good story line, but it just ended before it started. <br /> <br /> Pfieffer was 29 years old when he put this movie and his most beautiful work. The wardrobe and the set were striking. <br /> <br /> I can watch a lot and rarely find a movie that can not find anything like it, but it was a dream. I do not understand. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this was the end of a great cliff. There was a final scene that awakened you and wailed, this movie is finally going to somewhere, then lending it. Good grief. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, I have repeatedly stated this. Well, I say. In fact, this commentary was much more fun than the movie because it's so good. I also spent this dud.dud.dud .99 cents.
