Oh, my god, what a sad movie. There are all the right people in the film, unfortunately, not to watch. In my local library I saw it for free. If I had paid for it, I'd worry more. This movie is unimaginable. How Tarintino could be drawn to such a slow, progressive film? It was not surprising that it was not very distributed. I can take a good movie with Dated Camcorder and Big toe. I really hate it outside of calmness. Tarintino just lost some legs in my eyes. This should be some kind of patient joke. Do not worry about this movie. If someone has even shown it, you have to watch it and kill it.
