Well-known writer Mark Edglin (Edgar Allen Poe), a publisher of Baltimore, Maryland, tries to conquer old addictions and build a new life for himself. However, confusion, delirium, and rejection threaten to hinder his efforts. He also wanted to renew romance with the old lover, with a flawed perspective, as things emerge. Mr Redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious days of Edgar Allen Pound. Redfield works with many black-and-white, color and cunning photography to create a mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (Dr. John Moran) speaks relatively well speaking. Not enough.
