This is one of the dreadful horror movies I've ever seen, because it's a terrible thing, John Carradine has a very limited screen. All the characters are very boring and the story is terrible, and I'm just two miles away! A great venue and creepy home would definitely help if this is not a boring one, or there is no character to root, and I hope it will go down to the 100th because I deserve to be there. This is a pretty good scene when John Carradine finally arrives at the end, but it's been a long way off, and it was just flashbacks on other display times, plus the scene of only one reality in the movie - Bee drowned already. I got a DVD Horror set called Back from this Qadrum and everyone else has overacts in my opinion, plus I have lucked into a bunch of things I chucked out of this window! This is one of the dreadful Horror films I've ever seen, because it's a terrible thing, John Carradine has a very limited display time and I do not want to be like that, and I do not want to be tortured. Direction is absolutely terrible! Carl Monson is totally horrific! The job here is that everything looks cheap, does not lose the potential to create a creepy atmosphere, and keeps the film at a fairly sharp pace. Acting is also bad. John Carradine is good at the scene, but then there is hardly any other movie, then flashback scenes. (Carradine Ruled !!). Merry Anders did not really believe in me here, like Laura, in a strange way. Ivy Bethune is good and somewhat creepy, but very delighted, though at the end he had a creepy smile. The rest of the dump did not pay much attention to me because I had many problems, but it was really bad. Generally, avoid it, it's not worth the suffering! BOMB came out at 5
