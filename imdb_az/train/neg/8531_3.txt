This unforgettable miracle, 40-year-old Norma Shearer, plays a fluttery, girlish socialite, with a trail between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame for the failure of the film, the chat script or the director, George Cukor, as the film did not usually focus on a comedy. But basically, it is the fault of the lover, who wants to play with the "young" parts during the time he can move away from him. Inadequate, it makes a "strange love" of a strange monument to an old woman's plate.
