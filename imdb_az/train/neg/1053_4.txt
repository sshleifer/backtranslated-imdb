Talk about the awesome Cinderella fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Kathleen Turner writes poorly enough, but Kathleen Turner is a pretty decent step-by-step performance. <br /> <br /> In some parts, it's pretty strange, but it's about it. The costumes of the period are from the Elizabeth era to the 1990s. <br /> <br /> If you're in a Cinderella story, "Ever After: A Cinderella's Story" or "Glass Coat."
