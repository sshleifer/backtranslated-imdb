<br /> <br /> Shock-O-Rama's cinema has denied rent or buy for 100 times 100 teeth teeth (or others). The truth of the truth is that it is probably a good, yet intricate and terrible entry into the genre of "Zombies" in the genre of zombies. Folks, this is not just a low-budget movie, it's a very low budget movie by many people - sorry, I know there are families that love them, they will never be anything in Variety. <br /> <br /> In some cases, this is just one thing. <br /> <br /> He is a spouse, but I do not blame the actors; They had no direction. The scenario was a half-fired zombie fantasy, which had no meaning with the real cinematography story because there was no direction. Characterization is thinner at best, due to weak dialogue and soporific direction. Have I noticed that the scenario and the direction are pretty clever? They are. There is no drama, no tension, great moments, nothing. All the principles of the government's suppression of the press are sophomoric "commercial breaks" and are characterized by a story that is inconsistent with an effective analysis and hesitantly to end ridiculously. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < What is the age of mobile camcorders today and wireless communications, maybe they can hope for the best one day or better? Now, if they cover something like their own fault ... but the "Food of the Mass" does not explore such opportunities. Instead, absurdity and poor staged events pray for laughing and / or gaining importance, its viewers will not feel the total lack of production value beyond the core film facility. Did anyone in this movie make a payment? I hope the actors, if only they had wasted in such streets in their time; <br /> <br /> Even zombie fans will find so little to earn "feeding the masses." In general, it is an unhappy budget for extra-budgetary budgets and has no distinctive set and memorable effects. In fact, they are all unforgettable. <br /> <br /> The NCA does not need to be afraid. <br /> <br /> As the Aussie was dead, even the garbage dumped like "Undead", "Feeding the Masses." Sorry, children go back to their drawing boards and take your cheating marketing with you.
