Although Bette Davis did a great job like Mildred, I noticed that the movie was not the best I've ever seen. At the end of the movie, I felt as if I were missing out here. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis did a good job, so she hated me and hurt her at all times. Leslie Howard, lovelorn was very good as Philip Carey and I suffered him throughout the movie to be in love with such a terrible dame. It's such a sad thing when someone finds out with bad seeds. <br /> <br /> As a result, actorism was not about this area, but rather the incident. Especially someone like Philp Carey is a sensitive person. The last scene was particularly good, but I'm not the one to give it. Although others can find this movie well, I have found it. I should recommend this film to those who love it as a bad seed, and see if they fall in love with this terrible person.
