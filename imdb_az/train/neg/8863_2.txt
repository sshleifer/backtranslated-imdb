Howling II (1985) was 180 from the first film. The first film was creepy. The latter was sleazy and cheesy. The production values ​​are pretty bad and the player is defective. One of the victims of the baker's brother wants to know what's going on with his fever. The "scene" from the first film was badly re-established. The torn-to-go woman goes to the old country (Reb Brown) to uncover her / his death / death. Christopher Lee appears and now and then the two island disappears as a sage / way. Sybil Danning and his two major assets look like Stirba, Romania's chief rescuer. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> There is nothing good about this stinker. I'm surprised to see Philip Mora take this picture because he's usually a good movie. The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch (no content, not a movie itself). "Babel" is a damned wannabe with a punk performance damaged to round the film. Maybe they could add a few extra dollars, they would be a real deal instead of an imitation. <br /> <br /> Changing the best and most lazy channel to avoid the moment you are hopeless or away from the remote.
