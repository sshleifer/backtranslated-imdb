Uh oh! Another gay movie. This time also shows the black side. Make your last dollar an unfortunate end! But why? All gay films, with only one half a dozen exception, should end with death or the "addio" finale. In the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s all European films acted as Noir. Unprotected ... a man or a woman should die alone or be haughty. Why do writers, managers and producers of God's name leave behind the humble feelings of the theater on behalf of God? After all, it should be gay ... it's not a mirror. Perhaps you have to turn the category into a "stylish" movie. Most of the gay relationships are ending, and couples enter the West! No matter who writes and produces it, it only shows the lower part of gay life and gives the wrong impression of love lifestyle. This movie just proves my point. If you hire a DVD, get antidepressants because another 'gay' movie is coming! That's wrong!
