This movie should be a joke and one of Stallone's worst movies. This is the 80th typical movie where a man was killed by the entire army. "First Blood Pt 2" is very similar to Schwarzenegger's "Commando", but there is a special nation where there are bad guys here when you kill Arnold terrorists. This film is a typical anti-Soviet propaganda. True, this was the peak of the Cold War, but I was ill when it was always shown as an enemy to the Communists or the Nazis. There are many American films that are common. Why is there a movie showing Americans as an enemy? Who would believe that a single soldier would destroy all the armies? Do you really think that something like that really happened? Apparently, the average, brainwashing American watchman would certainly be.
