This film has a very difficult washability even when it comes to the standards of this genre. There is no way for us to know that a record of a repeat can lead to a dead person, and that the record is hidden in the message, and that only one child has nothing to do with the boy when he is alive, and of course, there is no way in which the record will end. In any case, the film is fun for some time, but eventually calmness and indulgence prevails. If they were really trying to create a new horror symbol like Freddy, they set out, there was no foreign personality, motivation and diversity. (* 1/2)
