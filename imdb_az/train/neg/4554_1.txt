Bingo game is the name of bullshit. Rarely spread by the explosive hodgepodge, including the screen, half-baked conspiracy theory, puritan prudery, and new-age embarrassment. Most of the story is located in Vientiane at Cristian Resort in Peruian Orchestra. Thinking of Tolkien's Rivendell, Star Trek Planet Baku, has been settled by many mysterious, but stunning narrow-minded love and peace of mind. The terrifying moving and glue production designs (the mysterious all-healing "color of energy" rainbow-colored appearance is particularly terrible), "Celestine Prophecy" looks and feels the epic "Twilight Zone" in the 1980s. There are many mistakes about the history of the church and the nomenclature. I do not believe Hector Elizondo has accepted to be part of this. Maybe it's a Bowfinger style, without his consent. The Lord will show compassion to the poor spirits who are watching or reading the filmmaker, screenwriter, author of the novel, and film.
