Philip. K. Dikian movie. And something worthwhile in this regard. Better than Paycheck (Woo) and a minority sheet (Spielberg), which is disgusting. However, despite the fact that the twisting and cooking ends, it was too small for me. Half of the film began to frighten that end, and I regretted it. But this is not worth the film's time. No, no. The first half (as we have explained here) is awesome. Basbug has some parts that we may begin to doubt in the future that the show is a significant thing (we can do that because we can do that) or simply merge. But there is paranoid and enjoy "co-existence". Good one.
