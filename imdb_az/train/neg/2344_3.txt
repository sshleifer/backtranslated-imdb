It's just like a soap opera. I can regard any description of real people as "social commentary". But I do not pay attention to how he characterizes this film in the final analysis. None of the characters are very unpleasant or involved. I did not feel chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, it's missing. The story is not enough to make me wonder, even though Dorothy Maguire is looking at the end of the testimony at the stand of a full and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) recycling. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is a wooden throne. This is one of Lauren Bacall's least interested role and one of the poorest performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack present more inspired performances, but his character is unhappy and is exciting. Robert Keith, the two children, is the most sympathetic character as a loving, discreet fathers of minors. But the most interesting is Robert Wilke, who seems to have a small role as a bar owner. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he is a brave, unpleasant man. <br /> <br /> I received my social commentary with an interesting, attractive story and a few unpleasant characters, thank you.
