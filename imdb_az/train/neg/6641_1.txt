I've seen this movie twice. I do not believe Pintilie did such a fantasy movie. I've been a film director, and I know what I'm talking about. This is no longer Romania, but I see that events took place in the same period since September 11. There is no story, no plot. There are no results, no messages, nothing is deep, no secret. Only blank images. <br /> <br /> Most Roma do not know that this film is for us, not for French audiences. They really believe that it is the truth in Romania. And for teenagers. Pintilie must stop filming. I do not know if this was a movie, maybe we would say horror :) We are also surprised that such an image is in Europe. It's a reality, but it's no longer. A good friend of the Brithish embassy said: "You did not know how long the Romans were from Ceausescu".
