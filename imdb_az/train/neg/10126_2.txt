BATMAN and ROBIN provide a time limit for serial production and batch production, but before 1943, BATMAN has gained a place at the bottom of any "blacklist" list that is not entirely in style, imagination, and atmosphere. Producer Sam Katzman was known for his role as "Quickies King" and, like Spencer Bennett, was more interested in faster and more effective than excitement. (Unfortunately, this team also featured two Superman series featuring Kirk Alyn, their sticky flying animation, canned music, and dull supporters). The opening of each chapter presents something in the future: "Batman vs Wizard", mechanical music droning, and heroes who blend or blend problems with two heroines that appear around the camera or face their cheap Halloween masks. The devil's horns and eagle dress sits in a weak manner so that the batman's servant must adjust it during battlefields. Its "utility bundle" is a piece of transparent lane without any part. Therefore, he still can draw a horizontal and oxygen tube in critical moments. <br /> <br /> In any case, the leading players are in bad condition. Robert Lowery shows little gameplay and personal skills such as Bruce Wayne and does not break dynamic figures like Batman. It makes an impression that I want to be somewhere else! John Duncan, like Robin, has difficulty managing a limited dialogue. He was filled with a more stuntman for himself. Rough, Lowery and Duncan are exciting businessmen, like tired businessmen, without a drink without a chemistry between Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft in 1943. <br /> <br /> Previously, BATMAN was able to provide a more energetic cast for the character development, even though it was not known. It offers a group of passers-by, not film supporters. None of the Hoodlums stands and they are run by one of the most dull villains, "The Wizard." (Great name!) In fact, somebody is preparing a sack, shawl and a sack on his head, with a dubbing sound trying in desperate danger. <br /> <br /> "The Chief Suspect" - the eccentric professor, the radio broadcaster, is simply concerned. <br /> <br /> Even the comic book created is "regular" too. It is difficult to distinguish romanticism between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne. Despite the dangers faced, Vicki does not actually emit any emotion. Commissioner Gordon is not very bright. Unlike the previous series, Alfred, butler, says the most important line is Mr. Wayne's residence. They are areas that are not drawn, loaded with gimmicks, unrelated, then recycled, recurring music and amateur production design. Wayne Manor resembles a suburban middle-class home on the outskirts of the motel, on an outskirts of any sitcom, on the edge. Batquave is an office that needs updating. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers can not make more effort to create an exciting adventure. Although the availability of two arrays on DVD is a plus for any serious "Batfan", do not be deceived by the excellent illustrations in the box. <br /> <br /> All 15 chapters of BATMAN and ROBIN capture the original mood of the comic book. <br /> <br /> Now for good news - this is not the 1997 version!
