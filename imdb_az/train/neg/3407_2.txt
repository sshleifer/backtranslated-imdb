Okay, forgetting all the technical weaknesses and physical impotence of Space Supply has begun with a golden heart by an angry robot. You have forgotten ugly special effects and weakly sized one-dimensional characters. Review the story's essence. The reason for this is that the film is primarily available and how do you see that this movie is merging? <br /> <br /> I know 9-year-olds who are dealing with this insult, and I'm just laughing. The story is horrible. The act is funny and the message they are trying to figure out is inaccessible. And worse, cable cables should show IT! Twice a day, every two or three days! <br /> <br /> There is something annoying to people living in the Caucasus. thing. Its just not worth it.
