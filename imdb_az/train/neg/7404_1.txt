<br /> <br /> I thought that this film, which is a great admirer of the Peace Hill and disappointed with the film's start, will give me. Mind, Fearnet only lists this movie as "Black Floor", rather than its full name. So when I saw the name Lord Lord, I immediately did not think that the group was thinking (there were a few friends in college), and lost their ideas aside. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a strong start. Despite being a "creepy little girl" for immortality, the good use of audio and insulation has really put the story to a standstill. The tense atmosphere is rapidly built, and each indicator shows the film is excellent. Since the monsters are the real stars of horror, I did not expect to see the main characters hide in the halls of the hospital where they were trapped ... <br /> And then the first monster showed up and I found myself in a very difficult situation. <br /> <br /> When I first appeared on the Megadeth concert, I was drowned and the silence completely abandoned me. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the film was terrible, and you wondered what was going on in the story, but the fear was quite void. But, I hope the latter will do everything worthwhile. Unfortunately, this did not happen. When I reached the end of the film, I was totally blaspheming and immediately knew the great evil at the last point ... Lordi's lead singer? Seriously? <br /> <br /> Was the movie all boiled? Lordi band members escaped from poor hospitals around a hospital by? Silly monster design was suddenly meaningful. If you're a quintet you can have Marilyn Manson members or KISS there too. A few years ago, I saw one of Lordi's music clips, I'm pretty sure. Did they go and take off a whole movie? <br /> <br /> The worst thing of all was that when I discovered what was happening, it was all I could handle. I will not "destroy" you, but I can assure you that this is a plot you've seen before. Most likely, once again. <br /> <br /> So if you are not a great Lord, do not be afraid. Not afraid, it does not bring anything new in this table (although there is a decent job of borrowing from other horror movies, mostly Silent Hill). And I can not emphasize it enough, the Lord is antagonist. Lord. Talk about a buzzkill. <br /> <br /> Of course, you are afraid to watch Slipknot music videos. In other words, it is impossible.
