The film is about a sabretooth that the young people will not lose in a fun park where a debris is hunting. As there are no rules, they go into a building and begin to be killed. Deaths are cheese and tulle. But at least a better effect was sabretooth. Stacy was here, and I liked the Sabretooth movie. I thought it was good, but some of the deaths were off-screen. When the two teenage kisses and the sabretooth head comes out, the boy leaves his daughter when she leaves her to open her fake-looking red mouth. Then, sabretooth goes out of the mouth and teaches children to shake his head. Last death with Sahib was completely fake-looking graphics. Even this death was foolish, because sculptures crossed the teeth and supported it, and there seemed to be an event that did not loose ties with a Gothic girl. The film is ironic and time consuming.
