Lynch. The man has many truths! He knows how to disturb us, and then he rewards us with thinking differently. However, it is completely different. The Dumbland Prize is a 1% absurd comedy that earns 99% of fools. Once he laughed, but I started to move rapidly around the fourth episode. He did not miss anything. When I finished, I was relieved, and this is part of a series. In frustrating cases, there is a series of trembling, boring animations, sounds and sounds related to boring symbols. However, they recognize this and other absurdist features, but still do not value Dumbledore.
