I did not understand the appeal of this show. Acting is weak (Debra Jo Rupp, noteworthy), most episodes are striking and weak, dialogue is weak, jokes are unfounded and even painful to try and sit through half an episode. Moreover, the relationship between the '70s' and the '70s' is extremely tough, and the decor and backdrop used for the show is nothing but a modern sitcom with old, unusual, clich√© scripts. Twenty years ago, they were dressed as a show with a hope of a nostalgic audience or something. Both "Happy Days" and "Wonder Years" are using this technique more efficiently and delighted to watch a show in contrast to these horrible, pessimistic excuses.
