Words can not describe this movie as totally horrible. This is a series of casual, unfunny clips about everything from a stupid Batman verbally to a man getting really (actually worried) with a dead lady. Only a fun thing about the underground comedy is watching Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this film. It also deserves the NC-17, the only one who can withstand it.
