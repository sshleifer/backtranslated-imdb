Thank you very much, this is a director of RAW ... most of us are not ready to meet the leaders. Sex, suicide, murder, and people's "self-exaltation" are constantly bombarding the audience that surprises me with trying to coordinate the concept of comfort or freedom. Although I do not think I'll see this movie again, I will say that the director is a good eye. In the film (fans, hair clippings) there were really good pictures and "picture moments" in the movie, but the story needs me more (when we ask ourselves, please note: if you have a whip or vomit easily ... do not see this movie.
