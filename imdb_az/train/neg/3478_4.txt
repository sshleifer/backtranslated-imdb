Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is set to avoid this Christmas alone. Not just a millionaire Drew; but also very surprising and guilty. Drew is heading home to a growing home and offers his family $ 250,000 for Valco's "family" throughout the Christmas season. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is reluctant, but Drew is quite strange to accept his offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) says little about it, but Drew knows about her confession ... her daughter does not agree with Alicia (Christina Applegate), but it's also a place for change. Drew's girlfriend Missy (Jennifer Morrison) follows Drew and wants to talk to her family with her family. Happy Christmas keeps the original entertainment store as hilarious gets a dysfunctional nightmare. Other members of cast: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck, though funny, is strange.
