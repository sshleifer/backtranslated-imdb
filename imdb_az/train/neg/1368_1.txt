One is the highest rating I can give to this movie, and zero and negative figures are not allowed. Pee yew giggles in a foolish whisper and smell and fart jokes, written and directed by a man with a twentieth-year-old elegance, with a lot of wasted b-list actors who do better. The character of Gene Stapelton (Ding-Bat, the whole family), who says Marilyn Henner sexually "throws both sides," was a cheap attempt to show the film's total craze ... Well, poor humor? Animal House, American Pie (Only One Part), Old School or Office Space is rented.
