My girlfriend and I went to see this movie as a premiere surprise, which we bought in advance for a movie before opening it in Denmark. We were sitting for 1 hour or so and then we left! The purpose of the film was to simply portray the cycle (and the club's 54), but it was a result of a characteristic development that was nothing but a lot of space. <br /> <br /> Rarely I was indifferent to the characters in the movie! <br /> <br /> Music is good though. Perhaps this is good if you want to listen to some good music and make the mood of the 70s. <br /> <br /> <strong> Economy>
