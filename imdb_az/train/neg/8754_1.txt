This movie is really terrible. After seeing the advertisement for this, I thought it would be his charm ... but that did not happen. Girls can not move and they will not read. The soundtrack of this film is full of their songs and is not a beautiful view, but a terrifying storyline, an incredible plot, one of Disney's worst movies by FAR! Ally is not a bad actress on "Future Phil" because I do not know what happens at Cow Belles. His sister AJ looks like a "fame" in her sisters, and she does not see so much talent. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie girls learn a little clich√© <br /> <br /> In some cases, this train accident has to be late to save the movie
