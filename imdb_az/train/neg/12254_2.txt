Some may be disappointed, but in fact, there is a real art of producing bad movies. Many young people - women with breastplates and durable moist T-shirts naturally go to the "blood-surfing" movie and have 31 foot crocodiles. <br /> <br /> Only croc is not explicitly fake, but when some of the requisites [especially when seeing the ship reef] appear to be out of the thunderstorm! <br /> <br is not good from start to finish. Do not see!
