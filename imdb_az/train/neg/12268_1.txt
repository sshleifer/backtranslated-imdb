I saw four other Japanese horror films and they were not very impressed. <br /> <br /> Life is a companion. <br /> <br /> Life is a companion. This applies to a detective who is trying to connect similar crimes. It is astonishing that a suspect continues to question a suspicious ghost when questioning him. <br /> <br /> Keeps in touch with his wife. Oh, no. The film continues to hold perspectives on different characters that have little to do with the story. I've seen other films showing a different perspective before. <br /> <br /> Besides, anything that happens on the screen really ends up in an unbearable way. For example, there are several scenes that are set up with a small tool and ... then cut to another area. I know it can dramatically affect it. Here is not necessarily intention. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a shocking "soul" in a "cowardly" or unusually ridiculous way. <br/> <br /> <br /> I'm talking about the events in the Caucasus. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify" After one of them, the film is over, and the wave of confusion has proven that we've all fallen in time, and some of us did not laugh and laugh. Simply put, AVOID.
