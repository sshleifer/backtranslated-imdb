Maybe I've seen five-minute "Jerry Springer". I do not consider myself a snob, but I really think I'm watching the show. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie as part of a leading public research event. They tell me that this movie does not really have a relationship with Springer, but rather focused on the lives of those who appear in Springer. Well done, this movie could actually have been an exciting look at people in this life. I will admit that I felt empathy for Connie (Molly Hagan). This is all things in life. <br /> <br /> I feel Molly Hagan's regret about this. After this film, he basically became a "B" on TV. I'll tell you about Hakan. She is a very beautiful and intelligent woman. I do not doubt that he plays a very important role in his work and tries to play his role very empathetically. The point is that Hagan does not carry a scene. He simply does not know what's needed to make a leading role. His best work is always Angel's "Head of Hermann" (a great show, but his heart is right), and when Seinfeld is hosted as Sister Roberta.
