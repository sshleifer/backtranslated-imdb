Christ, oh Christ ... An hour of confusion is incredible and maybe confusing, because this magic job emerges with all the intelligence and capabilities of a naked Galapagos turtle. Can such things happen? Does this movie really exist, or is my stomach, a strange international drug company incompetent, does not know that it is suffering from a dangerous halusinogen by sipping coffee? I've seen many movies and many bad movies, but nothing has been prepared for me; until the end I was crying with my teeth as a dog, roasting on the walls, and crying to my lungs. I kindly begged for mercy (I did not betray anyone, I did not know it) and Ozu wished for Yasujiro's refreshing cats. Basically weeping, Jesus, memories ... sometimes come back to me. When I'm most vulnerable I can not handle them. I am trembling, I break my tears, and drip my fingers until I cover it with blood, but I can not destroy the horrors of my mind. I made a mistake. I suffered. <br /> <br /> In another user's comment, when I am exposed to this terrible experience, I can not be alone in expressing one of two things: a) the film actually exists; or b) I'm a victim of the legion of conspiracy. Some people are able to protect themselves from foolishness, some of whom have been troubled or at least not traumatized. Perhaps they are part of the operation. Damn them, manicure! God damn them to Hell !!!!!!
