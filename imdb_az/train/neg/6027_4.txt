I grew up in Baptist and I do not believe in the story of this movie, though I am trying to explain the story of this movie. I'm going to give you the film's kudos for being as good as the average life weekly film. It's slightly interesting, mediocre, a little slow, the script can be predicted, music is gratifying, and a little melodramatic. All the remaining people must be the most magnificent Christians. They are not the words of any curse. But the actor laughed at the United Nations with a loud voice as he played with a man working as a "nucleus". In all, there are many Christians who claim to have God's name calling for a Christian code of honor that all Christians should cover their ignorance by replacing that word in the same way? LOL! It really was difficult to make a serious film after the movie. After the "Nu-Cu" event, the film began to feel like a packaged, manipulative propaganda. We were looking for something brave. In fact, we were looking for something to think of, but I did not find it here. If you are looking for foolish entertainment, stop here - it's good to kill the rainy day. But if you're looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
