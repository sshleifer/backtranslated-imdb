"Cut" is a film about some filmmakers who shoot the movie. In the "Scream" mold, it is a horror that is very forward, a reaction that is at least for me. Because, it's still a horrible film for all its irony, and it's the movies it refers to. <br /> <br /> But he did not have the charm. Yes, an attraction. Molly Ringwald was fantastic as a spoiled, frantic American actress who hated every minute to work with an amateur Australian film crew. He says he was happy to work with anyone who deals with Cut, though he was convinced that he was not a charming act. :-) <br /> <br /> Seriously, there was a great scene, sulking or hitting scene. <br /> <br /> In any case, Cut has some laughs, some strange (some surprisingly terrifying) and ultimately another worst fright.
