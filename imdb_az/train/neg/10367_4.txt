This movie is written weakly, poorly moving and highly anticipated. It was a very low budget, and I understand why I was never let out and went straight to the video. Not even a surprising fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could take 1-1 / 2 hours back! The colors were horrible, along with the land, which is a huge hole. <br /> <br /> The husband himself did what the young bride could not do physically - it was a lengthening! Skip this movie and see something better in the horror genre. <br /> <br /> Ejames6342 comes with a better idea of ​​any movie. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
