M.Barnin's artwork creates confusion and connects viewers who can begin experimental cinematic evaluations in some other way. Typical empty post-modern "conceptual" art. Check his interviews. I just apologize for not buying it. And so boring. <br /> <br /> I have not seen Alejandro Jodorowsky's films. In particular, when offering the possibility of something, in fact, it is an unofficial "meeting" in the sea, one thing (the starting and the great choreographic dance and the preparation of the ship) ... Ideas (if this was not faded) was a valuable object As a matter of fact ... These "pearl" divers ... Everything could have created a great sublime drama, but it did not. <br /> <br /> I have some beautiful scenes, but the whole movie was very boring and ambitious, completely empty and fake, so I was respected and respected. physically ill. <br /> <br /> And does not have a good pace. I love slow-paced movies, but it was just boring in some scenes - it was ambitious and fraudulent - so for a long time I was forced to witness artistic prohibition scenes ... <br /> <br /> This kind of film art and spirini kills in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Want more Jodorowsky!
