Very sorry. It is difficult to offer any spoiler in this movie because there is almost no development on the beach. Everything appears in the first ten minutes and looks like it is dry. The player seems to be very bad, but sometimes recalls the movies of the old black and white Maoist era, which is sometimes shown in Chinese television during the daytime. Although it is difficult to speak with the role of a woman, Yuwen, the story requires only a wooden picnic ride. This is reminiscent of the pale star Gong Li, who always had a reputation as a good actress in the West to be a scowl on the face. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang's 'Blue Kite' was a better movie. However, do not be fooled by the fact that Spring is a small city, built in the late 40s. Unlike the blue source, the truth that this film was created during the reign does not belong to this area, but the ruins of the city are nothing but a background. <br /> <br /> Tian Zhuangzhuang simply tries to appeal to an international audience who can not drag the popularity of Chinese films in the West and tell the difference between a "beautiful" deep or "hypnotic" and just a tedious film. <br /> <br /> If any movie fits the description of "overrated", this is so. I do not see any reason to stop worrying about the Chinese movie industry.
