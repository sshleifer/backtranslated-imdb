Wolves' eyes (1999) is a really bad movie. Stage was good, but overall execution was simply terrible. Instead of speeding up the production of filmmakers, they took the time to do so. Some of the blind guy gets some new eyes, something bad is about the middle aged werewolves. When the evil one turns into a seemingly evil creature, the evil person is in the devil. Can a girl find a cure that her partner does not find? Who is the weird little traitor who helped her and was with this woman's police? <br /> <br /> It's not a bad idea of ​​a movie. Before filming, we wished that filmmakers spend a lot of time in production.
