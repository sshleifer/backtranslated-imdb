This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I can not say how bad it is. Honestly, I wanted to kill myself several times from this ugly experience to end pain. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend watching this movie, but if you get acidic, at least you will know a part of the pain without a scar. <br /> <br /> When I read the DVD, I was so excited that when I told them that Jesus was following them, I was so excited ... I wanted to kill myself. The most sinister symbols in film history are a twenty-three minute entry ... JUST WOULD! The monkeys could have done a better job for the trash. At least they were thrown into najis and some garbage was found. It would make it worse if someone did not see the horror. <br /> <br /> I did not achieve jokes, they were not only funny, they re-repeated themselves as twenty. Apparently, if you look at a million times, something is not funny. <br /> <br /> Do not see it in any case. People regarded Manos Taba Hands as the worst movie in the world. I have seen it and I admit that it is bad ... but ALAS is only the worst of the second. <br /> <br /> It's worth every hard word, but I can not write it down, so I drank all the support.
