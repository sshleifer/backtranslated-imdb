This move was on television last night. Because I think it's time-consuming because it's a bad thing! The film is a pretext to show off about half a dozen horses and donkeys in some places and in some places. (It is not the poorest donkeys and donkeys). But the story is very funny for words. "Kurt", if you can call it, it does not exactly display its teeth. When looking at all of these, there were some CGI trainees, as the worm worked on a treadmill and the CGI treasure seemed to shine, and all the brightest movies were full of snow and blood, and you could easily see where someone was killed / destroyed / eaten. <br /> <br /> If you love such splatter movies, you will be disappointed, but you have not done a good job. <br /> <br /> I did not start the actors ... Very small lines and girls scream about every 5 seconds. <br /> <br /> And if someone asked me not to do something bad to give me a few bucks, hey, where can I register? <br /> <br /> Total dull and terrible horror.
