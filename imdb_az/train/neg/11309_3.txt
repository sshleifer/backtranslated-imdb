One of the top 5 films is Bad Film, which is a good scene with the best scene (though it's a good movie B). But something has always bothered me about this movie: How is Mariska Hargitay talking? In the TV version, he shares a few intimate moments with Jeff Conman, even kissing in a garden. However, in a regular (video) version, most of his scenes are cut off and can never speak. It's bothering me because it's just a woman's cliched look, and the last shooting seems creepy. It would have been better if he had kept the scenes of this movie, because at least one of those scenes.
