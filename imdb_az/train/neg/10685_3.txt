Future, hackneyed and badly written. I thought foolishly would not be drawn to such a prominent player as long as he deserved it. Now, the competition between actors is very tense and I guess that these days (and only the worse) will be able to pick and choose more. Earlier we were given an authoritative author, and from now on we have lowered our throats. The film did not have intrigue which gave us some details for the murder and only one reason. Some of the conversation was shameful! It is difficult to believe that everyone even tries to tens of millions of dollars to accomplish this.
