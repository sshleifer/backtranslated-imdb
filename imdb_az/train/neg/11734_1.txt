It's tasteless. I can not write about the movie wisely. He laughed all the film. It should have been funny. There is no clue what Matt Farnsworth did. His story is written, there is no information about the Iowa culture and the meth problem. I know Farnsworth is from Iowa, and his film is even more surprising to me. Why are two main characters highlighted? It does not make any sense. The player's best and sometimes hard to watch. Magnificent violence and sex movie full. I guess that violence and sex are to be sensitive to the film, but it is incredible and insulting. The film is about to end so much that everything I can do is not laughable and look at the disbelieving loans. Everyone else who came out of the theater laughed at me. The film's end was intended to awaken tears, but it was exactly the opposite. If you want to see hell, sappy, overacted, clich√©d drivel, do not waste time for this terrific movie.
