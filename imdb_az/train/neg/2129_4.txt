According to my humble opinion, this version of this great BDWY music has only two things going on for it - Tyne Daly and a version shot with the original script. (OK is good to watch Vanessa Williams.) But there is everything for me. Most of the bread rolls on the show - Chynna Phillips seems to have no idea who really is and who no one has ever played on Harry McAfee, when George Wendt did not want Boston to go back to the bar chair. Jason Alexandre is passive, but it is forced to go crazy and bugsy Malone saw a better dance. As I said, it's good to have a version of the script now, but I hope you do not judge the music there.
