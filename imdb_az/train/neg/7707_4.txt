With a theme like "Killer Tomato Attack", anyone who is involved in this thing can either (a) have a bad fantasy film or b) have fun with a bad comedy of evil science fiction films. <br /> <br /> It's never possible to take this movie seriously, but I understand it, but I know it. It was necessary to think that it was funny, right? I just saw a few jokes or situations that are funny (ie, side-by-side phone calls, Russian Olympic spies, steroid cereals, Superman, and others browsing by Lois). "Killer Tomato Attack" is trying to be a cult classic, but it does not. A cult is a classic film, which only distinguish it from a selected group (or similar description). <br /> <br /> <strong> Killer Tomato Attack> 8-year-old can be used with any bad sense of humor, so this can not be considered a cult film. <br /> <br /> Everything you have is a good actress: Sharon Taylor, like Lois Fairchild. He is a gentle, dangerous messenger, but he has a good personality, loves to pretend, and is a natural comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There are a few fun things to do, so I advise you to see it once. Avoid cutting off the director, some "lost" footage (called in the English language outside the print cartridge), called the film's producer and sometimes a "lieutenant" nickname.
