These "Star Trek" films were "Star Trek" because Zatoichi films - in this case, each of the original was a bigger, brighter, more fun and interesting, if the substance is more important than the surface. If I had never seen them, I would have thought good but empty; Because I considered his style inconsistent, and its contents were enough. The idea of ​​reviving the character in a larger, slicker production was well sounded, but there was nothing else but the hope of earning money; it's just a show that does not miss the atmosphere of a character world and has never been able to go anywhere (and the actor is not the best). At the final stage of my life, I was hoping to see him in a story to see him in a beautiful way and to draw a conclusion from his overall experience; It repeats fragments and pieces from other films compared to the severity of sex and sfx. Not the same experience.
