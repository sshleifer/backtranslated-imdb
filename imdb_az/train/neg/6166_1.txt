I do not recommend this movie because it is wrong and misleading, this story should have been in the Algerian Berber area, it was shot in the southern Tunisian desert (a completely different culture, I know Tunisia and Algeria), the other shocking element was the character of the comrade, , at the university level speaking of academic French, the character he should not be disturbed, Bedouin, in this context, is a "femme repudiee" segment, the most comprehensive scene and especially the disrespect for the people of the region, a writer / director's pure invention, an Algerian Society that will not happen!
