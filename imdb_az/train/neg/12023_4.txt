Reed Diamond is playing a man who has been suffering from amnesia in mental shelter for more than a decade after being curious about the back of the blood. Doctors want to try a new experimental drug, if it does, to restore lost memories. But when the medicines give him a hallucination, he chooses instead to run away. Apart from being friendly with a young boy who oppresses his mother (Greg Grunberg), he will not let him approach the dark room in the basement, and he is generally suspicious. <br /> <br /> It's an easy way to figure out the way before the film's emergence, and I've found the player to grab enough of Mr. Diamond's attention throughout my actions. (It's a great movie, since I have been a big fan since Criminal and its short, but extremely pivotal, Journeyman and Shield's role through the Dollhouse, on the meaning of the full disclosure), nor a good one but adequate service. I liked the previous films, but the film's director / writer Michael Hurst (Room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Mansquito) <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: My Price: C-
