<br /> <br /> I took this movie for a belt in the National Wholesale Leadership and after watching it, I feel like it's broken. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I've seen a worse movie than that. Honestly. <br /> <br /> I never wrote the negative theory of a movie that would have been so greatly respected, Stephen Foster and his music. <br /> <br /> What is first? Is this a music biography? Yes, there are plenty of tunes from Foster and these are the lively Broadway-Jerome Kern-type numbers, which are more than the Mississippi delta. I would like to say that someone has won PAID to write this wallet? Secondly, Foster's REAL story is interesting. Why is not it so close? Third, what was the great Ray Middleton to shoot this movie? Pictures with small boys ?? Communists? <br /> <br /> So, Foster friends, fear the truth and good entertainment ... very, very scared.
