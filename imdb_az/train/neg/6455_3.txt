It's really a terrible movie. However, it is expected. Obviously, low budget: not something innovative but it's always an actress playing a napkin in a shower (called "acting"), a reptile suit, a predator, trees, etc. But there are some salvage points. The story is not new, but in most parts there are several unregulated parts. First, the black guy is immortal (the first time) during the attack, and he is not one of the first dying couples. But this is small. More importantly, there is a very interesting twist on Kat's experiences and about coming to Wes & Steve. When I talked to Steve Kat, he knew what he was doing, and I believed what he said and did. But in fact, when I was really revealing who really was, I was pleasantly surprised at the novelty of my revelation. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < </ font> <br /> If you're in a mood for a cheap scif flick.
