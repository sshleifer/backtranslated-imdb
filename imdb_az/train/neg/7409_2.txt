There are some elements to get this movie out of a disaster, but it's shattered with bad behaviors, field holes, cunning machines, stupid dialogs, weak scripts, and predictable clichés ... <br /> <br /> Those here are often is a scary movie with a story that can not go on. First, a possible group of heroes, including the Gypsy (yes, this cliché is still alive in Finland), tries to get out of the mysteriously empty hospitals. Crazy ghosts (very creative), zombies (at least at some point I thought they did not use zombies, but they came), and the Finnish glam-rock band set off with satanic makeup. Sometimes there is a slider doodle, but does not add anything to the story line. Autistic girls and a hobo seem to have a deeper understanding of the situation, but they do not write it to the audience or to their mixed friends. Their lines include only deeper life lessons: "What will happen ..." or "Can not live in darkness" ... or "I need a red colored red caravan". So all of these characters (including being a dysfunctional father and anxious to become a sweet doctor) lead them to the dark ground or to the wrong jinn. Sometimes a ghost or a group of zombies emerges and if it looks like a devil and a keyboardist, it's just a claim that if a lantern roared and talked about a group of six people coming to it. Carefully this devil can break down many trouble-free walls, but the gate of the elevator is beyond its capabilities. <br /> <br /> In the end, we've got a breeze of the "all-in-one" series. Or maybe not. My son, I wish this film wanted and that's what makes time faster, all this is only 10 minutes or more ...
