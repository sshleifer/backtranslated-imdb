When Stanwyck's husband was murdered after being married, she withdrew from the cliff and returned to a mountain lake where a wealthy lawyer Morgan was rescued. Morgan falls in love with her, ends up having a one-sided marriage, and spends a great deal in Chicago (it's covered by the mountains!). Stanwyck is fooling Cortez, but eventually Morgana returns with a very unhappy and unfounded story. <br /> <br /> This movie has a great player (Morgan is especially one of my favorites) and a great director, but the violin smokes and sometimes seems pointless. I was prepared to use this movie, but eventually I was disappointed. It is good for anyone who is still modest and loves the movies of the 1930s.
