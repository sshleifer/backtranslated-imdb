You are ashamed of Mark Hamill's CORVETTE YUMURU. This time, he uses a new kind of "power" to restore the ghost carpet, the vivid red Vette. The age of another horse is fluttered in the first half hour, and it turns out to be in the wrong direction. Writing and managing your work instantly, you will not be able to get through a few scenes. You expect this to happen anytime, and you smell the late-70s hodgepodge smell. Just like Annie Potts, a new visitor would easily steal the show and save this bad movie from the repo creeps! His non-practical, but beautiful personality is of interest to the good and it is the best chance to see it in the swimsuit. Hooray to Annie! Sorry, Mark! Probably this time was not with you.
