Based on the key story, you know you are disturbed by telling you who survived. All these disappear. Needless to say, "Matrix" - bullet-time camera work. Video cuts to the game shots. Small old sea captains and wacky sailors. The Ravers, who have become skillful fighters in an eye blink. Even the zombie is boring. <br /> <br /> I am hoping for at least "very good this is good" zombie film, but the "evil of those who engage in art" should never be banned from filming. "<br /> <br />
