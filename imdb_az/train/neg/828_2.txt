Let's see. In the "Loyal Places" final we knew that there was no hospital and that everything was in the mind of an autistic child. "Newhart" said it was a dream. And Roseanne understood that all this happened in his mind. Very "creative". Annoying was more like it. Yes, it was just a television show and it was not all true. Only when you are captured in a big movie or television show you are ending at least wanting to believe that it's all "real". At least, it is the reality reflecting on the screen. This kind of serial philosophy was made twice before and the old hat to watch was frustrating and entertaining. Now "Newhart" is all a dream? At least in a creative way, the show has overcome everyone's expectations. The idea itself was not very attractive, but in such a brilliant way, he saw it as the Best Series Finale Ever. Roseanne left me feeling cheated after I became such a loyal fan.
