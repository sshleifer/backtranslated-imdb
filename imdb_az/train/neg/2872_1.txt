This is the worst horror I have ever seen at the age of 29. If someone does not give you this, I'll say NO to them. This movie is a delicate worker to know what you are watching. The area is the worst part of this movie ..... its functioning, camera work, lighting and sound. There is nothing disliked by this movie. Everyone paid for this movie is now broken. I hope the director will never get a green color for another movie. In the defense, this film was quickly taken to try to spy on the ICTK's assassin, but I saw a weekly film similar to Oscar winners.
