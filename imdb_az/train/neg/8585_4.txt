Yes, I want to say, "The Emperor has no clothes." Seeing this show at PBS last night, he was both hopeful and uneasy. I liked the "Morse" (even going to get a full set of DVDs) and I always felt that I loved Kevin Whately's Sgt. The character of Lewis, the show was the time of John Thaw! After watching the new "Inspector Lewis" (as here billed), I'm more convinced that I'm right ... How good (although she looks too bad and too greasy) There is no charisma to hold such a witness as Thaw. <br /> <br /> And like his "sidekick" Fox, maybe the reviewers here in England can understand his words, but <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <strong> left "Morse" rested in peace.
