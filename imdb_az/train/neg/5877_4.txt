Williamson's emphasis is hard to pass. He speaks incredibly fast as he is in a hurry to cross the lines. Whenever he needs to chat with him, he acts as if talking to someone. All in all and his bald spot just bothered me. For that role he was too old. When he read Williamson's other accounts, he probably took that role because he was crazy, and the director decided to move on a little lifestyle-art or compulsory. Believe it when actors declare Hamlet's argument! Marianne Faithful is a stunning beauty and can close Ophelia's role and can still get a link. This set is a dark and reminder, but it seems that the real king appears as a real fortress seen in tunnels / corridors, where light is shining in heaven.
