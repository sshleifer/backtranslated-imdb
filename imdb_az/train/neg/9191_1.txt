Yes, I have to write on the computer and watch your eyes watching this pond. Why? Because I have to introduce you to the fact that this film is so bad. This is incredibly bad. I'll present these little details about the movie to tell you how bad you are. Usually, a scene from a video game is played during confusion scenes that result from shooting or hitting zombies. Yes, you heard me right. This movie is really good. In fact, I think it's worth ten dollars to go into theaters lately. Is Egypt similar? There is no story to tell the story, and there is nothing in the film to offer casual boob and other than really cheaper borders. As I watched it, I really was surprised about it. Okay, I'm dumbstruck. It's too bad that I can find words. RATING: Quit ZERO *****.
