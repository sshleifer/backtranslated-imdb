I feel like I was watching a strange movie .... beautiful moving, modest, boring and terrible thing! The most basic and comprehensive sense of the word is two hours of lying, such as sexual violence and torture, aggression, overgrowth, incest, corruption, libel, and abusive, abusive, abusive. There is no charge. And I had fun. Could not stop watching. It tells me about a world that is so desensitized about me, about those who do and act on these things, finally, that the real snuff films will become the norm? I am neither smooth nor crooked, I am not trying to hide from the darkness, and I have not lived a sheltered life, but I am ashamed of myself. And I'm sorry to see my brothers slide through this issue through my tribe. It is not necessary to be comfortable, but is it necessary to be involved in faithful sadism?
