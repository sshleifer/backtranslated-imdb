A sentimental school drama founded in Denmark in 1969, "We Are Aarziz", offers a Danish who welcomes the culture of the United States. Fritz (Janus Dissing Rathke) comes out with a 13-year-old loyal flower ear earned by the half-brother of the brutal master Lindum-Svendsen (Bent Mejding). Lindum-Svendsen, a school principal, describes the local community as described as a fascist tyrant. Lindum-Svendsen was so far away that he was saved from a psychological breakdown with his father (of course not enough drama) and Mr. Svale ("Hello, Freddie Call me"), an extravagant clever hippie music teacher, <br /> <br /> <strong> Fritz stands for justice. <br /> <br /> What do you say? It is unsatisfactory, very unusual, and does not start to convince Scandinavian viewers who do not apologize for something strangely charged, such as a "family" with a strange kind of story. Sorry, dear Danish readers will enter your syndicated way in such a way. However, it is not necessarily a fairy tale about 'boy fighting with the system'. The boy is never transformed into a human being, but rather a naive, big-eyed cry. <br /> <br /> If you are in the pictures of your family, see a society of a small town with a little thoughtful, happy foot instead of cartoon character.
