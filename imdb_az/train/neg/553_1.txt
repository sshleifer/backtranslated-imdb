After enduring patience, I do not want to say that I will not join the whole series first. The last episode was against the previous seven years. Everything destroyed. The trip was 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the power to reduce it ... let's just say, seven years. Why seven? Why not just one? Or something? Why not worry about the adventure? The crusaders were dying while walking along the road. Why does he want to save only ninety-nine? Others do not count or what? The crew's home is the most ridiculous part that tells them that it's not really important for them to go home. As we said, "the appointment is more important than the appointment." It's incredible. It was surrounded by other federation ships in the final area and the place appeared. <br /> <br /> <strong>
