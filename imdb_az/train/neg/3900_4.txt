As the book reads, I can say that it is far less than the great American version of Gwyneth Paltrow. There are various reasons for this. First, Emma is very unpleasant. Yes, he has errors and is not the easiest person - but the viewer must begin to look deeply at him. Second, Mr Knightly is miscast. In this version, his drunkenness and melancholy Bronte or Gaskell adaptation are better suited than Austen and inspire the whole thing to "fire". Third, Samantha is a very powerful actress for the role of Morton Harriet; and why did he look so ill? Harriet is blond and blooming - does not look like it will be done by the consumer on the next stage. Fourth, the structure was mucked and scenes were cut off. Finally, when Emma decided, when she liked Mr. Knightly, this story came in a very surprising way, because this feature film was not enough and it was filmed. For the fifth time, of course, what happened to Elton's emphasis? He went on to speak as an American actress who was halfway down the street trying to suppress his peak at first, and eventually turned his back on English. Finally, it finally drifted. The book and the great movie version end with Emma and Mr. Knightly's wedding. <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Read the book or download the Paltrow version lease it
