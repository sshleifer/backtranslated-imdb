It's hard to find any positive in this movie. If the manufacturer is required to pay a lot without paying too much money, and we are cautious about showing that he is an excuse for a movie in the history of Galaxy. The police seemed very sexy with their little ones. The two police would have more traffic and fewer routes than the Galaxy. Of course, we will add to the budget that they decided to fill the place with this accident. Ms Albright is very good looking sexy and the player's first rate. I heard, but before she heard, Ms. Stabs did not appear, but she seems to be deprived of her basic acting skills. Except for Mr Albright, this is a real trash.
