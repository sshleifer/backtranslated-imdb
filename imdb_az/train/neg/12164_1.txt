this movie is not good. The first was almost sucked, but watching.It was nothing but an unrealistic thing. This is a horror movie, a zero-voltage or suspense.this is really a horror movie. do not show anything. There is nothing to talk about. it can be almost a television, with a little bit of nudity and a bit of violence. Acting is not good, either. surprise, surprise, surprise, is not one. even though it's less than 80 minutes, so it's good. I've felt something more. Anchor Bay edition.anyway, this version of Sleepaway Camp II, gets a big oil from me, if you want to have a more versatile version of this film.i much cheaper than still, . Anchor Bay's Sleepaway Camp features three sets of special features that are not cut off when you're a pseudo, probably a boring and unpleasant camper.if real fan of the movie.
