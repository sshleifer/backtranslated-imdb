I was hoping to see a classic story adaptation like the Arab night. Instead, I was disappointed in a movie that could not hold it right from the start, though I tried to watch it twice! <br /> <br /> Karadin was a bonus in this film, but there was not much that the actors did not have. Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras are somewhat similar to Zorro for action, funny moments and better overall enjoyment <br /> <br /> OK, so Dragon's son has many possible fans out there, the martial arts and the land There is nothing to do in terms of linearity. If only children want a Sunday afternoons, maybe this is for you with three ninjas.
