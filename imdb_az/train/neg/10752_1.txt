This movie was very heartwarming. The Blurb I decided to see was Phantom Love (why not say this?) I was expecting an arty and thoughtful thing with a beautiful view. There were some interesting images, but they often appeared random and did not make any sense. In fact, they seemed to have come to fill their time. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the film was meant to be an atmosphere, but it was only. The absence of a consistent plot did not help. <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Without looking at the cast list I <BR> you see the main character as a child. The film has very few contexts for time, space, or character. I'm not prude, but sex scenes (some of them) were meaningless and made me even more confident, I knew Lulu, but I'm not sure if the same man, different men, lover, husband or prostitute. Only the fox was supposed to belong to his lover when I saw the loans I had retrieved. This film was able to do some shocking things (shocking sequences from Lulu's mother) who shocked her. <br /> <br /> According to some indications of the emotional state of the pound, nail preparation was actually more meaningful. <strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> I'm talking about it I must do.
