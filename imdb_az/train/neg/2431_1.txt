As a Turkish living in Sweden I have to admit that I often watch Scandinavian films. Most of them I do not understand. I think scandinavian actors work well in Hollywood. Last week I watched a Polish wedding with a Polish friend and said that this film was the worst movie we've ever seen. Unfortunately, this movie is worse than the "Angels House". None of the actors can move, certainly not the woman called Helen Bergstrom. It is impossible for the land to believe in a unique person. Very bad behavior, except for Selldal and Wollter.
