While some speeches are good, Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and two Italian girlfriends come to my senses - the story is naked and derivative, highlighting the girl's background was hardly managed and the relatives were mostly described as stereotypes, not as real people . I found myself in an awkward moments when I needed to be laughable. I'm surprised at the SF that the local document here says that this movie is good and that WHD has left its view on the IMDb. I'm very disappointed with this movie, and I have repeatedly gone to a theater to see it based on wrong connections with the Garden State, a fun, more inventive and entertaining movie. I must especially touch the romantic peak in the church, which is one of the numbers I left on the board and some of the audience really was DID. 10 minutes before I saw this cemetery, I saw a foolish peak. I really misunderstood to spend our money unnecessarily.
