The screen on the screen is very painful for me to waste 2 hours of my life, and I will never come back (I've heard it before). Acting is this. No doubt, enough time is spent watching and waiting for things to happen. However, there is nothing original in this film. Although the first Cube was a nerdy horror movie that did not make much sense at the end, the cube dropped on it and tried to repeat the same story, but this time it did not exclude anything else. spoons for each detail that the first film did not answer. It's a funny thing, the director repeats the exact scenes of the first movie that is some strange and tries to explain them. However, scenes are only copied, no adaptations. This script is meaningless. Imagine that a semi-intelligent 15-year-old baseball cap and a beer pack were written for a class project. The best part is in the hands of a 'good' stranger at the end, and you see a late man in the first movie, and you see it in 1997 when you find Cuba (this room is green ...). Goodie gooodie, mud grass, what a twist. First, if you did not see the first one, the director did not give any meaning to the nitwit. Oh, it's another idea: instead of numbers (1997 cube) to set the x, y, z coordinates of the room, this is three letters, each of which gives one of 26 possible coordinate values. Duh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A MP living in the Caucasus, in this movie, is very bad, contradictory or just stupid ideas. Directors / writers should have some talents.
