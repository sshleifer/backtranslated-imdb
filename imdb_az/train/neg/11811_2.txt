When you're on the bus and you know someone decides to tell you the story of life, and you really sit on your face with a terrible smile, foolish and clash? Well, when watching this movie, there was a similar feeling. Okay, I really wanted to go in April and choose what to do, and I knew about Nanny Moretti's taste to create one and only star from Caro Diario, but after half an hour after this last taxi, Moretti was a madman from all rifles. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least a few other characters could get a word on fugitives. Since April, Moretti has exclusive rights to dialogue, since everything you hear about one-and-a-half hour seems to be the best of your politics, or a popular culture that is of interest. at present. She took the time to shut down films that I did not like, and I thought something was protected for those who lost it. Certainly, I wanted to be in such a state that he was a little clever to think and think about movies. Perhaps he is a man with a good film, some ideas and a decent structure, or perhaps a whirlwind of his voice. And when it started to drift on a newborn baby, I just did not want to go and stay in the normal company, preferably a self-admired film director, with a strange piece of tasteful music. If someone you do not know the next time tries to explain the story of life, give them a slap. Every blow in the fight against morality will be a little victory.
