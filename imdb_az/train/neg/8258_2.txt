I'm very happy to read the book before you see the movie. It was a teenage epic, a dream of a summer, a great potential, a movie, or a big budget drama. Taking into account that, without realizing anything, they clearly pointed out Boogie Nights and Rushmore. The scenario loses the book's flesh over forced emotional notes and low brown sticks. The characters in the book were rich and textured, but they were cut off due to embarrassing characters. Mason Gamble is great when it comes to Dylan Baker, but the skeleton that runs from the story runs bad after a school. Poor People = GOOD, Rich People = Bad. <br /> <br /> Gary Sinise is worth a look at to see the South California beach, which parks its trailer for delivering to the Gulf of Delaware. <br /> <br /> This is not a good book, for the first time a shameful turn for director Mills Goodloe. <br /> <br /> K.
