I'm tired of all these small circulations about how this movie is "boiling". This is a CRAP that moves more than a clean CG! Do not send an Assassin, it is more logical to smuggle hundreds of bright, colored, aggressive, poisonous snakes into a plan! People have only one reason for loving this movie. It's not bad, it's bad, but it's so bad that I'd like to get rid of a sharp stick in my eyes, and then I'm still in this job. I really thought it would be a COMEDY like AIRPLANE! A parody! I'm wrong. All this is "Very hungry, go!" Otherwise, Samuel A. Jackson says: "Announcements on the plane!" Well, I do not want to apologize, I'm sorry, many gang film industry Triple X and Die Hard If you spend money to watch a movie in the company of William Hung's people, they still live in their moms basement and play online on the computer If you are saddened by the day's plastic chair while watching and watching porn, then the Theater is in a hurry and a plan to fly a year because of a divine lightning that I think of as a girlfriend. Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Shades and more. No mood in good movie viewing. The true fall of Western civilization: This cult film is an insult to a real Kult classic, such as a Repo man, or even Orgazmo.
