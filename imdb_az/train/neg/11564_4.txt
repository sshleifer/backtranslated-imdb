A horror film in Italy about a wealthy English lord watching pubs and monkeys for red-haired girls, such as his recently-dying comrade Evelyn. You know his wife very much because he brings them home - a big, rotten fortress - breaking them up and then torturing them, rushing them and killing them. The most strange thing about this film is what Antonio De Teffe has ever seen as a HERO movie by the end of the film. In any case, sooner or later his playboy, Roberto Maldera, advised De Teffe to live with a girl he met at his uncle's party. He moves and strange things start to fall into De Teffe's fragile state. He begins to see and hear his dead friend, and finally look at the title if you are still interested. Additionally, family members and friends begin to die with the most brutal fashion. Poor Aunt Agatha (who resembles that she is smaller than De Teffe and looks like she is in a wheelchair and looks old), a foxy fashion meets her fate. Another person is injected and then buried alive. Of course, there is an explanation for what Evelyn has done. Emilyo Miraglian's director, Emilyo Miraglia, is doing very good things: the film's settings are conducive to convincing us that Britain is the best, although it is affordable for this movie. None of the actors are in English. Many of the dark-haired and Mediterranean-colored men and women wearing a dress would not die. The car is drawn to the wrong side of the road. But despite all this, the crypt scene was shot effectively and I liked the unloved resolution. And of course, any movie with sexy, red-headed Erika Blanc is always a plus. There is a number of sexual immorality; but he was appalled by the assertion that he was tortured and healthy, to release one of the devils of his mind. C'mon.
