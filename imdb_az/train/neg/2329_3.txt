When they killed the character of John Amos, they killed the show. Data was a vital part of the structure. An inner city told his family that they were struggling to do what they knew well. They were poor and black, and they proved that nothing was too difficult in Jesus and your family. Undoubtedly, James will not lose his job and JJ fails in school, but the family has always been able to find a way out. <br /> <br /> Jacob is a powerful man model of income and discipline of children. Florida was a strong lady when everyone needed a shoulder to cry or shut. Children have personalities and entries that are important as family unity. Their neighbor, Willona, ​​was also a key element, because she was not just a friend, but dear enough to be a family. The work was brilliant, strange, funny and honest until you changed the program. James died and JJ made a show. Flo was still a mommy, Thelma bloomed a rooster and Michael was still a militant midget, but JJ was a show. They expected us to be able to stay in the apartment without a father or a notable bakery. I think that James's salary did not work much for the family. They were threatened with leaving home because they said that no one was working at home. I know that JJ, Flo, Thelma and even Michael are engaged in business, but they can be true here. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > Let's be funny, but to show a real family and live in a real world, and have thrown a few laughs. Michael's character was almost lost, and the rest fell to the shadow of JJ Evan's show. Almost there was a guy who was unsuccessful at school, he dismissed and pulled out two sums. <br /> <br /> How do I understand why he took it to understand that he had taken him for a long time? ? It could have worked for people who sold paintings on the street or printed billboards and cards. (He just went wrong with it.) Why did not he do it, and why others denied their dreams? Why I say why they were not a father in life and they were refreshed and their mothers stopped to support their dreams. The show grew, stopped teaching us about building and learning, and began to teach about gimmicks and caught the phrases. They kept Jacob. If any father needed it, he was the one.
