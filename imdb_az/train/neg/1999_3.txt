At the end of this episode he asks Holmes Watson not to write a posterity.For one reason for the job. Moreover, he left his little gray cells (Agatha, who was apologizing) at home for the story. There are no deductive reasoning, no sharp analysis of traces of crime scenes. Holmes bumbling along the fifty spaces behind the pitch. The groundbreaking CAM is eventually solved by an old fragile one. Charles Bronson's heart would be fierce, with six bullets on baking. The follower of a traitor followed Watson's shoes. Decide to decide on Cinderella's story to extend the film. Homicide, Holmes and Watson make the runaway score free. Oh, good night Viktorian London.A change of tempo is a little bit of a bit of six law :-)
