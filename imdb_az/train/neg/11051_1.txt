Canadian actors in the D-list have an attractive film that feels conscious because they are on the camera. <br /> <br /> This film is badly written, badly drawn and filthy. Different, incomprehensible and strange - but not in a good way. McDowell does a great deal of what he does, but this is just one thing in the movie - a really bad story and an article for you to work. <br /> <br /> When he comes together with his wife and relatives, he should not do any of the things. Blue blue bolts and Pelleski's orange "magic" (for a better word for lack of it!) </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> ), of course, is the result of bad actors and has been completely covered by special derivative effects without any choreography. Was not there a director for this disaster movie (good sort) or in the regulatory room? <br /> <br /> Learn from others' mistakes ... do not waste your time, and you'll regret it. I have nothing more to do with this celluloid benefit.
