We should not see how Nikhil Advani managed to drive people to the theater until the day he was released. I would like to say ... look here, the presentation is perfect, good songs and trailers are good. It turns into a full house on the first day, but when people see just the movie and realize that their money is not returned. On the first day of the house, the film is being carried out next week. <br /> <br /> This movie, inspired by "Love In fact", says that not all wells were well managed. They tried to put big stars, but did not control even the average performance of anybody. Stories are empty and surprising, so the audience can not join any of them. A great disappointment after a great success for those who love the big stars or 'Kal Ho Na Ho' for Nick Hol Advani.
