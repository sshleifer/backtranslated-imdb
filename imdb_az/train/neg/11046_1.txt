This is probably one of the worst films ever. Bad fun, bad personal effects, bad field, bad things. In the last 15 minutes, a cat is fitted with a cyborg, it mixes everything. Malcom MacDowell may need to make a home payment, but he was forced to sell Bill on Hollywood Blvd. I just do not know how Clockwork Orange can come to this shit and you can see yourself in the mirror every morning. I can make better effects in my wax. There is no durability. They were bad for drugs. In fact, did they not smoke to get worse? Weapons or blue flames or bullets hit you, correct your mind. The film tells you that the evil girl and the other girl are very confused. In 2013, it is called "Seadly Wake". It has nothing to do with this movie
