I'm totally deceived to see that the average rating of this movie is 5.2 / 10. That's what affects me, it's definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I'm still not interested in watching the end. First of all, the plot is completely hopeless and it's really horrible to act. I think any absolutely unknown actress would be better than Susan Lucci's role; I think it would be a good choice for Mr. Kamar to stay in the "Puppet Valley" with Delin Reyes. To summarize, this is all the time spent (and I'm trying to stay polite ...) to avoid any cost. My rating is 1 and I still think it's a good pay, but we can not give it one.
