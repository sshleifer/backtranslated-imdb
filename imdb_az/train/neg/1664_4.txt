This movie is fun enough to show that Virginia Madse and Lindsey Haun are beautiful. However, the reason for the film's unpredictability is that we have seen it in advance. I have not read the book of Mother's Gift, but I hope that Britney and Lynne Spears are completely different from this movie. Unless you really want to end a movie with a genuine idea of ​​a musical video, the whole movie thinks that words are plagiarized.
