This movie is not in the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and the version of 1954 is better than I think, because it is shame. I do not deny Barbra Streisand's talent. He's a good actress and a brilliant singer. I'm not familiar with Kris Christofferson's other case, and I will not judge. However, this movie creates a lot to be desired. But I'm not a great fan of rock music, so I would like, of course, that Judy Garland's version is better. Watch the 1976 movie along with Barbra and Kris and become a referee for yourself.
