*** CLAIMS *** Get started with this movie "good" - Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton's acting player. The rest of the players are terrifying (this is not a strange post). The worst sinner, the head of the Asian crime syndicate (played by Franz Tumbuan), was Burtao. After losing some money, I was laughing as I said it was strange; strange performance. Patrick Muldoon is no better, and he was surrendered badly as something about his "an enemy takeover" line (the rest of this movie's headline). There is no other main hero, but another actress / actress does not distinguish himself in this movie. We come to the next field. All you need to know is: Cynthia Rothrock, who plays Chris Fairchild in the original Rage and Honor, was a teacher in the inner city. Now it's C.I.A. agent (or another government office - sorry, but I do not remember that this movie was so bad). Hmmm ... We can imagine that C.I.A. similar to the application period. INTERVIEW: What is the experience? Kris: I'm a teacher. Interview: Okay; you are hired! I can only give a "2", but it is an extremely worthy act and a good excuse (although Tommy (Muldoon), the secret lied).
