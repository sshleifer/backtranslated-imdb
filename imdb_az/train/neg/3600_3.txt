All in all, there is a question for girls: If you accidentally have never met a person before you make a call, and if you continue to do so in the most hateful moments, you are closely interested in it or the police? Yes, I thought Marty Gerrard had a great deal of attention to Connor Hill and could not grasp his thoughts. ***** MILD SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This is really a dumb story. Connor Hill's wife was murdered and something around the query turned out to be Connor's Marti because of phone calls? But here's a big gap in logic, Connor did not get into a collision man? The prosecutor's office is not deceived. Was there no instructor at the crime scene? So how does the whole judgment cause Connor's call to Marty's phone while she's being killed? Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. <br /> <br /> This movie is a merry-go-round skier for Marti Gerrard for one of those who made winter Olympics.
