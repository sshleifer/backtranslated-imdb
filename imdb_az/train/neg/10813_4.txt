The first half of this version was the best I've ever seen (and I think I've seen every version of Jane Eyre). Gene's childhood and character development were exceptional. Then, as someone said, "Uh oh, this is working very long," and began to shatter the rest of the story. The main scenes are built, edited, and edited to completely alter the story line when it is included in everything. There were very few transitions or scene development, because it would be difficult for anyone not even to watch the story. Great disappointment was due to the very beginning of the hope, and then it came to an end.
