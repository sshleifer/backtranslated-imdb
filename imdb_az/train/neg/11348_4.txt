Six GIs will be sent home and vacated, drunk, and enter a religious convention in Asia. Two men with hooded figures act like a dancer. Behind an altar, a weave basket is opened and a picture is taken and begins to mimic a snake and finally burns one of the dancers on his neck. The presentation snake is decorated with a massive body bag. (This is definitely a female imitation announcement). In a secret session, religious members warned that six people were repeatedly forbidden ceremonies, and vice versa, no photographs or fishing were reported down and killed. Naturally, the GIs take flash photographs, send their religious members into a furious hysteria, release the "snake" basket and run it to the Asian Night. <br /> <br /> One of the children <br /> <br /> Perhaps in New York, though everything seems to be just an old news story, men go into their own lives, protecting their relationship with each other. Their job differs from a bowling alley manager (David Janssen) to finish a research student (Richard Long). James Dobson, Jack Kelly and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood. Richard Long is a beautiful blonde girlfriend. Kelly is a flawless woman woman. <br /> <br /> Then, a dark, swollen, mysterious woman (Faith Domergue) emerges and Marshall Thompson loves her and hurt her. <br /> <br /> Guess what happened. First, Janssen is horrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash. Then he visits Kelly Domergue. Something frightens him, he jumps off the window and dies when he sits on the sidewalk. Long and Dobson begin to doubt that the viewer already knows - Domergue has something to do with death. They also think that he turns into a cobra, so. Dobson is facing his suspicions, and he proves his point. <br /> <br /> Long and Thompson, at the same time, discovered that he was interested in Domergue, Thompson, and had to explain to her what the "love" was. It does not matter. The girlfriend of a long girl - the last attack of Cobra woman, one of six original criminals - and Thompson should snatch the snake from the window. On the pavement below, the body changes to Domergue. The last one. <br /> <br /> I think I will skip the majority of the questions that are being asked. I will mention one of the more fairy tale in the past. Who has paid the Domergue tariff from Asia to New York? Who pays utility services at the hotel? Who has paid the magnificent wardrobe? How well does the American speak English? What is hell? The writer and the director clearly saw some of Val Lewton's humble horror films, and although he did not make much of this product, some gymnastics from Lewton staggered. For example, Lewton's "The Cat People" transforms a woman into a black pail, but with a slight exception, the threat is always kept in the shade, and even more heartwarming. Most of the changes here are using shadows, but unlike Lewton, the shadows are unshakable and uncertain. <br /> <br /> Lewton also used the "bus." Lewton's first "bus" was literal. Potential victims are rushing with only the footsteps of the dark tunnels of Central Park. Something or someone is following him. Freezes with fear under a street light. Something beats her bushes on it. He looks up. There is a loud, noisy noise that ends your hair. A bus that uses the air brakes for it. Manufacturers used at least two "buses" in this movie and they had nothing. A boy travels away, for example, at an intersection, and almost instantly flips the truck. No shooting. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: In fact, no snake is slim but most are harmless and <br /> <br /> If you are a six-year-old racerunner, this is really fast luggage. <br /> <br /> Anyway, If you want to see some nice, little budget scary movies, do not worry about it. Find one of the other little masterpieces of The Cat People or Lewton's other little masterpieces.
