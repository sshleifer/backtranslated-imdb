It's the worst I've ever seen. There is nothing good about this movie. The land is foolish, the dialogues do not make any sense, humorous scenes have not heard anything about the true humor. Players do not just play, worse, and even do not try. The scenario itself is a bit in the same league as Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. This flick, there is only one good thing in battles. They are choreographed as they expect from one of the Hong Kong children and are the only reason to follow the Prince of the Sun. I believe that the battles should fill empty spaces so that the screenwriter does not have to worry about the story line. But this weak and absurd area can prevent you from watching the end. Dragon Ms. Cynthia Rothrock is an admirer of her.
