When I was released in 1970, I enjoyed a man named Horse, but he played a typical sequel. Everything about it - budget, script, plot, casting and player - was less than the original. Gale Sondergaard, like an elder in the Yellow elite tribe, has nothing to do with a Hindu and half of the other Indians who play cheap wigs by Italians, Mexicans and Latinos. The old man playing the presidency was a fierce leader of the warriors and acted as a greasy old knife. She even used the summer as a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who is actually doing such a wonderful job, looks like this time around. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> To be fair, there is an interesting moment in the movie, a Horse-like purification ritual, "find your own vision" and force Yellow Hounds against the Indian enemies and white oppressors, but on the contrary, like most sequels, , dull, dark and predictable.
