I first saw this movie at MST3K. Although I laughed at the jokes in my jokes, I do not think that this movie is all bad. Of course, it was hard to figure out that the budget was quite low, but there was a plot like Hitchcock, and I can honestly say that when I look at a non-MST3K version, I really enjoyed it. This movie cries for a Hollywood remake.
