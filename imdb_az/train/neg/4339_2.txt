this movie is not entirely expected. <br /> <br /> This film would not see the difference between the two, unless otherwise said. <br /> <br /> I could not see her really strange. prequel and subsequently do not just give meaning, and even do not fit. maybe I'm convinced, but volume 1 and vol 2 to hear. <br /> <br /> Carlito was in the 1st Prison and dies in the original and lives in the prequel and does not go to jail. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> I really like someone else I was waiting for the end to end. <br /> <br /> <strong>
