The problem with family drama, in the lifetime of television channels, is that most people do not want to watch them. Followers think about the current or current issues or issues in the news (or the latest news). Movies that describe or discover the human condition are not popular. <br /> <br /> My special problems with this movie are cartoonism of this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Miss Lohan" has some characteristics. It was a little bit of blame for what all of Lohan's character (car, drug use, etc.) was doing for his father. Although incredible, there are a lot more to win the audience. In addition, the young Morman guy, oral sex, or he could accidentally be a mother, and so on. Like all other aspects that show good veteran help, all these elements really help this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are watching the DVD and listening to it, you can see the "dramatic episodes", especially for the various alternatives, to see all of this sharp focus.
