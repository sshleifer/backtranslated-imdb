One night I became a caretaker family with three small children and their mothers gave me this to show that they had just held in Wal-Mart over the weekend. All three children were actually physically ill. I've eaten that pizza or something they have taken from school, but it really was a movie. Completely disgusting. How can any garbage can calibrate it out of me? I'm happy that we closed the movie when we saw that children did not respond and they were strangely active. I strongly advise any parent, teenage children, to avoid watching this movie.
