11-year-old Luke Benward (Billy's "Worm Boy" Forrester) alert moves to a new city. At the new school, young Benward is selected by other boys. They put worms on their thermos. When Gag reflexes control, Benward draws a wolf over his bare face, Adam Hicks (like Joe Guire). Benver bets can eat up to 10 worms a day - without recourse! <br /> <br /> Tall, cunning Hallie Kate Eisenberg (like Erika "Erk" Tansy) uses archery skills to help Benward. Director and former SCTV writer Bob Dolman said, "No worm has ever been damaged in the creation of this film." In a related note, SCTV star Andrea Martin has a comic scene. "How do you eat fried worms?" The ship is based on the famous novel of Thomas Rockwell. <br /> How do you eat small worms?
