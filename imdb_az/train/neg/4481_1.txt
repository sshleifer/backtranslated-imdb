When I first saw Calvin Kline-esque ads, I suspected that I would give it a chance. I was watching it and I almost say bleh. This movie was very bad. It is rare that I hate this movie. Looking back at this whisper, writers recalled these comic scenes from Altman's "The Player" when they made strange comments to the producers. It would be a good idea if MTV's producer decided that Bronte be adapted to an hour and a half music video (but this time Heathcliff's name was Heath and he was a rock star and Hendrix's name). /> <br /> It could not even be so bad that every other aspect of the film did not bring such terrible mistakes. In this direction you must be "pout for me, you alone". I laughed louder during all "serious" scenes and squeezed in the rest. The camera work was mixed and I have repeatedly mentioned that I wanted to shoot a bad movie. My theory is that the sound of a trembling voice and his boom and some beers went to the beach - I heard half of the scenes. And on other scenes I wish I had everything I heard. <br /> <br /> Bronte's "More" song can not be completely denied when it comes to voice, but what they do for Bronte again. <br /> <br /> There was an entertaining scene on the shining side - especially Johnny Whitworth, a lying memory of Katherine Heigl's face - and you can tell her how much power she gave you with the rest of the story.
