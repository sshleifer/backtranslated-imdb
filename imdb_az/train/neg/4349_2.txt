This movie is terrible. Carlitos Way (1993) is a great movie. Goodgfellas is not one of the better cinema films. This movie should be considered closer to the STING Part2 or perhaps the fastest zone. Remember these gems! The only reason for this film was to use the original of the original. Everything in this movie worked hard like De Palma, Pacino and Penn. There is no disadvantage, and it is the sin of all who are responsible for doing so. I believe that RISE TO POWER will win every RAZZI and maybe invent some new categories to record. After watching this S @ * T FEST, I sat down and followed the original Carlitos path to get a bad taste from my mouth. After watching this, he came to Pachan and saved me from anger.
