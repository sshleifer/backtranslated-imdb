Who is the researcher for this movie? It was built in 2004 in Baghdad, but all soldiers wear ACUs and have all the Camouflage Pattern gear. <BR> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> did not make any sense, the characters came and did not go with any commentary and made fun of things that would never happen in the real life of the people. I understand it's a movie, but we're trying to do something obvious. Unfortunately, it fails, but it works. <br /> <br /> Someone came up with a group of random ideas, chewed them up and swallowed them, and then frustrated a movie. I do not recommend this movie to everyone. I am still not sure why everything is settled. GI Joe was really the one who was thinking about you. STAY AWAY FROM!
