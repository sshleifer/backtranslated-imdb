Why would Mary and Rhoda's history have to be so smashed? Divorced women with indifferent girls. And why the original show and the very few references to the characters? The girl heroes were ridiculous and uninteresting. Why can not mothers love their daughter for television? Mary is forced to leave Minneapolis and Rhoda is forced to return to NYC, but why should Phyllis and Sue Ann Nievens be guests? It's just a pitiful way to remember such beautiful characters. Mary and Roda were certainly good at one place, but it would be better. Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, has been a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hopefully Mary will do it the next time if her old Mary Richards re-stomping yards again.
