"Die Sieger" has been recommended to be one of the few best films ever made in Germany. I watched last night and am immediately disappointed. <br /> <br /> "Die Sieger" is trying to be sexy, brave and angry, but it is very important. this is not something like that. Heroes are wooden and stereotypes and when something unexpected happens (there is not much) to act against their nature. <br /> <br /> Some movies are very bad, and I think it's very difficult for me. There is no character that does not believe me. Perhaps the superior officer in the SWAT unit - but just about that. People who want to look or act as special units like elite cops - do not believe them. <br /> <br /> The story is not bad at all. But I think that's a bad thing. You do not know the bad guy - for example. Karl Simon (good man) asked him why his "dead" opponent after a "very dark" demonstration. <br /> <br /> I asked myself if Dominic would have no answer. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, though it's a movie in Germany, it can do better.
