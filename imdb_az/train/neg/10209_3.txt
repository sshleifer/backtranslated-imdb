Glad to Sandra Bullock's Miss Congeniality's performance, I decided to give a shot to Murder By Numbers. Ms. Bullock may well be desirous of having a bold, specific role in his "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 Days). His character is incomplete, mixed, and sexually irrelevant (Sandra's former part comes as a filler that does not need much to develop its weakness). The two teenage boys gave delightful speeches, although their judicial expertise and retention-me-if the attitude "We did it!" Shouting was denied by mistakes. <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers Ahead *** All the very clear suspects Chris Penn is spending here, because the car can operate beyond the biggest flaws. and, as mentioned above, there are mistakes (two boys standing in front of the school building, causing the vomit of rare foods in the killing area, very convenient and back to the frame), a comfortable love affair for friction, and so on. ) appear to be bored and disappointing by the killers by capturing the image. The last "figures" was resolutely and probably most disappointing part of the film. At the beginning of the film, to come to the conclusion, using the film, which nearly showed the climactic scene and filled the audience with those moments, the last scenes that do not surprise anybody and do not have any of the so-called intelligence. A somewhat promising concept is poor and weak. * exit ****.
