* Possible Spoilers * 'The Return of Lake to Lake' is a film that does not work. <br /> <br /> "The lake's lake" is a good television movie. There was no result. Judd Nelson was very good at the first movie, and it brought much more like it. Even then it was not interesting to continue it. Her player was good, but it would be good. I really do not want to comment on the details of the others, because in my opinion they are not worth mentioning. But I will do it. Alison's character is not even hardly shown in the first part of the film. Stanley Caldwell is in the spotlight next to him as soon as possible. The role was not logical and should have been thought a little better. Dahlia Salem was completely terrible. Her player was in a decent position, and cast-iron men were looking for someone else. Director, Mike, was a mixed character. He had a purpose to be there, but his death did not seem to be necessary. <br /> <br /> It was good to act for the role better than Salem, but something better. <br /> <br /> If you think about it, the plot was really exciting. Stanley, who is considered dead, comes out onto the 'lake cabin', a script based film. The director is abducted and soon the director dies, and Stanley works on the show. Yes, from now on, the staff will finish drawing a picture of this stranger and not knowing anything about the film. There are some murders, not a lot of things, but the ones shown are ridiculous. One of the actresses on the set of films was electrocuted. Another characteristic is chewed by a motorcycle. Before drowning, it crashes onto a plant. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised by the shooting of this movie. The way to change from the low budget to normal looks started very rapidly. Also, the new cabin of the lake is poorly built. We do not show it on several occasions, but everything in the basement was useless. <br /> <br /> In the first film, we worked only after being shown more than one room but was not busy with it. <br /> <br /> There were so many characters on this continuation. Except for many, there is no reason to be there all. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it did not seem to be appropriate in this movie. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, 'return to the lake's cabin' is then selected from the first left. I can say 'The cabin of the lake' but it's not just impressive. Judd Nelson did not do it and you have to do it. This is not the first thing and it's gone very slowly. Nothing happened during the first hours and continued to drag on to the second. The writing was terrible. <br /> <br /> Thus, we see that Stanley is opposed to his death and is still alive and well. By the way, it sounds like it could be a third installment possible for just one movie. <br /> <br /> Did not the filmmakers show us how the lake scene was for the first time they worked in a tank, never tell the secrets of the shooting?) <br /> <br />
