Nell Shipman paid a large sum for Maxwell's off-road capabilities. The film area is quite simple, Nell is a writer with a blurred writer's block and needs inspiration, as he is going to swallow the atmosphere to visit Mexico. There is not a father but a cowboy hero who chooses to drive a car (Bert Van Tuyle). While Nell met his father in the mining camp, local gangs kidnapped him and led him to a deep camp in the desert. The hero must get it quickly, so he decides to drive in his car. The film is a strange twist here. Bert, for a large part of the film, which struggles to prevent this car, has every imagination of the earth, big rocks, small streams, heavy brush, lush trees, pearls, etc. Think now, it's a modern ATV, but it's Maxwell's car in 1920, so it looks like an off-road vehicle. And there are certain limitations for a particular terrain, and we see it stuck in the movie more than once. But filmmakers have been trying to overcome these possibilities and eventually overcome all obstacles. Once the hero entered the secret camp and rescued his daughter, he jumped into the car and threw it in the hot pursuit (horse) with bandits and it was hysterically funny for me. When this car slowly rolls over large cliffs, it is time to get enough acceleration to cut down the falling trees, thrown into the gravel and mountain brush, and the bandits should have enough time to grow up. However, they will never do so despite the fact that this desert continues to follow the night. <br /> <br /> After seeing this movie, you are thinking of investing in the army. After seeing this film, Maxwell's cars in 1920 were better off than the Hummers and Bradley tanks. Watch this movie just for laughs, just let Nellin entertain you in the grille and "Make the best, daring little car"
