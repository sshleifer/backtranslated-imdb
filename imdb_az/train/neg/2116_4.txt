Drawing me from the pictures of the poverty line in the 1930s and 40s. God knows that there is nothing against budgetary films, but there is such a terrible, terrible thing about the ones that were produced at that time - in the final analysis, it is not very good. It is less entertaining but less classic than iron-iron sediments such as "The Corpse Vanishes", "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man". Bella Lugosi, a long time ago at the Dracula summit, plays another physician; Uncompromising Elizabeth Russell plays with his wife. Luke, a suspicious young woman, tells the journalist, Luana Walters, that they are lying in coffins because a coffin is more comfortable than a bed. Ho hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal can benefit from the 30th and 40th films.
