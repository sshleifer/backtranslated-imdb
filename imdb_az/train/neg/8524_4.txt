This is the Frank Zappa axiom, "people who can not talk to people who can not read music journalism." If you need proof that musicians can not speak, it's a movie for you. "Regular attempts to sadden themselves over themselves to end a random interpretation with anger sounds "Thank you, Idris Mohammed." This film is ambitious, but Youssou N'Dour and a bunch of naked men (and a woman) shake the daytime music. <br /> <br> The main idea is to collect a group of musicians from America and Europe and to return to the roots of Western music and to the old slave with various music styles of slavery and growing overseas Concert at the village of Gorée in Senegal We are mild, blues, jazz and their variations, including some fantastic strikes in New Orleans and Senegal. <br /> <br /> N'Dour has a good job with his compositions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is also a weakness. What N'Dour wants to achieve is not entirely clear. To some extent, the film looks like a workout to promote itself in the part of N'Dour. He is playing his music, punishes him, and talks to many musicians who admire him. She is somewhat ashamed of it and at the beginning of the film she gets the blessing of curator of the Gorée Museum. <br /> <br /> The conflict between different agendas shows in many other places. For example, someone felt that it was not possible to explain the story of black music without the singing of a gospel, but most of N'Dour and his comrades were Muslims (a duplicate point throughout the film). All of the early sequences that cover black Christians are anxious, and then a close harmony group (the only black Christians able to hold one ton) run away from the story, which will be opened at the end of the movie in Dakar. (They win and they do their best in the film to be fair). The story of black music If you need to direct the Gospel, why not even in the direction of Latin America? Where are the black musical influences from the Caribbean and Brazil? Samba? Reggae? Then there is Europe. Because N'Dour chooses to design a trumpet player from Austria and guitarist from Luxembourg, the black diaspora does not produce a caliber musician. N'Dour is in the team for playing with him earlier? Although I personally found the most uncomfortable, Amir Baraka was a long time in New York (legendary Leroy Jones) who tried to rebuild some kind of beaten / black power / Islamic culture in the 60s of the Islamic culture at home. Hearing people are talking about "knowing your history" and then the need to continue ignorance in the next breath. Why do many Arab-American names give them an African roots? And why do they consider Arab Islam to be more striking than European Christianity? Who do you think is primarily the trade of African slaves? The film does not have much to do to explain the situation in West Africa today, but the "most current" conditions are the brightest and best-known results for 300 years. Senegalese looks like a poor but happy, musical talented people, is friendly and kind, respects the elder (and does not prefer to transfer the Americans who visit the fish market). Is ethnic stereotyping or my imagination? N'Dour and the camera crew on the armed forces have no comment on the need for the opening sequence on the streets of Dakar. <br /> <br /> The film has a strong effect. The slaves from Dakar came from Dakar. The similarity between the drum style of the New Orleans and the drum style of the Senegal people is proven. The last thing they heard before the slaves were pushed was to say good-bye to their homeland. Of course, the slaves from Dakar did not come from Dakar. They were sold or sold internally by the Sahin Senegalese and now sold to merchants sold to the European Forces, Gorée slavery. The people of Dakar are not the descendants of Africans who have escaped from slave trade, but are they also likely? With high probability ?? <br /> <br /> Being the descendants of black brothers and sisters, slaves and slaves. <br /> <br /> Two confrontations that have come up again in the last part of the film. There are two separate endings. On the one hand, the concert, N'Dour and Co, prepares and prepares the way out of the tower tower. On the other hand, the Harmony Harmoneers comes at the entrance of the gale bay, saying "Return to Glory." <br /> <br /> This, as you can see, is a deeply moving move, although it is hard to believe that performance is quite spontaneous. <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. It tries to explain and hit the story in different directions. With irritating, mixed, beautiful & emotional turns. Wait for her to listen to music and feeling, but I do not expect enlightenment or intellectual ease.
