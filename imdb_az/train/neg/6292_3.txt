I'm surprised to see how much the film was actually filmed in 1984 by Tom Hanks, the film "Bachelor Party". Is this movie such an official post? This movie is full in every department, and you should refuse to watch it. <br /> <br /> For a comedy, this movie is not good enough or quite funny. Of course, there are very few stories and film lamps in the film, more than the floor pages. Finally, do not wait to get started. There is one basic scheme in place, but it feels like someone is very scared, and that this is so badly executed in the film, that it does not feel much. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this movie has a message and a moral story, but still so unoriginal and ill-considered in the movie. <br /> <br /> This is basically a typical teenage comedy without much jokes and nudity, without the young mother characters who make the story more sad and tastier. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;">
