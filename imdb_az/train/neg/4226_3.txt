Wow ... I do not believe how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH! T 3). I heard rumors and read, but I was forced to give myself an idea. Yes, let me know - IT LEFT YOU! Even though no movie is the worst of all, one thing is not dubbed, everyone is completely frustrated, a strange and laughable, incomprehensible plot at the FX, and my grandmother's "kinematography" Three boys are stranded on an island full of strange plastic and tin swords. Two of the captives are released along with a strange rebels, and the rest of the tribe is given a day before hunting ... it's pretty much ... <br /> <br /> Honestly, is one of the worst films ever. The budget was about $ 200, and it was spent entirely on the FX (which could not have been a bad idea). ZOMBIE DOOM is nothing more than just a hare-filled scene scenes, like HORRIBLY dubbed dialogues. This movie makes other off-budget trips, such as PREMUTOS: THE AGE DEAD'S REVIVATION looks like TITANIC. Some may come across the ZD in the "bad-dog-good" category - I really think you're drunk or high, and that you're watching a few friends in the MST3K-style - that's why they can be viewed in this way. But not with me. I hated pretty much in this regard. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (equally terrible and ZD's as a "bonus" in the release of Shock-O-Rama freedom) is an indication of Andreas Schnass's other works, then no one should be banned. In the second half of the film there are many fun kung-fu battles and many bloodshed - so I'll give lots more. 3/10 - Give yourself a favor and throw it away.
