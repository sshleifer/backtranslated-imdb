"Balderdas!" It is true that the movie has little island name and, in fact, underwater troops. Japanese warriors laugh, Japanese laughs pilots and loses one-dimensional square Americans die right and left, poorer camera work, dirty stock cartoons, and perhaps even lower Japs' stereotype, with more training quality. Six years later, it is an opportunity to see what is happening to you as a laughable and warlike joke as a single piece of art. The field and dialogue reminded me of playing my gun in the afternoon in my childhood, and my best friend, Steve and my younger brother, entered the neighbor's tent to win the deadly superiority. In fact, the Makler Island raid was a bit short of when Carlson and his men walked around the shadows around the dark shooting fires, until they were thirsty and totally dissatisfied and surrendered to the same exaggerated Japanese before surrendering to the soldiers who were immediately delivered to them! Many Carlson Seas came out on another island and were abandoned! The film, of course, could not explain this story, not in 1943, so this sad part was prepared and the drums were beaten. Randolph Scott and his co-creator, Colonel Thorwald (Carlson), nearly entirely cartoon cartoons, green employers (Harry Landon, Robert Mitchum), angry veteran (J. Carroll Naish, Milburn Stone, Sam Levene), Cameron), the entire American boy (Alan Curtis) and the Japs (when they were not laughing). Whereas casting exceeds approximately the substance. Approximately. Randolph Scott's narrow range is backed up by a brave team of commanders and is supported by a rigid team of devotees doing fine things. But eventually, a recording object of the exercise is winning. Randy Scott is completely abandoned by any claim that simply calls directly to the camera and gives a blender (good sorta mix) weapons call. Casting was better than this material. The audience was as follows. Reifer Madness and an average Merlot bottle should be reviewed.
