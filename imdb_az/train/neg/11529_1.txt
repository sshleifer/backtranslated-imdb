Well, unfortunately, I met the DVD and saw that it was terrible. <br /> <br /> First of all, the characters did not suck. So if you have a dork inside the orange hat called Orange Sherbert, these guys are the best creative idea that will be the same, then the film is not on the stage. Splatter Rampage Wrestling 's "wrestling" is nothing more than this. <br /> <br /> "Wrestling", "bad" interviews "and, in general, a" wrestler "on this disk is a hit with an attacker and a simple trampoline. <br /> <br /> In general, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a pretty elegant Backyard Wrestling Clone.We only get a man called trampoline, giggly kids, TERRIBLE audio, and Orange Sherbert, just blood, weapons, confusion, and WRESTLING. <br /> <br /> Prevent this or not if you are a wrestler Terrible.
