May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) pay a rare visit to his son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. After the journey begins, Toots has a fatal infarction, yeast, invalid and questioning his life and future. <br /> <br /> His daughter, his wife Darren (Daniel Craig), his actions, leads to inevitable results. <br /> <br /> A beautiful film shot, but for all his story realism and admiration, Mom is very unpleasant, attractive characters and watchmaker ask them to deal with them. Reid shines as May, and this is a skill and commitment as a wonderful simple actress who rescues the movie completely, but Michell and Kureishi Craig have allowed Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such a completely immoral character, despite the May events. As it is written, characters Mackintosh and Bradshaw are actually totally selfish and cold, and start to wonder what Kureishii wants to say. As presented, they do not want to either raise Bobby or Paula two-dimensional in their egoism. <br /> <br /> Reid's performance, but less. A crying shame ...
