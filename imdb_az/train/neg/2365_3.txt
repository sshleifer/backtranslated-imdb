This movie is just bad. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Now I'm out of the way, and I feel better. This film is poor from start to finish. The story is naked. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is in the worst case of cartoon character. Thankfully, they killed him. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> We see a family once and we will see his disgusting spirits father, Alice Cooper. <br /> <br /> Besides, it's all bad. Here are some of the coolest actors (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto) and do their best, but the result is extremely bad. It's half an hour since I watch this movie, and I can not go back in time and half.
