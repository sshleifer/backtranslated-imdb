I leased it on the DVD and felt bad about Dawson and Lugacy, since it's pretty bad since the comments on the DVD. It's not just a bad movie, but one of those films that wants to make a deep insight into the nature of the story when it is unable to understand the story's practical genre. Moreover, it is a bit simpler in many ways, and the behavior of the characters often causes a belief. If you do not abandon many movies / television / literature / life (if you are honest, I have seen the same story in the comic book). Otherwise, its point was made in advance and more harshly. And this is a big issue that really does not have kinematic interests apart from this point. This is a fairly soft movie that the whole story has to do with the idea that the main story will be shocking and modest, and it really does not pay.
