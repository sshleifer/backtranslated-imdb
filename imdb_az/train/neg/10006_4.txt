I do not know who is guilty, no-one writers or unusual directors. One of the films here (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna, and Jon) seemed to be one of the most featured films. It could have been fun, but there were cowards and even cowardly blinds hanging on every scene. Angie Harmon is not a 70-year-old woman, but she has a bubble bath scene every time she gets a R rating? Why It Wakens Through The Potential Hot Relationships With Two Most Beautiful and SEXY ACTIONS IN THE WORLD? If they are just looking for laughter, why not go to Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta? I was surprised to find that this was probably not five years old. Not only for viewers, but also for the actors.
