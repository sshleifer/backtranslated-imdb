Unfortunately, the first Busby Berkeley I've ever seen was 42nd Street. Then I was expecting everything to be good. <br /> <br /> The last musical numbers are as spectacular as ever, but as always, they are as spectacular as ever. The story is as busy as others and is exhausting. They always shout and shout about unhappy show manufacturers. <br /> <br /> In this film, Cagney often shouts things that screams, she gives me some headache after a while, and the character is thinner .... faster! <br /> <br /> Even songs can be heard here in the "42nd Street" class, for years and years - for ten years. The songs in this movie are not memorable. No, this is one of several early Cagney films and Berkeley movies - I did not like it and was very disappointed when watching.
