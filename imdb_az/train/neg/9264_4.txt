This flawless sequel, created by David Selzer and Harvey Bernhard (also producer), is concerned about a marriage called Gene (Michael Woods) and Karen York (Faye Grant). They accept a little girl called Delia from a monastery. Again, York will be re-elected for the congressman and lead the financial commission. Meanwhile, Delia appears around when uncertain deaths occur. As it is destroyed by numerology, therapy, consultation, yoga, tarot, as well as metaphysics, it creates all kinds of danger. <br /> <br /> This television has a special look at Karen York (Michael Lerner) to explain excitement, tremor, creepy events and heroic killings. Like Damien, Delia appears to be committing a horrific murder in a few-minute movie, horrific crimes are taking place. The main excitement is watching how new and innocent victims can do with moderate special effects. In addition, middle-aged heroes, Faye Grant and Michael Vuds, Michael Lerner, Madison Mason, Duncan Fraser and recently-born Don S Davis have become middle-class players. As always, the excellent musical score was taken by Omer I and III, by Jerry Goldsmith. The film is intended for Omen Saga, only hardcore followers. The movie is directed by Jorge Montes and Dominique Othenin Girard. Previous and better versions are as follows: A 'Omen' by Richard Donner (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick); By Don Taylor "Damien" (William Holden, Lee Grant); "Last Conflict" by Grahame Baker (Sam Neil and Tisa Harrow). Rating: Medium below.
