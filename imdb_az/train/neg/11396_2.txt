Cheap erotic horror master Rolfe Kanefsky is finally making a movie that does not go to the Playboy channel. "The Hazing" borrows from Nightmare on Elm Street over Evil Dead, but still tries to do it with enough humor to watch it ... simply. The characters are cardboard, the dialogue is wooden, the story is paper and the actors can not get out of the grocery bag. Put all these in one place and you have a ball of hammer for a movie. Sometimes, I want to eat paper when I'm bored. There are so many things to look at in this movie. You have 90 minutes to chew and have a strange taste in your mouth and no nutritional value.
