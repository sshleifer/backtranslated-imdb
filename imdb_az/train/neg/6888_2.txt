This film is poorly thought out, poorly functioned and poorly written. <br /> <br /> John Heder is quite annoying and can not escape from the same Napoleon Dynamite regularity. <br /> <br /> In addition, Diane Keaton is the same childhood, extreme caregiver, very fond of children, and still not enough about their children's life (look at me). <br /> <br /> Anna Faris, although often with her in this movie, plays vapid foolishly in this movie. <br /> <br /> Jeff Daniels can switch, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> Please, skip this movie when you want to save your soul.
