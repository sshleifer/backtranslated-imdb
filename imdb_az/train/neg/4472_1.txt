'A Smile to You' is an exciting comedy that does not really mean anything. I do not want to say that the story is complicated, but the whole plot is based on something: attempts to think of a couple desperate and expensive children are unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> Forget about not accepting this movie. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly plays Jennifer Robertson, who is totally contrary to what she has to offer for her freedom of movement. almost no sense of independence. She is quite dull, as she is a dreamy housewife, who has nothing in her mind, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> Like the romantic comedy of the Hot 50, Greg Kinnear also presents her personality, her independence and her husband who has no interest in us. <br /> <br /> They are two of the most boring and often annoying faces, and they make it difficult for a couple to do their best to get pregnant with a comedy that needs to come up with a lot of mishaps that need to emerge. Moreover, they really do nothing but go to a fertility clinic and allocate a lot of money that they can do in their personal lives (with the exception of this in vitro fertilization). The soil does not allow any mishapsa, because it is good that couples do nothing to create any strange situation. They just go to this clinic. So what is it? <br /> <br /> These subpods are intended to check the fidelity of couples because the couple are planning to connect each other. Jennifer is a friend (playing by Joan Cusak) in a new era store and they work on the development of aphrodisiacs. Christopher MacDonald plays intrested buyer and is a promising negotiator for Jennifer and his friend product at a pretty price. <br /> <br /> Danny (Kinear) is an architect, and he also has the opportunity to earn a lot of extra money. his director, Danny (just like her), took a job in Seattle, where she was once a brown seductress (another desperate, desperate woman character) who was trying to influence something so easily, and with clinical payments she and her spouse (for reasons I did not want to give ). Jill Hennesy is good in this role, but his character is much more predictable and multifaceted than Danny's very handy element to create a conflict. Stupid and something more difficult. In general, the film itself is totally boring and not difficult (save the flight scene and the flight of the airline). The land is really something that attracts attention. Although the story was totally in the mirror of two people, writers could have grasped some hilarious misconceptions to develop beyond that. Second, the main characters are absolutely boring. Together with their happy spouse and grandmother, they silently silenced the 1950s silence comedies. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there is nothing too complicated. <br /> <br /> For this reason, Cusack would even be astonished with an exciting story (sometimes as part of his role as a joint actor). It is definitely necessary to pass.
