I am a great Adam Sandler fan and one day watching Cast & Crew on one of the DVDs and seeing "I'm going to ship" and decided to go out and rent. I went out with a few friends and rented them. We left him and I'm shocked to see Adam Sanders, who are still underage, when it looks like it's 12 years old. I could not watch the 30 minutes of this movie, I did not laugh, giggle or even smirk in this movie, but in fact, when I see how strange this movie was, I only hurt me. I did not believe how hard it was to try to make the audience laugh in this movie ... I did not work at once. Although I did not hear the terrible cameras and the disgusting scripts, I realized why I did not hear this movie ... Because you are more than sure because it's a thing of the past. This movie, in my opinion, was no WORST movie ever with .... WITH!
