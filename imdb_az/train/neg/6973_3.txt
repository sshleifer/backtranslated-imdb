When I found an old VHS copy, I never knew this movie until it was deeply hidden in my dusty horror cabinet. The inscription on the box "Insect" and the illustrations on the back of the screen seemed to be another 80th and horrific film of horror. Undoubtedly, you can enjoy as long as you do not expect an intelligent scenario and, of course, not to be irritated by the many cheese makeup effects. Of all the important things that make up a decent appearance of a horrible film, "Blue Monkey" is very important here! The area is ridiculous and very unoriginal, expecting performance to be painful and lack of overall stability. After watching the popular trend of "The Great Mistake", Blue Monkey manages a new and unknown insect species to clear the doctors and patients in a remote hospital. Do not become more aware of the true origin of this gigantic corpse of artists! We know that it was originally removed from a tropical plant, not from space. Moreover, there is no explanation where suddenly the new species of insects suddenly appears! As I said, do not get your hopes for a smart scenario. The first half of the film is quite entertaining, with several beautiful looks and several defective characters (80 years old blind and alcoholic lady!), But the second half (all hospitals are quarantined). terrible drilling. "Blue monkey" begins to exaggerate larger (and better) films. As they approach the climate, they may have left the budget because lighting is very weak and the man in the wolf suit is no longer camouflaged in a very good way. "Blue Monkey" is worth a visit if you are really bored or want to see more than 80 horror movies that really are prepared. B-Cinema fans can recognize John Vernon (Killer Clowns, Outside Space, Curtains) and Roger, the clinic's small and meaningless way.
