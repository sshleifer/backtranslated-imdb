Founder, Eytan Fox, drew a few interesting films like "Yossi & Jagger" in the past when he begged the Israeli policy. But this irrational and unfair approach to Bubble is too extreme. <br /> <br /> When I was away from the movie, the silent men got up quietly. I also quietly left the fuming of an anger that translated such a ridiculous unilateral film into racist violence and racist violence (and terrorism) as justified anger; This implies that the Arabs were so cruel to the evil of Israel and that they reacted with anger towards the continuous flow of one-sided Israeli aggression, and therefore were not responsible for their actions. <br /> <br /> This movie was not worth the money for the ticket (I really wanted to repay my money) and was mainly the ape of the Palestinian film of Israel's "Paradise Now" film. Being an anti-Israeli, watching this movie in every way, really justify such a belief system. The film is a pain that Israeli director and even worse, such a talented Israeli director will do. <br /> <br /> The Israelis may be surprised to find that Israel has been called the Israel of pariah if they believe in Israel's propaganda and beggars. <br /> <br /> What a shameful, disgusting movie!
