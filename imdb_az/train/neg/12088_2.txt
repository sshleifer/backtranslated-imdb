I read the reviews of this movie and it was generally pretty good, so I would think. I am a great French philologist and art critics, but I believe that critics are another thing to do something "arty" or "intellectual". I'll be blunt: I've never actually seen sex scenes of immorality. Undoubtedly, the piano teacher has basic psychological issues, but I really did not want to show the graph. The film is, in fact, disgusting. I want to say that when I saw Requiem for a Dream, I was praised by Jennifer Connelly at the last scene, but it was not in the hate and accusation I felt in the movie.
