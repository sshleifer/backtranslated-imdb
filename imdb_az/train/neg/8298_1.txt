This movie is not very entertaining, of course, anywhere is as good as the original or a Christmas story. Heroes (except the smallest) are trying to imitate the previous actors and fail. Hillbilly's neighbors are no exception, since they are part of the first film. The story is weak, because it can be really sucked, can be good with the original cast, then it can be again. Jump.
