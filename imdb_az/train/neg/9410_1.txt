How long can you suffer? Wake up, stand up, dress, shower, cook, watch each other, watch sex in the dark, then sleep ... if you like, elegant apartments, narrow bedrooms and kitchens, a minute long silence ... If you like to be bored during hours, you'll love the excitement of "genuine sincere art". But if you do, try to see a good movie, there are thousands. "When you're here," but we want to stay? This German film was awarded the Turin gay film festival: Italian journalists still do not understand that the jury has made such a bad decision because the festival has featured very talented films. Perhaps you can be happy with a German because they can not get the prize often? Well, it's "the lives of others" ... but it's not good, gay. Perhaps this is a question of fashion. Are the Germans still "in"? It does not matter? Or maybe just look at some heads of a hustler?
