Okay, what was hell now? Is a family fantasy movie to earn money on the great success of Spielberg's "Thousands of intense encounters"? Or the shooting of the glorious days of prehistoric epics like "Dinosaurs Earth Rules" and "The Lost World"? Perhaps an incomprehensible intellectual and philosophical work? Yes, that should be! Whatever the creators of "Day Time Ended" (Former 'John Bud' Cardos' and writer David Schmoeller's "Tourist Trap") ideas for this demented hodgepodge of genres, which they smelled quite a gloomy when they wrote. The story does not make sense, and the narrative structure is not as hell as it is, but who cares for papier-car dinosaurs, miniature craft artists, headache-illuminating light, and laser show and supernovae self-consciousness! The application on the sound is practically not readable, but there is nothing worrying, because it is heartfelt! Do you know what the definition of "time" is? Time will not necessarily be chronological, this is a huge paradox! The words spoken thousands of years ago are still around, and the events that will take place in the future are already covering us. I had absolutely no idea what all this meant, but it seems that tap-dancer midget gives an easy excuse to gather foreigners and good dinosaurs on the screen. I'm deliberately delivering a sensitive dinosaur because at some point prehistoric monsters beat the door before scaring one of their targets. The terrible place is a strange family living in a sunny home nowhere. Dad is extremely frustrating, more grandchildren, grandmother is a walking and speech advertising billboard for plastic surgery, the youngest child looks like a strange princess Valiant and what is a young mother? incredibly hot! Chris Mitchum, for some reason, is also rarely traveling around shooting crews as a mother of a hot mother at a business trip. The special effects are completely cheesy and completely laughable (I heartily hope that others who talk about "excellent special effects" were sarcastic), but the most terrifying aspect here is the dialogue! <br /> <br /> The sea: "You know what that is, is not it?" This is a time-space warp! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> what do you know or not? Stop talking about "Vortex", and you're talking about some sort of expert! "The Daylight Saving Time" is not an incredible childhood and worthless, but a fantasy film, but some fans were able to grasp the film, but they were surprised at what they were seeing at the young age and with bright effects. The latter suddenly pulled out of money, or suddenly wasted the mushrooms on the Meal, despite the exhaustion of money.
