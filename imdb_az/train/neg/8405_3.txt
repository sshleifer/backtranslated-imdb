Before I saw this film, I was waiting for the so-called drama based on the ideas from the book; On the contrary, this is a book that cuts dramatically, reflecting various "illnesses." It did not bother me, but it prevented me from enjoying my movie. A story taken from a film integrated into the film and even two or three long stories would be superior to my opinion. If you're thinking of being in a movie in a psychological text, you need to find more interesting (and advantageous) text. In the 19th century, the film diminishes sexual psychology from the video encyclopedia, and in the absence of sexuality in the nature, it drags in parts that are not completely satisfying ("sex = interesting" for most of us, even for me). Fortunately, there are a few stories that have an actual character that drives us. <br /> <br /> But with disappointment, Krafft-Ebing's sexuality theories did not lose her. <br /> <br /> It is almost up to now to use stories to show how archaic view of psychology kept by most people is flawed. <br /> So what's the point? A detailed catalog of several chapters and trends with some moody exciting stories showing the tests and challenges of several "deviant deviations" without treatment. For most filmmakers, the film is moving at the sliding speed of the shooting speed (and mood). And obviously less budgetary movies, cinematography and entertainment are not exactly the top level. I enjoyed the music, costume and interior design. <br /> <br /> I felt that I felt the theme of this movie right, and still think that the mid-film is low. Deserves 3/10; I feel pretty generous at a 4/10. If I'm not interested in sexual fetishism, I will not be able to enjoy it.
