There are fans of this precious production. <br /> <br /> Moby Dick is not just a picture to comment on the classic mistake of Maryam Reilly. <br /> <br /> Because philosophical foundations for a "production" of a film will never make a big movie, but that there is no strong leadership idea that has hopelessly weak, non-dynamic, but dazzling images to encourage viewers to think they are wondering in order to transfer films to the film). <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the presenter and critics fall into it, the Oscars nourish all the junk equations. <br /> <br /> I do not share these reviewers with pleasure. Moby Dick is not surprisingly resolved. The actors are quietly singing about Yunus, Moby Dick, the ocean, Moby Dick, Moby Dick ... everything that can not answer, and none follows a small thing. It is dramatically ineffective. You can not build it. In terms of understanding, Moby Dick (like a movie) is less than the previous one in the search for an actual story. Half an hour later, "Oh terrible ... another strange ... another 4-minute soliloquy!" We screamed. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty full-fledged showcase when you are unsuccessful in trying to attract you. There are plenty of hair here. Starbuck needed to be a golden god. (!) <br /> <br /> Because someone tries to make a classic miracle, not just to repeat another's painting and palette feeling, as Huston is here. Drawings and books are wonderful, but they are a different tool. Such a film does not just mean that it is better to have a bad part of it (the village of Lanat) than a very unpleasant piece of culture. <br /> <br /> This is a highly appreciated job, but not artistic. Only few segments are interested in marine research; registration of beaches as a means of working and various maritime efforts; and whaling technology. And it does not take a two-hour film.
