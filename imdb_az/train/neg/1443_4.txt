Start a good way: Swayze talks a few times about the Zulu friends or the language tribe. <br /> <br /> The US and UK filmmakers all speak English on this planet (unless you are one of them: they are not). As we said in the Netherlands, 'tenenkrommend' (which makes your feet croaking and not in a good way). I love Swayz, but it is also very scary. The muscles in their jaws are already working and put all the film on the stools - some say that it looks butcher. No Patrick: It looks silly and compensates for the lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) chose a player style that does not fit the style of his employees. It's convenient for this movie to be set in the current days. And that's not it. <br /> <br /> The best player in the African continent and the Sided Onyulo people came to Umbopa, which I loved best. Clean, warm and characteristic, it is delightful to follow his performance. <br /> <br /> General: mwah-fun on a rainy day. Open. It would be better. Remove the film.
