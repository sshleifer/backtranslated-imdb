Yes, let's start by saying that this film is absolutely HILARIOUS, I just did not laugh at the stupidity of my own. <br /> <br /> In some cases, I think Bessinger's work is good, but the scenario is simply good. <br /> <br /> The goal is to witness a delinquent crime. Only then goes down. The half-way hero of the film removes the instrument box and, of course, instead of lobbing at the boy, he decides to shoot a screwdriver, a car jack and finally a shot (like a sailboat) to kill the victim. <br /> <br /> Therefore, there is a last line I promised, if I was not in your sewing, I would eat my left foot. <br /> <br /> For those who want to laugh at making this movie just some good old fashioned, terrifying movie. I can look at the yard, which comes from scratch, with a man on a wooden bench, and every time he gets me.
