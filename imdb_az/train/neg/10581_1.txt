This story did not have an original idea. Themes from different sources were drawn; Several Ninth Circumstances, The Spell In The Heart (Another Carpenter Film) and The Ring. He used the same cursed shimmering circle on the ring as the film's integrity. Cody Carpenter's soundtrack was removed only from Suspiria. Hopefully nobody can interfere with the word HOMAGE. Yes, the theater was played Argento Deep Red. Getting a compliment would have been a lifetime. It was down-of-the-barrel. Tackling and "bothering" images is not a good movie. The carpenter knew. He needs to get out of the darkness or take a time machine.
