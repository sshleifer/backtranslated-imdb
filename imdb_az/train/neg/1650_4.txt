Four good friends meet for repetition of sexual intercourse sex conversations in this misanthropic and visceral comedy on a weekly NYC square with chauvinist pigs (with an emphasis on pigs). Peet is the common denominator of three bachelors who led the conflict and inevitably "whipping" the group. The premiere of the film has a potential and although there are a few funny moments, it usually does not work to make it flicker, especially for girls, who do not seem to be better off than the most important point in the story. One person "Flyx", "Whipped" can only be used by young men who think that "The Man Show" is the "Emmy" outfit.
