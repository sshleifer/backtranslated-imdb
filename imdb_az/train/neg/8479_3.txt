Okay, when I came to the booth for this movie, I really was expecting people to enjoy it. I was surprised to see people enjoying the age of 7. <br /> <br /> I was very pleased with my movie ... but only my b / c my little brother (in fact only 10) had fun with everything. <br /> Terrible. You know, a movie that the film does not move is directed to the toilet. And there was no good script or trick to replace it. I also thought that Pamela's character was very naked ... the border covers were miserable. <br /> <br /> Even so, there were so many good players, as I thought, Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. <br /> <br /> There are two things in this movie: <br /> <br /> Spencer said that the boy would fall for him. . Okay, eww. I looked at the dates and in fact, it was only four years older than the difference in "Go Figure". Jordan is a very beautiful girl, but looks like 10 or 12 in the GF ... she seemed like a little boy! Jake Abel (Spencer) seemed to be a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) There is no way that Kristi Yamaguchi is about to slip for a girl. That is, I know Kateli is good and does everything, but it still seems likely that Christie can go to a boarding school for a skating or a coach train with such a relationship to a school <br /> <br /> All this it was said ... it was not the worst movie ever known, but it was not very good at DCOM standards, and I think it's too low.
