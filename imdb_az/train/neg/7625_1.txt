This is just a spoiler warning. <br /> <br /> For me, cinema is a deserved place for the Oscars. <br /> <br /> I divide the material into three levels. The first is the stage theater. Here the audience is stagnant and power is based on the actor's presentation and most importantly, the power of the writer. A good playwright is better than a good scriptwriter, because he knows the best ways to talk. <br /> <br /> The best writers know how to create scenes that can not show the scene. <br /> <br /> The second level film. In this environment, a weak writer can be used, but the audience does not sit at all. Together with the movie, the context can capture visual poetry and sense of quality besides strong writing. In addition, the film can manipulate the agenda items, such as sound and color, which are literally irreal. <br /> <br /> The last level of literature. In this context, everything is described by the writer, translated to the paper, and then re-imagined by the reader. <br /> <br /> Therefore, adaptations are not something that they can go but never go down. The novelties are better than the main movie (see each of the film's local bookstore), and the movie can not pass the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR). <br /> <br /> Movies can rarely play and the game can always be included in the movie. <br /> <br /> The 'Last Picture View' is not included. The director is a movie that needs to be filmed on the stage because it's too stupid to shoot anything. The heroes speak the same and behave the same, this is a clean space. <br /> <br /> I've seen it with about 20 other wannabe heroes in the high school drama class. The trainer expressed how sad the film was. It is a sad thing to feel regret when such a stubborn matter is cheerful at the material. If it was colorless, impotence scenes, the pool party, and the old prostitute would be considered a great comedy. <br /> <br /> See what Lucas did with American Graffiti a few years later. <br /> <br /> The American Secondary Education System should begin teaching more than ANY movie than trying to teach movies. Powerful two visionable films: Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon. Trust them, it is not. I would like to see this as 'The Last'. 5 out of 1.
