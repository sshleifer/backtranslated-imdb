This movie was strange ... I looked at a quarter of a psilcybe cubensis (mushroom). It was very strange. You doubt that you need to watch it, but the fungus is not enough. I could not stop laughing ... maybe lsd would work. The film is something that morphs on other things and dances. For today's standards it really was a cheese, but it was good when it was free. Some people thought about how good this movie was, but I did not think it was very interesting, and then I was in fungi. If you burn a party or anything and everything, you'll get a few laughs.
