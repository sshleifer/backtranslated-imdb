Yes?!?? Why people say "blowing your mind?" It is one of the worst results in face-to-face cinematography history! 4 left and the whole world is over! It was a man who said 9 that everyone was killed for a while. 1, 9 would not be all right. The people there are stupid and why they live ... To make a rain? I admitted that there were pieces of the film, and the whole concept was interesting. But many were clich√©s. And does anyone feel this feeling as "The Lord of the Rings"? The characters died for foolish reasons, almost no character development, and honestly ask yourself, there are only four children in the world. its meaningless and stupid. It was one of the shortest films I've ever seen and thank God! How robots turn into creativity in any way against people! It's been a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, go to see a movie worth watching as Star Trek, The Hangover or Inglorious Basterds, this was a good movie!
