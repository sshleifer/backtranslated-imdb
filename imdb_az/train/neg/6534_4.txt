This fantastic adventure is not the best and worst way. I declare a bad fantasy disaster. Strange pink colors and unusual special effects make for late, late, late showers. Planet Mars explorers, like the strange giant amoeba, fight monsters and other bizarre creatures. Very cool. <br /> <br /> The cast includes Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Comfortable and enjoyable. If you break a moment's node, do not feel bad. I agree with adding to the list of classic kult to avoid it.
