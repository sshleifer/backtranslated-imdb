The Inspector Gadget was probably my 80th animated cartoon. Both the first and second episodes of the series, as well as the Milad's special "Inspector Gadget Escape the Christmas of 1992". Some Gadget fans criticize the second season of the show (1985), but DiC should compare the 2002 version of "Inspector Gadget's Last Penalty: Claw's Revenge", which will definitely consider the second season as a golden <br /> < br /> As I'm a fan of the gadget, I did not allow the animated inspector Gadget to see something that is not related to Gadget Boy. I bought the movie and promised myself that I would be objective; Sometimes I knew that from the original series of artistic freedoms. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> This <br /> <br /> shortcomings for the movie: * This humor is exempt from the original series. <br /> <br /> Penny and Brain (originally nearly equal to a series like the Gadget) are fifteen. (Shaban now owns a production company, but at least "Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas", there was good music without Saban). * Gadget-like gadget, gadget-mallet, gadget-coat (really used, not even the same thing), as well as other standard hat and hand tools. In this film, his gadget feet were telescopic instead of springs. <br /> <br /> Such things worry the true fans of the show, and just do not have to change them. <br /> <br /> The gadgetmobile from the original series is now talking quickly, as if it were "hip". All fans of the original series enjoy gadgetmobile from the gadget van and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The head Quimby is now very jealous and even intended for the Gadget. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Great Wambini (classic "Gadget" canvassed by Louis Nye from the second season of the second season), if you are looking for many missing factors.How to survive and make choices.In most cases, life has the same purpose of teaching a lesson The lesson you learned here is the protection of the original formula! If True Gadget fans are hidden from this movie, I hope that after the series DiC and Shout! Factory 2006, the first 22 episodes of the series "Inspector Gadget: Original Series, Volume 1 "series, as the lover of 80's animation and the lover of many DiC programs, including" Inspirational Gadget: The Original Series, Volume 1 "and" Inspector Gadget Christmas Saves "DVDs perfect and sure to bring it back. good memories.
