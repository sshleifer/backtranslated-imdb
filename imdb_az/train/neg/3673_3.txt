William Hurt scuba diving scientist ??? US agents doing research abroad? The patient hurts his arm after fleeing 20 feet behind the contaminated person? Sniper is missing and not injured (just wound him), but the second "killing" kick is dead? Time loss. To compare this to other reviewers because they are ridiculous. Oh and at the end of the film they decided to wear gloves in their hands, except for the "bad" agent, and Hurt decided to kill him by giving him a "virus grab". Yes? BTW ... IMDb required 10 lines of text? I'm just here. If a line of X is required, does it not merely contain the content?
