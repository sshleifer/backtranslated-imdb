10 to 1. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you did not believe you spent only 2 hours while you were watching. Honestly, I think I can make a better vampire movie ... and I do not know anything. Not only is something (rather than a vampire more difficult), it's just Jason Scott Lee .... his character has at least a little cool, a mystery and starts a little butt.
