GAME MY GOD .. DOES NOT GOOD THE BEST - it's the main idea I've been thinking after watching this movie. I really do not understand anyone who is mentally ill. Although the idea was good, but it was affected. Especially the role of H. Graham. What was it ??? In my opinion, it destroyed all the positive intentions of the producers. The character has been played in an affected and annoying manner. He remembers a movie every time he sees it and destroys the soul of the moment, and then the whole movie, because most of the times you see, with his foolish tragedies, have a more wrong attempt to create feelings. MANY, do not waste your time.
