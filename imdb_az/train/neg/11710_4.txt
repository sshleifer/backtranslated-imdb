There is only one reason for watching this movie if actress Nichole Hiltz does not belong to any of the stars or producers. It's a show in this slow-moving and heroically unexpected revenge story. Simon Gornick decides to take revenge on his betrayed spouse as director of a director, Joyce Hyser's betrayal. Oh, but not by conventional means. He plans a general guerilla war and launches the evil girl Nichole Hiltz as a weapon he has chosen. Nichole (Tuesday) wants to get closer to her past (self-styled, but dull Stephan Jenkins, to remain in music), to embarrass and destroy her life. David DeLuise is good at a few short moments and nothing is said of Anthony Dennison, the old "Crime Story" star, but the spoon. On the other hand, Hiltz is sexually and entertaining at different times, and then is bad and shocking. It is also sensitive and "maybe a little psychotic". She is also pretty hot (although there are no nasty bit impressions), she can understand how she can get any boy from the target. But the performance has been spent in this type of movie, which is not ordinary or interesting enough to recommend.
