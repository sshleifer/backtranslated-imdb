This film is weak, the box cover is the most difficult part of East LA, and actually Santa Ana, James Cahill is a challenging chloe queen of all tough guys in Chlo's challenging network. It's fraudulent, boring, meaningless, and disobedient, and it's getting worse than the movie's movie to pull back my money. It was also a homo-erotic type far from the video-box announcement. James Cahill should perform at Gay Porn .James can not move on every scene to escape his life. There is Eva Longoria in the movie, but James can not do it! !!!!!!!!! When I watched the gay porn, I felt the whole movie. James apparently wants to be with men, and then he's pushing gay members back and forth. Martial arts skills are good, some real network members would take her and her weak skills and fall into a new affair.
