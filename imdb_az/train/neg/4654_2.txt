Women's vampires kill their young women and their spots with blood. He has a helper who does not want to be a vampire, so he must fulfill his command or turn into a blood stream. <br /> <br /> What can we say about this movie? <br /> <br /> What can we say about this movie? Its pacing has some strange sound effects that are very slow (no bells sound so strange) and the ambiance does not seem to come into the bunch of gangs (here comes the new jazz). <br /> <br /> The spouse is like an auteur horror film that shows itself. <br /> <br /> The plot is totally stupid and, as you can guess, the woman is a vampire who explains how to kill her. We have to do this; Of course, cross, light, garlic and sticks do not work. <br /> <br /> Not even a comic bad movie. Maybe with some friends and a lot of beer, you can not have fun with it (honestly, it's funny about 10-15 minutes to the end of the movie). Do not be fooled by the Troma sticker, they are a filthy film presented.
