This can be the poorest example of amateur propaganda. Writers and producers should learn German films of the 30s. They knew what to sell. Even the headmaster of the Soviet-era figure, the father-figure, had done a better job. Dreamer. As time went by, the church lost its faith in the last seconds of being a "salvation" by the Porcupine / God. Unfortunately, it ran away and seemed not quite melodramatic. The flaming paradise of Hoover's angel in the corner of the screen - lightning and nodding - would add a lot. The best side is saving only the children who have "proved" the value of DEO, a decent family and DEO. Unfortunately, other poor homeless are unpleasant and even good - yet, Hoover-God does not help them. A better approach was to drink the souls to show the justice of their situation. Finally, the bright and entertaining scenes of the restoration (after Hoover's depression from the country) ended. Then we found out how Hoover-God saved this worthy family, but they were truly worthy. The best amateur.
