True, this movie has even worse movies. This movie was no Manos: Fate Hands, or Troll 2 (yes, I've also seen them twice), but at the same time this movie has no Alien, Predator or even Alien Vs. Predator (Yes, even this movie was over). Such films look like Battlefield Earth as a Star Wars, so bad. Razzie rewards, your biggest competition came to theaters. This movie I talked about is Darkness. <br /> <br /> What's the best component of this movie? (As before) What is the best component of this movie? The last loan to the game, "Want an Angel to Want," characterized by Christian Slater, has been proud of himself and has shown that he can successfully capture the antifreeze in a movie. He was surprised to see why he did not go out of his way to tell him, perhaps there was Stephen Dorff in the film (he might have wanted someone, but failed). Tara Reid is bad. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> - The soundtrack, an unhappy and poor heavy medal is pumped into the ears of the audience, perhaps to hide the horrible story (something I'll soon get). <br /> <br /> The Directing-directed by Hollywood's favorite director, Uwe Ball, brought us to the classic Dead House. Long and very expensive 2 CD-soundtracks were on sale. It tells us "Yes, movies can be so bad, and this is the beginning of the deadly episode of negative movies." It is said that at least Uwe Ball will be managed. It became clear that I was forced to make a monkey abducted from Congo and brought it here and how to do it under the shocking punishment. The director of photography was probably a videotaper taped on a skateboard and pushed until a wall hit. The camera is constantly moving on scenes that should not remain in place, does not allow us to stop everywhere, and the camera does not stop for any reason when it needs to move on. <br /> <br /> Producer - Who is on the floor? Is it enough stupid to put money against a bomb? I'm sorry for dishonesty ... sometimes. <br /> <br /> Writing / Storyboard - Trying to analyze the story is more painful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Eduard Carnby runs like a child of a 20-year-old child home, but children who go to science experiments. He runs away and hides in an electrically-charged battery (this is where I began to laugh very badly). Later, a few years later, the place was a paranoid detective. He was attacked by some zombie who were not killed, killed, and killed by his life. <br /> <br /> Military operations against the people living in the Caucasus continue. A casual text about an illegal culture called Absca, with more than 100 pieces of film creatures awaiting us for about 10 minutes. The film is not indestructible one after another, and then the audience can manage, then the audience wants to manage, and then the audience will not care about it. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> I gave it 1 out of 10, but it was not 0.
