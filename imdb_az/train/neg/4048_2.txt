It is impossible, but terrible. Even the fantastic cast can not save it. Okay, I admit that they are very funny, but disappeared at the moment when they jumped at the General House of Women. Because Bill Murray was not just funny, he refused to become a clever and humorous person quickly into a cartoon that began to shout from the magical people. His character snatches a weapon (one RV, Let's ...) and knows how many soldiers are laughing before they invade another country and become a national hero and kill God. A good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and inadequacy of the US Army, and shows how truly arrogant and immoral it is, though it is unintentional. I really regret that such propaganda would really be released.
