While watching the movie, I start writing this review at a glance. It's the first time I've tried to do it, but I fail without a break. <br /> <br /> This is particularly painful and exhausting and unbelievable when his brother Ryan (Colm Feore), who is preternantally robust, is tragic and strange, self-guilty and self-indicating. - cluster. <br /> <br /> He would have been a better movie if he left this story alone. <br /> <br /> Nothing but chess, maudlin, and very breathtaking melodrama. Maybe someone decided that Ryan would not denied it, even though he did not believe it. The problem with this is: Who damages the scarred, acne, jerky shaky? <br /> <br /> This character is something he's going to die for and it's upset, but that's not enough. Dying is not special to anyone. We all die, sooner or later. <br /> <br /> The other two characters and the actors playing them (like David Cubitt, Theo and Chandra West) are very glad. more exciting, and their story would have been a continuous, better movie, that Ryan would regret. But it's not finished yet and it's time to hit PLAY again. Maybe it will be a great deal until the end .... <br /> <br /> Nope. Sorry. This rented turkey is coming back this night!
