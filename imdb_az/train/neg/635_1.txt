Luiza Rainer received Oscars for Good Performance on Earth. Unfortunately, he does not have a role. He did not talk much and appeared pale throughout the film. Luiza's character was a slave given to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job for her performance). Both actors in Asia were not Asian, but their role was very convincing. Hopefully, Paul Muni has won an Oscar to show his performance because Luise won the Oscar for it. She should be an actress, first of all, transformed into a method. This seems to be something that Hollywood has done often. Al Pacino played Italian and Cuban. I felt that Luiza's performance was unshakable, and she did not testify in the previous scenes when she died. The film remained the same; just changed his expression or feelings twice. If his splendid movements were so subtle, I did not see him.
