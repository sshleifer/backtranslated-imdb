I believe that Shakespeare has told me to read it beautifully. A lot of objections to me (women). The author tried to convince himself that everything sounded like me! I can think of at least three references from the Bible that give me a historical clarification of the events, but I have repeatedly considered the source literature literature (at the same time, but non-Biblical). Everyone can clutter and prove something they want, but that's not true. Customs changes, word definitions change over time (see English and German, where there is a very clear root) nothing is alike, always grows and changes. The Bible has very different translations, but when it comes to any kind of King James version, I've seen that I'm the best. King James version contains some words written in italics. These words have been added by translators and may have averaged all alterations. The writings of Christ's epoch are written without punctuality, without spaces, without point and verse verses. These articles appear to be a long word, and translators have added the above. For example, how do you read them? Do you read God as it is in the place of God, or do you read it as God is here? The same string contains two completely different meanings. That's why many biblical researchers use "boards" to help translate. Because it gives a promise to translate from the original Arabic, Greek or Hebrew, depending on the language of the book. It is interesting to note that when we turn into symbolic logic, we can prove God, but you can not prove that He does not exist! Finally, I love listening to people who think I'm so powerful that they judge the power. Talk about Ego! Forgive God Maegi away from the soap box
