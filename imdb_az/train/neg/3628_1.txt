The dream of a maven, which is an art house. Overrated, overpraised, overdone; only an ambitious melange, which was not the best of the 1951 form, dwarfed from the beginning of the competition with its superiority. The place in the sun, the Detective Story, the tram title, Abbott and Costello recognize the invisible man; At 51, it's better than Crapola's kings. The final ballet is covered for the intellectual crowd from the ground and the wrong film. In his time, fewer actors were less skilled (on the move) or less characteristic than Kelly and Caron. Among my worst '51 'movie (I've seen 201 movies) and 5 worst Best Picture Oscar winners.
