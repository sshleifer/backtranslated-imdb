For me, this is a story when traveling with one step and starting with some funny jokes about Franks fanats when he is in business meetings ... You see the problem for an hour while watching this movie. The same fantasies / comic situations repeat and repeat. To predict. <br /> <br /> I love Felix Herngrenny as Frank, but though it's a comedy, it's not enough, there's more to do with changes and a kind of message that has a direct message .... <br /> <br />
