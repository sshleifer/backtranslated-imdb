His father's daughters, Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West, receive some foul news at the local post office that they are being kept by the thief Charles Inslee. Meanwhile, father David Miles receives a message from his father, Robert Harron, demanding that your father return home; So, when young women return, can they? alone at home. In the evening, as a protected bedroom, the local "Black and Tans Grand Ball" starts; and a dark-colored drinker, D.W. additional danger. Griffith's dynamic duo? Inslee owns one of the best Biograph roles he has stolen from The Girls and Daddy. Heroes appear to be one of the black-eyed add-ons on the Griffith's "Black and Tans" ball. "Biograph Girls" Lawrence and West "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially the "Orphans of the Storm" (1921); and they are very compassionate in the bedroom! The racist tone is unfortunate because it is interesting to recapture a thief story that rescues potential victims from a greater danger. <br /> <br /> Girls and fathers (2/1/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
