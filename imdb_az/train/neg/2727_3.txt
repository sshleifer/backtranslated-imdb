This stranger to the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION should not really be included because it is only about 30 minutes in the movie. It is also bright when it is on the screen. In the upcoming film, few movies are just an excuse to showcase a few Warner contract players. CANCIE RULE is a shame that does not become a great star. RUTH ROMAN manages the go-getter role with aplomb. It's good if it's colored. Travis Air Force Base works well with some rear projection. The best things about the movie are a few wonderful music deals. If you like to appreciate your LUCKY STARS and Hollywood CANTEEN, it will be like this.
