I owe this movie because it's not just a homosexual theme, but a role-playing idea really interested me. I was surprised to be shot in San Francisco since I lived near SF. Of course, it was nice to see Castro's shooting (although Castro really serves more gay men than women). But besides, I really can not offer this movie. When I started to play the role of the heroes, not to care for me and finally to play the role I was delighted. The role played by the scenes I was seeing was a bit embarrassed to watch. Imagine creating something. Undoubtedly, I have not finished the film. I would skip it.
