I only saw this movie and when did they spend it? The movie was expected and slow. Basically, there is bad news from Mormon playing basketball that sanctions the church. I should have my root channel instead of watching this movie. Came out speeches were clearly sponsored / funded. This film had potential because of the angry behavior of the Mormons when playing basketball with the church, but as the PG was evaluated, the true essence of the play could not be transferred to the film. The player is horrible, except for Clint Howard and Fred Willard. The appearance of Thurl Bailey in the film was absolutely unnecessary.
