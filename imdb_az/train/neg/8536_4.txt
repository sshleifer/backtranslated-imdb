This is a typical Steele novel, one of which is a kind of tragedy that two people can reach despite each other's resources. I say it as a spoiler because everyone knows how Steele reads the novel. <br /> <br /> Gilbertin's character, Ophelia, is a worthy woman of France who lost her husband and son. Gilbert, on the other hand, is a good actress and should not leave the films he or she requires to emphasize that any accent can not be captured. Brad Johnson, a great player, is a very bad divorce Matt. <br /> <br /> That's why he's gentle, convincing and compelling in this role. <br /> <br /> Two men meet on the beach through Pip, and at first Ophelia talked to Matt with her boyfriend. After this episode, all of them become friends, and then they are exposed to love. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two potentials is not very good, though the talents of these two nations are in my opinion. They did their best with a predictable plot and scenario that limited their stereotypes. Two people meet, tragedy, great tragedy, mystery, another tragedy, then comes together. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it is very important for me. As for the genre of romance movies, it's not memorable. "A Mysterious Affair" by Jane Turner (not from Steele's book) is very good because some of Steele's previous books have been turned into a movie.
