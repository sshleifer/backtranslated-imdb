This was the worst movie I ever saw in my life! It was ordinary, there was no area and the special effects were laughable! I have never seen such bad deeds in my life! The only good part of the movie was all hot kids (especially Drew Fuller). I do not know how these people are thinking about filming! I did not even want to finish all the things because you came to this point in the movie that the children touched them in the bed. That means some sort of sick and wrapped pussy was like porn! I would advise everyone who has heard this movie and are just interested in seeing another movie to forget and watch! I was very disappointed! The entire movie was full of time in my opinion.
