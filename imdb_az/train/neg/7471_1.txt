I've heard that Cama de Gato is the worst Brazilian movie ever in decades, though I watched it with a chance; first of all the director / producer / writer Alexander Stockler managed to earn only $ 4,000 for his debut feature - even though it seems cheaper - finally, to show off in theaters that are not big sponsors or production companies (and then I was watching). However, your chance to give "Cama de Gato" is reduced to zero within 10 minutes: an incredibly illiterate, accurate, ideological fanatic and technical disaster attempt to imagine the Brazilian upper-middle class youth as a spoiled group Neo-Nazis are worse sex, drug and violence (and they are also prepared to look like closed ghosts), no talent, imagination, experience or structure. Sights and minds remind you of the worst amateur elements you can find on YouTube - just the TWO (count'em) here is going on in uncertain hws and unhealthy moments, and it's not funny. <br /> <br /> We have seen all of us at the beginning of the story: compressed young children go for fun, go to party, make drugs and everything goes wrong - aggression, exaggeration, murder, casual death (stair down), mother of one of the boys, resulted in boys who decided to burn their corpses and their mother in the garbage dump. Emotional and typical debris, get it? The film has a great impact Larry Clark (especially "Kids" and "Bully"), but Clark films - both morally and sexploitative - have high-level masterworks compared to this crap. Do not think that such a monomaniac driver does not have to drop the director's ideas down the throat: Stockler captures us by the collar and tries to force his brain to his non-stop morale with exhaustion and exhaustion. confusion, shouting, integration, shaking camera and terrible movements. The inventor does not care less about the technique (the quality of images, framing, sound recording, sound poetry, dialogue, sets, editing etc.), but a narcissistic control is amazing: it predicts the criticisms connected I will comment on how negative and fraudulent it is to add subtitles with cutie descriptions and comment on the protagonists at a single point (I may be related to it). <br /> <br /> Despite his megalomaniac ambitions, Stokler could not give us a minimum visual or auxiliary structure - realistic realism (handheld camera, etc.) or duplication of styling scenes, use of alternatives, etc.). Damn it can not decide anywhere to put the camera (a 3D camera is used for the potential)! Dialogue has never been one of the most terrifying combinations; conspiracy simply exists to justify his profane hatred for the heroes of the director and their support. <br /> <br /> Caio Blatt is a very unpleasant thing to put it into trouble. <br /> <br /> Hate, hate, condemn, hinder any movie director you see. Of course, one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil, with an awkward dog shark, with the emotional approach often referred to by Sal Mineo, Blat is in the good direction ("Carandiru", "Lavoura Arcaica", "Proibido Proibir"). Here, you have to go upstairs and play with the "actor" that is most embarrassed in the last memory. <br /> <br /> In the film real talks with "typical" (?) middle class youth begin and end. - Stockholm wants these conversations to be a "proof" of what they are trying to promote. But she is surprised and entertained by choosing from her heart-to-heart, racist, sexually provocative, foolish expressions (showing just whispering everywhere). Stocktor wants to prove that middle-class Brazil is the FIRST or the future fascist in Brazil. They enjoy middle-class and recreational medications (do all neo-fascists say they are on drugs, or do drugs potentially fascist behaviors)? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> The Brazilian cinema detectives provide a strong claim. "Cama de Gato" is the best, unmissed, buried and forgotten.
