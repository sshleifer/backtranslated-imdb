I have never watched this movie. The style of the film may be considered as good for some, but it causes me migraine. I think it could have been an interesting plot, but after a while I could not see long sights, so I missed many of them. Branding my brain to shoot flickering pictures and action movies. I stopped crossing the middle road and I will not go back in the second attempt. I suppose that if I'm at home alone in a dark and stormy evening in my lantern, this may be just a ticket ... I'm not sure PS Flashlight / movie style can be considered a spoiler, but I do not want to be listed at first glance;)
