This movie was very bad, and I had to put forth most of it to reach the good points. What's the good The only bit of that was worth it (those who saw it will know what they mean). I was faced with Freddy and Jason, a hell of a deadly hell from this film, but what happened to me. The story was unforgettable, the tattoo was badly used, and what the director thought of it. It might have been great, but it turned out to be the most boring movie I ever watched. OK, if T and A have a nice guy, something similar happened and I'm somewhat disappointed. Do not wait for a good movie, but if you want a bad cats horror then you'll see it and watch out for a horror movie.
