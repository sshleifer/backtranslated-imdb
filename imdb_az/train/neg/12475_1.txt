I do not remember to go out of this movie at another movie theater once. Not just that, but I had 7 friends and we all wanted to go. An irresistible plot, characters from clay, no violence. Good kids did not care about me when I died; The bad guys did not take care of me when I bought it. This fantasy and magic liver puding was thickened and there was no discrepancy. In a word, it's a great fun for you to spend eternity in Hell.
