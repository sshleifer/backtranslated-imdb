I do not know ... maybe I'm Brazilian, but there are so many things to do. It's a lot of love for music, lots of parties, a beautiful life of the main characters (not very sad) and a very controversy between the majority of the city shown by the director. Everything seems to me very fake: families, relationships, music, "happiness". It just sells a bit of delusional Latinamerican culture. I have to be honest: a little deceived me, but who should not be deceived by the beautiful music, sex and party life? I'm not a fool: what is a world where people are not exposed to diarrhea, deep sorrow and STDs? I liked the scene with Caridad's main call and talk with all musicians and the Spanish people.
