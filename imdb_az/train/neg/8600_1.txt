All low budget history. this movie should be one of the worst. True, some humorous parties come to the film, but in general, it was just terrible. I do not know, he could not handle a few conscious heroes. That is, they must be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. The only part worth paying in this movie is close to an slugs trying to bite a man's finger. It was very entertaining.
