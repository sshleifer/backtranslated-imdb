For the love of Paris, Je T'aime, I admitted that I was looking forward to this movie and I was very pleased with it, but I was surprised by a number of reasons. <br /> <br /> I did not expect that in Paris, I was waiting for the same structure in Paris. The collapse of my favorite neighborhoods about Paris. Each director has a style and a sense of the story he wants to say. There is no clear difference in the 'NY' movie stories from different points, the faces of different stories fled each other and saw who was watching me and what exactly it was. <br /> <br /> Another favorite thing about the Paris movie was love. Not all romantic. Love between parents and their children, love of love, love, middle age, and so on. His love inspired many layers of love between people. The 'NY' came just for strange, very advantageous sexuality. There were some redeemable shorts (couples living together for a couple of lifetimes, Julie Christie short), but overall, the 'NEW' movie did not make any sense for me. I did not contact any characters as I did with "Paris". I watched "Paris" and had a deep sense of sadness, loneliness, longing, despair, miracle ... only a very soul. For me, there was no one in the 'NY' movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if I was not behind my brain in Paris, compared to this movie, it was a more favorable answer, but I was very surprised to hear a self-refreshing applause named Paris, Je T'aime.
