I saw this DVD at my friends' house and thought that Hollywood was a motion movie with many Turkish names. Interestingly, then I decided to give a shot. It was hard for me to practice, believe me. Finally, after seeing the credits, "We are really filming in the Hollywood style of the Turks." This rifle is an insult to the genre film. " But then wait! I did not have some names and they did not exist, they were not Turkish names and they were not Turkish films; on the contrary, it was shot in America with an American filmmaker and crew! It made me think again! - How can you sell names such as Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to participate in such a project? probably with money ... This would make me think more ... Can you make such a amount of money to offer international pressure on them and in one word? Then I paid all my thoughts and came to find answers. You start the cheap equipment and crew you can find. If you still have difficulty adjusting your budget: you can write and direct the movie you're trying to produce - or vice versa, I have no idea about it. So this sub-line is not a bad movie, it is very concerned about presenting it to everyone. It's even meditation in my opinion - and there are many films outthere that does not have such an impact .. This is at least a bit of a thought; It surprises you .. It can save you from disbelief .. Then it surprises you ..
