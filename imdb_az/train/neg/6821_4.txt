It was a good event, but it was not very good. I liked the themes and the main story line, which was not as straightforward as possible. Perhaps there was much to do and there was no ability to judge everything. Acting was pleasant to the cheese, some were stronger, and even stronger actors had less quality moments. It took me several months to shoot the entire movie because I did not care and the stream was just bad. I just finished watching it and I was glad that the film was finally moving and its endurance toward the end. Still, it was a good story, but the delivery was lower. I'd like to say a bit about the storyline and maybe a little candy for it.
