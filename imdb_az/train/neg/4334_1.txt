<br /> <br /> This film had the potential and I was prepared to give it a try, but there are so many problems that are so clear - it's hard to swallow it like a fool. <br /> <br /> Rising power is the end of the 1960s. Carlito's Way is appointed in mid-70s. <br /> <br /> For the film to be realistic, it must be settled in fifty years, as well as in the next forty years. <br /> <br /> Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), Kleinfeld, Carlotto, has no sign of Rolando, claiming to run away with "hey-day". None of the main characters in the original film were in this movie. <br /> <br /> Carlito believed that for a few years, all these people were brought together. <br /> <br /> Rising the power, talking about leaving the paradise with Carlito, in the original film. Also, the pre-quelts create Rocco and Earl characters - what should happen with Carlito's failure? It is also difficult to understand how Carlito's relationship with Italians is in the original film, which deals with Rise-i Power events. Taglialucci flies in this movie? There are probably two years between the two films, and five of them are imprisoned. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: and the story throw a character named Carlito Brigante. /> <br /> I think this movie is a good moment, but I think it would be better than going to a prequel on Carlito Road instead of releasing this movie. <br /> If you are looking at this movie, the only advisory film I can give is a line do not think of pre-quelle as Spinti's West, as Clint Eastwood's name does not think, in other words, two non-interrelated films.
