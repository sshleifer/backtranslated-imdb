This is the biggest burden I have ever seen. When I watched "28 days later" and "Magnolia," I hated a movie. There is no point in this movie, except for some really sick and wounded sex / rape scenes, Gillian Anderson relieves himself on the edge of the road and at least a few times in every sentence "F". It has a very cheap operating and very low budget. My wife and I quit the movie about half an hour later. We tried to give it a chance, but nothing could save it. WITH IT!
