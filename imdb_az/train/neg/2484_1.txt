I still do not believe that Wes Craven is responsible for this crap.This movie. This film is worse than "Deadly Friendly" .Styah stupid, actress is mediocre and film is deadly dull.What I Wes Craven, the first hate to call "The Last House from the Left" - this genre definitely masterpieces and likes it (probably) to get it wrong with turkey.Don't I want his many movies, but this is a real torture sitting and watching.
