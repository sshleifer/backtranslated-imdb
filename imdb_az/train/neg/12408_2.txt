You just sit in one of the most horrifying, dreadful horror films you see and you will not miss 82 minutes of your life, never come back. Just imagine. Since today you have to spend a little extra time with your family, one hour of shopping, and 22 minutes for your family. Unfortunately, it's been too late for me. Do the same mistakes: (2/10)
