Of course, I did not watch GI Jane. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> GI Jane, Certainly not. As a result, the story automatically constrains, the amount of humor can not be restricted (stagnant scenes of action) and soon becomes very serious. For this reason, the film is extremely boring and predictable. 'GI Jane' fails to succeed in other action movies, mostly movies like James Bond, Dirty Harry and others are bigger than life, can not be otherwise. They are escapism and therefore fun. <br /> <br /> <strong> GI Jane tries to be real and fails. <br /> <br /> Ridley Scott is a very unbelievable story, with non-branded acting, a film that gives a lot. For some technical work instead of 1/10.
