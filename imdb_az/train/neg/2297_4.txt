I once open the Club 700 times and only agree with some statements. Most of the Christians are Christians and are considered liberal by most Christians and are protected by the majority of non-Christians. I sound my mind and I do not reveal his name. or not - I do not believe that 700 clubs believe in people, but represent some very important Christian elders. I misunderstand what is said in most of the 700 clubs. hitting me to hear the name calling me in one direction. I think that 700 people really love Jesus, but they try to make people conscious of certain people and forgot to promote peace like Jesus. We should not judge Jesus according to ignorant people who believe in him, nor should we be ignorant of our interpretations. Why do people resemble one another?
