I'm an admirer of the series and read all 7 books. I just wanted to see how it was seen. All we can say is that only those who read this series have read the series and are interested in it. Its pretty bad and you will turn them off to read them. You do not have to understand, but Lucy is affected by this ugly movie. Did he become the directors' daughter? Seriously, I'm sure the monsters in the film will jeopardize his teeth. He had a mold which would make him feel embarrassed of any sadness. The film just loses much of its translation. CS books Tolke's LOTR books are not easily translated, even as Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> One thing they did right! Lion! He did very well. Although other human actors (beavers, wolves) with illustrated faces appear to be foolish, the Lion was really good, because not just one human actor in the environment. (Do I resemble her old horse? 2 people inside?) Also, I wonder what the children think of this movie. Maybe they can do it? But as for adults, though they have a CS fan, they do not rely on it.
