Undoubtedly, the worst movie I've ever seen ... Where can someone tell me where to make me laugh? An idea does not have a hint or shadow. Three leading players are illness, especially one from Sicily who wants to have a Sicilian accent (say Aldo)! Do not tell another story taken from the worst cabaret tradition to go for a little longer, like a dreams of Dracula. What Massironi and Littizzetto do, but this so-called film is really hard to get rid of. I would give it "0" / 10, but the lowest figure was 1/10 and therefore you have to overlap with a brand.
