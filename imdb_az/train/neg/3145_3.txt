I'm convinced that it does not matter how close, but Lost and Delirious are the rebuilding of this movie (or the story based on it). Very similar to the plotline and even some scenes and sets, very similar to it. Lost & Delirious is actually a better movie, so look at one another. <br /> <br /> This is a very slow movement, but not the latest 60th French movie, expected from style. We talked about a retrospective of one of the girls looking back at school. Creating flashbacks with current scenes is a little bit confusing, especially for each of the overlapping sounds (ie noisy noise while looking at the present and vice versa). Also, "girls" are a little old to think that they are in a boarding school. Finally, not even a lot of character development to join the film.
