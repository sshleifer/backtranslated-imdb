We have to go to the appointment, so we downloaded the DVR. When it was over, I looked at her husband and said, "Is there a hint?". She shook her head. I said, "You watched the last movie of this movie and I did not know what was happening." <br /> <br /> The movie itself was pretty good. There were many tensions. You've been wondering. Then it's over. The last one was ... well done. Why or why not. Something would have happened to explain the loans I thought, but it never happened. So, I came here to think that someone figured it out and I just did not pay attention. Nope. <strong> Caucasian <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> I'm getting it! The end of the movie disappeared! ROFL
