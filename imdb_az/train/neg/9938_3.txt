Jean Luc Godard's Marxist polemics are not close to a movie that you can see from an internationally respected film artist. <br /> <br /> The development of the song is a bit of political theater, along with Mick's shooting of the film "Happiness for the devil". Jagger is interested in recording an acoustic guitar while listening to the end of the supporting vocals, and is just hired to see this movie with Stones. Almost half of the film is due to the fact that, thanks to the miracle of the chapter, you can skip all strange political sketches and watch Stones sing together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally I gave it up, and I just dropped out of the Stones segment.
