There is something very popular here. Actors are first degree, and the script provides a good dialogue, with an intense touch, a good family atmosphere. But for this reason, the film will not come true. As you can see, Leo, who learns HIV positive, is largely responsible for the supportive atmosphere that he finds. Also, the film, Leo, his brother, and the rest of the immediate family had to deal with his love, and he suddenly runs away suddenly. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is generally effective as the rest of the castle. Unfortunately, screenwriters have not been able to decide on what they want on HIV / AIDS as a functional, attractive family affair, or what they want on HIV victim's victims - both of them. This film gives you nutritional support, though it wishes more of the audience.
