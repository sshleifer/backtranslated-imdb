1st Watch 2/2/2003 - Dir-Jim Kammerud and Brian Smith: The Drab and the original classic animation are unbelievably unlikely for '101 Dalmatians'. Yes, the movie goes on for the first time, but the problem is playing as the original. One of the greatest things about the original is the absence of this story. The animation is also very unusual for Disney, and everything we do is the same thing as the recurring story. Disney intends to stop drilling after us and what to do, and so on. And so on. Perhaps when we rented this mediocre price or refused to buy it.
