I've been a great admirer of David Lynch, and I've had everything in the DVD, except for the Hotel Room and the 2-hour Twin Peaks. So, when I learned about it, I immediately caught it and ... and what is it? It's a bunch of roughly drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and badly mouthed and unfunny. Maybe I do not know how good it is, but perhaps it shadowed the public under David Lynch for a few dollars. Even though I feel bad, I can be my neighbors because I have not continued to sound. All of this is a very heartwarming release and may have remained in a luxury suitcase built only for an interest. That's why you do not spend your money. 10 out of 2.
