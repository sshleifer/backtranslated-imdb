Hello, Everyone, if you see "Read Song in the Rain", you remember the scene of Gene Kelly, dancing in the rain. You also remember the dance number of Donald O'Connor: "Make them Laugh." If you see the "Royal Wedding", you will remember that Fred Astaire danced on the ceiling. <br /> <br /> If you see "Jailhouse Rock", you will remember the dance number, which was choreographed by the King himself. <br /> <br /> Here's something missing. In this presentation, some blockbusters could have dance numbers. The closest Chuck McGowan's "I can do it". It does not make a real, big dance movie with a few talented people on the stage. Richard Attenborough blamed for this failure. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "> Michael Douglas in the West or comedy, it would be so bad that when we were in the Michael Douglas movie, we shouted at one of the screams we wanted to shout, and it does not work here. <br /> <br /> Of course, Michael was no exception. <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
