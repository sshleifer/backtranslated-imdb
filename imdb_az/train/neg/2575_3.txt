It is not really up to the Cagliostro tower. Lupine is funny or unreasonable or hyperactive. Decoration and music are groundless and the plot is not just interesting. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this flour is the nudity provided by Fujiko (only unwanted version). It helped to decorate some tiring scenes. CoC set up a giant killer and set up a movie for some creative sets. Places at TSoTG are not very livelier or attractive. <br /> <br /> Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen also do not have fun at this time. Apparently, they just like the contractual obligation. DVD Dolby Stereo is full of sound. There are a few decent additions, including a few trailers. But something interesting. There is no chapter selection on the timekeeper shown on the disc or on a single player. You can still use the remote to scroll to the next scene number.
