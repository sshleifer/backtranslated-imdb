Some of the comparisons between this film and the "Last Detail", but the "Chasers" extend from Texas's west Texas interstate highway. On the beach, there is not much to distinguish it from the scene, and even a woman is a fact that the prisoner is transferring two naval vessels this time. Nobody is very good at casting; It's not surprising with the bare scripts. Dennis Hopper, the director, I do not think this place will not give much space if he does not write anything.
