Theoretically movies should be a fun type. Except for documentary films and other experimental forms in filming; most movies, special genre films, just tell stories or messages, and entertain a target audience. All this is just a movie that is a bad film, in my opinion, is a movie that does not have low production costs or low budget, but a bad movie, something boring. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" or "damn" as it is known in the United States is simply a bad film which is simply irrelevant and irremediably dull and tedious, although it has a very good structure, it did not, and did not improve things that were mediocre, but on the other hand, the film might have been a nice or even classic B movie, but here's just one mistake to shoot. <br /> <br /> Director Philip J. Jons James Bishop (Matt Stasi) is a young psychiatrist who has just been dreamed of at St Andrew's Ruhi Hospital, but he is hiding a mystery in the old shelter, after some of the mysterious deaths and persistent rumors of religious beliefs, James decides to learn what happened. <br /> < <br /> <br /> This premise is pretty much in m office, where his boss, Dr McCort (Bruce Payne), believes his bishop is going crazy like his patient. Although it is a spontaneous film, Jones makes an effort to create an extraordinary psychological tension, making it easy to make a film full of every cliché of the genre. Of course, there are many great films full of clichés; <br /> <br /> Everyone in Hellborn is spending the fear of making a cheap jump to mobilize everything, and is eventually a drill-and-predictable story. <br /> <br /> Acting is a great exception: Bruce Payne gives a top notch performance that ensures that the film does not look good on this kind of player. <br /> <br /> Despite all these flaws, you have to write something about Hellborn; there is a very good visual appearance for the budget, and the large budget in modern day is very similar to the Hollywod "horror" production. Both makeup and prosthesis are done in a very good way, and the basic antagonist's designs are very good. Unfortunately, the rest of the special effects are terrible and outdated, making a great contrast with makeup and prosthetic. <br /> <br /> "Hellborn" is a movie with some good things and terrible consequences with its serious shortcomings. Hardcore horror or b-movie fans may be interested in his interests, but this is a boring and tiring experience. 3/10
