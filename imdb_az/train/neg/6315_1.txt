This bright, sexy movie is something to see. Only after many attitudes we can truly grasp the uniqueness of this film. Personally I enjoy the story telling story, not touching any topic. The presentation immediately takes you to the edge of the chair along the film. He gives a glimpse into the world of gymnasts, and lets the viewers really 'get in touch' with the inner horror of this movie. The scenario itself is a good way to film. Not only for children but also for the elderly, they will also gain a better understanding of the instructional guidelines and modern perception that have a sexual experience. Undoubtedly, the word "shah" in the face of the cinematography era and foundation.
