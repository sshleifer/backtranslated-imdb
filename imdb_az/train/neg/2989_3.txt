According to this movie, one of those who paid attention to this statement, which is over 80, has a low liquidity, and I have to say something about it. I'm not a filmmaker looking at production value, thoughtful dialogue or brilliant toys and management. But I claim that this movie is sweet. I do not know why I do not like it ... Almost there is everything I want to fear from a movie: blood, insults, unwanted humor, and so on. This proof should be my favorite. Still, Zombi 3 is a baaad film. <br /> <br /> On the screen there are a lot of things to shout. As the girl was thrown into the army when the car was broken to find water (it did not insult anything). I see it as an abandoned hotel or something. Did not see that there was a friggy lake in the middle of that building? Yes, looking for water and going through the lake. Why? Cuz wants to know why (when he says "no place") people will not answer when he calls: "Is there someone there?" <br /> <br /> In some cases, the shootings of this film will last a few days later. This is just one of those movies, if you forgot how bad it is for a few times. It is so overwhelming in every respect. In the first clause, I called this blood, but it does not have blood, it has a mixed ocean. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of the most emerging to think of the worst and most sad movies and get acquainted with 50's fantastic movies? I believe that the Zombi 3 and similar movies are beyond that. There are all elements: scientists are debating with the government, apocalypse warnings on the radio, troops fighting monsters, and so on. This is the 80's plan of 9! If I want to buy it, I will not be able to say that it is a waste of money, but it's too bad. It's not as bad as you realize that Zombie 3 does not expect the worst. <br /> <br /> I do not think I hate this movie, I'm not really. Oh, P.S. Birds kill (aka Zombie 5) rules! (did I simply steal my validity?)
