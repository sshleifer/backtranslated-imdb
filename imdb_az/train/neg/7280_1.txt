I will continue to review this program as soon as possible. Jump. Low budget, not funny, bad deeds. Writing is not as bad as it is, but it's still bad. <br /> <br /> This is a three-part film, each with a different kind of movie parody. The very funnier movie, with the same exact idea, is "The Movie Movie" with George S. Scott. Save too much, but worth the search. MM pulled the parody movies in the 1930s and made it with delicacy, sensitivity and dryness. <br /> <br /> This movie did not. From the 70s of the night, at the beginning of the 80s, three films are parody, only my parody films. First, in my opinion, the parody of "Kramer V.Kramer". Peter Reigert does his best with a poorly written article. Second, a parody, I do not know what to do ... Danielle Steele novel? I would like to say that you see such a story all the time on TV, but in the movie theater? So I remember 70, I was there. This is a soap opera type parody of a young woman lying on the road to power. Such things usually parody themselves, so I do not see how important this is. <br /> <br /> With the third part, the "Municipalities" are a little bit easier to parody police films. When the film was created, both celebrated New Centurians, about 10 years old, and some of the "Dirty Harry" elements. Well, fine and current. Robbie Benson is irreverent when he plays police whiskey drinking while Richard Widmark's police car (OH! Stop! My party! He is really drinking in the Police!) Note that this is the " National Lamp ". Amazing! Wow. It's not shocking to go to this hygiene meeting within five years of this classic whip. I can continue for hours on a sad decrease in American humor that sells and starts to one of the most advanced and original sounds (which will be the National Lamp for the first 10 years or more). long, slowly drifting into a world of bull that has long been a magazine and is just a brand name for injustice on the budgetary "comedy" films. Why is one reason for the deterioration of capitalism (and cocaine)? <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a serious one. Do not spend 90 minutes. We want back mine. On the positive side, there is also Fred Willard!
