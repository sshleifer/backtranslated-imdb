This is a very strange movie ... I'm not sure what somehow I was talking to, some N Londons find a quiet child in the trees, all believing that some kind of oracle and in any way change their lives in the disaster. The film came to an end in about 90 minutes, giving me a feeling of dissatisfaction, almost a senseless part of all of them. <br /> <br /> I did not think anything about any hero, none of them had the chance to rejoice over the audience. Am I neglected? It was very striking. What happens with the runner? Why Emilio Shoots a Baby? ... it made absolutely meaningless, meaningless. Can someone help me understand this blend of a movie?
