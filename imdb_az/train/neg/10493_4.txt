A difficult movie to categorize. I never gave a 110% concentration, and as it turned out, I did not know exactly who was among the American FBI symbols and what their roles were. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a splendid episode of Discovery TV. going to a less important sub-area, just set off. Since any Irwin show is always worth a watch, this movie is not surprising, not on Christmas Day. <br /> <br /> <strong>
