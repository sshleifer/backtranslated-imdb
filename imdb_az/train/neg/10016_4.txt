"Dragstrip Hollow's Life" is one of the many films that interest young people who are faced with supernatural. In this case, adolescents will not pay rent for the conversation and will not be allowed to go home. Until they go elsewhere, they decide for a visible haunted home. As you can imagine, some strange things happen when you arrive. <br /> <br /> This movie has nothing to see in other films, but it's a great fun. My favorite character was a bad-tempered parrot. Yes, I would like to reiterate: he did not speak as a symbol in Quentin Tarantino, but he said things that we would not expect from the bird. The cleanest film of the film, but harmless.
