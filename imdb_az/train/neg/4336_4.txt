I returned this movie and the original Carlitos Way. The difference between the two is disgusting. Now, I know that people say that the preeccess has turned into a small budget, but it has nothing to do with a bad script. Now, maybe it's just me, but I've always thought that a prequel is preparing to set up another movie and perhaps a little bit about life we ​​did not know. The rise of power is just a movie with the name of Carlito. The original film must have at least a few characters, the end does not make sense of the original. At the end of this film he gets into his sweet heart, but what is the hell out of prison that goes to the next movie? And she speaks of her as in her essence, not the same woman. Along with the little bit of a movie, I would say that she was entertaining in a fun way, but when I got older, she took a pallet. Do not wake up at night to see if you really need a hit if you look at the original one more time.
