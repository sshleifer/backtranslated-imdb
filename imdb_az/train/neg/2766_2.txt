I went to this movie with great hopes. Normally, I'm not very picky about my movies, and live movies have always been fun or thoughtful to watch. I will mention the good part of this movie: - Live effects. All living things did a good job, their actions were real, and they were in line with other illustrations. To be honest, creative impressions are the only reason I have given this movie to more than 1, but to 2. Now bad things: Well, my Lord, I've seen a bad move, but this movie gets a cake. None of the characters are * close * not convincing. Leader sent a casting challenge and was selected from all the worst tests. I did not want to disturb anyone in the theater, but in fact it was BAD. - Story Line: The whole story is full of trickery from the beginning to the end. You can choose at least 5 field holes every 30 minutes. Of course, the field holes are full of cheese. This is one of the most terrifying stories I have ever seen on the screen, since it is a great regret over sitting overnight and watching the Parasite on the SciFi channel. - Dialogue: This is a world that is the most cheesiest and most clichéd thing possible in every possible chance of everyone. At least 30 other low-budget live movies in this world appear to have been spoken before each row. Cheese and cliché world. Special effects. The effect of the creature was terrible, although the special effects were toughened. Yes, it is better than what's being done in other films, but it's the presentation of many. And this film has no presentations. To be honest, Power Rangers seem to be just as special effects used on TV. Summary: Dragon Wars is neither worth nor worth your money. The concept is good, but the film's poor orientation, movement, dialogue, and inadequacy. Wait for the next great monster movie to come out. Dragon Wars is completely terrible, because it needs to be better.
