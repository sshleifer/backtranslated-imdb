From the 1970s, I can enjoy the horror of any worst Italian horror movie or jungle. Seriously. <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Of course, some who build a resort in the woods together there are ignorant westerners. I do not even remember where it happened ... How sorry ... Basically people can see this tribe and its ceremonies, but in the end, when the river's "Traitor" continued to strangely go, some of the graduates and some tribes also killed. It sounds good, yeah? Well, do not take your hopes. <br /> <br /> By the end of the day, there was minimal violence, special effects seemed like a kindergarten class, and she was amazed at the amazement of love. <br /> <br /> There are serious scenes in a pool, pulling underwater water and throwing a toy crocodile into a dart like a dart, and it must have been a gateway. I'm not kidding. With another beautifully-crafted special effect, Matchbox van is targeted at an incredibly sinking plastic gator, which is more than five times the size of a van. (Just a few minutes ago, he was big enough to eat, but now he threw a full-sized freight car ...) This is really miserable. The other flick Bruno Mattei's masterpiece, which I thought of the places where the effects were worse than me, was the Rats, the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all that could not be terrified. /> <br /> Normally, if I see Sergio Martino as a solid thing, it must be one. It's not worth the time to drop it and buy it at $ 15 +, which is not necessarily a shame. <br /> <br /> Children under 10, children.
