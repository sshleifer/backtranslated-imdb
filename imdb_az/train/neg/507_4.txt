Unlike my friends, I always try to find something in any movie I've seen. Perhaps the quality of dubbing and lighting is unbreakable, and the player's chest and boot sequence causes all the delusional female lesbian vampires to shed their blood. Under the heading of Italy, the word "Bloodsucker" should disappear; almost the producers first make the Gothic Vampire tale and then change their mind, but they will not be able to refuse dramatic opening sequences, so they hit the film. <br /> <br /> This film was released in 1975 on a DVD and comes with a peculiar film, which is more courageous as seen in the film! Anyone who has taken this movie now is likely to read his mind and know what to expect - Italian softporn in the mid-1970s. I bought it because I pulled Christa Nelli (mostly referred to as "Krista Nell"). The lack of cartoons is one of the most emotional of these Eurosleaze films in the 60s and 70s. Imdb is very difficult to associate with the player, just as you hear their names in the movie, but without a cast list. I hope Krista Nell has played Cora, but under the massive hair style, the costume and makeup are difficult <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> the music was atmospheric and, of course, is used there when you have a nice delicate soft porn. The outside places were good and I would like to know where their castle is. "Ireland" in the North or in the Republic?) In 1902, so everyone has a piece of sports suit. I have some scenes, unwelcome funny, especially sex scenes! Anyway an unpleasant romp.I rated it 4/10.
