Nothing can prepare you for another bad bimbo journey! This time is nevertheless brought by Fred Olen Ray! This is not a click because of the abuse of the movies! As science fiction, it is unnatural! Everything we see is an ugly femininity that shows nearly everything to wear a bikini and to resist the Earth! Call me a f-ing! If this kind of entertainment is your stuff, then why is not dust changed from this old SI water curtain? It would not have been good if the sleaze factor did not set too high. I would like to mention another movie by ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, similar to ALINENATOR's personality. Outstanding notch describes the "femme fatale" action of 1-person filmmakers in America is not well translated. I'm sorry, friends!
