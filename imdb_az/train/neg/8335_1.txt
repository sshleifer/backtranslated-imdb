Package suggests that Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn have pulled a big bank robbery, but that does not go away! I did not get anything! In the first half every single scene has a new character (without the application). The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is just a long, exciting, secret chase scene. In the background there is always an exciting sound, a loud clock, an inflatable siren, a train crash or a horrible score by Quincy Jones. There are also many sections that are very funny. Like bad guys pushing Beatty on a thin ice with a CAR! Or the police arrived at the scene about fifteen times. I really hate this movie!
