My husband and I did not think it would fail if he decided to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I love Billy Crystal, my husband loves Julia Roberts, and everyone we talked to him said they loved him. <br /> <br /> We too, the character of Crystal was extremely dim and had little to do with the film. <br /> <br /> Of course, she has caused some nice jokes, but as a character he did nothing. <br /> <br /> Poor Julia Roberts. In the past he shows that he plays well as a loyal, self-indicating lady. This flick, it looks totally choked and very few fire. <br /> <br /> If I had found something good, it would have to be Christopher Walken. Now it's fun. But like Billy Crystal, it does not seem difficult for her character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night with a little delayed foolish laughs, look. But if you are looking for a smart, romantic comedy, this is not your movie. This is not one of the above.
