No One Sleeps's plot line is a bad idea, and the subject is a bit of a curiosity. However, while watching this movie, we said with a loud voice: "It's good that the filmmakers find good places, worry, lighting is good, makeup and hair good ... why is the sound so bad?" <br /> <br /> There are some good moves in this movie, and I think Jim Thalman is a really good actor. Together with some actors, this story could be regarded as a high-budget movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a budget similar to that, pay more attention to good sounds. . Sound is part of a movie like a picture and worth the right direction. 6 wins.
