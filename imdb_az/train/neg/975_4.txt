I saw this director "The Woman on the Beach" and did not understand well for the good reviews. This film is very dynamic and has two people who are less interested in it. Like all his other films, I want to listen to the important dialogue, to be very passionate and to be proud of the unwritten and unfamiliar characters. If you think you love this movie, do not stop me from reviewing it. I love minimalism in movies, but Tsai Ming-Lian's films are very high. In his films, Lee Kang-Sheng has a terrifying actor. There is nothing here. I like the IU, but I'm not. He is excellent.
