Terrible, just awful. This is evidence for the theory of "star energy." The man who manages Titanica (Battlestar) is the same man who manages this shlop schtock stunt about a chick, because it is supposed to be a great television.

This is a direct proportion: quality 1 / "star energy", less "sp" quality, and another way to look at it is "less . ") Z
