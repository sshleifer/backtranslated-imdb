This terrible detail of the BTK killer can not say anything of my hatred. Evaluate this movie from one of the ten compliments of this really scary excuse for a movie. From the beginning to the end, there was only one single note. The whole thing is horrendously put together; comedy, acting, sky, lighting, direction, action, actual information, ACTING, just a few names. Many scenes are a laughable-loud sound, in which the whole word is put together. This review may seem like an unjust and sensitive attack against a movie in a low budget, but that's not the case. I only think about the movie I've been watching, and it starts to cook. I will never know that this film is justified for producing it. I really intend to recommend the ICTA because it is really unbearable and uncomfortable that it is unhappy. We can honestly say that this is the worst in all my films. MOVIE. EVERYTHING. I spent an hour of my life on this useless trash, and I was glad to see the building near me, and I knew why. TEN ZERO.
