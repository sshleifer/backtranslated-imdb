Die For (1989) is another d.t.v. At the beginning of the 90s, the cable name appeared on my nose. The only thing that draws attention to this feature is the latest film, Duane Jones. There is no reason to watch these vampire flickers if you do not want to disguise the horrific chicken squirrels as a scary movie. The tired vampire is looking for love for a long time and looking at the back streets of L.A. <br /> <br /> Like in the last century, he will succeed, or will Vlad just blow it once again? <br /> <br /> This movie is great for a couple of follow-ups. It's too bad to make this one look like a classic. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <strong>
