Run over your favorite seat and move it to the play station and take it to the wastewater disassembly unit. Spend 90 minutes. You live in your favorite game. Disjointed - bad film shot - non-directional junk. He takes a piece of many other "science fiction" movies and makes bad attempts to incorporate the pieces into a strange story. There's nothing new, but filmmakers do not think they can win a game with simple fun, but in order to make a good movie, they need skill inventiveness and flair touch. Any money that I'm watching is a waste and I would personally want my 90,000 life back.
