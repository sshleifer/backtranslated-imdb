Finally, Major Joe Don Baker, running around Texas, shoots people who hit people. He then shoots more people in Malta. Locked several times to hit people. Then he goes into an armed fight with a bad boy dressed as a priest. There is a boat pursuit and Joe Don re-enters the prison. Finally Joe Don, "Seinfeld", with the help of Elaine, kill a bad man, blow up a boat or two, and someone gets shot with a glimpse. All this and an attractive theme like Mitchell!
