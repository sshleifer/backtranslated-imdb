AWA's wrestling can for somebody forget about this unreal show. First, "Rock n Roll" Buck Zumhofe had a very short interview called Marty O'Neil, which looked like a nose. At that time, Gene Okerland would say, "if it's crazy like a wrestler," or "it was out of the season" or "if it were alive". After going to WWF Ken Resneck took his shoulder looking like a week-round soup, because "Georgeous" Jimmy Garvin called the mouse face down to me laughing at my cafe. Larry Nelson, after he dropped the ship, came to the evil he thought Philish was going to do! Then Doug McLeod has the best wrestler spokesman who has made every match that thrills with his description of the blows! Later, the Minnesota North Stars hockey team offered more payments. Roger Kent, a wizard who ringside who could forget mispronounced words and sentences, was great "something great!" When hit in "boxing" or "hit" or "bump", he shot or hit the fists inside "right in the kiosks". When a wrestler knocks the knife down from another baby's forehead, they say to the right front-e-lobe or to a wrestler: "Wrongly in a bad way." He would also say that AWA's most unfortunate, tough, ordinary, and most scientific wrestlers came to AWA! (Added Werne Gagne!) Larry (WWF) Nelson seized and I would have to talk to someone else, or I had never seen him (WWE did not take it wisely!) Greg Gagne also had the yellow color of something I had never seen in the farthest wrestling I ever saw Looks like she wants to get her to escape to the closest toilet! Jumpin J im Brunzell was such a great drift artist that Greg is always his partner. Jerry Blackwell (RIP) was also a superstar wrestler, but you wondered what Verne had done for him. (Puhleeeeze!) When Vince McMahon employed the Gagnes employees, most of them would play squash games. I want to see Gagne's family say that the wrestlers are real!
