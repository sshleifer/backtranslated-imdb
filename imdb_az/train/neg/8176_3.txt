<br /> <br /> <strong> With the exception of "Combo," I thought the actor was poor and the story was limited. <br /> <br /> <strong> It looks like a drama for television. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie was very subtle. At the outset, all the organizations in the context of the context (yes, we can stop now in Britain from the 1980s), and in the mid-80s, gave a one-sided idea of ​​England's life - met with poverty, war, royalty and Margaret Thatcher is there nothing? There were really middle classes - just ordinary workers, decent wages and mortgages. <br /> <br /> <strong> Falkland clips seemed to be seen in a random way. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> It is meant for dramatic effect. </ P> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Relationships between Shaun and Smell were shining. I could not even look at the snogging scene. I believe it will be attracted to a child who is not so young, but I believe it looks very young. I know that there are only four years between them, but four years are not something you have reached for 20, but a great difference in your teens! In my experience, this age difference occurs only when the girl is smaller because girls grow faster and have a wave height of more than a few years. Sorry, but I did not buy - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value. <br /> <br /> The latter slightly aggravated and re-created. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Do not get wrong, I love Trainspotting, and the Four Duke has a charm, but do not the British come up with something different? Why do our films always depend on the classroom? I was born in 1973, so in 1983, I did not differ much for "Shaun". I grew up in a single parent family in an ordinary municipal council in a city in England. But my childhood experiments were very different from those shown in the film - I do not remember racism as a problem (though I did not exist). "This is England"? Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The following line, I felt that this movie was not material, and therefore totally boring and uncompromising.
