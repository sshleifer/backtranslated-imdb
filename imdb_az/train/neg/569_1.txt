Thank you for killing a franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This film is so miserable on many levels. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <BR> <BR> <BR> First VAMPIRES was fun, Banderas's guitar job at DESPERADO. He chose some "hunters" along the way (including the annoyingly feminist infection girl holding the pills for the vampire), and some women who were unable to give any of the old broadcasts set off to stop him less (about the Black Cross walk in the sunlight and hold a ceremony to allow it). <br /> <br /> You see the first VAMPIRES, you've already seen it and done a lot better. <br /> <br /> Recently, John Carpenter is responsible for very bad movies. Undoubtedly, he has gone through his own initiative and is unable to create another class of fear. THE only film ever made by LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything is nothing but an incredibly inexpensive and delaying MARS ... and now it's a waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> PUBLISHERS 13, HALLOWEEN (1), WHAT IS THE BEST OF NEW YORK AND WHERE IT WAS GREATEST? <br /> <br /> Carpenter crony Wallace proves that he can not print paper bags with paper - Scenarios were originally full of yawns, groans and reversed shades. Have I hated every single character in the movie? The entire film did not have a memorable character. How is it? There is nothing that this movie has to recommend. DVD presentation is not so good; <br /> <br /> Author: JASON X: "SPECIAL SPECIAL SPECIAL SPECIAL" poem. Now you are powering on a franchise, ladies and germs later on, and creating an exciting DVD menu.
