We are now traveling to a parallel universe, where the appearance of giant prehistoric monsters that make up the cities is a part of everyday routine. <br /> <br /> For the first time a few days ago there were Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra Ghidra and their sex - a strange world. The appearance of an unidentified flying turtle called "gamera" made such a strange thing. <br /> <br /> Unusual Toho Studios, the second round Daiei Studios, were more popular than monster films for Samurai Sagada. In the mid-1960s, they decided to join the giant reptile race and prepared Toho's mammothly successful Godzilla rival monster series. They have chosen the gamer intelligently - a huge turtle (and at one point a flare that holds the shell of the paper) rotating into the air by flaming flames between the teeth and the flames of the shell. <br /> <br /> The first Gamera movie is a virtual mirror left behind for the first 10 years of the first Godzilla movie, "Gamera The Invincible" (sold to the United States). American warriors pursue an unmanageable aircraft on the Arctic to the brutal death - nuclear bomb, flames, and awakens the giant gamer. Atomic energy begins to breathe immediately, and the world wants to destroy Gamer once and for all, but Gamera is kind and kind, besides a young Japanese guy, with a psychic connection with a huge turtle, and even a boy named Kenny, which has a miniature version of the aquarium. Hitler is a little Jewish child with a pinup. "Gamera is a good turtle", then sulks, and puts a face like a cat in a coco pop. Miraculously, world leaders are listening to it and the Z-Plan ends up destroying the world and the Gamer. <br /> <br /> The Gamera, released in 1965, was a striking hit. This annoying baby anthropomorphism actually worked on kiddie audiences in Japan and the United States, and made the Tokyo and North Pole miniatures a gem in the eye of Gamera's two legs. The most striking of all of these is the longevity of the series: eight original Gamera movies, one of the last remakes. Not only is it bad for an eight-year-old milquetoast's friend, a mutant reptile - and I'm going to crush in Tokyo again, when I hear "Gamera ALL for Children". In a parallel universe where children are intelligent, turtles are larger than the Seiko billboards in turtle-fest gamers in 1965.
