The rebellion of the zombies is BAD. There is nothing remote about the movie. Gentle, lifeless, weak movement and weaknesses. This is a little slower to my taste than the original Dracula often, this movie looks like a roller coaster ride on Dracula. The 65 minute running time seemed to be 165 minutes. Story: Cambodia is sent to an expedition to find secrets of intelligence through "zombie". A man finds secrets and uses his beloved wife to marry him. After this happened, he exposed zombies under control to terrible consequences. This is so. This is the whole story. <br /> <br /> For most of the film, I saw the place where I was brought. He was very familiar. I had a lot of time to think. Nothing happened in the movie. Before "zombies rebelled", they hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I've seen him in the White Christmas as General. <br /> <br /> I am very pleased to buy the DVDs of this movie. On the other hand, King of the Zombies is a masterpiece of the film compared to this movie. Why pay for it, I'll give it 2/10. (I will not go to 1/10, because I believe or have seen worse.)
