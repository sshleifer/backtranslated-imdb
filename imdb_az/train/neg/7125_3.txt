VILLA RIDES (1968) is a great disappointment! Although Sam Peckinpah is the only one in the script, Robert Towne is still a wretched movie directed by unusual Buzz Kulik. Firstly, the part of the top bill with the Pancho Villa, Yul Brynner, is wrong! Not enough charismatic to play Great Mexican Revolutionaries! There was no fire in his recording performance and could have brought the role of gusto Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland. Brynner just dressed as a Mexican robber in the middle of the Mexican Revolution, not a Russian warrior. Also, the second invented Robert Mitchum was completely wasted! A biplane flying in the lobby that lobbies homemade bombs on the grounds of the revolution, plays a minor role that can be played by any small star. Mitch does not have a decent line in the entire film and, unfortunately, reflects the Bandido (1956) film, which unfortunately does not show anyone any interest in freedom of the DVD on the Mexican Revolution. In addition to the lack of any style, "Villa Rides" suffers badly without a female star! Mitchum is a starlet Grazia Buccella, a young Mexican girl who gives birth to joy, but her shooting is in progress. <br /> <br /> <strong> Someone like Klaudia Cardinale or Jean Peters could possibly add a few bad lanterns to a careful story line. <br /> <br /> There are several good action scenes in the film, but there are some good action scenes <br /> <br /> No additions like Paramount - not even a trailer, not a movie, and the perfect Panavision image quality plus recurrent Maurice Jarre theme tune helps less. Yup had to be a disappointing movie and a DVD presentation, and much better.
