a friend told me that it was a classic like "Debbie is in Dallas". No place near you. My main complaint is that I'm thinking about the leading actress, not the most affected by the porn industry. Even worse, it's almost always on the screen. But I read that in those days porn had some "artistic" values. Although I could not find him. See if you can only evaluate the art of pornography or about pornography. I dont know. But the director of the film seems to be a talented person. He even wanted to allow Simon and Garfunkel to use his songs. Of course, they refused.
