I read all of the Love Soft books. They know that films can not use all aspects of the book, but at least, they have at least the main points of the book. I'm so glad I did. There is only one thing in this book, Missy's father is coming to visit (even if the book is from parents). Thats it. The story line was too wrapped up and very distant and yes, it was sad, from the book, I just could not enjoy it. He was so upset that I could not read the book. I know the pioneer's life is rude, but the whole movie was a loss. The rating is to direct the film to the same family, making them beautiful.
