In my hopes, I will not be able to benefit more than twenty minutes. Though we thought that this would be a worse one, I kept hoping for it ... Maybe someone would fix those around them this time. Unfortunately, the Prom Night is of the same quality as the end of April <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It deserves a full digging, repeating, and flattened eye pad. We've seen it before and have seen it a million times better. Say Prom Night in the theater (Wait for DVD or PPV), be ready to laugh at the audience to laugh. The smiles feel like watching the newest installment of Scary Movie, which responds to "exciting" moments in the most exciting way of the film, not just at the point where they should be laughable in the movie. Seriously, could that be a recurrence or verbal? The filmmakers did not leave here so badly that in the theater I attended about half a year since many of the audience. Which retrospective I did, I did. In spite of this, I have to endure torture and worry that it would be better. Needless to say. "Horror" scenes are a toy, but in the direction of movement, scripts, "special effects" and camera work are not so many. The film tried to appear as if they had a wealth of production to produce, but still came out with a micro budget movie. Sometimes I was planning to see a store label full of one of the requisites, and I thought I would find a porn star in a cast. <br /> <br /> These films are good at scrambling, if this is the future of fear of big budget this horror genre is condemned.
