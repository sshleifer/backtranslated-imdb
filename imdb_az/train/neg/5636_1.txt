This movie was the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This is not a plot, but when you realize that it is beyond the start of the movie, it does not seem to be long enough to recognize the director's total inability, a buffer chick plays in the movie, and we do not believe Willem Dafoya in that movie, , clone, because we would never agree with this script from Dafoy "Apocalypse now" and "boon dock saints." <br /> <br /> Duh wrote that the enemy has closed this bill for 20 years with a baby <br /> <br /> Bottomline; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <span style = "font-family: Black widow (different header, same bumpy). <br /> <br /> DO NOT STAY THIS MOVIE! Total time of the time!
