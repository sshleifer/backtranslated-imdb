Inexpensive, everlasting shooting, unnecessary pictures, useless scenes will be found in this movie. In other words, it seemed to me technically weak. Music bits are directed by amateur (synchronized dance to dance, synchronization after errors, bad and open improvisation from time to time, etc.). <br /> <br /> The film is long and boring. Finally, it gives you a few points and less meaning. <br /> <br /> Even though there are some good ideas. Some of the funny elements are really effective, especially the opening scene. However, the film is worse and worse, until it is completely unbearable and can not be understood. <br /> <br /> The trailer I saw was very dynamic, it's not right for the movie. That is, the inconsistency between trailer and real movie is something that draws many.
