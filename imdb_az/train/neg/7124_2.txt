A man brings his new wife to the house where his ex-wife died from an "accident." Her new spouse has just been released from a single organization and is very rich! He suddenly begins to hear all the noises and begins to see the skulls in all places. Is he crazy again or is his first spouse coming from the dead? <br /> <br /> Maybe I will finish it. I saw on Saturday night as a child many times on television. Since then I liked it, but I was young. Now I see how bad this is. He was scared, poorly written, very sorry (even at an hour) and there were five great men (one director)! There are still good things to do with it. <br /> <br /> Music is a very ambitious and wonderful atmosphere with a great empty house and pond creating itself. There are also moments of fear (when I first skipped when I saw the skull) and ended up with some effect. All this is definitely not a good movie ... but not a total disaster. There is one small cult below. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid the release of the Elite DVD Drive (linked to the Giant Siege Attack). Bounce and scratch everything in the form of MORE DIFFICULTIES. I did not even see it on TV!
