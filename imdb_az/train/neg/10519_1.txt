<br /> <br /> I've seen many films and rarely do any movies, but this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> The act was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effect was unreal, and the characters were bored. When watching scary movies, it's like saying "DUMB" when the houses / forest / school noise hear, and then greets "Hello there?" <br /> <br /> This film is a film that will make B-horror films like Venom and The Fog. <br /> <br /> While watching movies, I always have an open mind, and I can only say that this movie is a complete waste of time, and I am writing this article that everyone thinks. We'll watch this movie again. WITH YOU!
