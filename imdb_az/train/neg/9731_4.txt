Others have already commented on director Tobe Hooper's "degradation," but what can you say about Brad Dourif? He was perfect in choosing good projects (because he was proven to play in the same year as Exorcist III), so why would he agree to participate? Of course, he does give a proper demented performance and the movie is obviously not bad; it's just unresolved, uninteresting and unreliable. These three are more. (* 1/2)
