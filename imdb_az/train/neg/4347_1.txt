Wow ... what can I say ... First IMDb says it was in the 1960s ... Carlito would be close to going to prison, at age 75, and said he was 5 years old. They used a bunch of non-actors and even an illogical story. They play only one actor, Guzman and HES, a completely different boy. Why not with it and this Puerto Rican chicken did not end up? Where's Gale? He said he was in love at first. Where's Kleinfeld? He said you knew him forever ... You would think that this would be one of them. And if this is known, Rocco and the black man, the first one? All this was just stupid ... This is Pacino's insult to the first film.
