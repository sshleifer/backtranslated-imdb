I can say that before watching the film, there was no sign of Annemarie Schwarzenbach or his life story, and I have to admit that the movie is a tough help to reach this information ... by writing a few words on the google website, was not successful in convincing him to conduct; <br /> <br /> I also say that actress Jeanette Hain is great with a really good silent facial expression and, in reality, has shown a deep mental depression status. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film was in Afghanistan like in Tehran, Afghanistan, but I believe that it was in a Moroccan Arabian desert where I met the region .. The Turkish people and the Persian people are totally different in face and culture, is not. <br /> <br /> I think this is a documentary-type movie, and I think that a detailed investigation of all these small elements is necessary.
