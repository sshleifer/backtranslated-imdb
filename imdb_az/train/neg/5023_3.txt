No one, but no one, is a great example of why chew scenes like Divine One, Ruth Elizabeth Davis and "Elizabeth and Essex". Even though he sometimes overplays a portion of it, when he writes his words about Raliegh, look at the women he expects to write in a song: at one point he realizes how Elizabeth can handle and manage. !! At other times, it is executed with the blessing of the script. When Elizabeth becomes sensitive, she comes down to being weak and embarrassed. Flynn shakes his charm and has forced us to see how Essex can escape. This, in turn, affects his sovereignty: it is a blow to his pile and threatens to destroy justice. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth is going to his heart, but he is completely unclean in conveying the complexity and the mischief of man. This does not help Essex write in a bad way. What is this hottest head who wants to overthrow his kingdom - even if he says he is loyal to it, with the exception of the blue bloody, or even more "dignified" rule? And why does Rallyegh betray Elizabeth and Esseks's letters by betraying her? He is not in danger of falling into a benevolence, and we know that Essex (and his head) is head. <br /> <br /> What did Kurtis do with all his $ $ $? It is not uncomfortable to try to conceal that even the battle scenes were shot at a quiet stage. He was the first to complete with Elizabeth at the tower; Everything below (especially the final scene between him and Essex) is unnecessary. Costume is fantastic. And if I do not, Bette looks like Susan Sarandon?
