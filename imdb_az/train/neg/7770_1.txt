On the contrary, Bill Rebane was led by a film, the man really took on responsibility for the awesome anti-classic Monster a-Go Go. When I came to the end of the cold, I came to an incredible conclusion that this movie was actually worse than the shock of the 60s. Story? about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to play a series of macabre games far from home. Whoever goes on fast and does not live up to the dead will earn 1,000,000 dollars. There is a very simple project, but Rebane is still somewhat incomprehensible. Things happen. Characters completely forget. Nothing is too meaningful. And then it's over. It's strange. What does hell mean? I think you will stay for the results. Production values ​​and action are the subject of a pornographic film standard. In fact, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not so good. He is incredibly terrible that he is compelled to do so. Unfortunately, the same thing can not be said about the whole crap-fest, it's just a bargain cellar rotter.
