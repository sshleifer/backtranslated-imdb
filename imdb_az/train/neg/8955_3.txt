Despite being filmed, this is a science fiction movie. There are so many cool things in it, and there are some good quality scenes. So this is not good and some things are pretty far away ... <br /> <br /> It's okay and full of bullsh! T. This is a very high definition of giving a great and inventive original film ... Firstly, it can be the first of its kind, but the application of people / androids as part of the "team" behind the cube extends somewhat ... <br /> <br /> I gave this 3 *** because of the original shot from the back. <br /> <br /> Cub and Hypercube should be sterile in most parts of the film, which can be seen for those who have never seen, but do not advise ... <br /> <br /> For serial fans ...
