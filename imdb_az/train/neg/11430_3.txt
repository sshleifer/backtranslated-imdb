Okay, leave a new word here: Polyphobia: the fear of polyamoric relationships. It begins with justifying a trio of trio on a long line of films, turning it into a dime and so important, and sending all the blessings about something monogamous to find a monogamist solution. One in a thousand understands that one person deserves to love more than one person, and that director is not one of them. Bleh. <br /> <br /> Please note my words: After several decades, polyphobia will be a huge mistake as homophobia, but who has been so close to understanding it? For the first time: the producers of this movie. And it's very similar. Why make it a ridiculous conservative and an old movie type? If we praise for having an open mind about homosexuality, we live in a time when monogamine becomes a consistent monogamy, which, in its turn, is eradicated and polyamine. Open your eyes, people! <br /> <br /> This is a frustration, the mill is naked flicker. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he is capable of everything.
