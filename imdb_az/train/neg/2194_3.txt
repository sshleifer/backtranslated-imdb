Neat premise. Very unrealistic. From this film I learned that speeding up the speed of departure to go to the weekend booth can not be the best idea. I liked how Bill easily hit the car and did not fall down the hill! Unfortunately, it can not be said for the gal. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, Poland did not have difficulty finding cars. <br /> <br /> There are many dragged scenes that are straightforward (including nightmares from that area). Poor assistant man and his little useless hand. I must admit that the mysterious "thing" was forced to see what was behind the door, but when I came out, I just laughed. HA HA HA! The girl was angry because she was really animated. Personally, after a similar experience, I would like a new body!
