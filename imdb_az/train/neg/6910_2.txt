I actually did not see this movie, but I can say something about your production. In 1988, though I was a comedy / oldies radio DJ, I came up with a call from the production company. I would write and record a little bit of a sound (as the television screen would never be shown) as a noise from the sound. I am sure that the 50s have written fantasy monster stereotypes, rounded off some sound effects and called on another DJ to play Pam Landry. At that time, when he was in the air, he put a long song in mine, joined me in the production room, and separated the sound square one by one. Giggling went back to his show while he was mixed with gothic sound effects. If we knew that Woodchipper Massacre would go to such a turkey, we never did it - but never again, I never paid for our efforts! - Gary Theroux
