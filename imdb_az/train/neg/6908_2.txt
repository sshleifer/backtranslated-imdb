This series had the potential, but I think the budget will not allow it to see this potential. After the first episode, an interesting device is no different than "lost". The entire series could have shot six episodes, a 90-minute movie, but the producers began dragging it. Most of the scenes were slowly and prolonged without moving forward. The music was very boring and generally did not work. As they grew up in time, their character had improved, there were some characters that care, and grew up. The rest of the series was terrible. The only force in the art department and its creators was an interesting look, and the very bad writer and director did not have enough to do something interesting with that element.
