Finally, we know that film is a drill. Even when the story progresses several times, other areas are emerging. And that's more frustrating. To compensate for the inconsistency of tension, we learn more about how unbalanced the characters are. And yes, yes, there's plenty to show. For example, Andy (P. Hoffman), a drug addict, is more likely to deceive his wife than he is planning to rob his father more than his wife betrayed his brother. more accusations of his mother's death, more ?, he is a serial killer, more? and so on. there is not enough space for writing here ... How can my best work be? Why did not her husband leave her at first? On the other hand, I love actor Hoffman's performance. <br /> <br /> Even here, PSH rescues the $ 7 spent for this absurd. Why is it foolish? Because there is no sense, why should you care about humiliating characters? Another distorted lemma is that a movie has a sympathetic (least pleasing) character. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there is a lot of emotion, for example, to be careful about the argument of the father, and to care for the parents without knowing anything before committing a crime.
