This Kiyoshi Kurosawa ghost movie was pretty wild and there was at least one fear of jumping me off guard. But all this, the movie is an incredible stupid, with a detective trying to watch a suspect serial killer, just to be able to do one of those crimes. Then she finds herself by a beautiful Asian ghost ghost and does not have any (and no viewer) idea. As other crimes are committed, murders are more complicated than easily found, and this ghost still insults him. Not just a fool of a sloth, but a woman's dreams, more fun than ever before, especially suddenly fly along the city like Wonder Woman. And the latter is a bit unreasonable, in fact, the whole movie is a bit unreasonable, and I do not recommend it at all. If he did not take himself seriously, I would think he would be a black comedy. Out of the "Bright Future" is still the worst movie I've ever seen, Kiyoshi Kurosawa.
