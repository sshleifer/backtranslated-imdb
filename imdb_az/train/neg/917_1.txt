This film was really tastefully done. The scenario was really bad. I'm really sorry for the late Gregory Peck, who has played a leading role in adapting this B-movie to one of the greatest generals of history. The film did not feel politically wrong and obvious, along with others fighting the Second World War II on Japan. He was almost a vomit, and he showed up on a bunker on the Corradidor Island, a Corradidor island, an experienced political analyst in Hungary. an injured, one-legged Filipino soldier. The bleeding and death of the soldier usually sits flat and says, "Pope is not a mother, uncle Sam" and Macarthur gives a small talk with the Americans about the "Philippines will never leave." The scene ends with the soldier who plays Macartur's words and gives him a clever greetings. I do not want to say if the US has a more striking scene, which depicts the world as the world's largest white-savvy, tell it to me, because it will take the residue. The Philippines had dropped dull pride and showed great Americans that they should only rely on purchases. Members of USFFE (US Far East Armed Forces) have been contributing and deliberately shadows, including Philippine volunteers integrated into American warfare during World War II, and Japan, along with Americans in Bata's death, to Macarthur's " defended the island of Corregidor. My late father, a Philippine World War II veteran and USEFE soldier, was one of many people who fought Japan with respect and love for abroad. In my opinion, this film does not honor the thousands of people who, based on their intelligence preparations, come back to magnificent return to land in Hungary and the Gulf of Leyte.
