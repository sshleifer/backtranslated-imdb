Do not get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the shots are stunning and material dramatic. <br /> <br /> <strong> The BBC had Planet Earth above and beyond. It was fine. It has a sense of balance and has shown the full range of life and death. Tragedy and triumph, loss and profit. <br /> <br /> This is Disney's Earth Redaction. They tried to make us a film that talked about Americans. They made it DRAMATIC. They put the best musical score there to scare us. They hurt their predators. They WALRUSES made it worse. They showed that every encounter was negative. She tried to be successful and successful, but at the expense of balance sheets. <br /> <br /> <strong> This is to prevent global alerts, but it's at the top of the political and environmental agenda. <br /> <br /> This is something else, I went to see it on the big screen, but disappointed with the picture quality. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like this and get the entire picture, you want to get out and borrow, lease, or borrow the BBC's Planet Earth series. Better lessons, better sounds, and better picture quality (if you have Blu-Ray).
