Johnny Weissmuller is the latest and most successful version of Tarzan's films, because it's the worst of 12 films ever made easily. A beautiful woman is trying to escape the runaway runs of the people who are worshiping a god and trying to force her to be her bride, or there is no mermaid here. Tarzan and Jane are trying to protect her. George Zucco is available as a potential foreigner prime minister, but is not used for his full advantage. It is also a sensitive, annoying guitarist / singer who sings very often in the hands and note. <br /> <br /> Even the "great" Robert Florey can not help. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (fourth)
