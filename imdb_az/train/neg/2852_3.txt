This is a totally unpleasant film. I broke down like Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, because a cunning line - a mob boss was expected to be released from a mental body. The movie is billed as a comedy, slaughter it. There is an infinite number of shots - a little surreal, intertwined - head, stomach, kneecap, foot, heart (no part) anatomy is unacceptable, as it seems, some of the non- defined and encrypted dialogues are provided. Goldblum's dialogue for the whole film can be matched by 3x5 card and extends along one face - a sardonic heart. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do their best. Burt Reynolds is a community. The list of loans was Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I missed myself (I'm doing good in their parts). The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and unusual; I'm doubtful about the style of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Fargo' and 'Natural Born Killers'. If you love them, maybe I like it.
