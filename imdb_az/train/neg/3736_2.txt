This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Robin Williams sat on a rug, like a rhino, and even his performance was still poor. Kurt Russell was more convincing, but still terrible. Ars√§n had a lot of desire and the rest of the action was terrible. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This is the only thing that comes into the movie, 90 minutes of my life to wipe me to the water it would be better for me to try to lick my head back. <br /> <br /> If you love this movie and burn this movie. If not, just happily.
