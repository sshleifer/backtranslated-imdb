Carpenter is looking to raise questions about abortion, and if the Devil is a father, the woman must be allowed to abort, as it is hard and accessible. Ron Perlman is laughing. Your baby has a really stupid look, mostly a baby with a baby head. The outfit of Satan's suit can be quite a lot. What a bad thing. This episode contains about five minutes of story and 55-minute distress. Very, very bad. And the end is just ridiculous. After learning that the baby is dead, the devil destroys the abortion chair and kills everyone in the big, bloody, heroic, rebellion? NO! He just lowered his head and squeezed out of the room. Terrible.
