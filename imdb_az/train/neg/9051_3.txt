I'm so excited when I find it! I did not expect to see this. What is energy? Your favorite band you love behind the rack in your local music store is like those rare CDs. You have been convinced that you have a hard time finding it a valuable discovery. However, these dogs you once heard have never been caused by a real album. This DVD is only recommended for 'companions' who have everything Lynch does. "Six-person disease" is somewhat intriguing, but short and repeatable. Nenne, who is deprived of the power of Lynch's next job, is not a very naive job. It looks like a tedious and student film. But it was 70 ... You only hope for the director's psychoanalysis. But in brief, you can see the seeds of some of the trademark images and sounds. "Alpahabet" is a memorable thing (I really do not remember anything!) "Amputee" is meaningless. "Cowboy and French" is simply foolish. "Lumiere" is the only value in the group. Without a dialogue, Lynch creates an inconvenience that can be compared to her best work. I have to watch it several times. But less than 2 minutes. Leasing or buying DVDs is a challenge.
