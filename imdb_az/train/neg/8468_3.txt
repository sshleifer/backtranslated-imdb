"They are among us" is the best science fiction. In this movie, low-motion bogs. There are plenty of soil holes. Foreigners who came to earth on a meteor and hiding for more than 100 years, but need a plastic surgeon to appear to man. In the form of foreigners, they have exotic skeletons (therefore they need plastic surgery), but when they see them they have teeth and nails. After closing the Blue Book of the project, the hero's father "disappeared", but was probably the F-16 pilot. And ten and ten. If you want to see an overseas film, select "Body Figures of the Body" and see how that is true.
