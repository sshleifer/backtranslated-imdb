Okay, so let's get to know everyone who died in the film with a free coffin's hockey offer, so bare, that's funny. And the first "skull scene" is not laughable in such a compilation and un-retreat. The real part of the film is worthy of a bit, the character's behavior is at least a bit of original food, and horror scarcity is as good as horrible snakes. The acting medium is really bad. <br /> <br /> Generally, this film is not exactly flattened by the film's 1/10. It is not terribly enough to be the lowest rating or even the second lowest. If I only read the script, I would say that it's a good movie. It is an angry direction and production that only destroys the film. There is a bad movie, but there are some worse ones there.
