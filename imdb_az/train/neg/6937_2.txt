The most recent topic in this regard is that the author tries to engage in debate on his / her own initiative, almost any cultural standard - is a very old topic of discussion with timeless romance (discussed). However, the b / q account, dialogue, dance, drama and so on. Exploration (and Desi auds for exploitation) because it creates a wonderful search suite of ordinary inclinations for 'peppers, spices and sugar' in the usual case mix <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes of the movie has been repeated at least 8-9 times in the kitchen scene. Additional repetitions were watched by the movie (cook after all the lead character). But there are problems - there's no story! Well, not surprising. <br /> <br /> Amitabh puts a Cheeni Jyada (more) multi-functional series. Will this man never stop? Although nubile is teased with something in 30th-30s, such as prance about somethings? Unhappy thoughts are yes, but how unreasonable about bod? And the only one? Sorry, soul? The film's only sensitive role is played by Paresh Rawal. The director does not have the feeling of realism getting a whole new capture of the new fangled discovery. There is no real-life problem in anywhere, or issues that may face such a pair, in fact, except that it is the only obstacle to getting married. The underlying area of ​​a small child suffering from cancer (the first love of a bachelor) does not go anywhere, and if it is a little extraordinary, it is often killed with the character of the girl. <br /> <br /> Anyway, nice try but pretty much there.
