Primal Species (1996, Dir., Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> If the army commando team is now reluctant to stop the exhaustion of human species, they have to think quickly. <br /> <br /> You look at the cover and you get the first impressions of the movie. This is pretty much. The player is only acceptable from just a few characters. The story is weak, it is based on the sea and the sea, trying to kill dinosaurs. This film came out three years after the Jurassic Park. Instead, this movie appeared 13 years before the Jurassic Park. Dinosaurs' costume is very weak and I mean suits. Of course, people are decorated and this film does not try to hide it. A scene in which a dinosaur escapes a corridor is created in the same way as one creates a creature. This is a good thing from the movie. Short-term time. <br /> <br /> "You do not spend most of your life in just one hour and 15 minutes, but they're still trying to pull you off. <br />" Like Friday Night 13. "- Officer (Brian Currie)
