This is the first thing I've been to, and for the first time I was disappointed with Tim Burton. POTA is not a bad movie (great sets, suits and great performance alone), but can be made by any off-the-shelf hollywood director. Pacing was very strange, and the third is waiting for myself and my arm to end the film. Tim Roth was perfect, probably just enjoyed in the movie. Come back, Tim.
