Nowadays, there are not enough floats around here, and here's the IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) director who has been here this year and has another naked GODFATHER clone. At that time, the cost of the staircase was Telly Savalas, without delay coming into the process and for the first time looking at the flowers and wearing a beret in the style of French artists! Despite the millennium, despite his regularity, he has nothing but acquaintance. Antonio Sabato, then makes for a tough gangster - apart from being a resistant lead man; a relationship with Savalas, a ghosting father, is unbelievable (especially since the latter turned romantically to his younger brother)! Additionally, for a gangster flick, there are valuable little moves to talk, and none are in any way memorable (although a clinic is extremely well managed); In addition, Francesco De Masi's account service can be, but nothing else. By the way, the rental housing DVDs start at half as none of the players, even the movie's name, is listed!
