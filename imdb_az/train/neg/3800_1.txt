It's not an easy task to name a strange piece of cinematic history, though it's a lot of candidates, but it's been a personal favorite for Nemesis 2 since I've seen it. The next day we had to rent again. Again, I laugh, I'm rolling in the ground. (It only happens when you see Monty Python's "Antarctic Skoosh"). <br /> <br /> Throughout the whole film, the overwhelming thing-heck-senses, strongly perceives the audience. I find that none of these horny home videos have come to the production stage. The film should be a continuation, but it has nothing to do with the first movie. <br /> <br /> The hero has the same name, but this time "Alex" is a woman, though half of the film is filmed, do not postpone all the muscles and the daggers outfit! <br /> <br /> It is not really a plot, but a scene that's just a long-lasting scene is just so slow and meaningless that it's really something more exciting to say that a scene of discovery. There is almost no dialogue, taking into account its quality, and then suddenly it has come to an end with a sudden movement scene, and a few petrol explosions have taken place. Fortunately, there will never be drill, because there is always a fool and a fraud! <br /> <br /> Horrific films are usually tedious, but Nemesis 2 is very serious and completely unevenly unequal logic is really fun. You will not be disappointed if you sell or even buy this movie!
