I just watched this movie because I was very sorry for Olivier Martinez at SWAT. But this is not SWAT. SWAT was a plot and some likable characters and sense. Bullfighter had none of these. <br /> <br /> Because I do not understand that any kind of goodness can not be, because Michelle Forbes has always played a painful role. <br /> <br /> Here's a poster movie discrepancy. It was not the worst movie of any other. Both gave a lot of credits to the film. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> one.
