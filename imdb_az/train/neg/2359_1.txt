It was estimated that the latest Freddy movie (and more than 10 years) - they were trying to see a good movie. But they have revealed to us that the series is the worst (and says many things). The area had no significance (I do not seriously remember it), all the basic characters idiots (you really want them dead) and Freddy's minds were worse than usual. <br /> <br /> Johnny Depp was the only good thing about short (and funny) scarves on the first ("Nightmare" first). <br /> <br /> I was the last part I saw at a theater (re-calculates Freddy's childhood) 3-D. Well - 3-D is bad - faded colors and focus and going out. And the three flying skull, which I thought was afraid of my thinking, was the opposite of my audience. Everyone laughs. 2-D also deteriorates on TV. Irrational and stupid - it's very boring. Skip again and see "Freddy vs. Jason".
