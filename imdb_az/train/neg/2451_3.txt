This film is deliberately laughing more than anything I've seen. Indeed, if you are a fan of Tolkien, just hire your friends to laugh. I will not be a million people to break his shortcomings ... all this means that the movie (for me at any time) has lost the main points to turn my character (Sam) into a bumbling fool. Shame, shame ... 3/10
