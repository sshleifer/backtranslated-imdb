This film should give reason to IMDB's 0/10 vote. The player is awful, some of them are here, the Carpathian Prophecy! The script seems to have been written in a hurry. On a scene, black christmas escaping behind the scenes, when asked by Buck in the computer graphic, "dan7" means "Daniel 7, SECTION 24." He probably meant VERSE 24, but the filmmakers were abducting this slide. Perhaps the worst part is that the eschatological position of the film is Biblically ineffective. Although many Christian backgrounds support the interpretation of the film, such a comment is wrong in my opinion. To understand these drawbacks, Jim McKeever read "The Christians Doomsday" and George E. Ladd's book, The Second Bible and Bible Study.
