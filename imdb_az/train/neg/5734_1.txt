This is a very bad film that you can not avoid watching, if you continue to explain yourself, 'it can not continue to be unhappy until the end. Just cant. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm scared, really and much, well looked good, no way. <br /> <br /> Acting is evil and all the lines are bad stereotypes. If you're thinking of being a mixture between Ichi Killer and August Underground, it's really going to be a story of sex, blood and violence, and you will not find it in Live Feed.
