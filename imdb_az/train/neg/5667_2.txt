If I had checked this DVD on Netflix after I had checked IMDb, I would have taken a couple of hours of my life. Whenever I see the director of a movie writing it, I doubt it. In this case, the same guy for loans was a "writer and director" - unfortunately, this is an indication of the overall quality of production. There were a few interesting moments (for example, Judy Tenuta's scene reminded Judy-ism of her early comedy rhythms). But it was very small and far from these moments ... I did not see them because the sequence of opening was incomprehensible to me and was not guilty of violence. I knew that after seeing all the parts, I did not see anything that could help me. On the contrary, at least, who knew who would be important later in the characters. The "Yarn Camera" method is often used and is basically meaningless. I talked to myself on the television screen: "What?" or "For kindness, let it be!" Not recommended.
