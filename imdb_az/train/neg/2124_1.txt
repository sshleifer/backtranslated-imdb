This film is based on the story of Eddi, who hosted his former comrades in a seaside society. The area also includes a friendly group, as Eddie points out that Eddie is leaving as a means to deal with a friend's death when he feels a responsibility. However, this is a weak choice in production and is uncertain as it is not fully implemented. Scenarios should not always "talk", but at least they should contribute to the story's development. Here's a line trying "just like it" or "knowing that you do not have the love in your heart" just because it's a worthwhile thing to the audience. Also the writer cuts a musical assembly of the hero who goes through areas for any indie mood music when it feels a loss to go next time. Talk about working hard. If you're interested in a good movie, it's not just for style and style that gives you style.
