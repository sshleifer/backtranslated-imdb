This movie offers nothing to anyone. It does not succeed at any level. The player is a terrific, long-wave dribble. Of course, the length of the last sexual scene was trying to shock, but the goal of the film was to stop the parody. Completely debris, I do not believe what this ridiculous film is. <br /> <br /> I am very convinced that Rosario Dawson ended up in this movie, which would have been a disappointment for the NC-17 movie. The film will not reach any adult, as the film is an obscure episode of the movie or something aimed at teens. Disappointing.
