First, I can not tell why I was renting this movie because I was still confused ... <br /> <br /> Air Ragei resembles any movie I saw that an airplane was stolen. Of course, there is an important person on the plane and a kidnapper seeking revenge. Sad to say, some methods have already been used in other films to stop the kidnapping. <br /> <br /> This is a glorious film on the lid, though, for the Ice-T (for some inexplicable reasons, it does not make c) As a stewardess, shown by five 'smashers' by the smuggler, she loves less than the incredible Kim Oja. <br /> <br /> It was said that only Seinfeld was Steve Hitner, known as Kenny Bania. <br /> <br /> I like my favorite <br /> <br /> <strong> </ font> </ font> <br /> <strong>. <br /> <br /> When my wife comes to my wife, I can say one thing - one thing. <br /> <br /> About this movie, I spent about 100 minutes paying for electricity and electricity for the start of the TV and VCR. <br /> <br /> And the title - the DID movie goes through the air. <br /> <br /> So, the only Rage movie in the film is less than the audience. <br /> <br /> So, if you're in a mood to separate a movie, that's bad. Please save yourself and do not choose it.
