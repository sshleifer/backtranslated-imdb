The "math" aspect is just a trick to trying to separate this television show from millions of other police demonstrations. <br /> <br /> If I signed up for this show, though, after being expelled from the Northern Exposure (realistic), it's just Rob Morrow, the backward aspect of this show. <br /> <br /> In an episode of "The Mathematics" aspect of an elderly show, Lou Diamond is surrounded by an episode with Phillips, which is the final refuge of the demonstration. The mathematician uses some theories about "bubbles" to catch smugglers. Thus, when he sees a suspect in A, B, and C, he gives this long explanation to calculate how he can use the "theory of alienation." <br /> <br /> As a result, when you look at the finished product, he basically took three points and chose one point. right in the middle, "Okay, mathematically, the most likely place to find a refugee is here," he said. At some point, another character says, "Oh, this is the point where the man lives." Is this math? Even when it is not connected to each other ** k ** g-dots !!! This show reminds me that I was working with a mathematical analysis that could do whatever it needed to "support" points from any other complex analysis or groundbreaking agreement. > Only going to show - When you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. They will not wait for the NUMB3RS team in OSUMA ... They use the account, urge an air strike in the middle of the mountains and strike Osama, and it can not draw five kids using a human trunk ... <br /> <br /> Generally, ridiculous television show.
