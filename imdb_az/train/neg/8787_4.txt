When I saw the television commercial, I first heard the White noise. I did not know anything from the beginning. I watched the trader go online and I decided to go and see it. Now that I'm an admirer of films like Sixth Sense, I thought that this movie would give me everything I wanted. There are Michael Keaton in it and it's rocks. Unfortunately, the movie was not delivered. Eighth Scenario or Echoes Stir tried to be and failed. There is a very promising start, but the average is only creeping to repeat itself, and ends with a totally inferior twitch that any monkey can be figured out. Unfortunately, like most "scary" movies these days, it's based on high noise and bangs to compress the audience. This movie could have been more. This is a good idea because it's shameful.
