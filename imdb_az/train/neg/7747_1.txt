The fact that the cover is a painting, as well as those old B-films, should give a warning about the quality of this film. This is not a B movie. This is a D-movie! <br /> <br /> There is no known actor and animals - WOW - the worst info-animation in the last 20 years. <br /> <br /> You see very little of the SCAAARY patience shown on the previous cover. People are screaming, bleeding and dying, and sometimes you see a teeth or tiger paw. That's so amateur! Maybe is worth seeing, because it's so bad. Give it to a friend and say, "This is the best film I've ever seen and wait for their reaction." <br /> <br /> Film is weak to give Spoiler Alert! A SPOILER.
