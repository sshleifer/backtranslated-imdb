Perhaps Alberto Tomba heard someone. An old police officer, an old sky champion, and now also a KORKUNÃ‡ actor. "Alex L'Ariete" was planned to be a mini-television, but Italian television refused to show its channels. Now, I believe, a funny movie. The scenario is simply a fun (a dramatic film), something like a 5-year-old kid's job. Alberto Tomba, in fact, did not believe himself as a police officer; he is totally illogical: the Italian police officers in special cases are busy opening their doors! ("ariete" "ram"). This super man will try to keep a young beautiful girl's life (the actual Italian "small" television show, married to singer Eros Ramazzotti): beautiful, but indecisive in the toy. Lose it and give yourself a blessing. A shameful film for the Italian cinema industry: John Travolta just came in Earth Attack.
