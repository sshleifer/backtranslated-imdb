I really do not know what to start. I can not recall seeing most 'actors' in a film that was really terrible, moving in this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that: I believe that even children know that when someone is shot, they deal with blood. However, when one person was shot in Snitch (!!) times, there was no blood. <br /> <br /> You can look at some of the movies. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that the shootings of this film continue for several days. This movie should be without a doubt below 100.
