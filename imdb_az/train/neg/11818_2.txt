A psychopath on a distant planet is carried out by a cosmic priest. He releases a few friends and leaves a prison on a spaceship. They entered a sad spacecraft that placed a supernova star in orbit. This mass work is filled only by three people, probably the film's budget has not hired many actors. In any case, to trim a long story short, the three happiness ends with the baddies in the cat and the mouse game. <br /> <br /> The psychopath in this film is fascinating because it is frustrating. 'Slimming' is generally lunatic - unhinged, scary, dangerous, but not 'boring', but it means. Three giant ship managers are seriously controversial of providing such important roles - the ship is practically the size of a city! Given that the film is about 50 years in the future, it will be somewhat optimistic for the existence of such a great human craft, and never forget that it will not be used for such a relatively secular task. Despite the huge size of the spaceship, the crew is overwhelmed with embarrassment, small rooms and dining rooms consist of plastic table and chairs. But there are many corridors. <br /> <br /> The film is moving very well and is a fantastic aphthian triller. But there is nothing great.
