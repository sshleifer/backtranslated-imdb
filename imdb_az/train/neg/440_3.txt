** GREAT USE ** article: Mia (Helin) returns home from Stockholm to the village of Rättvik to celebrate her 70th birthday. She is the youngest child and two sisters, Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petren). Eivor is a family and still lives in Rättvik, and Gunilla divorced and moved away from the city. Mia is still alone and cares for her career. There is a lot of jealousy and hatred and confrontations between sisters almost have conflicts with each other, and each one has personal problems that are difficult to handle. As the party continues (and alcohol consumption), more secrets are emerging and more conflicts are emerging. <br /> <br /> Comments: This film has been disappointed to be the new writer / director's work, the great Swedish comedy / See the same tracks for drama to follow for many years. Indeed, there are no new elements or ideas. This film is based on three main areas. 1) Those who characterize humor only by character are deceived by themselves. 2) Sorrow and 3) Anxiety. This action stands on the last movie, and almost forget the first point in the movie. There is no loss, because the humor there is not funny. Outsides are good, perhaps losing all the pain and forgetting. There were hopes that new ideas and impressions would have happened, but nothing happened. To understand this, there are better ways to spend more time watching. <br /> <br /> 3/10
