What is supposed to be a simple general mystery structure with the participation of a dead philanthropist is a tale of a headache about a headache about many characters (a very early actor, Ginger Rogers, who is just the great actor), a killer between a small cast of residents in a luxurious apartment building. These symbols are obviously foolish. As a cheap, low-budget producer, most of the action talked about Rogers and his leading men (some of whom were 'not really sucked' when I was), about a variety of crime-related issues, and was cut off by an absurd detective. Honestly, I had not had a worse time watching this old-fashioned movie, and I saw some real leaders. <br /> <br /> Previously, butler did not do that because there was no butler. However, draw attention to the person closest to an idol. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
