This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I've ever seen. This is a fun thing to do with stomach cramps and hand labor. The film begins badly (I'll bring the first few minutes of the movie to 1/10) and then it's getting worse, and minutes later. The only way to evaluate it can be a kind of negative number one spiral that grows for up to ninety minutes. Unfunny is not a real word, but best describes the humor in this video. In any way, the video manages to make even cute, disgraceful women dressed up and sexually strange and unpleasant. This movie is strange. Besides listening to this movie, it would be better for TTANIC to repeat the theme and pull Buscemi's character ESCAPE FROM LA. The series is not bad. If you rent a Troma movie, follow Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock. I would like to ask you to retake Tony Little's data again than see NUKEM TITLE CLASS. Do not take me wrong, it's a kind of criminal offender to shoot this horrible film, and if any movie deserves a terrible award, that's it.
