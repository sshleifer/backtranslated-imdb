<br /> <br /> I watched half of this movie and I love it. <br /> <br /> The first reason is drilling. However, something happens that women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are, and how they do not have the hope, the grass, the magazines, the care of the sick, and the sometimes dead bodies. BORING !!!! <br /> The second reason: There's something unexplained. Many scenes are abducted by random men and stored in a cafe and dedicated to a zombie hunter who interrupts them. Who are these men? What do they know about ill-treatment against patients who are ill? <br /> <br /> For the first time, a few days ago, a few occasions have happened. What we started was never told! How frustrating? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I found women who were disturbed by the story and did not care about the story, the duo was exhausting and inactive. Also, the art of the lid is misleading, and therefore, when it is not clear, this film believes it will be cool. Based on some of the other reviews made by other people on this website, I hired this movie and, for some people, despite the fact that I have a reputation for it, I regret not to rent another movie after which I will be more sure to read two films.
