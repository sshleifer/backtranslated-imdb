This movie is not as good as it all thinks. The actors are at a low level and the story is very funny. I respect the fantasy, but the Lord of the Rings is not a fantasy ... Conan ... fantasy ... THIS DISCUSSION HK-LOWPRICE-ENTERTAINMENT ... Why did they enter this Splatter-language and make things worse? The only good thing is kinematography and cutting work.
