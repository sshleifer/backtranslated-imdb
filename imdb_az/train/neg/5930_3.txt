Hey, <br /> <br /> If Leonard Cohen is trying to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen! Why is it full of Leonard enough to frustrate the spectator who explains why he is wondering why other singers (some of whom are doubtful) are curious to talk to themselves? Puleeze .... sounds like their relaxed daily entrances - what about Leonard who cares about you? Whatever you do, "do something worthy" maybe someone will make a document about you. In particular, they insulted the parade of the U2 members, as it would be credible for this film. Leonard does not need to mention the morality of Bono or Edge. Cinematographers would be good to embody a portion of their spirituality through the film. Gee, what an understanding! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> According to Qafqazinfo, you!
