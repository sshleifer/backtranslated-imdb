Commenting on a word written by the daughters of Lisey, even on this site, was the stupid movie I've seen, it was funny, how to sit there and just a movie is the best movie that can be the most stupid thing I have ever heard, I can rest assured and I can go to "Boo" and it will skip you, but it's not a good reason to write a movie or to get a movie, but not a movie "at the end of everything." What would be the film if it did not resemble each other, so half of the film is not a movie, not a movie. So, basically, this stupid girl praises them to finish the movie, and I love how young people today have given media and producers such high standards. The political system of this country will not be able to move away from what they want, there is something like this in our country, and if that girl really can move forward one day, what will happen is a scary idea. Get a life and once you watch a real movie, try something like Shawshank Redemption or Waterfront or something like this and do not comment that it's "boring" after seeing it, just a little bit of using your little brain what God gave you for analysis.
