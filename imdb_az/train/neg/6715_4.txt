If it is not experienced, I went to the theater wanting to rest for 90 minutes. I was neither entertaining nor inspired. This film can not do what it wants and ends quite long. There are a few comic strips and some amazingly ambitious movie references (The 400 Blows - for this character! Not all characters are treated with respect, but more than thirty gays all get worse: all predatory, greasy, sad, rubbing. Instead of being in a mood for a movie you are watching Instead of Late Opinion, Long-Term Partners, Cunning, Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia. <br /> <br /> Thank you. <br /> <br />
