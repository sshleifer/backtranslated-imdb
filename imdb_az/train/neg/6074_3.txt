What a bad movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes will be related to something like that. If you want to make a movie that is playing baseball and baseball scenes, at least make sure the action looks somewhat realistic. Why did he make up the ring for a while without a reason? *** WHAT SPOILER *** And what was the final scene in the movie ....? We believe that DeNiro has found a way to the field through a jury's uniform and that the game is overwhelming. One of the worst scenes in a sports movie. 10 to 3 stars.
