I have been a fan of the premier episode without A Trace. Indeed, last week I can not express my disappointment in the episode. This is a problem that is continuing to deal with many African-American families. The lack of media coverage in the first 48 hours has been documented by a recent study. Law enforcement officials, including local, provincial and federal officials, are also charged. What was the purpose of advertising and ending this topic? As you can see, television can deal with almost any topic. It's ashamed. Do not go together or try again.
