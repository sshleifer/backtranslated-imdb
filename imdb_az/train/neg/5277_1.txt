I held this night in Showtime and liked how a movie with such an interesting structure was incredibly terrible. WHO IS YOUR DADDIR? stars Brandon Davis is a geek who inherits the inheritance of a porno empire issued by her biological parents. Although the film is very fun, for the first time, director Andy Fickman is undermined by a clich√© and predictable screenwriter and direct-to-video standards, even without doing badly. Even traditional comic Charlie Talbert turns out to be a surprisingly boring performance as his best friend. Ali Landry is just a good part of this bare and unfunny duck. 1/10
