"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of Charlie's 1915 Essenay films. Although this film band is more popular than its 1914 colleagues, it is a little lower on average. The baker is a pillow, classic Chaplin moments, with a double tape locked vaulted hook and Charlie's head lying in the mood of a mop, blowing his lady's hair with a lucky chance to wake up. These are the beginning and the end of the binary. A bank falls into a bank to win his daughter by fighting with a mid-caretaker watchman. Mop is probably the biggest physical force of this film, and Charlie uses it as an expert comedy, though not the intention of his character. Mop would not have done with his own hands while doing things that Charlie could do. There are some interesting things but better.
