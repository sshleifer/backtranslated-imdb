It's just like watching this movie and almost wasting 2 hours of my life, but I think it's all about a good thing. <br /> If I take it as a movie, I get 1 or 2 peaks, but it's down I value the budget as ind. The film can be 3 or 4. It was a film that was 'full' and had to be very bored or deprived of time. This is not a movie. But many independent films have demonstrated filmmaking and, as you can see, there are a few things in this movie. If I commented on how the directors should approach the next project, there were some qualities of negative sound effects. They also create a few characters, but the characteristic building is very long because it is very important for the main part of the film. In the next project, what is the continuation of long-term hikes? I think this movie is trying to be part of everything (artistic space, suspense, and plot) and nothing happens (not so much) <br /> This movie works hard and very hard, and maybe a short movie. <br /> <br /> There are many unusual things happening in this movie. The story should be simplified. I know that there should be some secret in this movie, but it's no secret that the killer is a little surprise. The story behind the "mysterious" does not really attract the attention of the film. <br /> <br /> For this reason, I would like to say that this film is a great attempt, but it is not. I hope the directors learn from their mistakes and produce better products the next time. <br /> <br /> If you do not have the interest to learn about producing low-budget movies, you do not have to watch it. <br /> <br /> Others say that many of the 10 films featured in this film are people involved in the film. This film was unable to give away the "10" from any remote objectively.
