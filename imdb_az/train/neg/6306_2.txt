While working in a video store, I started seeing a few films and sometimes trying to watch some great movies. Proud was one of them. The first idea of ​​the story of the first black cruise ship during World War II was a blessing. In less than 10 minutes watching the film, the main focus of the film is to say that there is foreign tension in World War II. The story is about ship, crew and their exploits in war. This key point is thrown into the extremes throughout the film. Thanks to the USS Mason men for their hardships and their triumphs. One should pay attention to the successes of a film, these men, the Navy and their country, and not to a film about racism during the Second World War.
