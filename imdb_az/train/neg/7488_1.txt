Everyone who has seen the original 1970 movie knows how to write a manuscript, script and director's comedy masterpiece. According to the same information, on the contrary, it is possible to create another insipid Hollywood bore-a-thon! This movie was miserable! If it were not for John Cleese (funny genius), I'd spend about 15 minutes in this terrible loss of this attack. <br /> <br /> Neil Simon would not write another version of this version <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis have done such a great job that the original did they think? How do the director and editor view this scene, and was any of them funny? I do not know, but what I know is not surprising, why it's even more popular with foreign and independent films .......
