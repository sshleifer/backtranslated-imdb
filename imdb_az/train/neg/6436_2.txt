I'm a good person, so I gave this movie 2 instead of 1. Without a doubt, it was the worst movie I've ever seen. There were very few plotting and more interesting areas, that is, Jesus really wanted to know us, shattered, and instead gave us severe visual doses of a faithful sentence given to our heroes (Arquette). In the first 15 minutes, the total crucifixion would be more humanistic to his character and to the audience. There was a variable player and the direction was missing. And once I saw a dove or a flying dove towards the camera, I could have begun to make Patricia even more loud.
