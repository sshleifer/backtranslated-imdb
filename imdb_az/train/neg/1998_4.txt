In my guest room No, No, Nanette has a dub on a tape on a tape soundtrack and he listened to the non-stop. Finally, after I have completely surrendered to my brain, I want the songs to be irresistible, especially to be popular and happy, but I can not be happy ... But I did not know what was going on in the film that was negative to film art. So, one day I saw a copy of my video store and hired a long-lost version of the movie. I thought it would be nice, because the noise is so sweet. Unfortunately, most of my favorite songs were not found on the video I'm seeing. I have never seen the 1930 version of the music now, but it's silent, because it's not too little singing and practically no dance, and its sound really bad and did not really understand what people really said. Most of the time. Indeed, the only point of this film was the ugly 1940s fashion. Nanette feels like a rabbit ears with this terrific hat and Kansas Kitty keeps it in his forehead and then has this strange feathered pillow wrapped in a net finish. A dance sequence, along with Nanette, makes this strange ballet stuff a bit strange with the pin-up girl description she puts on her. In fact, the brightest place in the film was Guillesse, and he was dreaming of becoming a great artist, but at the moment he was condemned to pin-up girls for money. I like how Guillespe is keeping an old school and is sold for $ 5250 by Nanette, Nanette, a fabric to make her kingship and career. Does that piece not realize that it is immortality? Silly rabbit / girl with ears of birds on the hat. When will you learn? Why does not he handle only one cigarette before the advertisers get the job done?
