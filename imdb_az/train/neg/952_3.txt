Happy Go Lovely is to lose everyone's time and talent, including the audience. The old hat may inadvertently pardon the identity of a person and the scandal of the lie. Very few people watched these films for their field. But, in general, there were some interesting little characters dealing with subplots - not here. They usually had exciting choreography and breathtaking dance and attractive songs. Happy Go is not Lovely. And as a female presenter, Vera-Ellen played the entire movie as a second banana, and was called to shoot a film instead and could not do it. The place of the Scottish was wasted. Usually there are no Scottish blocks that go automatically. Photograph was on foot. Music numbers were on foot. Cesar Romero has played the role of producer frequently written by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou for his professional performance and chewed up the scene because nobody gave his part. David Niven is good, and David Niven, David Niven, could not do anything. At the end of the day, I love Niven, enough to spend 90 minutes in Happy Go Lovely. If not, skip it.
