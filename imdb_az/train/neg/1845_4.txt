Losing Control is another suggestion of erotic tension that can be regarded as pulp fantasy in the film world. In most cases, they include a jumbled route for deadly intentions, with interspersed by many hatred. Kim Ward (Kira Reed) suffers from the writer's block. Only accidentally (or o) he meets a person who deals with more risky sexual encounters (Doug Jeffery). The man refuses to disclose any information about himself, but who refuses to stop it. His agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott), believes that he will do miracles for his book sale. As with most of these types of films, denouement is nearing the end, but some things are not added. I think that I've seen enough of these films, then there is no change - but I love them. <br /> <br /> The performance of the presentation varies. Doug Jeffery is like a psycho / sociologist you do not want to skip. Kira Reed looks good, but she does not like the woman in danger. Clay Greenbush did not agree with the latter as PI. <br /> <br /> Finally, a careful note about the DVD you are considering. Both the implicit and the disk condition are R-rated and the processing time is 93 minutes, but the processing time is less than 86 minutes. This is probably the reason why sexual intercourse has not been interrupted and why Jennifer Ludlow is about to be cut off shortly after the beginning. 4 stars.
