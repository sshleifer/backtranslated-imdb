Terrifying player, sneaky assassination, a stupid story and only sneers up this shimmering piece around a terrible film. It was a delight to sit in the past. Just horrible. Do not waste a penny on it. Film cinemas should really feel bad about leaving this movie to watch. This "horror" film was at least scary, creepy or uncomfortable. He had never resorted to a vision in any way. The actor was totally destroyed during the actor / actress who opened the mouths of an attempt by all actors to draw you through a dialogue. Moreover, the whole story, I do not know anyone will shoot a movie with this story. Do not lose your time or money. Do not expect this movie for a moment even though this is a free ticket. You will want to watch it.
