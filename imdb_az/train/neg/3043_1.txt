This movie should be a "tiring" tale about Santa Claus and his "magic and mystical" miracles. But instead, it is obviously creepy. In my opinion, this horror film has two things: 1) Santa's appearance. Have you ever seen Santa Claus ever more terrifying? and 2) "Devil's Fat" Pitch's just strange dances are hard to watch. You can only watch this movie if it has an MSTed version or if you are not very laughing. I do not think it's a kid's movie.
