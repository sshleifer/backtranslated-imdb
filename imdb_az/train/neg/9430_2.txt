I was also fooled by packaging. I also went to the horrible packaging and the DVD box, "as sad as fans of every copy are pulled from the shelves". Although it's cheap ($ 6.99), it's really not worth it - no fear and very limited. The latter was very unattractive, and he did not have the necessary punch. How do I actually know how much it works "Video Nasty"? The story is drifting, the characters are amateur amateurs ... they do not fulfill the word. The DVD premium feature ("Interview") is as strange as the director looks very incredible and not all of them. The main role player speaks as seen in Shakespeare's production. This is a great laugh.
