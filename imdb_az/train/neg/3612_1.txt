Splatter U is very poorly prepared - the story is stupid, characters are thrown away, and the whole movie is not the essence of imagination. No doubt, there is no tension or atmospheric or intimidation. This driving is not brave enough to throw any nudity (for all the cheapest excitement). Thus, this infinite defective slasher does not offer anything fun (even cheap laughs) around and it's just a hole. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
