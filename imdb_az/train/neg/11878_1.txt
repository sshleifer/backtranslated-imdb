Indeed, when it comes to film, this movie is not only funny. Josh Kornbluth is a funny antithesis and he still thinks he is funny. Joshin was pre-arranged in connection with sending 17 letters until he could enter into every scene, "look at me, I'm logical". Judas Priest's joke could have been the most fun thing for me, and that's a bit of a joke because of all the other jokes in the movie. As for the incredible superiority of Pixies's "Debosher," I have something to say: what did Pixies do for a fate like this? What did everyone do to make Josh Kornbluth write / drop / star in such a horrible movie?
