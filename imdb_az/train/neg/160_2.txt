All those in this story would like to love this castle, the fan of "Buffalo Bill", "Wild Bill Hickok" and "Disaster Jane!" As Gary Cooper's leading role-player, he added to his confusion and sounded very well. <br /> <br /> There is no concern ...... When I looked at myself for 40 minutes, I looked at my death. Jean Artur's character was a bit uncomfortable, and James Ellison just did not look or act like the Buffalo Bill. Cooper did not sound very good. <br /> <br /> Several days ago she hit her head as an actor. <br /> <br /> He also wasted western shots. Go upstairs and watch another watcher because most of them are better than ever.
