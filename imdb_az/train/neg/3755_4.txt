I like this movie, I'll accept it. I've seen the best (straight)? Video should be a movie. Yes, my friend and I gave sparks because we were talking about leasing this movie. We knew what we were expecting, and we got exactly what we expected and more. It was beautiful (hysterically, of course) when it was glued to the tree by the red neck Sasquatch, about three or four times we were watching this part. And why? Oh, why is the main character going so far? Honestly, we know that because you are in danger, so much will not help. But if you really are in this movie, the local video store is NOT IT. It's worth the money and it's not as bad as it's bad, but it's incredibly bad. If you rent this movie, you will be absolutely fine.
