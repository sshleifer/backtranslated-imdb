All fighter people are working on Miike and his work. I sat down in the evening tonight. <br /> <br /> I thought it would be better than Rwing than I could ever think of in order to be careful about these ideas. <br /> <br /> I'm all about finding the next great director (or writer), but Miike is nothing. I do not have NYU Fine Arts Masters, but I know very well that a horror movie has to be pacing. <br /> <br /> The pacing of this film shook my head. Some of the scenes closest to the end drifted very badly, and I went to the refrigerator and stayed there while Kou Shibasaki looked at the camera for a minute, eyes wide and mouth agape. A famous director once claimed and I am paraphrasing, a camera camera can be turned into a beautiful woman conversion and roll. Kou is not a good actress enough to do this job. She looks at the undead girl in good health, rather than remembering. And it is not the only man who shows himself in the lanterns; other cast members feel that it's imperative to imitate this non-performance. <br /> <br /> I love Asian cinema. <br /> <br /> <strong> Love asian cinema. Hong Kong's actions over the past 30 years, the Anglo horrors such as "Phone" and "Coma", Ang Lee's work, some of the Filipino films full of non-sex and freedom, as well as others. I could do without Çakuşin Ari.
