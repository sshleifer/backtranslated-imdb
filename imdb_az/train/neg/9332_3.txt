This is not really a terrible film, and Glenn and Keitel are top-notch actors. Additionally, they are doing a good job with a very weak script. Decoration is aquatic and the plot has some interesting twists. Additionally, I hope these actors and crew prepare for the movie, they are professionals and pay for it. But do I wonder if studios spend time and money to shoot a movie and then leave it for theater audience? Although the film has a cash register, it definitely gets some money. If you are an admirer of Keitel or Glenn, rent a video or keep it on TV. It seems to me that the film does not help solve the immigration problem with Mexico, but the practice is better than 90% of the standard. Today's TV right.
