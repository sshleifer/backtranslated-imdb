I do not want to join Pallbearer, it's not too bad, but very slowly. As the film continues, it is a bit more interesting, but there is nothing splendid. I love David Schwimmer and I think it's good here. I am not a great Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but sometimes I'm crying and here. Pallbearer is not a highly recommended movie, but you like the potential if you like it.
