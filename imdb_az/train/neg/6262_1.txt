I agree with what I read here, and I do not have the words to define a Turkic like this, but in spite of everything, there are some reasons for this. Are you enjoying the happy days where the video is a nice job and just one movie movie to fill the shelves of video stores? this movie comes from that era, and this is one reason why many, many, many other stinkers have happened. Do you remember Rambo's imitations? and many of the Z classes are slashers? I still feel nostalgia for that time. I can say that I did not waste my time because I pressed the fast forward for the first time in fifteen minutes. a comic scene that puts a person's bang on the ax against an ax, because it was perfectly made of plastic. And last, well, so bad film was shot and I did not understand what it was. In the same way, I did not follow a single plot that does not exist. But the child was a big age, despite the age of Video-Age.
