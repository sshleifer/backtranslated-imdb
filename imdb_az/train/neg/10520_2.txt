The angels, a little icky, were banned from paradise, and now they live in an English forest where they are beaten and infected. Talk about high concept. Now this little mom is giving Tom Savini, but his five-minute presence will take a long time since the player is limited to a two-minute screen. The angels escape on a bare beach for most of the film, but even though an angel can look at his corpse, his face looks like a bad day, as Joan Rivers. Moving and amateur gore-effects do not help, and night scenes are reminiscent of Paris Hilton's most popular movie. It's really bad that's bad.
