This movie was terrible. The end was terrible. There was no movie in the movie. A decent thing about the movie was the move made by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were very good! The only problem was that the actors did not make their performances unfair. If the scenario was close to a half-worthy story, it should be followed. Instead, the performance of Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones is a god fearful event ... or the lack of them is completely wasted. There was nothing else to do in the movie for something to do with the movie ... a good real movie ... is not a complete dialogue between the characters because it is absolutely no reason. There was nothing more than the general dialogue that took place during this period. There was nothing special about any characters. Robert DuVall was the only thing he described as a smug, dark, drunk, old man. Nothing is worthy of the last movie. When I finished the movie, I was amazed ... I was surprised to be sitting in the whole movie while waiting for something to interest the movie. Never happened! The protagonist of the heroes suddenly began to realize that the film was really over and I understood that I watched two hours of my life watching a movie that was totally undefined and meaningless. It was not even a story. The whole film is worth a day. This is so. One day the people in Paradise were in a yard (and death) one day. What kind of story can happen on a day (other than Film Training Day)? It was good that all the players were playing, but the film was so disappointing ... you can even say a movie.
