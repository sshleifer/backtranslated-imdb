The first ten minutes of this film about the production of an international film in Belgium is beautiful: you see a real chaos on the set, a producer on the edge of the nervous breakdown, the director (Mickey Rourke), the evil star, and so on. You've seen everything before, but good things have been done. But after that! The film repeats itself only: The remaining ten minutes are repeated again. No rise, no dramatic progress, good action, or even worse, just goes on. Mickey Rourke has twice as good a moment as his character has a reality and artistic scene. Generally, this is a 12-minute minute walk. <br /> <br />
