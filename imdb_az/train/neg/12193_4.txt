"Look, I know that it can now be narrow, but the pain is temporary, the movie is eternal, and what you do now is burnt in celluloid all the time and for thousands of years." ?? Robert De Niro <br /> <br /> At the outset, for director Steven Spielberg, the director is more appropriate to tune his scenario to the scenario of several scenarios. So, we have an unemployed family, recently dropped out of prison, threatened by a nasty monster in the form of Robert De Niro. "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "War of the Worlds" is a lawyer who can not afford to defend De Niro during the trial of animals, animal ancestors to defeat non-functional family pets. <br /> <br /> In the Spielberg fashion, the father kills the deceased violinist, and then immediately releases his sins. <br /> <br /> Spielberg's father, as a result of almost every "father" figure in Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and Spilberg, eventually left his photo, Martin Scorsese, who wants to try his hand at the cost. Finally, the worst movie in Scorsese's filmography, and ultimately, the most intense. <br /> <br /> An artist's failures or misconceptions are often explicitly disclosed, revealing the inner work of his art. When the story does not work, the characters are not identical or invisible, and we leave ourselves to some kind of internal core. What is this? The rest of the carcass - what about the director's film? Now, "Cape Fear" is an unusual movie, so the rest of the Scorsese movie will not have a thematic relationship with "me!" De Niro yells, but the movies are Catholic redeeming themes cookie cutter). What is the film, which shows how the filmography focuses on the foundation. Scorsese looks at how his camera is retreating, looking at progress, looking at the tension and how his characters are high, and looking down on the guard and the windows as a zooms to try to scream. But more importantly, you can watch the movie does not mean spatial. At the end of the film, the boat is usually set on an open-air scene, the street walk is claustrophobic and does not appear in a wider context, and the family's home does not appear anywhere. In the picture, there is simply nothing geographically, Scorsese can not shoot movies in space or create any spatial environment. <br /> <br /> This is because the Scorsese camera is always connected and closely linked to its central character. In order to be meaningful around the character, his camera should focus on the character. Resnais can take you around a French Hotel, down the street from Welles and Hitchcock, and you can dance up to a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can give you an alien desert planet, Many directors can create a "close-shot shot shot" combination in the manual, but Scorsese can not do that. There is no material place in his films, no poetry. He is about the nature. If you break that cycle, you're leaving the boxing ring, taxi boat, you're away from De Niro and everything breaks down. <br /> <br /> Scorsese has tried to fix this problem with the New York Group because it can not go away from the multi-documental shooting style. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <span style = "color: red;">> 5 / 10 ?? Like the general B movie, this is ugly, vulgar-looking movie. Look at matt pictures, do not strain in tension, crazy rotorscoped special effects and hockey fistfight showdown. Perhaps we can not take the silence of Robert De Niro. De Niro, who gave his body Tattooed Messi as Scorsese, gives the film a beautiful scene. In the romantic sequence of young Juliette Lewis, she starts kissing her start. <br /> <br /> However, a symbolic rape that De Niro coincided with excitement, which can not be imitated by Scorsese, runs out of a girl, and is in line with this man's interests. To do this, you need someone's operative tone and baroque visuals like De Palma. But Scorsese? Nope. <br /> <br /> It is worth a look at.
