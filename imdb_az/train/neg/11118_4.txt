It's probably a humor, a fast moving story, quitting all the loudmas, and so on. It is a secret character. If it's a popular thing, you could not shoot a movie with that name but something like "white" PC would be considered racist by the police. <br /> <br /> However, Woody Harrleson, like a white man who is a good player, is not as good as black basketball players, as his main ally, Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br/> Snipes had many funny worthy lines, which provided much of the humor. The worst part of the film is that it does not bother many people - it's too much blasphemy and sleaziness of all the characters. Rosie Perez's Woody's girlfriend. There are no really good people in this movie. That's why I do not advise honestly at least those who are dealing with the movie and friends who are dealing with many curses
