I used a watchman's perspective not to spend a long cold hour helping to build a family home for illness to see a family home. All of the beautiful rock landscaping was erased, a magnificent rock pavement and front fountain were removed, all the pine trees and pike trees were cut off, the sprinkler system was removed. It looks like a disaster area now. They live more ... They live in "the city" and only come out at the weekend. I am concerned about thinking about the great people of the Oklahoma people who have donated these people and think about the consequences. The story we saw on television was not entirely true ... We do not believe everything you see and hear.
