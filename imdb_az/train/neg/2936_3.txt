I also enjoyed the high 8.5 rating for this movie, and I was very disappointed. I had seen a few good foreign films and hoped in three successive, but not. I went with a Spanish-speaking friend who felt the same way. If so, there are not many areas. I do not really need a movie, but I need to entertain or bring it in a way. Best of all, I would say that it was a very small ensemble, but she wanted to be Altman-esque. Of course, there are moments, but for a few minutes you can easily slim easily with 97 minute moments. I do not understand the high rating of this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong>
