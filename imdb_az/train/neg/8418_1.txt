Yes, there are great speeches here. Unfortunately, they happen in the context of a movie that appears to have a clue. During the first 45-60 minutes all music takes place as true performance. Suddenly, in about an hour, the characters they were talking to each other from that point to the point began to read at one another. To make it even more exaggerated, they make a really 15-minute noise dialogue, then leave their ideas and look like something else that begins with the jazz club. a drummer and two electric guitars suddenly turn into a fully orchestrated piece with an unprecedented iron part. In most of these discrepancies about how music is used, it is impossible to record music in the composer's style. The first few pieces imitate the motown voices of the 1950s, while the rest of the film is Broadway show music (bad). Then there is a clean silliness that is part of the band that imitates a bad Jackson family, and part of Eddie Murphy, who transfers to James Brown to Lionel Richie from Little Richard. When I began sewing Stevie Wander, I could not help laughing loudly. It was one of the movies that caused dissatisfaction with how much I spent on earth and lost watch over the two-hour film.
