I liked Batman TV series and really hoped for that. <br /> <br /> Why did they leave me the story they were trying to get out of the baton of Adam West and Burt Ward? I do not want Burt or Adam to look at them now ..... Batman and Rob is 35 years old because of their looks, but they are sadly saddened by their dresses and looking at the badguys battles. It would be better for me to interpret the old stars. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> In my opinion, this is really just a quick look. I would like more fonts. They showed Penguin and Joker a minute, only what I knew. The joker had a mustache under his makeup, and though he hated the penguin, he did not smoke. It was 2 of them. <br /> <br /> I love reading books. I'm sure that there's more to it than this. There were 2 Riddlers or why there were 3 Catwoman or 3 Mister Ice Cream. List Gordon, Chef OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut and others. As I said, those in the union were also difficult. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. And really fragile.
