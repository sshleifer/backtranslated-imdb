Producer / director Stanley Kramer saw Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's very striking scenario? Was there a few tracks left in our goal? And Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? <br /> <br /> Why does a terrific actress, Candice Bergen, accept such a happy role? <br /> <br /> The Domino Principle misses the same foot and mark as a Parallax View or Manchurian Candidate with a very wide margin. A great reprimand by Stanley Kramer.
