First of all, I have to think a lot about writing this article. The best view of this kind of cinema can only be silence. Housewife and grandmother. This film is trying to look "original" and characters must be "real people". The Italians never thought that the characters could be "real": they were just "low-profile" stereotypes. It gives a very bad idea of ​​what life is in the Italian village. The area is weak (what is the plan?) And humor does not make everyone laugh.
