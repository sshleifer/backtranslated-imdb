I did not know if I would laugh or not. Only fans of Danish dirty addiction can be a taste for it. It's supposed to be a movie movie, but it's just a bad thing. The coolest area is a car crash, with the best of Hollywood's best-selling effects. Avoid all costs for this movie. See just how bad a movie is ................
