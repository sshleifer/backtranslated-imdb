Anyone who wrote this "beautiful" story should be friendly to these children. This is even worse for garden wrestling. In fact, this is not wrestling, even a few children hit each other on a trampoline. Each child is about 45 lbs moist, and this is just one of the fun things. If possible, there are some bored children who even call their yards a bad name. If you want to see some entertaining yard wrestling, enjoy the Rear Wrestling Pain for a while. It performs the 2 biggest names in BYW, MDogg20, and Josh Josh. These guys are good. In fact, they have been trained professionally as "real" wrestlers. They went legit and improved. I'm coming to check out those two children. MDogg crazy and hook off. So do not spend your time or money on this awesome DVD, there's a "better" back yard video.
