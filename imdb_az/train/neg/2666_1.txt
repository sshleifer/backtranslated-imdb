honestly, everyone has a brain <br /> <br /> What can you say about this movie 1 There is nothing positive. <br /> <br /> I've rented it for $ 1. Will Smith say, "If you have a dream, you have to protect it," laughing. <br /> <br /> All actors have no boredom or no reputation. even if you wrote Matthew Mc Conahay * in this movie, it was better than all actors when he played a psychological at Texas Chainsaw 4. 4. If you see this movie and say something good, the IQ should be so low that it hits movies in such a bad taste. Thank you ... and the truth is talked about! <br /> <br /> Free yourself from misery. <br /> <br /> Take Satan's rejection, now it's a classic.
