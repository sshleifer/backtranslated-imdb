This must be the stupid movie I've ever seen (advanced spoiler)! First, the plot is foolish. A small child is strange and takes him to the hotel because his father is caring. We see that the child is a "glitter" gift. This gift is nothing with nothing at all in the time, make the kid look cool. The film becomes dull and boring until the guy is finally naked. He continues to rush to kill his child and his wife ... because he feels like that. Why would he do something else? At one point we see a naked woman in the wind. The man is kissing and understands a dead body, completely disgusting. A black man goes into the hotel and is hit with an ax. Then the child and the woman take the tool of the black man and leave the father for a few minutes after the hypothermia. Most of the movies are not full time, but it falls into the same category. Music is musical, the character is subtlety (except for a good actor, Jack Nicholson), the plot is wrapped in and vomiting, the latter is predictable, the sound of the story is slow, tiring and boring. This movie is very overrated. ALL FINANCE IS EVERYTHING. I was surprised that IMDb received such a high rating.
