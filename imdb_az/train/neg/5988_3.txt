The original Thunderbirds TV has earned a place in history. Indeed, all the first 10 minutes of the Wallace and Gromit movie (Wererabbit) are the direct removal of Thunderbirds, the direct duplication of the original Thunderbird 2 startup sequence (if <br /> <br /> This movie was an attempt to create a kid's movie - film shoots, film shoots, movie clips and original episodes, loved and loved by children and adults! In fact, Thunderbirds, Mother Nature or Technology went horribly wrong (yes, there were also many criminal cases) often trapped people Thunderbirds did not put their lives and resources at risk for any rewards - the essence of heroism and sacrifice - some physical violence Thunderbirds protested to some degree of imagination - will one ever dream of setting up Thunderbird 2 one day? <br /> < However, along with that , Many people in Japan are longing for the ancient Astroboy cartoon with human robots. <br /> <br /> But this movie was a poor image of the original. This movie has come across as a meld between Thunderbirds and Loony Tunes - I have Anthony Edwards like Pearl Pig Tricks imitating Brain ????? Most of the activity is a battle of Kung Fu / Power Rangers. There was no doubt that when someone sprinkled with a bowl of bread on top of someone's head, there were funny sound effects. There was no technology to put our dreams - instead, these guys have never been in the real series, running around using the device in no area (all team children leave the base occupied by Brain and take off once). Then, TinTin had a dose of "Force Luke" imagination thrown when he was going to give something or another leverage, "The Crouching Tiger, merged with The Hood, using aerodynamics that seemed to be raised from the Hidden Dragon. Just go to "TinTin, I am your uncle" with a breath mask sound for Hood about something. <br /> <br /> Thunderbirds was unique in its unique heart GONE. <br /> <br /> Rachel Parker's painting was just a brilliant point. But Lady Penelope has acted as a child playing actress - HUH ???? <br /> <br /> So we hate this movie. Someone expects something to be known to a fan base and waits for the fans to earn money to watch, and then provides something that is not close to what the fans are expecting - good luck, sadness, loneliness! Okay, so if they are preparing a baby movie - nice - next time they broadcast it to videos that are broadcasted directly. However, do not pack anything in a familiar package and do not alter the intestines.
