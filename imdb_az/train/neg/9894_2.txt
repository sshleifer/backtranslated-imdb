I missed the start of this movie, so I did not like it very much. On the other hand, I learned Roman's fall in the country for several years, so I know the story. And then maybe because I do not like this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to the film, there are more historical errors. Although it's true, I do not think it's right, so I can be forgiven. It is striking that sometimes, with a very precise accuracy, it becomes clear that it starts to get confused. Antonius's decision to throw Octavia into marriage and then push it out of the two scenes. Why not even serve the purpose of the plot, can not even bring it, and even Octavia does not appear? <br /> <br /> <strong> It's like some of the scenes by Antonius's original name (Marcus Antonius) and calling her strange English name Mark Antony on another scene. <br /> <br /> Despite the historic inaccuracies, the film could have been an entertaining hour if not for the leading lady. There is no decent dignity in it. He is hysterical, dramatic, and totally self-destructive. Instead of the elegant and emerging queen Cleopatra, an angry teenager turns into a bad state of PMS. 95% of them work from refugees, but 5% come from poor writing. The scenario is very stupid dramatic scenes. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you did not watch Antonius and Cleopatra, and you watched versions of Dawson and Joey's "Dawson's Creek" in progress. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch something about this period,.
