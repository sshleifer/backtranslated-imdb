Was our descendant Ramu on earth? Is this person who makes Sarkar, Satya and Comapny? I refuse to believe it. If the AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he skipped the high cliff that had risen to the industry by giving up his biggest works of all time. This film is made to fall as a brick. I was afraid to leave the theater, but I was forced to sit down because I could not get a car from my car before I left. Additionally, I would never have to go beyond the range. <br /> <br /> This film is not close to Sholay. Even a mile does not come close. I love Ramu more than Sholay, because Sarkar is a classic piece of work. I read Ramu's interview a couple of days ago, but the interviewer said that Ramu had no more than 4 hours a day. <br /> <br /> In some of the movies, Amitabh Bachchan does not seem to be scared, along with the shootings of this movie. It looked even worse with a few posters and wallpapers that I've seen before. Ramu's beloved Nisha Kothari did a great job in Sarkar, because there were not many dialog boxes (in fact, it was not clear enough). She opened her mouth in this movie and found a place in history. The new guy playing the role of Jai seems to have a sad look, but Jai did not control his role. <br /> <br /> I promised myself that my pain is great now. <br /> <br /> I promised myself in the movie to see the original Sholai once again. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Terrific movie. Media and critics will prepare Ramu gas. To remind all the readers only, I am one of the greatest Ramu admirers, and I will not spare him for this action.
