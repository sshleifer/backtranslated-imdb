When I give these 3 points I will not give the original Soviet version of this movie. Apparently, American-International (a studio specializing in ultra-low budget expenditure in the 1960s) took the movie and completely destroyed it - turning a two-hour film into a 64-minute movie! Moreover, more than 64 minutes are new material (like "monsters") - so you know that this movie is not the same as the original. The original film looks like a very dramatic drama about the Soviet conquest - though I'm not sure what really happened! She reviewed the story of Steven Nyland to give her an idea of ​​the original film - it was very useful. By the way, I saw that the third Soviet movie film did not cost a dollar more than a standard film on a "new" movie - a company that wanted to give something on the screen after purchasing an American-International hacked one. First place! This American film was two rival world countries (not US and Soviet) who wanted to be the first on Mars. Hardly "bad guys" work unsuccessfully and "good guys" rescue one of the righteous astronauts, and then move to Mars. Unfortunately, they are temporarily closed for a month on Mars. Here they see some monsters (sometimes by American-International). There are some cats and similarities to a certain part of an anatomy of a woman. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> </ font> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> movie. So the Soviets really had a reason to hate America! I'm not shocked by the terrible thing I did with this movie because they did not refuse to sell more movies to these movies! It is worth a look at a laugh, but the laughs are few and far between really bad moments. Thus, the film is a dudo - bad film enthusiasts and should be taken seriously on the dip. I really would like to see this movie in its original form - it should be a picture.
