Since this book is true to the book, we only think the author's history is ignorant. Mark Anthony never died in battle. He died of a cowardice by committing suicide, and even asked his slave to do so for him. The slave chose to kill himself. The real story is that Mark Anthony is ashamed of his slave's great valor and decided to copy it. But Mark Anthony in death was also a drunken failure and failed to commit suicide. He called Cleopatra and bleeds to him. He dropped into the rings of the garbage and Mark Anthony died a little later. If you want to, history does not watch this movie. If you want romantic drivel, then you will probably enjoy it!
