There is nothing wrong with recommending this movie. Although Chase Masterson can always look and act truly, this clunker wastes his role. Unfortunately, the remainder of the remainder varies from bad to moderate. In many of these films, someone will shine through the material and mark them for future reference. There is no such chance here. The kids are a clich√© monster, a flick, a monster, a man in a rubber suit back in the days of Paul Blaisdale, one after another. a little humor could have made it even worse, but everyone made a deadly dull article, there was a twist or two, but since then you've never been interested.
