Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and I am happy to see one of their films. Basically a man in a horn factory is the fourth to crack and soon enough all the horn noisy cracks. He is staying at Stan's home with Stan, calming down, and coming to check out Dr. James Finlayson's phones. Once the sanitary and electrical energy has been exhausted, after a caretaker mechanic has been implanted, the doctor comes to the inspection and after some tests, it is advisable to drink goat milk and take offshore air in the ocean. After leaving Stan, when he played a trumpet, he closed the window to the phone and made a car accident, he and a boat were hired. They keep a boat on the dock to give a goat milk, and Stan brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, on the front page of the paper, Killer writes that Nick Grainger runs through the boat rope when he runs away from the Escaped Prisoner (Richard Cramer) and runs to the boy's boat while goat and goats. They see their places in the morning and Killer demands something to eat, and Stan and produzu produce fake foods, e.g. spaghetti string, soap for cheese, belt for bacon, sponge for dumplings and forcing them to eat. When Strangling started to drown, Stan freaked out, and the English anger hit him on the Killer and continued until the day the police came in, only the US's anger put them in jail. There were moments of comic comedy, but it's not a big black and white movie. "No, there's another wonderful mix you've got with me!" In the 100s, there were 60 numbers, 100 Quotes and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy Comedians Comedian 7. Okay!
