<br /> <br /> This film, presented as a continuation of The Full Monty movie about unemployed men in Sheffield, is a fake thing. <br /> <br /> I was born in Sheffield, and I'm very glad that I'm still in town. this movie. Someone said he could be appointed in Oklahoma, and he just finished it for me. It looked like a romantic appearance of the US market in northern England. Probably, many Americans and many South Africans do not realize that Sheffield's urbanized culture is a large city with nearly half a million inhabitants. In the Giants, he was depicted as a semi-peasant small town with a dead-end dead end, where everyone in Sheffield went inside the same old square and danced in some village square of a public opinion. Sheffield men in the working class were different from colleagues who lost their lives in general, and generally communicated with each other and talked briefly. Dry words. <br /> <br /> Even in the bakery, even in rural conditions, they looked alien to me. I knew a few places in the trip, but some of the pylons that came from the logical scene reminded Wales more. Indeed, at the end of my loans, I made reference to Wales, Wales. In the summer, Peak District travels with hikers and tourists in cars. Located between the two big cities. <br /> <br /> It is not some desert. <br /> <br /> The young woman's love and lover, Pete Postlethwaite, was ridiculous and when it came to the idea that only one man could sleep. The reasons for being her lover never seemed to be clear. None of the men have been shown to be partners or families; <br /> <br /> Everyone who wants to see a film about Unemployed Sheffilders has been misled. <br /> <br /> This Sheffield is available only in the minds of middle-class writers and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> This was a great fake! <br /> <br />
