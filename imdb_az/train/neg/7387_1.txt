The DVD was a joke, the first few minutes of the sounds were afraid of the synchronization sound, and Segals sounds like that! I'm sorry! <br /> <br /> If 5-minute audio sync is good, poorer sites, lines, and actors should get something else, because no movie business should be. <br /> <br /> Segal <br /> <br /> If Segal decides this issue, after returning to hold a better show, <br /> <br /> This movie, it is full of embarrassment and betrayal of those who see it. I stopped him for about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I will ask my money to be returned to Block Buster! Mark, Ontario, Canada
