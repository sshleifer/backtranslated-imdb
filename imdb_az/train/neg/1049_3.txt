This movie has a very Broadway sense - in the background, moving, "noise" and so is it. Some of the Broadway feelings without tape. <br /> <br /> The film is slowly distracting from each other, and the pops say that it is a musical recollection. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jan Simmons Havvan It looks like Vivien Leigh in the scene.
