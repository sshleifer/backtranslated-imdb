Before I leave my point of view, I wanted to read other ideas and most of them follow the rules: This movie is intriguing! Undefined animation from acting against multiple errors. I really hope that the flaps extend beyond the imagination (it is impossible to extend the wings without the engines). Do not drop the opening device when it is not in the power supply. The smaller fan that was going was not enough with any lugging to reduce down the opening gear. Something quite astonishing is that when they fell to the ground, they touched the rear wheels, then dropped their nose down, thus silencing the airplane with the rear tires. How did the captain apply the left and right brakes to the wheels that did not touch the ground? Did they forget the liars? The director's story: You can learn about airplanes before attempting to film the story of "*". We apologize for the technical rents, but I give this movie a 1/10.
