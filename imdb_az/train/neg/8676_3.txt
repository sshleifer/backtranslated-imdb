Avoid the US version. This is with supplemental US footage and probably the worst dubbing done by New York Amateurs. Dubbing is so bad that it sounds like the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think Bronx is a black guy Chiba's voice. The whole movie could not see the bad. Follow the Americanized version of other greats like Chiba's Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
