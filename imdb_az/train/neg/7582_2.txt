High heels are tricks. Women (or men without help) have risen to new connections, have a sharp style of style, and can bring sensitive elegance. Alternatively, there may be a dangerous foot pain that will inevitably lead to visits, falls, and recent tragedy. <br /> <br /> Tacones lejanos is a frustrating visit rather than a stylish high rise. <br /> <br /> Almod√≥var's mother's daughter drama is undoubtedly elegant, but in terms of plot, this complex, complex-filled language and a troublesome work are those that have nothing to do with or are unreasonable. A few minutes of comedy, Tacones lejanos are just exciting. The best bit has begun with a child murder case. <br /> <br /> Black comedy is looking for a bit of this shiny thing, but then the movie comes with a heel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < A story with murder, suspicion, femininity, broken mother-daughter relationship, and an alternative judge, a transvestite, and a police teacher could have been a melodramatic force center. Instead, it is weak. High Heels stumbles decisively.
