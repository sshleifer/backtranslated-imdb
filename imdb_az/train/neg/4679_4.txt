It's a strange movie. Do not get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but in addition to a number of interesting works, the film is generally shocked by iftar dinners, crying, sweating, and something wrong. /> <br /> Audience is still something that the audience understands (what Denzel tells us about how Washington's Radio Trail should be on the Star Trek) is nothing more than nothing. <br /> <br /> We hope that the US Nuclear Fleet does not have such a script! <br /> <br />
