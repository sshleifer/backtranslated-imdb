An angry scientist kills his girlfriend, so she returns her head. Honestly, this is a movie. She tries to get another body looking for a sleaz of the city for a perfect body. For some reason, there is an ugly visible monster hiding in his office. The sleaze style of the movie laughed. No one in the movie can actually get the head. A hidden monster is a person who connects with a mask and can really say it. The area is slow, weak and finer is too bad. Follow the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this action. Believe me, I will not watch this movie myself.
