It was hard to sit with this terrible legendary adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. As you can see, Matt Frewer did not dump because he was long and skinny. His skull appearance created a good zombie in the Dawn of the Dead, but it seems like a shrewd, like Sherlock Holmes. Frewer does not have a spotless voyage that is only difficult to watch, but he seems uncomfortable in his stereotypical Holmes dress. Not only this, but the coat could not find a suitable hat as it looked in the gray tongue. Thus, its lid is dark and looks just as brilliant as the polyester. Whatever the cover, it looked very new and artificial. Jeremy Brett sometimes wears these traditional suits, but did not need to dress up like Sherlock Holmes to look for Brett. On the other hand, watching Frewer is painful. Even Holmes does not carry himself as Sherlock Holmes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When I started watching, it was a comedy called Wishbone, Jack Russell Terrier, and I thought Frengen was beaten like a kind of foil for Wishbone. <br /> <br /> Frequerin Sherlock Holmes version not only to stop talking, but also to be more friendly and kind, not just in this delicate artificial English accent Freewer always smiles at the witnesses he speaks and is so polite and polite that he should be taught at a Charm School, not a Shaytaan. Since the Hallmark Channel is produced, they are based on Sherlock Holmes (Wishbon <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Of course, One point of Sherlock Holmes's comment on Frewer, a pancake was more plausible and easily seen that the worst version of Sherlock Holmes (formerly the worst, the sound of this movie is terrible. It reminded me of Barnabey Jones or Murder O or typical episode of Diagnosis Murder. All suspects acted suspiciously and appeared before the victims. Holmes and Watson explain each clue throughout the entire movie. <br /> <br /> This Sherlock Holmes does not compare Rockford Files with Jim Rockford and is under Columbo. Terrible dialogue is probably the fault of the author. Obviously, anyone writing this article is very familiar with the BBC version of Sherlock Holmes, especially with Jeremy Bret. This film has the whole atmosphere of the Little House episode in Prairie. <br /> <br /> It is said that I do not think to be funny when these players light their lines in their fake habits. <br /> <br /> Only a small point is Dr. Ken Walsh who plays Dr. Watson with some dignity. He did not compare with Walsh Frewer and often talked to witnesses while his behavior and conversation were more natural and valid. Unfortunately, the rest of the castle is amateurish and they are similar to each other and their visionary tricks are something I have not seen in any modern movie.
