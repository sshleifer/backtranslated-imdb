Chris Rock has been upgraded to the 1978 "Heaven Can Wait" city agenda, hopeless for a comfortable star car, allowing him to make an appeal to white and major black audiences. He often plays a comedian who is often involved in an accident that has been brought out of his soul - in the end, the angels must find another body to accommodate him and may only encounter a white businessman. Repetition of a movie as mild and sentimental as "Wait for Hell" only shows that Rock is in the box (this is most an organization organized by most Hollywood players). Why not work for anything more or less memorable than the foolish reincarnation comedy that led to an Evening in Apollo? Great support for the player (usually including Regina King, beautiful Mark Addy, Wanda Sykes, Eugene Levy, and the terrific Frankie Faison), but Rock keeps himself in a difficult situation. * From 1/2
