I was very surprised that this movie was waiting for a few ratings for such a high rating and positive. I saw the movie and was very dissapointed. I have not seen it so pleasant. It was slow and lack of entertainment. Murder scenes are almost inviolable, usually close-up shots of commonly-priced knives. And the probable big bending ends, not really so much, I've seen it, and then the last clich√© appeared. This movie may not have much to say, but it is less than overrated. I do not recommend this movie.
