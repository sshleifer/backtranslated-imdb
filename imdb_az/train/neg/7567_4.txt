Story: Young-goon is a girl with a history of mental illness. He ends up in a mental body after he believes he is actually a cyborg. In the organization, he gets acquainted with Park Il-Sun. <br /> <br /> If you read this, you probably know how talented Chan-Wook Park is. But "I'm Cyborg ..." is a great progress from the familiar and (sad) strong areas. I'm a great admirer of any movie or story I'm trying to do something different. God knows, we all seem to be enough for our local cinemas. <br /> <br /> The main point about the movie I have said is that he can not create a character that he or she is having difficulty saying or anything about mental illness. <br /> This story should be one of my most bizarre things. It has been seen for years ... but it's not strange. The film does not have a heart ... just reality and confusion. Confusion seems to be the main theme of the film. All of the heroes are trying to understand their problems, but the Chan-wook Park itself, which proves the most confusing of them.
