I am a bounty B-Rate horror film buff and I have looked at slasher pictures in my works, so I have a significant dimension to judge this movie. It is easily put in the top part of the worst horror movies of the 1980s. It's not as frightening as the Demons night, it's not as strange as Re-Animator and there's no camping cost. This film is said to have no value. Remember, film art is for a completely different film. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Story: $ (The story is that for the Forbes Riley actor, Francine Forbes, who started a job at a university, begins to die, and Forbes believes that he is targeting the crime. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Movement: $ (all levels are terrifying - a school building experience is a high school because college students can do better than that) Forbes demonstrates a talent modality as a workshop, as one of the pupils, everyone is the caliber of "Extras" on the move).
