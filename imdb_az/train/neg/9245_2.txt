This video tutorial was a witness of 1995. Beautiful works! Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have chemistry on the main screen while talking about what the start button is. I'm looking forward to erasing Microsoft's deleted scenes, a Bill Gates commentary, a documentary on how Windows 95 compares Windows XP, and more, a Special Edition DVD! <br /> <br /> Overall: 10/10 (At least one Golden Globe won)
