Normally, I am a very generous critic, but I have to say that this movie is incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> There were some spectacular shots, but it was very bad that the film was wasted. "Trenchers" can simply be an action flick and romance, but unfortunately, if the movie was built around a loose love triangle. There is no chemistry among the pairs, everything between Mei and her men appears to be more lust than love, and most of them are loyal to the dialogue. This could be a problem with the translation, but the use of the word "flirt" often reminded me of the 8th grade; I also felt that we were throwing our head on the wind metaphor. The viewer is very little emotionally invested in the film, so the characters are really very carefree. I wanted to move quickly to get away from it, I was preparing to swim in my seat, but mostly I cried many things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now, Instead, he adds insults to injury. The latter was one of the most horrible, ridiculous events I really had seen. The boys are fighting each other, screaming, shouting, and attacking each other. Oh, and then the snow starts. Randomly. Oh, and then Mei (closed with a dagger in his heart) suddenly leaves the seeds. Then, it takes about 5 minutes to reach its target, and even throws a dagger that slows down a comfortable midscreen speed by hitting a small drop of blood. Wow, cool. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, Mei finally dies, because he threw a dagger in his chest and drowned. Jin reads, cries, keeps his body close, and the screen remains idle. It shouts the people around me and me. Not a good sign. <br /> <br /> Sight, but ultimately a failure.
