The Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining movie, while Murray Ibrahim was there. Spoilers: The Darkling has vicariously living creatures, like the devil is alive, because about halfway, F.Murray gets zapped. He is bums and damaged and makes them even more distorted whenever they want to succeed. He enjoys seven sinful sins. However, some of this may be defective, but people who are not bad should buy. Otherwise, it does not "diverge" its natural kindness. The little man told Barry White that I found both charming and fun. Very entertaining. If Barry White was a little dwarf, and Aiden went to Gillen, "Dee Plane, Dee Plane, Bos, come here, Dee Plane!" Throughout the film, Dee Dwarf speaks with Aiden Gillen of Barry White's voice, "Good to be good, you know what you want." "You are now committing a crime, you are really growing in the world" and other words that sound like "Evil" Stores or something for advertising. <br /> <br /> Please note that Aiden Gillen F. Murray is not Ibrahim and Murray receives an ax (or a knife?). F. Murray brings a certain unpleasant betrayal to his role in this film. He is a good player. On the other hand, Aiden Gillen has a happy smirk on her face, and maybe she looks like a restorative English complex. the class did not hit the mythological symbols, and could not imagine what the film was. ENDING is really creepy and it's still not funny. This movie was a parody, the end was perfect. Without a parody, it was creepy; but the use of a small girl cheap, said the film itself could not deliver. People who shoot this movie have lost everything they want to do before they finish. They just realized that they understood that they had run out of money and that a strange movie had to end.
