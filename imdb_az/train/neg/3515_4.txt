Basically a typical propaganda film for the final good war. But there were a few things that hit me. The first was mouthed epithets. In either case, Scott's mouths were once trying to throw a bombardment ("s *% t"), once and once a "pilgrim" (once a "dammit") bomb target during a bomb. I may be wrong about the second instance, but I repeat it several times and it resembles me. In the third case, the nature of Anne Shirley's character, O'Brien's character and kindness ("Give Hell") is the nakedness of the engines. He thought he was very surprising, because he obviously says "heck". I also found it interesting that the bombs, which have moral problems, bombing the citizens specifically. Hunters are sure that only the military targets will be hit because of the sensitivity of the bombs it uses. As we have forgotten LeMay's Japanese firefighting strategy, this scene plays a little mockery. McNamara's reference to LeMay's "War Sishesi" is that if the US did not win the conflict, it would be tested as a war criminal. After the movie has ended, the film has been processed according to the film. He reminded me of the end of the White Heat (I do not compare movies, just finish!). Maybe it just blew up. Real well exploded!
