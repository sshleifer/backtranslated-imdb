Anyone who writes a script for this film is not worthy of working in Hollywood (even living there), and these actors need to find another job. The most terrible time and few minutes of my life ... and just watched to see that it would be better, unfortunately not for me. <br /> <br /> Even at the end of the loan gave me trouble. There were not many people behind the film, so they had to put the credits slowly ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This film is definitely a great movie:. Too bad, I can not give 0.
