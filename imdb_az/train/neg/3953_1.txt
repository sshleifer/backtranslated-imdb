I do not believe this movie will be done. These people should get out of drugs and be beaten with corner objects. They should be tortured. This movie is a disgust. This is nothing but the first movie. Anything original is strange and does not matter. As a kind of mirror hallucination. What is in a mirror with bare therapies? In addition, any moron they had in each other did not have to worry about watching the first movie, because when they were Lacey, they called Natalie to Suzanna Love's character. I feel like screaming on the screen, "LACEY, LACEY !!!!". I give it a -50 out of 10. MY GOD !!!!
