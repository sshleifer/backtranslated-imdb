I came to see this movie and decided to see what others were thinking. I'm wondering if these guys who look bright look at the same movie! This is potentially a very good story, but it is unable to hit the mark. The scenario is very weak - the plot has many gaps that will build a large immersion network for fishing scenes. The heroes did not develop well, and the story was such that I said, "How are we here?" She asked her question. At least half a time in the movie. <br /> <br /> There was a lack of chemicals among cast members. It belongs to Lindsay Lohan's antics during the shooting. <br /> <br /> It was clear to everyone that they had seen and done their job; <br /> <br /> This is not a worthwhile movie ... go for a ride, take a nice warm bath, and earn money for something worth your money!
