The most unsatisfactory monster that is challenging to the depths of challenging children, sexual wives, profane and polluted lake. You would think that "Monster" would be entertaining ... but not really. However, the star is Tony Eisley and John Carradine, and it's worth looking at at least once in my book. Eisley, who interviewed Fangoria in 1987, recalled Herbert Stroke's direct involvement in the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - Andrea and Glenn (Andreas and Glenn, the characters, especially the inventive turn) - were taken full credit. Finally, considering how the giant result was, Stroke probably did not write to him. The "monster" has a look and feel of a medium and seventieth television movie, so I often want to leave it in the background. As a fun, it falls flat on his face, but it's very effective, as it is a reminder of being another type of movie and remember it. The only thing missing is a car track.
