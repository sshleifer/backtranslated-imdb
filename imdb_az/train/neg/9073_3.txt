This movie appeared promising, but in fact it was pretty bad. The object was OK, but the organization itself was terrible. While the actors were doing their best with limited materials, the overall spirit of this captivating college film could not be uplifted. Jason Schwartzman was even more angry - more than Rushmore, the rest of the castle was a great deal. The entertaining scenes came off-putting and incredibly young to be. It tries to be on the road trip / American Pie but at all levels it is dismally unsuccessful. Total loss of everyone's time.
