<br /> <br /> I have to be one of the worst films I have ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the worst and worst question of the script is how this will be the selection process of the lower sketch art. <br /> <br /> I want all kinds of deep dramas to kill more than any movie you are watching, so I can not say that I am a voter. I'm struggling to find something to compare it, but I do not think of anything that matches it, maybe starship troopers 2. In my opinion, the goddess crys and asks me to throw my DVD player, but compared to that, its effect is great. The effect is perfect and should be scripts. When a movie is funny, you know when it's bad, good people, it's not one of the soul minutes that killed soul minutes.
