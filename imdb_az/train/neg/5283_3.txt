I was looking forward to the first show of this movie since I was given a DVD on Christmas. After leaving a special nest for last night, my daughter (17 years old and Film Studies student), of course, was waiting for chocolate. <br /> <br /> We knew we were just drowning in the first two minutes. Weaker camera shots and switches, generally pessimistic kinematography, direction and wooden outputs have been plain and dissatisfied to us. <br /> <br /> Sally Hawkins's mother, unexpectedly, did not look directly at the camera a few moments before. <br /> <br /> Poor Rupert Penry-Jones, who plays the role of Captain Wentworth, did his best with script and leadership, and bless her. Hopefully, they had paid a good deal because he was practically wounded in a witch, a huge wave that passed through a segment, drain him and his colleague. They were nearly in the sea. Health and Safety would be one day! The weak Rupert spilled the sea water to convey his line. The cats did not have enough money to replay this scene. <br /> <br /> Unlike Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Krige had just given convincing performance, like Lean Russell, but his efforts were soon balanced by those with an unconvincing description of the disturbing Sir Walter Elliot, head of Anthony. <br /> <br /> For a long time awaited end to the film, Captain Wentworth visits Anne every two seconds for most of the film, once every two seconds. He had developed a memory defect, so he forgot his existence. On the contrary, Anne did not show Anne's enthusiasm, when she was looking for a good Captain who was almost able to call Hamam almost three-four minutes. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ span> <br /> <strong> </ span>> Important kiss, normal The moment we love our girlie moment was taken painfully. As they approached closer, Anne opened her mouth and closed her lips like chewing gum as a gum, and then hit the screen. Eww! <br /> <br /> The most unpleasant thing about last night was the half-hour exchange of ideas between chocolate and mother and daughter. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Mr. Jane"
