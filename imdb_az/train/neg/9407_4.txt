"Houseboat Horror" is considered to be the worst Australian film, often called and described as a typical slasher film, called "Watch the film that can not receive the Academy Award". Local disco team members, Australian outback. In an attempt to draw a musical video from a remote lake, the slasher of writing and moving with zero-voltage and boring characters by the burnt maniac. This, of course, gives: heads are divided into half by a machete, the throats are cut and a woman is killed by horse meat. If you love your favorite slasher movies, you can try this one, but you have been warned. At least the Swedish is better than The Bleeder.
