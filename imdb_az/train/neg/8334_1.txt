This is definitely the worst performance of Robert Duval, all referred to as William Buckley throughout the film. Her attractive melodramatic player is moving away from any dramatic interest. I'm not sure if this deliberate scene is theft or unintentional, but that's something I really can remember from an unforgettable movie. This picture should be illustrated by an example that should not be specified in each amateur player class. Thank God, Duvall continued to do better and better, and tried to influence a cultural accent. She's a good character, but it's about it. Klaus is much better. His performance is silent and noteworthy.
