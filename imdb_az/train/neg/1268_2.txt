Oh, what a sad movie! <br /> <br /> Founded in Los Angeles, the space center of Hollywood filmmakers, this film seeks to be a profound public comment on modern American sources. <br /> <br /> Multidimensional socio-economic stereotypes, cross-cut roads in daily, irate life. The area is indivisible and dirty. A number of unscrupulous controversy continues the filming, a baby abandoned in weeds, a thief who fears a lawyer, a man flying over the city at night, a boy in the summer camp. <br /> <br /> Thanks to all these events, it is always the generous support of sociological "insights" that have been continuously disseminated through dialogue. Another character says: "When you sit outside the Grand Canyon, you understand what a joke is ... these rocks make me laugh, I can tell myself and my worries. <br /> <br /> Another character is all meaning "There is a gulf in this country, and there is always a widening gap between people and people, like this big hole, like the big one ... The Grand Canyon and what happened ... anger and anger rage. <br /> <br /> Besides the terrible unnatural and compulsory dialogue, the story's speed is too slow, apart from obscene slippers, eighty, clever, and the act is fuzzy and superior, and the sound of the film is disrespectful to viewers, <br /> <br /> This is a Hollywood suit approved by a high and low price It is a film project that looks like a ghost of a movie, and will be transformed into a humorous film for those who want to learn about the true meaning of America's social change.
