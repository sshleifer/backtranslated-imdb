When I opened Lassie's MAGIC in the Radio City Music Hall, it was not as foolish as to believe that some of the first Lassi films would be heart-warming. The story was luxurious, and the songs of Sherman's brothers were lower than usual, the heroes were thirsty and JAMES STEWART and MICKEY ROONEY also saw better days. <br /> <Later, she was interested in seeing what ALICE FAYE's contribution would contribute to, as she had been away from the screen for a long time and was always receptive to her previous role at Fox. Alice was also killed by foolish writing and hateful photography. Another disappointment. There is no work here, there is nothing far away to enjoy the adults - there is no obvious magic. You can skip this without missing anything.
