The film is, in fact, a dull symbol of the terrible stereotypes that do not represent a true intercultural idea. The Middle East foot of the journey is particularly irritating: there are obviously mud brick villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, black dresses and women's belts. From all the pictures I think how camels and historic palm trees are lost. The two main characters are sketched very roughly in the identity and in many cases it is hardly valid. <br /> <br /> The real idea might have been interesting, but if you are looking for cultural ideas at the end of the day, you should skip this movie.
