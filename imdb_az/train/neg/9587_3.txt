The Soho in the 1950s (in London) and the rest of the arrivals and arrivals. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. No, less. Give him $ 15 million, and he'll give you a $ 15 million pop video. Does not forget for two minutes that people who can not really move are two hours, not something? What did he think. Who are the spectators? Who cares about a book recalled in a good way? Taking the chances of luck, the story of ordinary London. <br /> <br /> Can this movie really get even worse? Oh, I know, they're the third-rate songs that sounded like they were. David Bowie, crones several times over and over, and emphasizes it. The Soundtrack album is a clay texture material. <br /> <br /> Although it's a good thing. Good rest in Soho period. They were shamed, they did not think anything to put in front.
