I saw this movie and I was shocked! Robert Carlyle is a man who is not Hitler, who regretfully wants to be Hitler. The film does not reflect the truth. At the scene, Hitler hit the boy with a gun. Hitler never hit anyone, he did not hit people with fists, but with the fists of the soldiers. Understand? Another thing is that Hitler was as poor as he was shown in this movie, but he was clever. No one would accept him as a leader because he sees that it is bad. <br /> Yankees watched "Der Untergang" or "The Dawnfall"? It's a great movie with incredible actors. And his German movie. I think that this issue of Nazi Germany should not be considered as a film by people who do not know anything from Germany. Nation! <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> around.
