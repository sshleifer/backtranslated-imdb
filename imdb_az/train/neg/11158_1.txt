What a horrible, terrible movie. The worst collection of clicks I have ever seen. I've seen so much. I left the theater for about 40 minutes in search of a hard drink to calm the nerves. Meryl Streep was in a typical situation. How many people can be hurt and tortured? The talents of Aidan Quinn - as usual, were completely wasted. And Gloria told her who could move Estefan? It is still applying racist stereotypes while trying to fix it to the police. (A dysfunctional novice single music teacher teaches numerous children's violins in the poor neighborhood school). The kids were not even sweet! Written in horrible script. Aaargh! Wes Craven really made me flatter at once. this horror!
