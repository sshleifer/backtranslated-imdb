This is my duty as a lover of horror films to warm up the other people about this terrible and very terrible "horror" movie. Do not waste your time or money in this movie, it's bad that you act, the story is one of the worst I've ever encountered, and the script is just scary. Nothing good about this, why do you think I'm watching this shit. There were a lot of crazy inside the area, and eventually they were not cleaned, it was so bad, I do not know how awful a movie would be. As I said, I love horror movies and did not allow it, it was 18, but you do not see much blood and you are not heartwarming or jump. What foolish thing has happened to me in the film that has nothing to worry about, such as the kiss of her brother and sister? we can say. Just do not worry, there are many great fear movies, just do not waste your time.
