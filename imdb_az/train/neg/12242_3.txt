I was expecting a bad movie and got a bad movie. But, in my worst fantasy fantasy, this film is not really imaginable. Blood Surf do not want to tell you what to do. It's not about a blood-skiing, a great $$ crocodile. They complained about Jaws fake shark, but Spilberg was wise and did not show shark until the end. The crocodile is demonstrated many times and it's the worst crocodile I've ever seen, and they do not try to hide it. Lake Placid to watch a good fake timsal. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a decent surf and shark movie, but had to make a bad b-monster movie. He had the chance to create an original surf movie, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you understand how bad this movie is, do you have good parts? Indeed, there are some nudity and a sex scene where a playboy film has been taken straight out. Half of the players are not bad and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad, it does not take over. Not bad actors are going. There were some potentials. The place was beautiful and with some nice surfing scenes the movie started working well. Innocent author is a writer and director. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> o. Even if you want to watch beautiful Kate Fischer. It is not worth it. <br /> Watch Kate nude to watch Watch Sirens and want some good crocodile to watch Lake Placid 3/10 I'm a good mood and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked and Kate was a good man (but not a bad actress) and did a good job with Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi.
