"Prom Night" is a single-click repetition of the 1980's flick roller, playing Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen. This film takes place in the city of Oregon, where Donna (Brittany Snow) is coming to the big fish and wanting to enjoy it after some extremely traumatic events over the last few years. He and his friends need to think of a baby in a large hotel and be the most entertaining night of his life. <br /> <br /> For a year, Danny knows a person who has been insulting him for years, everyone knows and therefore is ready to kill anyone. <br /> <br /> Because I'm an admirer of the original "Prom Night," I tried to give some hope to this movie, but I must admit that I was very disappointed. "Prom Night" is a horror film that suffers from the worst possible predictability. There is, of course, no surprise here, and in this movie I've seen that it's been a lot of times, and often even better. What is this for the audience? Boredom. Of course, you have never seen a movie or a part of the pre-teenage audience, but most viewers will be able to guess nearly everything. The site is simple, but all scripts are surprisingly surprised by any surprises, bumps, atmospheres, or any kind, and actually really hurts the film because it actually does not give the audience anything to immerse their teeth. <br /> <br /> Many people complain about being the PG-13 slasher, and I understand what I'm saying, but it's not possible to make a good slasher movie with minimal score. Carpenter's Halloween, for example, is a small number of screenshots, but it is still a very scary and effective film. There is no need to scare the movie, but the "Prom Night" was extremely violent (and not too much), yet it would have been a little extra for the movie because it was very small to start with the script. The stress and tension here are good and I've spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of the situation, and about 99% of the time is right. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus> About this movie, though that was not entirely useless, the cinematography was really beautiful and everything was very well shot and stylish enough. The "horse" scary (most predictable) was a scary one. The movie sets are also very nice and the hotel is neat, but unexpected. As for players, this is the best mediocre. Brittany Snow plays a decent management, but the rest of it does not show much talent. Johnathan Schaech plays this and is probably the most experienced singer here, but it's also not effective. However, I love the character I play, a wonderful change in the typical 'masked-stalker' killer we saw so much. <br /> <br /> The last fifteen minutes of the film dashed to the end of my mind and was very anti-climactic. <br /> <br /> In general, the "Prom Night" was a disappointment. Everything was a large number of regular, predictable things. It was a little too much face-to-face, and it was a worthwhile slasher movie. There were a few good moments, but there was no regression or atmosphere in the film, and it was a very little trick-making development, not an incredible character. Gradually I advise horror fans to keep their money and wait for the video or to rent the originality, because there is no surprise here. Someone might find some fun in it, but it was very much anticipated for my tastes. I was expecting better and the theater was very disappointed. 3/10.
