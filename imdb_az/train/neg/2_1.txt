The description of the capsule is "a great move". In my opinion, this is a great directorship with two great players giving terrific performances and with zero chemistry at every single time, in their greatest effort. Robert De Niro is the most sophisticated and accurate of all time. All the lines outside Jane Fonda's work are disturbing that he has no handle on this character, because the character is badly written. It would be a very effective attribute for the exciting pacing of this movie. The film's aim is to keep watch over it, even though it's an astonishing story about ill health. I gave her 1 out of 10, really one of the worst 20 movies I've ever seen.
