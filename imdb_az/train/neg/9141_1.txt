What do you think, Sam Mowovich? What was everyone involved in this "movie" idea? The author, writer, producer (also an ICRA producer), Caster, lead star - Mroovitch says that "Ben and Arthur" are almost everything. <br /> <br /> So what's the movie's mistake? Everything. The film is about two gay lover, Ben (Jamie Brett Gabel) and Arthur (Mraovic - * cursed). Me and Arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay men. To further worsen the devil, Ben's naked "old companion" (full divorce), Tammy (Julie Belknap), Ben left for another man, and Ben's (<br /> Arthur's Christianity, excessive hypocrisy , Tammy sank like his brother Victor, dare Arthur to be corrected, and then tries to kill him when he is thrown out of his church. <br /> <br /> The film is a block that is totally destroyed by many picnics (ie Ben and Arthur fly to marry Vermont - there are palm trees in Alaska Airlines and Vermont, they return to the FedEx cargo plane - hopefully) Arthur and Arthur return to the next "The Final Deed", calling for the murder of the Final Plan; Arthur and his trainee detective control the same car, Blah Blah Blah). "Actors" are all very bad and the way from above, the road; It's a shocking horror (I'm not logical, you're not logical, I have meaning, it's logical!) and "movie" is a lot of mistake <br /> <br /> However, about "Ben and Arthur" is not the most funny, yet unbelievable thing, that Sam Mroovic thinks he really created something fantastic ("Ben & Arthur" and his comment on YouTube). <br /> <br /> So, in order to come to the conclusion, do not forget about any bad movie you claim to be the worst movie - "Ben and Brian" Arthur will immediately break that name, and even Paris Hilton films with monsters known as "Ben and Arthur" compared to "The Dark Knight".
