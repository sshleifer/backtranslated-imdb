This movie is very simple, but there is a lot worse. The whole movie is connected to a girl drawn from one door to another, and then a re-opens a year later by the magician and a group of friends (including a senior actress who has a problem with someone else's lover), along with a new partner ... camps ... a girl ... they are lesbian, and, of course, for some reason, of course, nudity). Unfortunately, Satan is now returning his mature daughter. Unfortunately, none of this is disclosed. Where were they? Where's Demon? How did a child live in a place full of evil demons? Hell taught him and made gladiator-type outfit for him? Imagine, but I think it is terrible, but it is difficult to say because the article may be very bad, and perhaps nothing could do with it. I gave three to the wrestler because it was pretty good, and although the effects were very cheap, it was great fun. I do not recommend it, it was not bad enough to be funny.
