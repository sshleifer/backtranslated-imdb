I do not want to touch the obvious peterbogdanovichian deficiencies of the TLPS. Instead, I will look at the positive aspects of this torn celluloid pigment of the film. 1. Peter Bogdanovic has succeeded in making a film that can survive as a whole. <br /> <br /> This movie is just above the top, and is placed upstream to the top of the movie. 2. Bogdanovich has a few successful lover - Cybill Shepherd (her protagonist), sharing his body and heart with her male audience - only one and twice. Brava! <br /> <br /> This kinematic festa del siesta's indestructible moments. 3. TLPS has a stereotypical country music scene that has consistently been staged. (Peter tried to find the movie in America's Deep South (probably not as plain as bleeding) so he hit that point and on and over ...) How can this be the advantage? Ask Whenever the movie ends and when you're refusing to massage the tired ears when monotonous music ends, "The movie is over!" <br /> <br /> <strong> The film gives hope to all women who look like Cloris Leachman. I hope they also throw one day younger and maybe even a good-looking companion. 5. Cloris Leachman's biography (technically not part of the TLPS) gives hope to all women who are looking to win one-on-one beauty at Miss Chicago. <br /> <br /> (I think Klioris has won a beauty contest), yes, check her bio and then we'll see it. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in black and white, and Chloris Leachman's face was looked through in a genuine, natural way.
