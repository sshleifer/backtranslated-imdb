(1 outta 5 star) This movie features some pretty cool opening credits (an offscreen narrator who will be released when a movie is afraid to watch this movie, the pool and scary music everywhere), but the movie just dropped there. A widower raises a new bride to a lonely place ... she hates her and her maids, and has a very sensitive effect on the new lady's past tragedy. He never begins to hear and hear the mysterious things he can never do. Her husband is sure that she is just in her mind, and this may come to the point where all this happens. Perhaps you have seen the same surface in hundreds of other movie and television shows (and have done better) because you will understand what has happened long before our hesitant hero. To add to the many transgresions of the film, most of this movie (in numerous cheap DVD compilations) seems to have lost a few key scenes. You see the hero stepping slowly towards the window ... he is switching on ... you know he will see something scary ... and then ... suddenly the scene is stirring in his arms. What did he see? I know, we will never know.
