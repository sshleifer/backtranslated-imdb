If possible, even the widows are more than the original (I hope, according to IMDb rules). THE FRIENDLY FRAMEWORK, at least, has resulted in Fridkin's ambivalence, americanism, and generalized inaction, but at least attempted to tackle Europe's effects to complicate the traditional appearance of the American police detective. The Arthouse Boom (relative) of the 1960s (especially the unusual) caused a great deal of influence on the European cinemas in Hollywood. It gave a new subversion to the experience gained in a tired environment, a new force and complexity, and the best ones (eg Bonnie and CLYDE, Early Scorcese). The Original Link was part of this action, a strangely distant style and anti-detective figure. TWO is a re-evaluation of the Hollywood's right-wing America's values. <br /> <br /> This film is a very dialectical and entertaining philosophy of America against France. For example, in the 1970s, TWO was shot as a French police officer. Of course, they did not see at home that they were Frenchmen of the size of the American cinema, and in a sense it was a warning against Gallic's presumption. It can be seen in the example of two films. CONNECTIONS French swords invaded New York, when the French style drowned the American thriller - it led to the detachment of the detective figure and the irradiation of the structure - the baddie escapes. <br /> <br /> America is returning to France, but America's backward values ​​are set on local genres - the power of the detective is revised and they reach a convention resolution. <br /> <br /> Doyle's relationship with the French inspector Barthelmi is even more dramatic. <br /> <br /> TWO keeps track of the original, violating her detective hero. From the start, Doyle's importance is reduced. CONNECTING is a hero, despite ending. But she does not know that she can not dominate the area of ​​America in a foreign country and her inability to check language or customs. He even misinforms the police, mistakes the information for the offender, and kills him. <br /> <br /> The power of an operation seems to be seen and interpreted by its power, but Doyle is watching, controlling, capturing an object, a corpse (exactly thrown by Charnier) and interpreted. CONNECTION, he committed a crime, forced the field, punished, punished; <br /> <br /> This is unreasonably bound to a bed, a cell, a dependent, locked bed. <br /> <br /> This loss of power can be symbolized in the loss of a weapon, a familiar Oedipal trajectory. In the heroic sequence, she finds comfort from an elderly woman who says she looks like her son. Her nervous status goes back to her beloved womb from adults. Oedipus was the first detective, and Doyle had to reject this false denial to escape his destiny, a person who abolished his unified identity and killed his father (Charnier), who could play the role of a mystic man in society. Psychoanalytic theory was popular among scientists in the 1970s (Jacques Lacan, a pro-French Frenchman), but it's rare to see a full-fledged film. <br /> <br /> If all of these facts tend to minimize Doyle's, then there's no movie style. Fridkin takes care of the field mechanics by abandoning us from his hero, refusing empathy or character motivation. Here, Doyle is a very glorious Hollywood hero. Instead of losing a long stroke, it will be understood and understood to the audience by traditional devices - a point of view, close-ups, shooting, and so on. <br /> <br /> TWO fall and the rise of Popeye Doyle. In this case, a moving player is the usual Hackman grace. Therefore, cold turkey scenes, despite their efforts, do not bother. It is allowed to distribute more than we observe cold; This is a less stressful experience. The scenes are also multiplied by a very lachrymose manly sentimentality of the American. <br /> <br /> HEAD OF THE PRESIDENT, Jean Pierre, tries to imitate Melville's complex tensions, reflects TWO. Melville's LE SAMOURAI has featured a gangster that has a whole, strong, foreign language, and has eventually described its fragmentation. TWO starts with a non-invariant character, partly by tongue, begins when the language of its power goes out - the final movement schemes are baseless. <br /> <br /> The film is important when it comes to local and language trials and detectives, but when it rebuilds its power (weakened by gunfire and cathartic burning of the main site, Charnier's tower block), Marseille irrelevant and seizes a mysterious stagnation that can occur anywhere. Compare the end of two films: one is uncertainty and despair, the other is definitely the final decision. <br /> <br />
