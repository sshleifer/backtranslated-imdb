"Fallen" fall into the category of life (WOL). Now I'm sorry I'm big for two hours. My other family members also watched this movie and made abusive comments on the screen and rooted in mummies. I'm sorry for the actors (Wagner). I have read other negative reviews and can not add anything else to this movie for up to 25 minutes, as there is no slot on the TV for 30 minutes. It reminds me of a good meal with a few good ingredients, but it is not mild with any taste when served. In my esteemed thought, the 42-foot mummite had to be 8-10 feet, and made the structure by replacing the mystics and replacing the truth with a few people who want to break the truth and ask for DNA samples for bad reasons. The heroes were protected by their crews. Then everything was torn by bad guys. The Heroes Day saves and proves that everyone is wrong.
