I wanted to put up with a lot of movie streaming movies in late-summer / summer, but in general, most of them have a reasonable pay (ie cool special effects, interesting plot twists, funny value, Steve Buscemi, etc.). But this was none of the films. Everything we got was a few moments of cheap excitement of Eva Longoria's splitting (Maxim is less expensive than a movie movie). <br /> <br /> </ div> </ div> <div> When I'm in the theater, not to spend the night watching 24 seasons on the DVD I hit myself. Save your money from this one nation. If you really are really like Eva Longoria's splitting.
