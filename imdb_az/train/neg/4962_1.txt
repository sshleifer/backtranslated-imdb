99.999% pure shit. And the other .001% thought it was a short moment, that my dark chicken was split. <br /> <br /> Dialogue was a bad dialogue. The action came out and there was no gender (the whole film, in general, with the blonde naked modest dresses mentioned above). CGI had undoubtedly been the worst I ever had in the movie, and the anacronisms were numerous and prominent. The actor was from Kros and Marina Sirtis, even the only "names" in this film. And Marina Sirtis really looked really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw the play more playful at the high school. This is a film developed by MST3K. The heads should enter the Sci-Fi to allow this steam pile in the air.
