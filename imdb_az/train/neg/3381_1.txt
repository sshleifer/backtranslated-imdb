This can be the worst movie adaptation of a Broadway music. Even music has been destroyed. Attenborough does not know anything about the theater - almost every shot and moment ring is fake. <br /> <br /> Hairstyles that are not released are very interesting. For my life, I do not understand what the concept ("conceptual") is meant by the opening of the movie "A HORN LINE". Are we going to vote for the "A chor line" that contains stories about people who sang these people? No, the show itself collapsed. <br /> <br /> I saw the original production and listened to the album for hundreds of times. Why, oh, why did they do it?
