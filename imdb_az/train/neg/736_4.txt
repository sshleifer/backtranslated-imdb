Twenty years ago, a five-year-old boy Michael Hawthorne was a witness who killed his mother on the empty road and subsequently committed suicide. Michael (Gordon Currie), his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friend Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive Phillip Rhys and Trish (Rachel Hayward ) grandparents in their farm to carry Halloween in their country. He wanted his friends to wear suits that would represent their greatest fear of them, and Morton (John Fedele), a carved wooden beard with an Indian-friendly Crow (Byron Head Bear), to overcome their fears, is infinite. <br /> <br /> Michael's biggest fear is to be a father like a murderer, but something is wrong, and Morty turns his father into a murderer. <br /> <br /> "Fear: The Resurrection" is a fraud and a senseless blow, using an interesting concept to overcome the greatest fear of each friend before growing, but uses a misleading blurred script. For example, there are some exaggerated speeches, such as Betsy Palmer; others are very weak, but in general the toy is good. Unfortunately, there is no explanation that causes the fungus to survive; Additionally, in spite of being guarded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sorrow if each of them dies. It could have been used to build a better dramatic situation at a much lower speed than fifty minutes. Finally, Michael tells me an interesting story that his father did not tell the story. I do not know that 87 minutes of pre-rolls on DVDs in Brazil have not been edited. Special effects are very acceptable for B-films. <br /> <br /> <strong>
