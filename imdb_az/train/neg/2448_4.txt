The purpose of committing a crime and the victim realize what has happened to the victim as a result of family hostage taking and is promising and interesting. But this is only one of the most exciting parts of the film, directed by Ravi Tando's "Jawab" (1985) 20 years ago. Here the problem is to Ace Director Rajkumar Santoshi, a rapidly moving move-trillion (or Xakee) or a heavy-drama drama (Viz. Damini), and this intrigue ultimately appears clear. Lajja (2001), this gorgeous director has always given us films dedicated to high entertaining values, so why does this movie come as a surprise? Sensitive director of both heroes, Amitabh Bachchan and Aryeman. As the film ends, the audience does not know whom to hate and to whom it can benefit, and this is the main constraint of the whole story, and therefore begins as a war between the common people. Don realizes that he has gone wrong with his family, ending up like an underground pig and making himself feel uneasy. The appearance of Dawn's son as a real evil does not seem to be an element of surprise as quickly as Aishwarya's character is used compared to the same situation in Khaki, all of which is more dramatic. The life of Underworld Don from abroad appears to be very illogical. He thinks that Mumbai will be forced to flee behind enemy enemies and escape behind their enemies. Ashok Mehta's beautiful camera work, two good fight sequences (coordinator Abbas Ali Moughal), some well-developed scenes by Akshay Kumar, Santoshi's fast-paced slick treat and, of course, Mr Bachchan is a lifeless character they worked very hard. But all of these do not create an exciting experience. You and your family!
