The posters include: "At birth, she was given 6 years to live ... traveling for a lifetime of 34 years." Ami is an Israelite born of an American who was diagnosed with dystrophy at an age of Muscular Dystrophy. After his 34-year-old love for his 22-year-old brother did not go well, he decided to come to the United States to face the doctor who said he would only live for six years. The doctor wanted to show that he was still recovering and weighing 39 pounds. Why? <br /> <br /> If I see this movie, it's as good as I am. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, everything he can do is his left finger, but why is he so frustrated with the doctor? Who knows his illness 34 years ago? The physician only told his mother that based on medical history, people with a disease will not have to live long. What's the point of the old doctor's door? Why is this old doctor living in the US watching? There are many things we can do about Amy's life: How can these animations be made with just one finger? How can it be that it depends on others in daily life? How did he accomplish his ministry? How does he deal with emotions when looking at other people while looking at a strange creature? The film told us that. Instead, the filmmaker took a minibus and made a trip to allow the old doctor to appear on the doorstep to show Amy still living. I thought it was a joke.
