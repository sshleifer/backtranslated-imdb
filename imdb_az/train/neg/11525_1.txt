Just horrible! Why not use real actors? Look, this should be stopped! Stop non-actors! If you like any reliability or any message sent through these low-budget movies ... Use real actors for the love of God! Most people will work for free ... Take advantage of it! Now they have come back to my interpretation ... In any case, humor was lower than the bath's variety and was not funny at all levels. When it comes to quality, you can see the reflection of the crew on a public bus bus ... what did you think? It looks like Sony Camcorder, and it is likely that he was a man with him. I know that the only audience in this movie is people with little fashions ... and not even a good thing.
