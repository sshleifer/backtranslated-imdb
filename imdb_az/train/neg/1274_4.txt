It should be a film about Sam and his wife, renowned Peter Falk and equally famous Olympia Dukakis. It would be a worthwhile movie to see. Instead, a little Falk thrown Paul Reiser is a tool. Beautiful Elizabeth Perkins in this movie, but you know it hard. I guess Reiser is impressed by the fact that he is a giant film star that needs a proper tool. It is not. Riser was forced to hire some of the best female actresses on the screen today and then push them all back in the background. Dukakis does not look up to the last 15 minutes, but the screen shines when it comes to the screen. The story is true about Falk and Dukakis, but we are exposed to a senseless, frustrating, terrible journey that Reiser has shown to be psychologically insensitive (misleading!), How sweet and valuable he is and how profound it is. . For example, on the scene of a restaurant I think Reiser is thinking of as "Cassavetes", there is a ridiculous lie between Reiser and Falk, not so ridiculous, I am embarrassed by Falk.
