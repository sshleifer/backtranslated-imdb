This is a decent early indicator of the ability of John Woo to succeed in shaping swords and flying puzzles. The cinematography is great and the works of some swords are really remarkable. Unfortunately, the film is under a burden of a dull story and a sparkling low budget (if you doubt me, check out some combat scenes). However, it's worth seeing, especially if you can keep it in the box.
