Dooohhh! My Bwainn Hurrrts! Certainly after a good film's endurance test. The lord knows only one headache when I have not started moving fast. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm not, maybe the movie is not getting ahead of itself ... or perhaps it's a mystical atmosphere. <br /> <br /> As my visit to McDonalds, my modest opinion is that the film has a mystical atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Besides, all of the characters were terrifying and a Tom & Jerry cartoon became more and more character development. Yaarrrghhh! Why am I doing it? Why can I watch such a picnic? It's enough to run a run and join a monastery or foreign Legion! YAARGH !! Only absolutely terrible movie from every point of view. Besides, it's not bad.
