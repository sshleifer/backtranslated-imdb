Despite the theory of Rave, this flick is collected in New Zealand, and any taste surrounding the production is hopeless. <br /> <br /> In spite of the overall appearance of a large budget (NZ), in addition to the clicks that make sense, the film has some weaknesses, <br /> <br /> There is no problem solving the Karabakh problem. (http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/) They will be able to choose similarities ... I like basketball and so on. playing scenes like boys playing in clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Oscar Kate sees himself as a mockery, but his manifestation is always self conscious. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has no doubt that the Samoans-in-NZ culture is deeply rooted and I hope that it is not sustainable but is affected by the American speech, culture, and the stubbornness of everything, undoubtedly, at the end of this film will be. /> <br /> Robbie Magasiva always looks good on the screen, but is down by the script. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I know someone I find in these films that, obviously, feels like a good revolutionary clunch punchline. <br /> <br /> This is due to the events that took place several months later. not great, fun, but not funny ..... Wake up! NZ - this is not a 5 star movie (middle-class network of guilty? :-)) despite all the shimmers .... <br /> <br /> Is my advice? If you watch it, be the first drunk!
