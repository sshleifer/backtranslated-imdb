Before I began watching the show, I heard it was very beautiful and aesthetically interesting. Which deception, scripts are terrible, because I'm sure the authors are the son and grandson of Scoobidoo writers. What can you say about SFX and colors that they are too painful to watch, the colors are unsaturated, saturated because scripts are written and the show is overrated. This show looks just like a sugar and a bad cake for the baby, because these ingredients are good, they are enough. Unfortunately, for this show only two items of this show are finally vacuity and total discretion.
