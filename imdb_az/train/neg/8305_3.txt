Like many people, I love the "A Christmas Story." I've never heard of this movie, and for good reason - it's horrible. The same local, same story, same director, but the original did not have the blurredness. Charles Grodin is a poor choice to replace Darrin McGavin, but I do not think anyone can replace it. Story is forced and deprived of the original dessert. Interaction with neighbors, Bumpus, is ridiculous. In A Christmas Story, Ralphie's affiliation with the BB gun seems cute, but his commitment to this film is very boring. Scud Farkus is replaced by another guy with original neighborhood insults, substitutes and a strange hat, but Scud Farkus is a dangerous charm. Even if this film was made with the original crew, it would be quite difficult to balance the originality.
