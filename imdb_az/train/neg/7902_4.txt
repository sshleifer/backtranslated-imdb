Sweet and fun, but naked and inexpensive. 'Munchies' is another Gremlins clone to break out of the 80s. <br /> <br /> Firstly, it was good Gremlins. <br /> Then came the average 'Critters'. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> br> Now, the "Munchies" will have to fall for me between "Ghoulies" and "Hobgoblins". In fact, I found it more entertaining than the Ghoulies, but I'm over a dark tone. <br /> <br /> Get-go is increasingly nature-natured (better for it), but by nature, see hammy (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips) just munchies running amok. This is where the fun is. Very light hearted bark, though the story is mostly in a small desert city like a few people in most of the munchies (or hungry, devious and devastating) in funny encounters (some moments work). It is attracted by the elegant but strange zippy pacing. Those who are created to praise some of the puppets may appear to be very soft and vulnerable. <br /> <br /> As for their identity, they can really speak ... and with the attitudes. <br /> <br /> Charlie Stratton and the attractive Nadine Van der Velde (Critters) Harvey Korman were two roles. <br /> <br /> <strong> Robert Pikardo also opens. <br />
