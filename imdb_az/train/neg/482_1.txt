Here is a French movie, LOL, with an emphasis on younger men and young girls ... why are the French connected to such a thing? When the age difference is so great, it really comes as a desolation! Valentina Cervi is beautiful (she was built at a time similar to Zeffireli's '68 Romeo and Juliet from Olivia Hussey), but she looks at about 15 and plays an actress playing with Tassi ... well, <br /> <br /> Other posters have tried to explain the historical record of Artemisyan, a great artist who is one of the most well-known women's painters of this era (unusual in this case). XVII century). His story tells us in the modern era, especially because of the guilt that proves that "all major artists are men" - he has a lot of allegations of bits - and because of his awesome excitement in the process of his aggression. Only she was exposed to sexually explicit and sexually explicit sexual intercourse (because marriage was the only way to avoid public shame in those days), but Tassi was seriously aggressive and probably killed her husband and child. > <br /> <br /> The film is a terrifying refusal, which does not need much dramatic and no "spicing up", by committing a truly realistic story of a fascinating and noteworthy - because in some strange Frencified way, the "hot" men draw their sex organs and overseksed teenager with a warm love affair with an elderly man to become his father. This is "sexy" - the truth is elegant and feminist / politically correct. <br /> <br /> This is also an issue that is part of the life of Artemisia, who thinks the movie is quite interesting. The truth that decades of decline (the famous Hollywood directorship is not preceded by aggression), he was the first woman to be admitted to the influential Florentine Academy, and he went to have a child ... oh drilling products. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is necessary to talk about a woman living in high school, and they are not "hot" as teenagers. <br /> <br /> I understand that a true movie (or book) is a historical character. You need to create a dialogue, create subplots, create dramatic structures. Certainly, some details may be sacrificed - if the dates are transferred for several years or Artemisia is played by a blonde actress (he is aware that he is afraid of his portraits and is not a big one in a big bonnet) or something like that. But it is really sick and unsettling to change his story and to agitate romance. Even worse, because the director is a woman. <br /> <br /> If you were like this (and I know that some people can stoog to less than a real female artist, and like a suit and hot sex) probably with "Dangerous" Rufus Sewell and Catherine McCormack "Beauty ". Bon Appetit, a large number of pigeons and jewelry items based on a re-written date.
