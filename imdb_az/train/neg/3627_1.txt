I'm not often in classic movies. Patton, My Road, Green Valley, How to Wind, Casablanca, Annie Hall, Wind, Lawrence, and Citizen Kane. But in a luxury suite, when I was in a cafe more than just watching an American in Paris, I was watching 3,469 times in one of these films. <br /> <br /> The digital art direction and music did not interest me, Gershwin or Gershwin. Dancing and reading can help sleepless sleep. Dialogue is not suitable for Singin in the rain. Basically, this movie is boring. Another film that fell asleep while watching was Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid. But you do not blame me. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (very bad we can not give zero.)
