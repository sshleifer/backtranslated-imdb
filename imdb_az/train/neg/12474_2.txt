I saw the MST3K version of Deathstalker III and loved the movie - even the "unmystied" - I decided to watch the entire series of Deathstalker. <br /> <br /> I'm embarrassed and regretted that no level at any level on the Deathstalker I is fun at all, and the loans have taken away me! Very ugly and naked. I think that either "DS 3" was a cleaner product, or MST3K really did make many things because something like that is foolish, careless and straightforward. I was wrong. He even spent $ 6.99. I'll go back tomorrow, and even do not open "DS 2". Probably, I'll be able to put it on DVD because I can not turn it back and nobody wants it - including myself! So really do not worry about it. Even nakedness (too, btw) is acne and icky.
