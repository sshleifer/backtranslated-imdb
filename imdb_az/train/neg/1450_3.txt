If someone really wants to understand the Hits, read the WWI history with the history of the Second World War. Find what they need to survive the dead bodies of soldiers during the war. As WWI saw, many soldiers were shocked at what they called a "terrible" post-traumatic stress disorder during such calls. If you learn the real horrors of the WWI, you will begin to understand Hitler. <br /> <br /> You will understand that this film, unfortunately, misses a person's hatred, not just because of their evil, but only for them. many are doing it. Read some books on the subject and watch the WWI movie "Glory ways" that have never been seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> In this film you will see that soldiers are angry, desperate, and completely devalued by human life, nothing more than a bullet. We understand Germany. A lost war that millions of millions of Germans lost their lives, without a real reason. Then, after the war, the whole economic collapse comes. These are factors that create extremism. <br /> <br /> Loss of family members and massive poverty will always lead to extremism. Unfortunately, this film ignored these factors and became another shooting part for throwing a throw. There is no real value, a decisive film that is based on fictional characters that can give Hitler a better idea. They named it Hitlers, they would sell more.
