If I were to go up and watch it, or watch it, I would have slept, but it was a shit, and I really got up! Together I hated it. And he did not take Brendan Frasier, it was better. It was not as good as I would have expected, given that I really enjoyed Jungle 1 paradise, and the first one, for example, was not as good as a bird and never collapsed into the tree. I hope this is attractive to the filmmaker and should review the future films ... terrible! In fact, I would like to give Ursla a good job, as the movie is worthwhile (until I go) ... I usually give this movie 2 out of 10
