No one is going to spend money on such a bad article. It should be one of the worst films along with the Haunted Highway I've really seen. BAD actors and a really bad story. This film has no normal reaction to any event and although it is Halloween, normal people get a great deal of reactions, they witness the killing of their ancestors, gutted, people surrounding the aerators can not breathe (at least I can add in a room of 50 people) ) and the devil would see the difference between a puppet and an individual who was 8 years old, as if dragging the dead from his home. It is impossible to say that no one can be naive and dumb to believe in the truth of Satan's and Jesus's appearance on the same day, as this child. I'm 8 years old and I'm sure there's more brain than that. <br /> <br /> However, it's really stupid that everyone is falling like one of these silent devils, apparently, no questions are being asked. Is the question of a movie really a devil, or a crazy man who killed people when he felt himself? Yes, human hands, weapons, built, and whatever, I think, should be in the film, otherwise they did a bad job to hide it. Then this man was able to kill a man, an old lady, a man and her mistress, the police (all weapons and teachings) and a few people. <br /> <br /> Most of the detainees understood that the worst thing I've ever seen and I'll never advise everyone 1 hour and 30 minutes will spend their lives to watch this general shit.
