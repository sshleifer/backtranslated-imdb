As a fan of the Broadway game, I was waiting for the movie to be released. I spent months looking at premium speeches. Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Danny Glover, Star Power ... Can not we be less than 4 stars in 4 stars? Lying! The finished product definitely disappointed me. Eddie Murphy, Anki Noni Rose and Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy's James Brownesque's performance, film, many lulls, and Jennifer Hudson's performance make them look on the screen every single time. His and "I Speak to You" performance was the only time I felt that this act of worthiness was worthy. He begged the group and any good people who would not let him stay alive. As many reviewers have reported, the film is made up of more experienced actors and deserves all the prizes you receive for this performance. Anika Noni Gul was in a strong position with great voice and comedy talent. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Noules watched their performances. Foxx's ability to film this was seen in advance of his unusual "Ray" performance, and Beyonce Knowles was pulling and erupting through the film, tapping a long, fashionable photo or long video. <br /> <br /> The film was not strong enough to pay attention to its character at any point on the film. <br /> <br /> The film is too short, 30 minutes and 1 song (solo for Beyonce's "lover" Jamie Foxx) is too long. <br /> <br /> DH - Vancouver, WA
