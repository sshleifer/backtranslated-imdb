In this movie, I gave Natassia Malthe (like Vampier Quintana) 2 because she was very sexy in this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are very few logic in this film, but many scientists are flicking. The film has probably worked hard to avoid traditional vampire stories. Unfortunately, it went too far, and the whole story was not just unfounded but funny. <br /> <br /> I have very sick and worn scenes. A good vampire movie should be more logical than not needing to see a lot of blood - we all know when a vampire throws a man who can do what a vampire can do. A few nale or screaming are all you need to describe the scene (just as Quintana is trying to force Rosa to be a few, the rest is your imagination). Anyway, this is my personal taste.
