Renters have been an interesting experience for me. This is the first movie I've ever seen in a place I've moved quickly with some of the unusual moves and I can watch Serbo-Croat indie something from an ordinary moving movie and find them interesting. <br /> <br /> The renters are heartfelt endurance and extreme orchestra. One of the main problems of the scenario is that in a very structured environment (the film should feel more congressional to do this, it did not happen). This leads to the lack of real character development; everyone looks two-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The worst thing for this is Bill Spear, aka Snoop Dogg. I found his character very uncomfortable and very sincere. At one point I will stop the film because I am irritated by the character as aggressive, violent and monotonous, and there is no personality other than the decisive "ten" passage (after a while it is actually projected) and I wish it had a heartfelt quality. However, one reason for this jar may be the strange tempo of the film (in the 70s, feels and looks more early noughties). <br /> <br /> If he were in a safe situation in the 1970s, his character could have been more apparent. <br /> <br /> It was also difficult to cover the film. <br /> <br /> For me, the tenants, for me, have been very well illuminated, trying to provide a bit strange, jazz-filled atmosphere. an incredible movie. <br /> <br /> It does not reflect the truth, or does not offer exciting thinking about the race, identity, or writer, whether it is black or black. It is strange that this project is needed by David Lynch; his creepy, clustrophobic and unobtrusive looks and feelings could raise both actors and scripts to a very remarkable thing.
