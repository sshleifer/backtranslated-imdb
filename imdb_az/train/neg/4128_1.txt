This movie is one of the most horrible events I have ever seen. Only dialogue is not terrible, never ends. You'll think it's over, but it's not. What is 140, 160 minutes? Do not even know. I do not know, I'll never follow him again. Someone pulled out a romantic comedy, pulled out the comedy, then decided to diminish the romance and succeeded us. But if you look at my word, learn how terrifying this film is.
