The last few minutes of the film I would give you a 7 or 8 star rating. <br /> <br /> Life spouse and refugee camp, military units, refugees and internally displaced persons,. Captain, Gene Hackman, the first officer, Denzel Washington, will be able to start despite initial confirmation orders. The point is that BOTH captain and 1st officer should use their start buttons simultaneously. Hackman is determined to get started, and Washington finally eventually stands before the end of an armed uprising. Finally, the mistake was discovered and missiles did not start. It's cool. However, here is just a part that does not sound. After they were on the ground and facing a research council, Washington and Hackman shake their hands and half-hearted friends! Huh? For me it is very difficult to evaluate the film.
