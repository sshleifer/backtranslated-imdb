At the third entrance of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue to run away from Tall Man, a trigger-happy 9-year-old, a black GI. The soul of Jane and Mike's deceased brother (died in the original Phantasm). Figure 3 is quite a bit of a disappointment because the dark and black comedy is less inspirational and interesting, as in Phantasm II. I just felt that Stres felt like a lover, Reggie's incompetence and a comedian who stopped his talent. The humor in the previous film was more droughty and depressed and better suited to such a story. Also, does not the settings here, as well as the permanent presence of Tall Man (Agnus Schrim)? However, it is still not so satisfactory at times. By the way, take a look at the sharp cut, because it shows the most beautiful clay of the screen. The entire Phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of Don Coscarelli and is the fifth production of 4 episodes ever written and managed. The first is a semi classical classic, the second is a holiday of fear and violence, and the rest can easily jump. A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike, although James LeGros's character is better described in Phantasm II.
