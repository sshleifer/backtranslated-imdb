This film creates a deep disappointment. Only Wenders demonstrates only a limited range of Blues music, which is subjective and personal interest in the music that brings the film and it's a totally boring thing. The only point of the film is J.B. An interview with a Swedish couple who made friends with Lenoir and showed her personal video as well as talking stories. The use of Wenders' filmmaking theme has been very interesting - it focuses on the culture of the world (or in fact, American culture), but it is limited to the subject of reproduction in a funny and completely charming way from the stories of the 1930s. film just like bedding. Yawn. I was expecting more.
