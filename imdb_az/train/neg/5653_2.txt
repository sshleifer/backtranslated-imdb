Put it this way. Actually, I'm taking this movie. I took the printer / director what you are trying to do. I know that dialogue is to be dry and emotionless. I understand that the plot should be non-classic and obsolete. The writer / director was going to work. Very dry humor / comedy. With all this, I still think that the film was shot. The writer / director tried to recreate Napoleon Dynamite with this movie. All the features were the same. Even the main character resembled Napoleon. But Napoleon Dynamite was really funny. His script works. This is not a movie. There is no purpose. Yes, let me repeat it. His sole purpose is to wipe Napoleon Dynamite and try to keep this look and feel. It did not work very badly.
