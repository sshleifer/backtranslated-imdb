The United States started operating the UK police with all weapons and knew that CID employees had become uniforms when they quit their jobs and fell out of the pub! It should have been one of the most unrealistic films with the worst images of the "real" UK police, which has been tackled by the public without any doubt. I saw that Mr. Snipes could have needed money to pay back tax returns, but a good actor like Charles Dance was a mystery. <br /> <br /> Worse than the worst low budget, there are over 50 "B" movies. One hour of suicide and time will never come back. <br /> <br /> Avoid being like a true tuberculosis.
