There are beautiful landscape paintings. Writers put trite mouthings on actor's mouths. With this lesser player this show will be silly. 'People should raise humanity or BS.' Not all that is mentioned is to awaken the mastery and to express the darkness. The lead character says that the non-drinkers hide the shadow side. He had lived in the wrong, darkness, and drinking the darkness, and drowned directly out of his horizons without the enlargement of his landscape. He did not have a respiratory organ in his work, and he had no expression of his pain. All the artists were restricted in the form of many landscapes. The discussion between the heroes was a class school, and the writer separated everything he wanted. After reading the first woe, I tried to love it. To see what I agreed, I had to dig deeper. I think great comments are related to the movie. I just moved towards the end. The child was very passive. Beautiful scenery and music were funny. It is only my opinion, but there is no place for me.
