I rented this movie thinking it looked like a beautiful piece of art. What I earned was a clean garbage. This film was mixed with many spots, almost whipped everywhere, and it was terrible in all its spots. The description of a queen who was a young male scientist Mira Sorvino suffered most. I want Kingsley to abandon his godfather to make this movie one of his projects. Fiona Shaw will definitely play with Petunia Dursley; at least Harry Potter is more entertaining than what they call a game in a movie. <br /> <br /> Kinematography, some college graduates received 101 classes in Cinema Art and were unhappy. Almost every scene in the film is cut for some kind of effect; Of course, the last result is at least the adjustment I have seen. Jay Rodan was good as Agis; He wrote such a bad article to work so badly. Rachael Stirling puts the best effort as a good lady in anticipation. Finally, I really wanted to make any payments to the Blockbuster Video. I'm so glad I did not spend $ 10 on this fiasco in the theater. Since they played this Marivaux game since the 18th century, they are interested in how many people have been the best for centuries. If I were there, they would not play on cockroaches. Thanks for the modern convenience of DVD players; you can go boring or horrific scenes. Guess that means you've just watched the start and end!
