SWING! Since the 1930s, it is an important film that is one of the few black production and moving films. Most of these films are simply badly damaged, so they are unauthorized, but that's pretty good. <br /> <br /> Although this film is historically important, it is a great chance to see many of the talented Black singers of the time after the peak of the old Cotton Club. <br /> <br /> And there are some wonderful performances, which is a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood music of the time - including the prima donna, which demolishes an unexpected surprise, which is nowhere to be seen in the show and the protection of the day. But the writing is only God-terrible and sometimes somewhat embarrassing-some people can find Black America's images a little bit. Here's a battle that looks like the scene from WWE Smackdown when the plot really begins before it is captured by a hard-working wife (a popular stereotype of the times) and captured by the hussy (so completely overcome this role!)! And a lady wants to cut another lady with a flat razor - really a scene from the outside! Then, in the film, prima donna betrayed her husband while she was treacherous and everyone welcomed her! Apparently, the film sometimes wants to appeal to the audience with the lowest common denominator. They can not do it - with the worst things I've ever seen. <br /> If you still look at a bad manufacturing past in any way (with ugly characters, bad moves, direction and poor writing), you'll find this excellent song and dance. - Good to catch a part of the forgotten Black culture. I'm telling you not only the actor - it's really bad!
