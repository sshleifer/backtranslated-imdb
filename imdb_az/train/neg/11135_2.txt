What else can I say? Acting was almost exclusively amateur. Directorate and sustainability were painful. Sceenplay could have been predicted on the final scene and the tiredness of the dialogue. One of the features of the DVD was called "Gag Reel", but most of the film could have been a definition of the reaction of the audience. <br /> <br /> One of the most entertaining things was the director's statement: DVD. He said he had set out to hit a straight face, high production costs and a film that featured his name, and that he was successful. <br /> <br /> Some of the films are explained by film shootings. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most fictional part was a monster. The darkwolf suit was a modified liquid suit (for making 'DVD's' feature) and much more. The masks and claws were better than any shelf shop. Cgi effects were painful and similar to a good video game.
