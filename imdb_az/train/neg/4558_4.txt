Honestly, I was disappointed in the "term of expiration". Super clever hood and an interesting place, but I do not think it surrender. What happened? Do the main character desire to reconnect with native roots? Otherwise, he needed to overcome his fear of death. However, his life was not set up as a man who lived in fear, but his life should be worse now, after his coming to the Day of Judgment. I did not get it. Meanwhile, the supporting characters in the film did not seem to have come up with a comprehensive story. All of these were those who worked in parallel with the main character. It looked more like a coincidence than a curse. Who Curses a Family? Why? When? Finally, why did not he plan to stay in her apartment on her birthday all day? These are my criticisms, but I liked Seattle's shooting, the cinematography was fine, and it did well when it was not outstanding.
