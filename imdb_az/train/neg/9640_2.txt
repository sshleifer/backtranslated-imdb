I was always interested in this movie because it was hard to find, so when I stumbled on Ebay, forked for over $ 10 and bought it, and now I understand why it's so rare! This movie is very bad, so it's a low and low budget that ends up showing all the cut scenes that their lines are packing is exactly the highlight of the movie. The film refers to a psychic (Pettyjohn, apparent reason, for the topless scene) using this power to experiment with an experimental machine to attract other objects to this reality. When he's throwing some sort of object into the box, the soldier throws him to the back of a truck to keep him unarmed, and gee, what do you know? SURPRISE! A kid in a foam rubber wolf suit, instantly kills his face with a scratch, then runs to a nearby town. But to place a half-armed force to find the district and protect the public with responsibility, just leave it to Pettyjohn and Ray to find himself, but this movie has never lost its reliability. It just runs out of No. 1 because of my sense of humor, and some have to warn the manufacturer of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but they do not know it anymore! From 2 to 10 really is really bad!
