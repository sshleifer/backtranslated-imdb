Ok, I rented this movie because of directorship ... in the past (if you have not seen Waxork, it's a fun drive) has made some interesting slips. Anyway, I had doubts about this movie since the beginning, but I decided to process it. This is bad. Very bad. Against those who have not seen the film and want to read it in advance. Above all, the old word "you can not judge by the cover of the book" is here. The box for this flick emphasizes Jill's long haired fox. The back of the box is Jill and a few other shots. The description wants to rent a movie, because it's good. You started watching him and suddenly you know that the film will not happen in 1977. Jill is not a girl with a cover, but a common dog. The film is not as advanced as you think ... and it's not a good thing. The cartoon is so embarrassing that motivation is so modest without any modicities ... it is ashamed to watch. 10 minutes before the end of Dolph's film, and another woman has no basic cause. What was another point of killing another lady who was helping her with Dolph. When the author read Anthony Hickox script, he had seen a stinker. If it had been put into the underworld of the new millennium and did not make the symbols half-elegant, it would have been worth it. Building in 70 does not make any sense and does not make any story. Avoid!
