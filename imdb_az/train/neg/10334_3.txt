A spectacular story repeatedly kills The Psychic. The heroes and the plot are not entirely interested (Fulci's films are, in fact, an indispensable factor), and no displacement is found anywhere. Insufficient degree - in the end, you are not afraid of anxiety, but you will not face boredom (and like me, maybe it's not just starting to fall asleep). Jennifer O'Neill's performance is worthy of a good movie. Fulci gorehounds cautious - just goes on "The Psychic". <br /> <br /> 3/10
