(English), it appears to have been a bit of a deal with the Devil and a connection to a powerful hungry ruler seeking Philosser Stone and wanting gold for the golden (sister's) gold. Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and has little to do with killing people when she thinks she's threatening her position or needs blood for her virginity. She is basically caught by the love of the lady and by an alchemist she is working on, and it is, unfortunately, the most devastating and madness of the devil. When trying to hit each other with big sticks, there are at least some interesting parts, such as jousting and growing men, and the movie has at least a good look for it, but there's so little to advise on. For Molina / Naschy's movie it is not really any unexpected humor, and is not afraid of anything, and most unusual, small in the way. Therefore, from 10 to 4.
