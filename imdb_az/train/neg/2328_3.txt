I have recently seen and need to say that I have been transferred to the actual story of the story. But Holly, like a movie, did not work a lot. But I am very pleased to see a documentary produced by the producers of this film. I think it would be more attractive than this movie. International cast, B-class actors, but their performance was appropriate and I gave a special promise to a young actress who played Holly. This was his first movie role and he did a very good job, considering that he was the most difficult part of it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Unfortunately, despite the most favorable opinion of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, both of these actors were unforgettable and did not do the best of this movie. <br /> <br /> I believe in the message and intentions of the film, but I must be fair, so I value the Holly 3 star as a film based on its shortcomings. But I think this theme is worthy of a serious evaluation, and we are delighted to have written a documentary on the fact that the people behind the film may have hoped to have their debut on the BBC and other television networks.
