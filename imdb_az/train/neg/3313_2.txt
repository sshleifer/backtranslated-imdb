How can anyone say that this movie is a comedy? If I had not gone with me, I'd lie down and I would return my money. I love Gwen Paltrow, but I was in the wrong group. I love lots of chick sticks, but I hate this hate. This is the time I saw so many breaks and I did not repeat. These outfits were an extreme way. No one speaks this way and I do not think so. The dance part was terrible. Then he told me ... "Did not you want this part? I did not think life was sensitive?" Yes, I just said to protect her feelings. Now, I know why we do not marry. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.
