For Gary Busey and Fred Williamson, I thought friends were police. They are on the Busey landing scene, but do not look up to the movie for about 40 minutes. Every scene in it is awesome. <br /> <br /> What an incredible plot about this movie. In the film, Fred Williamson tries to find out who kills and kills sex operators. At one point I think he is Busey. But it turns out that I'm only partly right. Busey is not a killer, but women are calling and raping women. Why? I dont know. It is not connected with the killer in any way, and I think it is only for the kick.
