It is difficult to know what this adaptation is like, because I think the problem begins with the book itself. Alexander McCall Smith worked for the detective stories but not for an inexplicable Africa's indebted and totally deceptive view. <br /> <br /> What did Borat do for Botswana, what Borat did for Kazakhstan, how successful it is, but it's a fact. <br /> Once I realized that Jill Scott was shot as an American singer / actress, Mma Ramotswe. If she should represent an African land, she is not a African woman but a black woman? He is not only American in the game; Mma Makutsi is performed by Anika Noni Rose. Both women play very much and are very far from being attractive. Both of them brutally kill the local accent and both of them pay full attention to this cruelty that they can not offer a lot to operate. Scott Mma Ramotswe is bouncy, cute and gentle. <br /> <br /> Rose Mama Makutsi is an annoying motorcyclist. <br /> <br /> The result is almost inevitable. The main task is realized with the participation of Lucian Msamati, who just returned to a decent performance like JLB Matekoni. Hes is cleverer and closer to books, but I am unable to blame Habakkuk for it - it's just a shining light in the ocean. <br /> <br /> For me, McCall Smith has always been exposed to high-level entertainment. It refuses to edit. As a result, in his books, there are signs that change the boundary grammar in science and the name of the average penalty. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the writer group on this project has worsened. <br /> <br /> Now the dialogue is basically Anglicised. Symbols talk about "open" and "sensitivity to needs." Mma Ramotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni openly flirt. <br /> <br /> Mma Makutsi does not have a computer, but she does not have a MacBook in her handbag along with her Visa card, considering her long hair, makeup and jewelry. <br /> Are we here? It's hard to deal with this terrifying adaptation, because in fact, most of the things I love about the original books are apocryphal. McCall Smith is a so-called Botswana dye filled with cute, non-hazardous black people full of entertaining and delicious wise nuggets. Despite the linguistic transgressions, he sings well, but a white man has a black man's appearance. <br /> <br /> Taking into consideration that this show is not as stupid as it does. Nevertheless, the European and American audience can even be warned.
