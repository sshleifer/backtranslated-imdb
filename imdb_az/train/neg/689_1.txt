What is this ...........? Of course, the film, the parameter, and the camera's greatest loss should be. I do not know that you can not set expectations for 80's slasher, but it's too foolish for the truth. I downloaded this movie for $ 0.89 and I still call for my money back. <br /> <br /> Who is this violent murderer in this movie, and what is his motivation? It really was not possible. And why not? Manufacturers of this trash did not believe. They did not try to create tension. Director (Stephen Carpenter - easier to find money with a similar name) supposed Kindred (1986) was pretty enjoyable and recently Soul Survivors did. Of course, they were crying, but at least Eliza Dushku was. This trail is Daphne Zuniga's debut! (Who?) Yes, that's right, Melrose Place chick. Its very memorable character lasts about 15 minutes. after opening loans. He's the second man to die. The first victim will die directly in the first minute, but nobody remembers it or afterwards, who looks at it? The rest of the actors ... Actually, they do not pay the actors, they are not interested. <br /> <br /> My modest idea is 0/10
