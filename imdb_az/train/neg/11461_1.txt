Please do not lose + 2 hours of your life following this movie - do not just do it. Especially if someone lucky to delay you on your side. If you ask me, damn cheek. I waited for something - never happened. I am not one of those who refuse to follow the path of a movie. I always have to see it until the end. What a great mistake. Give yourself a blessing and put a wall and watch the dry - more entertaining. Please do not lose + 2 hours of your life following this movie - do not just do it.
