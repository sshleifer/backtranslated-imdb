A few days ago, I went to see it and it's hard to forget this movie for the wrong reasons. This movie should not be funny, it's not a laugh in the theater (probably for Jos√© Garcia and Gerard Depardieu) and it's boring, drilling, boring. Sometimes it was difficult to understand what he was saying. They speak only fast and do not open enough to understand. I met a friend and caught me more than 4 or 5 times after a line of "what, what he said" was funny, and I was French. <br /> <br /> Given that I think good movies are coming here, I would like to apologize to all the foreigners who have seen the movie (as shown outside of France). We apologize for this cr @ p. 2/10
