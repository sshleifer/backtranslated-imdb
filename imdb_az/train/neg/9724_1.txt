Poor Slave Hopper. He has directed the classic "Texas Chaimsaw Massacre" all the time. Since then, everything he did was horrible. This is probably the worst ... and says a lot. These things (and people) are about a guy (Brad Dourif) who is capable of shooting ... or something like that. It's a tough idea (anyone remembers the Firestarter?) This is a real mixture ... Everything is wrong! Strange action (even Dourif!), Asinine scripts, loust production values, malicious special effects ... everything is BAD !!!!! I have to run away ... it's not good for laughs.
