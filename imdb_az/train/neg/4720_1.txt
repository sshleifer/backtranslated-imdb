When I saw this "documentary", I was disappointed to see once again the Serbian propaganda. Although Serbia and its nationalist policies are the main cause of the breakup of Yugoslavia, it is not a "documentary" that says that Bogdanovich is a Serbian and that he is far from being objective. One of the lies that Milosevic's regime accuses. Everyone, though the Serbians were justified and victimized, most of the war criminals in The Hague were Serbs, although Serbs committed genocide against Bosnia and attacked all the independent states attacking Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia. The UN did not allow the United Nations because of the Serbs did not want the federal Yugoslav government to influence its nationalism, so Slovakia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia have to be independent states to protect their interests. It is interested in an objective document about the breakdown of the Yugoslavia region, and that fact is not a document. You are prepared by "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation", "Discovery Channel" and "BBC".
