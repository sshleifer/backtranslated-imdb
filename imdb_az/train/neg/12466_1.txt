After hearing a lot about the movie, I did not expect to get a DVD. What a disappointment! It turned out to be one of the most mixed films I've ever seen. Because it was impossible to follow the story line, many other characters were presented. At least in the first half of the film, George Clooney was rewarded for the film because he had a hard time. My husband and I waited an hour after the anger and stopped on the DVD. I think it's fast moving, so I decided to check if the end was good, but after a lot of chaos, I decided to make the best of it. One worker told me that many movies were "coming together" at the last minute or less. I was happy to not spend another hour. I gave the DVD the following day.
