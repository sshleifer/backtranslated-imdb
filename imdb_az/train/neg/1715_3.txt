It contains facts that are not very common, though this is not true. They enjoyed the freedom to carry out the events of the 1930s, to exclude people and to use sets that did not meet the philosophy of their lives. At different times, the network was more than just Bonnie, Clyde and W.D., and it had to do with facts as they were. Buck and Blanche went to Clyde to go far ahead of a shot and actually turned into a crime. Some of the events described in the day really happened at night. Bonnie was worse and never recovered. It was so bad that he had to move around one another, and he even got up, as he had strayed. Clyde also went on a mentality because he cut a big finger in the prison. I know that I was a votive and television movie, but without these actual errors in the story of truth, the film is moving from the incident to the event very fast and comes as more than a few moments of life <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong>
