A great thing about the movie is its name. In this case, the "Snake on the Airplane" book is not an example of judging, but the title is not about the movie. When I went to the event, I did not wait for Citizen Kane, on Independence Day, I was expecting a movie with a purely popcorn, but instead I called the movie Roy Liotta "Turbulence". Well, how bad is SOAP. Only one thing makes SOAP better than its name. Not the real title of the film, it did not have anything like a 40-minute snake or an airplane! What a fake advertisement! If not for the title, SOAP would be just another unforgettable cheap B grade summer movie. And R rating? All the time has to be the most unfair R movie! Producers of the film add a few words for one R, the whole of violence is stored at pg-13. Do you really know what R is? R superstar Edge! Instead of putting money into the snake, look at Summerslam!
