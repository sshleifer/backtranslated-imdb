I'm very disappointed with this movie. I do not know a lot about the real story, so I was keen to teach myself to play a part of the film and learn a bit of history. Together with such a powerful story and great actor, it seemed like a strange merger. Well, somewhere scenarios succeeded them. Was it so scattered - a film about his childhood? his love life? is his disability? his speaking ability? passion for the disabled? I'm sure there is a way to put all this into a good story, but this is not a movie. I was afraid to watch the characters, not for their own disabilities, but for their own personality. Other minor gripes: 1. Heavy sound soundtrack. There are seventy of them - WE WANT TO KNOW! 2. If we had such a philosophical public listener, why did not we have been treated here more than one piece - and even later in the assemblies?
