** GREAT USE <br /> The government continued to develop UniSol UniversalSoldier software. Soldiers are now stronger and more likely to suffer earlier. The government is down, the project is in danger and threatens the supercomputer in the middle, so it takes steps to ensure its safety. It activates and controls UniSols, and the mayhem starts running. Only Deveraux (Van Damme) stops them. <br /> <br /> This movie is about something. Conflict fight. The story is bad and soon drowns in all battles. No matter what happens, they fight in the place they go. Unfortunately, for this movie, no entertainment that follows a fight you know is part of it. You normally believe that they will win the hero, but I still want to feel that battles are among the warriors equally. It is not immoral and I can not lose it. Then it is a tool to extend fights. Wait until the last battle when Deveraux finds a way to beat his undefeated opponents in a miraculous way. To make my thinking even worse, a delicate and safe sign of a bad film is how small the women are. Yes, indeed, there are not many of them because most of the characters are men (at least one woman is UniSol), but almost every woman should be shown at least once in the column. Women should go this way, but we also have a strip club (using very little computer) with very cold women. These moments do not give the story a story and will try to ask the adolescent thinker. <br /> So, in the end, drilling battles happen. No, less. Well, maybe less ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
