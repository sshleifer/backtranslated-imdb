In the 1980s, Derek produced a number of decent proposals to win the title of "the worst movie of all time", and this is probably the main achievement in these stages. In fact, this film may be part of the "very bad, good" category, along with Edward Wood Jr's or Doris Wishman's beloved products. <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn has shot a strange danger at the time, but this randy as a ghost performs incredibly bad because it is incredibly bad. To be believed.
