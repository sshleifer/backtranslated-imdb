Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips from "Dead and Breakfast"), she still returns to her home, still living with her grandmother, Fay Dunaway, inherited from her immortal brother.

Jennifer seemed cold, distant, casual and narcissistic, and grandmother seemed dignified, sad and narcissistic. <br/> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;">
