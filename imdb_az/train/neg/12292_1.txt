We brought this movie as a joke to our friend and could have been the worst joke to play. The movie is difficult to wait and the player is strange. The worst child player and Hasslehoff does not give a poor performance. The field is shameful and we would wonder what hell is at the point where we are very bored. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
