I thought it would be for many cars and cool cars to gawk because I was watching it. I was lying. This movie is very boring. <br /> <br /> Film Kip Raines (Giovanni Ribisi) checks whether the right car is sitting on the edge of the Porsche dealer. When they confirm that they are true, Kip takes a bricks from the luggage and seizes it in the window. He gets Porsche when his wife gets keys. They start and go to the night. The police bring him to a warehouse to persecute him. So, the whole crew carries all the cars and goes on separate routes. Then we get an idea of ​​Memphis Raines. A gang of talking on a go-kart is a bit of a talk. Then he is facing Atlee Jackson (Will Patton). Atlee told Memphis that her brother, Kip, was deep * bleep *. Memphis is known as one of the most famous car thieves in Los Angeles. Memphis manages a parrot and meets with Raymond Calitri (Christopher Ecclesten). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first 48: Memphis, Looking for a team of Cage and Duvall and watching movies every hour when planning. The last 12 hours of the movie is a waste! <br /> <br /> 2. The Cars: You may see 10 cars out of 50, as advertised in the movie. So what are the other 40 cars? Why not see them? 3. The Chase: The pursuit at the end of the movie was a joke. <br /> <br /> Dog: In the movie together, the dog eats a burger and slices three buttons. It is impossible. The keys were opened. Switches would be a serious damage to the esophagus, peptic ulcer, and large intestines. The kids propose to give dog lacquers to push it. It will not work. The dog will get diarrhea, but there is no key. Jackass said after hitting a toy car in Ryan Dunne's rectum. There are many signs of dizziness, but no car. <br /> <br /> <strong> It is in the same position as the Alliance. <br /> <br /> During the Chase: Cop: Eleanor breaks in a few minutes, Nicholas Cage runs hopelessly to start the car. You see the police cruise behind his wife. However, when Nicholas Cage reboots the engine again, the police officer heads his head on the right, sees the car and begins to follow. It's stupid. So when he heard of the engine start and saw the car he knew that he was the car he was looking for. How does he know that he is the right car? <br /> <br /> Generally, the film is boring. No action. There are very few vehicles. The film is foolish. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 10-year-old 1 star. Instead, be quick and angry.
