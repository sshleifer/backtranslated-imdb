I read all this reviews about how to do this kind of good movie. Jeez, this movie was predictable and pretty dull. The player was most of the time, especially by Mckenna. I have never seen a worse attempt to make someone badass in a movie. O human, this film was an excitement. I also read somewhere that may be a cult classic. <br /> <br /> The script knows that the author has tracks, but this movie was just an average movie. <br /> <br /> The scenario was naked, on the contrary, the player was naked, this movie was naked. <Br / <br /> <br /> Oh, pray for the guy who used to be Cheers. It looks really bad. <br /> <br /> The best actor in this movie was probably a man in Office Space, and only about 8 minutes in this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
