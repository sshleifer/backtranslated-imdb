In 1977, this cult movie has two crazed lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp), who appear to be hoping to find an invisible dwelling in the home of a wealthy socialist, Dr. George Manning (Seymour Cassel). But, taking into account their plans, George's wife begins to control his place of residence when they are out of town, shut up George and kill an infant when they destroy one evening. A strange and entertaining movie, but both give the same oddity as the end of the movie. Most will not love him or will be captured in this ridiculous movie about 30 minutes later. In some ways, some of them regard it as a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
