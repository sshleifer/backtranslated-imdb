I rarely write to IMDb.com, but I am afraid that potential audience will not be afraid of this movie. Just horrible. I love Shaw Bros movies (I am not cunning) and I had so many expectations as I participated in the many "10 Best Kung Fu / Martial Arts Movies" sites. (Now, I believe all 10 best lists are cut-and-paste jobs). First of all there is no movement in the film. Most of the film talks about the plot, it's a wonderful job, because it's the best. And in 1978, the movement itself could have been effective, but it was regular in line with today's standards. A special warning to Netflix users: they are terrible; picture is terrible and not even at 16: 9.
