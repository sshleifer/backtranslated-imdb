Poorly-haunted house trailers find an American family in a 200-year-old home in Japan where a severe murder loves a suicide triangle. <br /> <br /> The Roman setting is very interesting to the horror of this move by the director of the Motel Hell. The film creates zero declines and rarely consists of stunning scenes that appear to be happening everywhere. <br /> <br /> A clear example is that early manifestations of the man's leadership, as soon as he understands that his home is in a state of the home, is a fairly early scene where he will visit the temple. This monk repeats the history of the house (the viewer is already familiar with the opening sequence) and the film is just another thing. Earlier the priest asked for help. Well, where to help? Families are still worse and worse still, stay in a perennial house and when they return to do what they should do an hour ago, no word of the priest is about to be prepared until the end - try to control the spirits <br /> <br /> American actors suddenly find that the unexpected camp encounters the Japanese spirit and suddenly begins their bad martial arts, perhaps the scene remembers more than the chain duel designed by the same film maker to be more entertaining to the Motel Fire. it is a memorable nightmare.
