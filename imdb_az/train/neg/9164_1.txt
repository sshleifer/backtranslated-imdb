I must say this by saying that I'm a great romantic. Well, I would like to love this movie very much. So, I write your thoughts so that you can keep track of the rest of your portals to get rid of the disappointment I feel. Leap Years, explains a fateful story of Li-Ann's flooded water for Jeremy and is bound to meet each leap year. A very short story and a romantic foundation with a castle that does not feel like you're watching another Jack Neo flick. Why oh why so bad? First, I feel that filmmakers think they are making a music video. Because they chose to replace the story and any real emotions with cheese assemblies, predictable movements and clich√© lines. I was both embarrassed and embarrassed to be one of the first few people to watch the The Leap Years in Singapore, but the men in the movie told us the volumes of the dreams they sounded in these ridiculous performances. My hope, Forever Fever, has so far been a romantic movie that will surpass the best romantic comedy of Singapore and the The Leap Years did not even come close. Some blogs said that the Crap Years were tough, but ultimately true. Do not waste your money or emotions as I do. The film will abandon eternal love.
