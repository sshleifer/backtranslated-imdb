First, lead, Brad Dourif KOOK. If you try to take this movie seriously, then I guarantee you will destroy it for you. If you do not take it seriously, it's really fun. Like our other reviewer, Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif love each other - places where they run away from the arm in the car through the flame shoots. Another major campaign scene, John Landis, is a strange radio show producer. In fact, I found the flair of laughter to stop the last 15 minutes of the movie - I'm not sure if only Tobe Hooper intended to be in this way.
