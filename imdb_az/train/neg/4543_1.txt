<br /> <br /> This film, its direction, scenario and player was totally unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> I tried to explain the story based on the fact that there is a great deal of probability, simplicity and courage in the absence of a script that can not explain the novel. <br /> <br /> Why this film has not been widely circulated in most cities? I do not recommend anyone I know this movie. <br /> <br /> Just one of the worst adaptations I've ever seen is the paradise's less intelligence plan. <br /> <br /> Cinematography was really the only point. But how can this happen when it is shot in a beautiful country like Peru? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time and energy on prospects for prospective viewers.
