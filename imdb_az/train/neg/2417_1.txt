Undoubtedly, it's the worst thing I've ever spent. I feel ugly to acknowledge my hire and really paid for it. It does not even have a trash. No no. It is the water that collects on the base of industrial dumpsters, especially in poor mountainous neighborhoods, after the unusually humid summer. It would be possible to bring garbage everywhere to call trash. It was so bad that I registered at IMDb and warned my comrade. The character of this luvahire claims that this movie is great. One should question himself about the truth. <br /> <br /> "The actor who played Ricky (I forgot his name) did a very good job." <br /> <br /> I see it. Yes, it is true that whenever director Ricky is drowned in a laugh or often overwhelmingly detained, most directors can ask for a harsher response from watchers; Ricky did a great job. <br /> <br /> "I'm not a post-graduate student in theater at school and it's not easy to make a game I'm forced to cry and emotionally on the stage. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it's very important for me. If you're thinking of throwing it out, you can look at another line of buddy, probably if you try to cry, they can help you. <br /> <br /> <strong> I was very surprised to continue, and now my filmmaker Mr. Bangla If you continue to read so much, I took the movie for what you already saw, and now you are looking for one of the two things: 1) Additional vitriolic debate of what you have agreed is a pretty bad movie 2) The extra vitriolic debut that you felt was a good kinematic effort to protect me from such terrible deeds. If you want to, if you do not want to, if you express your soul or ammunition for a mixer repartee, but if I tell you a good thing, it will only disappoint you - so I should assure you that there is no such disappointment. <br /> <br /> Other negative comments on IMDB now regard the film's specific failures (eg acting, noise, leadership, dialogue, editorials, etc.), but all these shortcomings can easily be forgiven, inside and out of themselves . If these elements are required to be the top hook, the lesser will rent a movie called "Living Dead Hood". However, the major faults of Hood do not convey many promises of his name. The Living Dead Hood, practically splashes color in the video store with direct bands and horrific creativity killings. In the ghetto, mixing the mix of zombie film with the reality of life, undoubtedly, was a chance for the rabbit to bomb the innocent lives of zombies in order to have all the slopes of the pimps. their numerous deadly ways. The mix of two genres could have been fun. Instead, the film plays more lines like watching secondary school children, but they do not understand. In order to experience the betrayal by the video-rental audience, I suggest that Quiros Brothers resubmit their film with the following title: "The dead of the dead are: last weekend we shot a video camera with some friends". Or maybe they can release a documentary. "Daytime creativity is dead: An investigation that a low-budget movie may not be a perfectly clever or genuine idea, even if it does not have a big movie." A potential tenant who does not lose his life should find the following blurb behind the video: "Quiroz Brothers once again proved that you can easily do things yourself." - Mr. Bangla
