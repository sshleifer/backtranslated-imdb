There are two scenarios of sexual assault on any of the official views of this movie, so people can not believe that they are not aware. This kind of behavior of our culture is not merely sexual, but violent. The biggest problem with my film is that it does not seem to condemn these attacks because none of the women who have been attacked or harassed for many times are responsible for their actions and do not belong to anyone. If someone tells her that she will not be forced to love you by saying, "You do not punish a woman with sex," she is reprimanded by a woman's point of view, the film is a shock. This type of women, as well as experienced warriors and leaders, "throws a bone", but the film is more romanticized - human sex is characterized by the inequality of power and the concept that men should judge. These beautiful combat fighters do not use any of his attacking skills and try to protect those who attack him. He does not even apologize to them - on the contrary, SHE does not apologize. In general, with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes, but not as good as a hero by a long shot, a smashing and swimming film.
