I saw the name of this movie, and I always thought it was musical. It's like The Harvey Girls. It is not. This cooked pudding fluttered into the kitchen ceiling and mixed with each other. It's not a music, it's a piece of time, it's totally unbelievable. Patriarch James Woods, the eldest child of a small child who grew up to become Barbara Stanwyck <br /> <br /> We think that's why it is a historical genocide tale. And for a short time. Later, cold-blooded Stanwyck's lawyer turned to the story of his fight with George Brent. Why did she put her dead? Why else? As we learned from a strange flashback series narrated by Stanwyck, she had thought that she would be able to earn some money (for her sister as well as for her) for a couple of times. <br /> <br /> <strong> Brent </ strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Therefore, he loves himself. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Young is played by Gig Young. Another sister tried to get her. Etc., and so on. <br /> <br /> It's a complicated, complicated mix - it's fairly mobile, but without logic or expediency.
