But many doubt that it is sad to see this movie. Or "Some movies appeared". <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong> <span style = "font-weight: did not come: everybody wants to talk to him and does not want to meet with him every day, even though his brother has left his story to talk with Frankie-boy more than once! Even his beloved brother a woman who wants Stacey Keach, looks like one of the ridiculous "Mike Hammer" episodes, and like Stacey Keach, the Frankie-boy feels the dream of a good-looking woman In real life, someone like Sinaatha (without fame) MacLaine but there is another way around this Hollywood movie: MacLaine is totally nuts about Frankie-boy, but he could not care less! In Sinatra films, he often plays "cool" shades and is rarely valid Dean Martin is one MacLaine is a charming, but caricaturous, as one cartoon player, but not just a card player, but one of the main problems with the cartoons. The main characters are all sorts of stereotypes of all bad or seen-before films and cheap novels; Frankie is a "cool cat" who came to town to get all the women and "less able to care about writing" (this is nearly the end result of the recognition of the garners); Martin sleazy, but a friendly card player; MacLaine is dumb, but very loved bimbo; Frankie's blonde love is a literary expert; A successful man married to Frankie's nephew's wife and having a bad marriage; and so on. Clichés. <br /> <br /> The story contains several coincidences for my tastes: Frankie only joins his brother in one place; his nephew gets away from his father when he first kisses the secretary; <br /> <br /> Therefore, a fun guy to kill his son Frankie-boy is trying to find him in the carnival of everywhere! The place is full of typical noise and chaos - plus an evening - and yet a man finds Frankie (although drunk as a doorknob) and throws him. But guess who killed her. MacLaine. Jump in front of the bullet to save Frankie: a cliché that can be overwhelmed by comic writers. This absolutely miserable, very dramatic and boring end, of course, can not benefit any imagination, even semi-intelligent, from the audience. And MacLaine and Sinatra get the same day they're getting married! The writer of this nonsense, the unfortunate novels, seems to have read his whole life - what else is written in this film? There is even a card game, with Frankie and Martin, encountering some cliche cartoons from the writers' "lively" imagination. Sinatra is a simple thing to do is dull snotty nose bimbo and crazy about not seeing too much MacLaine. As the film progresses, Sinatra finds MacLaine to be too dumb for her, because the blonde finds out that Bimbo is too low for Sinatra. MacLaine-related script has a certain snobbishness and sadness. MacLaine is treated as worthless by everyone while the blonde bimbo is treated as a princess and an intellect; this mock truth is that the latter character is very weak and completely intellectual; his behavior, his interpretations and his thoughts are mostly cliché, foolish, mixed, ambitious, and primitive. At least MacLaine's character knows that he (MacLaine) is dumb. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ em> <br /> </ em> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; <br /> <br /> <strong > You are interested in reading the "biographies" of Shirley MacLaine and other Hollywood intellectuals, please email me.
