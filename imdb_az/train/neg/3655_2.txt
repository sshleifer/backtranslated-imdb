Oh in my opinion, this can be the only cheesiest movie I've ever seen. I'm serious, it's one of the latest b-films. The first proof is this $ 5 DVD. No, this is very important. <br /> <br /> I lived in a samurai in Japan in the 17th century, where a few days ago, her name was Mayeda, and the King of Spain was sent off on an epic journey to earn 5,000 crocodiles. A stormy storm in the sea swept through the precious gold that he intends to buy and is almost their life. Mayeda should fight for everything to save his life and secure his beloved Japan. "Then he continues to say," A multi-million-dollar action adventure epic "on the three continents. <br /> <br /> I must have seen a different movie, it was epic, and it was $ 1 million, of course, Shogun Mayeda 'is really crazy adventures in the Mayeda (Sho Kosugi), which is really Engrish speaking, but it is not important, but it is important that he enriches a castle called' Monty Python and Holy Grail 'and his own samurai mind his ability to demonstrate his power is really a wonderful impression of John Cleese. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing about this movie is Sho Kosugi's Engrish, with almost all of a good film shooter missing, but the most delicate strange lines, and honestly, really want something else? You can accelerate the "Shogun Mayeda" to the end, <br /> <br /> 2/10 - So too much cheesy.
