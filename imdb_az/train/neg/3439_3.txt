<br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> For example, if you have not left anywhere with the worst CGI I've ever had If there were bad things like sharks, I would definitely make this part, I tried to stop seeing the rest of the film. For some people it will not be a mood, sometimes it is home ... For example, take a scene where one of your comrades died and what they did next. nop, do not cry ... tell each other stories of horror. <br /> <br /> Another stupid thing, hundreds of "candles ... boat deck curtains (old suitcases covering windows) and sofas / coupes ... I do not think using pines, I thought it was dumb, except for being alone in the sea ... <br /> <br /> Well, some scary scenes, they have a nice way of doing things sometimes horror works better, when it's hiding behind something, but this movie is good, maybe it's a low budget she does not know, but it works fine for me! <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> Do not expect too much! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> /> <br />
