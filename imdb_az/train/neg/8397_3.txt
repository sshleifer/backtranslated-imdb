After reading previous comments, I'm glad I was not the only person left in the last 20 minutes. John Carradine, two times going to the cemetery and closing the lid after himself. I was a bit surprised at this cynical behavior ... of course, there was something wrong with the house, but the first rising body (hereafter Zombie # 1), these scenes did not make any sense. Please, if you know that Carradine is riding in a madrassa, then leave us the rest! <br /> <br /> All movements are limited to the last 20 minutes, so I will make a report. John Carradine goes to the cemetery to investigate and twists Zombie # 1. So far so good. But then we get the confusing scene where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler discover dead body of Carradine for a few months' shooting in the cemetery. Strickler has repeatedly tried to push Ireland into an open graveyard after climbing from zombie # 1, but Ireland has turned it into an open grave and PRESTO! Strickler Comes Like Zombie # 2! Yes, I think that Strikle will die all the time, but why nothing flies to the tomb of Zombie # 1, if it changes from its normal appearance to the rotten-to-constellation version. (Given that the zombies are moving too slowly, I thought it would stay in its "normal" form until it was over). This scene also brings a question - just Hack IS Zombie # 1 ??? We can only assume that Zombie # 1 is one of the victims of the original murder during the opening credit, but we know who is what and why we have special sorrow for the film crew. <br /> <br /> Anyway, then, Ireland sees this transformation and runs away, as we've seen for Zombie # 1, Zombie # 2 has been shattered through the trees as MORE USE. (This leads to sudden confusion about how many zombies actually exist). The best film of 1950 is leaving for Ireland. <br /> <br /> Along with this, Zombie # 1 has repeatedly squeezed the air in the house of the Prophet (saas). He easily sends three crew members and then opens the stairs. Faith Domergue is listening to her, and her lover, John, slips back to Ireland by night. Only after seeing Zombie # 1, he allows him to shout and retrieve a bedroom with an Irish revolver. Starlet Carole Wells is currently in the shower and can not hear the scream, her co-star Charles Macauley (who is boozing and smoother in a mirror in her bedroom). After finishing his sweet time (and a few hours later in the hip-bottle), he finally decided to investigate. (Something that hit the audience in the last quarter of this film is how the stars will scream and answer the weapons). Domergue is armed in the hallway and ready, but Macauley makes a mistake for Zombie # 1 and shoots six times! <br /> <br /> Karole Wells is now out of the shower and when hears the drenches and Domergue's screams; he does not suffer greatly from continuing the investigation. Thus, during this time, Zombie # 1, Domingue covered with a rope. Wells sees Domg√ºlue's hanging body and takes on the dead. Next time, we see that there is a stream outside of the house - but then. However, Ireland restored her feelings and poured into the house where Zombie found the bloody massacre # 1. Though talking about three people killed in Ireland, she is concerned that her film is exposed and damaged! Zombie # 1, a good neighbor for her (and viewers), shoots a series of film-makers at the top of the 2nd floor. That's what we've seen in Zombie # 1. At this point, the audience is being treated with the assemblage of all deaths and the new ones show the "mirror" from the past. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zombie # How did it come from there? Zombie # 1 took him down, threw it down, and then raised John the Great to crush Ireland? Apparently, one of the original victims was drowned in the wind, so Wells was forced to drown (but outside of the river, no outside). Zombie # 2 has never been home (now everyone is dead, thanks to Zombie # 1), but instead Carol Wells is in the cemetery. <br /> <br /> When the latter comes to the screen, we're looking at Zombie # 2 with his deadly love, still on the open grave inside the gun. <br /> <br /> The audience was not curious: Yeah, but this is the # 1 tomb of Zombie? Why Did Zombie # 2 Live? And if Zombie comes to # 1 and wants to go back - Zombie # 2 will release it, or will it be a zombie fight? Will the zombie share both the tomb and the new merciful Carole Wells? What does John Carradine, now dead, do? - What will be left? After all, we know from the previous scenes that he is at home in the tomb ... If you are confused with this episode of the finals, do not worry he is not alone.
