Well, my goodness, I'm disappointed. When I first heard the movie "Haunting" of Robert Wise's 1963 film, I was afraid that it would be destroyed by the abundance of summer-cinema-sized visual effects. However, he was deeply downhearted. Undoubtedly, with such an unlucky castle ... De Bont and the company did not destroy the movie, it was a fantastic and intimidating film that understood the original subtle art. Well, gentle, now what's up? My fears appeared ... a promising movie was wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannettin's production design jawed; the movie is shot beautifully; and composer Jerry Goldsmith can never make a mistake. However, the script tests these beautiful players. It only provides the type of stylted dialogue that speaks in cinema. As a result, always beautiful Lili Taylor is the only singer to run away with pride ... and that's just a challenge. But all the crimes of crime, horror were shown to us. We will no longer be able to use our imagination, afraid of the fear of unknown fear. No, we get some visual effects to show what we're afraid of the US ... and what do you know? Visual effects also appear in an unhappy way, as they do in a remarkable way. And the peak is a phantasmogoric mess ... but before the many things were too bad. <br /> <br /> Everything in Haunting is overwhelming and overstated. I'm afraid that monsters in this old haunted house do not have real excitement and sculptures ... only fear. Instead look at the original. <br /> <br />
