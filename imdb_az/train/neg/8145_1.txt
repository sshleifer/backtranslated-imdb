This film is as bad as I could not believe it was. 10, 9, 8 and even 7 voices, are you crazy? Did we really watch the same movie? Or I can say the same thing. Everything is bad in this movie. Story (Is there a story?) It's not a place to go anywhere, it's not entirely related, the player (some dialogues is just ridiculous), music account (what's this?), Editing and especially artistic direction is a disaster. It reminds me of old Macist films ... Mermaid suit is a slippery sleeping bag that clings to it to give an example of the productivity of the production. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> mobile phone. The next shot at a completely different location still sees this mobile phone, even talking to your mobile phone!!! Yes, it lasts so long. <br /> <br /> Great, great, money loss. It's useless.
