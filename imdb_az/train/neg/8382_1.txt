There was a cartoon called "Bugs Bunny". Baby-faced Finster robbed a bank and pulled away the carrier's money and dropped into Bug's rabbit hole. Wearing a baby to enter the bugg hole to make money. The "Little Man", which looks at the mirror of the bathroom with a cigar in its mouth, is straight from the animated film. It was a 5-minute animated film; not many movies. If you really care about it, buy the Bugs Bunny DVD. The first time (1954) is more original. Already, I'll shoot more classic Bugs Bunny cartoons!
