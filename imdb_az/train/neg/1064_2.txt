<br /> <br /> The only intention of this film is to show love in many ways. <br /> <br /> Every story is only a few minutes, the development of characters and there is almost no plot. A single description of a plot. The writer was trying to get the point of departure to surprise the audience. <br /> <br /> It just did not work because you did not know the previous characters or because these "jokes" were just foolishness. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about love that you can not reach. Many times. Or more, I do not know and care about me.
