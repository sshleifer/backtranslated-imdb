Have you ever seen a movie with no long wave? No? What happened to me? Yes, I finally saw someone in my hometown, and I must admit that I know why people do not do it. Technique is "arty" to be sure, but not necessarily for public consumption. Techniques are simply flawed because the viewer is not emotionally distant and may have all the intentions of the director. I do not know, I do not read the minds and I do not know enough about the director to make a decision <br /> <br /> But it's a rude, anti-American sentiment that describes this movie painfully. Like America, I am aware of my country's involvement in the Korean War, and I know well that we are not always angels, but I cursed how this person would take things. According to this blind morality, the Americans were at the root of the war, we were the cause of the war, and we almost destroyed the country alone. No matter what, Mr.. I guess if you did not intervene, are you still kidding this movie in KOMMUNIST? Talk about forgetting your date. While making Allied forces "bad guys," this intends to make the Nazis a "good guy". This film was not so embarrassed to watch that it is so historically naive and virtually inaccurate. According to a human coming from a country that is owed to American intervention, it comes as high and mighty and convicted.
