This is a realistic thing: Joe Besser was the top notch comedian in other situations away from Stooges. There was a certain trace of being too laughable and intelligent. Moe and Larry and Shemp, for a long time, have long been acquainted with her or at least love her job. So what happened on earth when joined forces with the "third stooge"? Obviously, nothing. During the "late Stooge" era, children are often faced with each other or with Joe, and this is not in line with Stooge's rules. Rate Curly for "Everyone for Everyone, For Everyone", and "Sad Tips". Something about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Marx Brothers, stay in one place whenever the chips are really low, and help each other to take advantage of each other or touch each other. None of this is happening in this regard. Say it as a dog fight or fight a dog as a funny or trying to get worse and worse. You think that there is something behind the scenes that happen here, art is imitation of life. Maybe it really was because of Berein Moe and Larry did not stay too long. Look at the history of other teams and tell them I'm wrong.
