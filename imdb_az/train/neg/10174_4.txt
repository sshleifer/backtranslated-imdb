I saw it in 1994 after I was finally released. As you can see, Orion's photos have been bankrupt, and I think the film has not been released a few years ago. <br /> <br /> I remember the details that I have not seen in a while. I remember it as a very boring movie. I did not want to get out of it. The store was not interesting and attractive. The third degree was the imitation of the American Graffiti. <br /> <br /> None of the audience is able to watch it. After reviewing a local newspaper, one of the biggest disappointments he has made is highly appreciated.
