This movie is perfectly designed, unusual garbage. Sometimes I love romantic comedies. To watch something good, eat ice cream for meals. This is not always the case, but the experience is so fashionable that you do not see how unreasonable you are. This movie forced me to think how stupid it was to keep sitting all the time. Everything about it was cheap. In fact, it seems that the film is overturned at certain points that have been washed away. <br /> <br /> <strong> I know that you can usually expect a number of problems in a vocal comedy, but you laugh, because you often do not really care . This film is really strange about sitting there, an incredible series of coincidences and totally incredible behaviors. In the movie, events have been set up to transfer or expose the characters from one scene to another. Of course, this is how all movies work, but you should not realize that this is happening. Intimate. <br /> <br /> In some movies, it's very important for me. They did not have to listen to me while they were away from hell, though they had survived. In the film, the character of Paul Rudd, does not want to deal with a completely lying, surprising, controlled stranger, played by Eva Longoria alone? Also, almost all the heroes chose the simplest solution for a consistent situation. A straight guy wants to become gay for only five years, to hang out (and to bathe) with an attracted woman? Rudd's best sense of how he could come to embrace the happy ending of the same firefighter, a liar-lying lied, kleptomaniac brother. Lake Bell and Eva Longoria are very attractive, attractive women. Maybe they will find something better on the way.
