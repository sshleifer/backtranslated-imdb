Anyone with a very good knowledge of the German cinema, undoubtedly, will tell in the past many films about a young girl facing her boyfriend, along with her mother. If such a movie is shown again to people, give it a new, fresh, and tempting thing to the challenging audience today. The German filmmaker Sylke Enders, whose main protagonist, is everyone who is ill-treated by everyone, including her mother and her lover, is also right. He is brave enough to face any kind of punishment. The Kokko was originally posted on the DV to blast in 35mm format. When croon learns that he wants to be a policeman, technic virtuoso obstructs our joy. The mill is like a hairdresser. If someone says the positive aspect of Sylke Enders, it would be good if Croko's involvement with disabled people resulted in a penalty. The people of punk together with Kroko are unique joy and sadness.
