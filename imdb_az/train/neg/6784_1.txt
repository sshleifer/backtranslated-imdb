<br /> <br /> I tried to watch this movie two times, but even accelerating the parts, but it was still unable to finish it. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how good these reviews are. In my opinion, people who make such good reviews try to betray the film for marketing purposes. Their review appears to be very unreal, and it resembles the inner work, which is more bitter than anything else. The films should give positive comments about their own steam and they will not achieve it! <br /> <br /> The player is a bastard reminiscent of a porn movie and is not funny. I do not know if low-budget movies are bad, they know how to work. <br /> <br /> I have found the president's character to irritate. Her facial expressions and humor were ugly. I used to think that these women were intentional for the assassination to be more pleasant and dry, but even worse. <br /> <br /> The scenario was also very difficult (his executives were overworked) and unfounded sarcastic words. <br /> <br /> Besides some attractive women, I have not been able to find anything about this movie. <br /> <br /> I never felt that the rating was wrong. I was interested in his purpose, but I was afraid of everything. Of course, if you do, you see, but I do not want anyone else to lose their time. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's just me ... Probably not.
