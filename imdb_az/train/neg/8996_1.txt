In the future in 1985, the government committee led by Howard Hesseman is listening to the first uncensored network of television. They are a programming example, playing a series of sketches. On the one hand, I can say good skit films that do not use my finger. "The Amazon Women of the Month", "Kentucky Fried Film", "The Meaning of Life" and "Mike's Mondo Video". I do not notice the "Tunnel Vision". This is the cause of death in the kinematic form of "film". None of the sketches are even laughable, even at least intelligent. <br /> <br /> My price: F <br /> Eye creams: Dodi Dorn full frontal
