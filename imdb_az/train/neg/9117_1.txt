... or maybe it's just bad. The area is a cheap rehabilitation of the first one, it's strange, because it's not a prekail, it's not. Indeed, the whole movie is more funny and impossible, with the scenes that imitate the first time. First, there was a huge cast, this B-list consists of actors and rejects. Acting is basically horrendously bad. Half of the good lines in the film are about every single key, including those that are not included in the first film, as it was originally mentioned first. I understand it's a television series with a pilot episode, but not an excuse. They did not have to convert images to a movie. Only one thing is marginally good and it's erotic sequences. However, these are not the same as those in the first place, which does not exceed one level. If you have the opportunity to see it for free and if you are a flat guy, then you need to check if you want something erotic that is not porn. If not, avoid any costs. 1/10
