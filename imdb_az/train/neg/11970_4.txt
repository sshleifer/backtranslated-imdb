... It was chosen for Lt. First, the film was not terrible, it was Hollywood alone. The worst situation - this is what I need or no-movie scenario: if Willis's mission is to rescue the doctor, but his "people" put him on the first chopper and put those refugees on the border without him. She would not hand over her package for refugees. How it does not work. But as I said, it's Hollywood, we should be a drama. That's why we're filming, because the truth is not that complicated. But I would think that Willis and the good doctor were working chemistry. That is, there are some good battle scenes in the film. Not the waste of time, but the "Tears of the Sun" dvd rent. On a rainy day, check it out and you will agree.
