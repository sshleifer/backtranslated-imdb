I'm a big sign of Neil Young music and, at the same time, hit the first show of Greendale, where I found the shining description of the film shot in a very sub-press circle. <br /> <br /> Neyl says that this movie started as a noise, and the characters were so vital that they were very excited. just drew a soundtrack movie. It's not the best way to prepare a story. No character really has a foot and when the "important" events take place, the audience does not care because the cinema's worries are so high. The film is all about the song, and when it's over, the heroes of the last word read the words as they read it ... the technique works for the first tape and then opens its nerves. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> Poor lighting. The only kudos that can give the film belongs to a few scenes such as news, but little has been done to make this movie more available today. It's a good soundtrack, but I can not buy anything. It's a bad movie.
