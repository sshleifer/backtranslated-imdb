Oh, I've heard very well about this movie. I went to meet my closest friend (he, woman, and I am a woman). Now, give me a different idea than the main line. If you take a few nineteen "dresses", we both feel the strange combination of tranquility and boredom. We laughed (and not), we were dozed (and it would have been better to stay in bed), we were sure that we had spent the spare time on money. And we were. The assassination was contradictory and was a group of people who could not think of the heroes. Loss of money, loss of celluloid. This film does not deserve even one of the ten votes, but it's the least available. I'm sure why this film has a reputation for being perfect; I do not recommend it to anyone who has even taste or intelligence.
