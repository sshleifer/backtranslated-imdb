The latest Tarzan film, starring Johnny Weissmuller (looking from a stunning age after Tarzan and Huntress), can help make it look better, despite all the triumphs. RKO has made a big farewell to Weissmuller and thinks that Andrea Palma, the country's best star, and many award-winning cinematographers, Gabriel Figueroa, have attempted to shooting a beautiful site in Mexico and bringing them to the prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin. Although less costly for shooting, Acapulco uses real pyramids such as Aquatania and the Aquatania, but it's more expensive than any RRO movie, but it's built on exterior rock especially for all scenes of the Balu temple.) Kurt Neumann , Robert Florey should remain a director rather than a slower one. Neumann has done a good job with Tarzan and Amazon, Tarzan and Leopard Women and Tarzan and Huntress, and a year before his death in the classic "The Fly". Florey became the director of television, after a few wonderful movies. If Weissmuller is tired, the Cheetah chimpanzees are not as good as others, but the worst character is Caribbean ambiance in Benji, Africa and Mexico. The dad, who had no doubts and suspicion, was a conscience of Weissmuller for Tarzan.
