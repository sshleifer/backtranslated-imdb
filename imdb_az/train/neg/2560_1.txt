Well, I watched last night and did not do anything terribly straight forward. There was no beating around the bush that this child was an anti-Christ. But the film was just bad. For example, the incident with the dentist did not explain to the "accident" how the police miraculously once was built at home, and still rescued children to save their children without police. Death scenes were just really bad and not fun. The children they chose to play Anti-Christ were teasing and could really choose a better child. Do not just waste time watching it.
