Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a pupil of the Devil's / Serial Killer, "First Power": after being captured by the detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and after being executed on the gas chamber, he continues to be spiritually body-minded and committed. <br /> <br /> Attractive psychic Tess seaton (Tracy Griffith, half sister of Melanie G.) tries to stop Channing. <br /> <br /> This concept is likely to have some possibilities, but in the end, the First Power suffers from the usual comedy and film structure. This is something we have never seen before, and sometimes we're getting better. There is nothing to distract from the excitement of any supernatural horror except this film. The more points, the more exciting and certainly not scary. Phillips is a tough sale like a tough nail, stupid police stereotype, and Griffith does not seem to work too hard; <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> br /> 4/10
