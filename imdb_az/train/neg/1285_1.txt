Born in Scotland, grew up and educated. It did not seem to me that there was more or less cattle rustier than this untouchable description of an animal. Even worse, the subject of the whole movie is sexually or otherwise, sexually or otherwise. In Scotland in the 18th century, many sexually abusive and homosexuals lived to consider this. Lange was a joke at the age of 49 when he was a "young" mother, but Liam Neeson was even worse! Taking a "hammam" in favor of a Scottish is not unusual as we described it - but it gave us another opportunity to demonstrate that we were sexually explicit. You can save money and watch Pinnochio.
