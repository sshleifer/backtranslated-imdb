The writers probably did not have any experience in the army and probably did not look at any history books, but I still give credit to this black-and-white production movie for a long-term look at the role of black soldiers in the Second World War. br> <br /> Movement is mixed and incredible - any episode of fight! There are better production values, but casting is interesting. I saw the New York giant Rosie Greer and paid for it. The direction of art is fifth - men have worn the Korean War, and when the US Army arrived in Germany in 1944, it was not so sunny and like Northern California. . It is not clear at the scenario that black troops were never used as combat soldiers. <br /> <br /> This idea of ​​the main story (the racist southern civilian who ordered the black soldiers), instead of the M-1s, is carrying the Springfield rifle. ) should then become a big budget product and it is not too late to try it now. <br /> <br /> I remember that this was a while ago, and I remember thinking that it was built in Italy. In 1944, there were black fighters operating there.
