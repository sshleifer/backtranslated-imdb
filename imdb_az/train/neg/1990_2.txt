This can be a strong candidate for "The Worst Sniper Flick Ever". Probably can be tolerated as a child's film without John Hurt's participation. However, all of these attempts TRAGEDY, John Hurt, one of the greatest actors on the screen, reduces himself so much ... Only Mr Hurt has given me two points ... AWAY I scored 8 points because he did not run fast enough. The remainder of the rest is simply terrible. Janine Turner can not move to save her life. And the leading actor, AWFUL for all intentions and purposes. If you can save yourself from this embarrassment, please do so. It's so bad, almost HURTS.
