Taking into account the quality of actors and the fact that Scott's brothers are involved, I really looked at this show. Unfortunately, my hopes are cut off! At the same time, we believe that the KGB is an unsatisfactory group. At one point, there is a funny scene where 4 KGB agents can not handle a CIA agent. I was tired of this prejudiced, one-sided, and completely incomplete picture of the Spy game during the Cold War. I think it's ridiculous that the US is not able to shoot objective films about their presence on WW2 and beyond. <br /> <br /> Like the U51a's unpleasant rule, we believe the United States has repeatedly denied the Enigma machine. <br /> <br /> According to the loan, the company has been well-built and operated. Places are also well implemented. Alfred Molina exhibits a great performance like Keaton (The conflict between them is very good). I really like this show and will surely end up watching the other 2 episodes, but I really like the US production of their Spies, military servicemen and so on. The planet that is so superior to everyone that is very intellectual and physically wish that you stop to show as evidence. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;
