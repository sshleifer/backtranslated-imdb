I did not like the Bill Murray, which was released in the 1980s, so it's been a pleasure for me to enjoy my movies in the '80s or "Stripes". <br /> Now, Stripes can be an innovative comedy in the early 80's and can be appealed to key trained people. or is a bad movie, but still a supporter of Bill Murray. <br /> Why is it bad? Basically Stripes should have been a comedy, but it's not funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far. Most of the film is consumed by the dramatic structure, which is incredibly complex and not interesting. <br /> <br /> The Stripes film is suffering more than Bill Murray and Harold. Especially noteworthy is the lack of comedy when you are accustomed to more modern comedies such as "Anchorman", which strives to laugh every part of the Stripes movie. The lack of functionality of Ramis. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he is not a very influential player at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. <br /> <br /> Finally, most of the comedy inside Stripes is a characteristic of Bill Murray, the character of the smart-alec human-born child, so if you do not find the characteristic (I did not), then in Stripes you will not find what's a fun little comedy. <br /> <br /> The "ribbons" are often a movie of their own age, well-aged, and it is not necessary to watch. If you want to watch an early 80's "comedy" comedy, I'm "Crazy Stir." I recommend. Like "Stripes," Stir Crazy is not as fast as it was in modern comedies, but in contrast to Stripes, it can still be viewed as aging.
