I rarely move to make a comment about a movie. But I do not know how. Who did this? Maybe they thought they were able to shoot a feature movie? After a weekend training course at some movie schools, did you miss a nice check from her father and miss out on David Badiel's family? Or does he have a family-friendly / remote relationship for a long time? I do not know, I do not want to know. She feels embarrassed to be in her, plays her lines and hid her face from the camera. Meanwhile, the DOP should have been neighbors, and there was no silent design, the scenario, direction, and correction were all terrible and obviously today I can not be disturbed by the predatory apathy. More about my life is to think about this movie.
