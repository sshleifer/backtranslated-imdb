I read the comments about the best Chinese movie. <br /> <br /> Probably the only Chinese movie you see is no dialogue, long-distance perspectives and silences, and hack editing, so you're in your place. <br /> <br /> The mixed story line? Very hard. Work with juveniles and amateurs. Magnificent mood and excitement memories? Very hard. <br /> <br /> It was terrible. I did not wait for it to end. Especially when the movie's best lines are called, "How do you get it? I'm fine," am I sure? Yes. Amazing! Wow! The depth of the character. <br /> <br /> I'm totally disappointed about this because there are so many fans of Chinese, Japanese and Korean films. Even the Zhang's spectacular "The Road Home" was better.
