Cage (1989) was one of the low-budget "friendly" action slots produced in 80s thanks to 80 films for 48 hours. and Lethal Weapons. This is one star Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno relates to former Vietnamese Vietnamese veterans who are in charge of managing a local dive bar. Reb takes care of Lou because he saved his life in Nam. But Lou was shot at the head and is now very soft. Although he is great, Lou has a child's brain. One day, some of the blessed ambergris waited at the bar, and Lou and Rebb beat their tares. But there is a maternity mother. They hit the bar, which did not leave anything Lou and Reb. <br /> <br /> In this film, it's as if there were two brave planes (one of them a beautiful boy). <br /> <br /> Movie time loss. Maybe they have gone all the way and if they try to make the situation worse, they may have made a tough move. Unfortunately, the audience did not pick up the bag. He is excellent. B-movie has all the elements because it's too bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
