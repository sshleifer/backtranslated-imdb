Spoiler Alert Well, I do not think the film's worst movie ever. Probably Ed Wood style (heartbreaking). Lightning is terrible. Music is too bad (come to piano and orgue!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < no doubt clowns! <br /> <br /> Every member of the pigeon is stupid, and the director puts every single movie movie director without effort. <br /> <br /> The ultimate fraud is the last day. Think about it: a clever guy (who is behind the flop) invites the same worker and his two colleagues to the weekend cabinet with the same worker and kills them. <br /> <strong> <strong> His wife </ font> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
