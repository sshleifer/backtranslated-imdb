<br /> <br /> I understand that some of Ben Stiller's films have been implemented or this year, but maybe they should not be content with quality. <br /> <br /> I'm a filmmaker with comedy "Alone Came Polly". "<br /> <br /> Reuben's style is unloving and is listed as one of the worst performances of the year, and her sister's difficult, and she's undoubtedly a comic talent, but she's finding another break or break, actually a funny one <br /> <br /> There is no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston because she is a good, intelligent player with a shameful career. <br /> <br /> <strong </ div> <br /> <br /> <strong> Aniston runs hopelessly to get rid of the things she's longing for, but it's a tough job for any actress, Ruben's best friend, Sandy. There is nothing funny in this horrible film, like Alec Baldwin, Reuben's director Stan and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and other supporting characters, such as Debra Messing, Lisa, and Claude like Hank Azaria. /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Azaria's accents are not just foolish; it's pretty unfunny. <br /> <br /> Of course, Alone Came Polly's promise is a promise. Unfortunately, for a comedy, it was not a blatant, boring, boring excuse, but rather a writer who could make a good comedy instead.
