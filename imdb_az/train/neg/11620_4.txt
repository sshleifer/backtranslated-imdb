I thought it was some moral lessons in this story, and I thought it was my husband and I had an idea and thought because I gave more than 1. The call and dialogue were mediocre and I confessed that God and Christ were our salvation on the head with God. There was no need for film and story line. If you like me, prevent a Catholic or Christian from restoring it, you will be nauseating. The film did a good job of showing a fine line with a good citizen and attention to something that could be a potential stalker.
