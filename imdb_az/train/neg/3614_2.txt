Schizophrenia has escaped from a NYC mental hospital and soon teachers start working at the University of St Trinity. The new teacher Julie (Francine Forbes) is involved in the mix of red bread. Despite the 78-minute operating time, these cheap reels are undoubtedly drifted to where the suspect was killed before leaving. Director Richard Haines breaks a sword with the pretext of some bare sticks-n-slash, but he cautiously denied the audience in the 80's. For all the amateur anthropologists there, it was shot in the New Yawk movie early in the 80's, so you can check the culture, belief and experience of that remote person. The film gets a bit of credit for the release of the "Final Girl". You will rarely see. Also, it is always nice to see a horror movie where a priest is a murderer. Do not you believe in the soul, dear movie industry? Fortunately, this is only a false priest and is kept. However, it still works on a moral level.
