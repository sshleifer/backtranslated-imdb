I thank Hollywood. Another film classic has been rebuilt in cheap, ineffective, heavy-duty and unnecessary. The original "Planet of the Apes" was a clever and thought-provoking film with a very clear message. It was almost a film directed to dialogue, which was very boring, but in fact it was very interesting. <br /> <br /> This film appears to have faced many dialogues on the other. Instead of a great movie, we get an incredibly stupid two-hour chase movie. Dialogue is only minimized, characteristic interaction and development are virtually impossible, and it is often hard to understand what is happening. Instead, we get many pointless moving scenes, some marginal funny liners, and some very loose quasi-smart conversations. <br /> <br /> The only thing that needs to be mentioned about this movie is fantastic. The makeup of the monkeys is spectacular, and the giants and backgrounds are beautiful. Nevertheless, "Monkey Planet (2001)" is a large number of simple, full-featured films, full of paperwork, foolish dialogue, and nearly unusual captivities. <br /> <br /> Yes, the last thing he has done. <br /> <br /> ***** ***** mainly for visuals. <br /> <br />
