This is definitely a stupid, bad taste movie. Eddie Murphy, the stars of the sitcom. She is surrounded by a perfect family, full of good family values. If you are looking for a politically neat entertainment, this is for you. But if you hate it without thinking of being the only one to avoid laughing immorality in a movie theater with pop-corn hungers.
