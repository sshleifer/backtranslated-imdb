Kudos to the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours and hours in the make-up room to look at Zola's part. In the 1930s, Muni was one of the greatest stars and I'm wondering how many people today know anything about this classic movie. He was a giant in business for at least ten years. He could earn an Academy Award for his performance, twice as he did, just as Louis Pasteur won a year ago. In my own opinion, though it is a bit strange, I still think it is one of the greatest actors of the Golden Age. Whatever played; <br /> <br /> Unlike Pasteur's role, I thought this story violated some of the things we've seen in the last 60 years: The Liberal Hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood did not dare to disrespect the police or the military, where it put a point to describe how "corrupt" these organizations are. Filmmakers love it when they challenge and defeat the government. From this point of view, this film is preceded by the day it was seen since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> However, it is important to note that facts support this story. Reducing Zola's achievements as a social regulator does not want to get rid of certain tyranny. It's good for him! I wish they spent more time concentrating on a trial.
