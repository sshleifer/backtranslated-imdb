<br /> <br /> Just as Micheal Dorn and Stacey Kitch were a bigger star than Nicole Eggert was shown as a star. <br /> <br /> Actually, this is a little spin on the film "The Land of the Wild". Eggert plays his daughter who is apologizing for being persecuted by an Alien soldier and is in the very realm of illegal sexual intercourse. A little nudity and partial nudity, a sensual sex scene all along the way. <br /> <br /> The film looks like photographs from a few obvious numbers and fleeing jokes. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Star Trek jokes after Michel Dorn missed. <br /> <br /> Stacey Kitch was shot and most of the film was pretty clear. After the weaknesses had ended, it would be great to have Alien's story clearly on Eggert.
