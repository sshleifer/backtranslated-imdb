Human Man predicts the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation, frustration with snail, his involvement in the event of a loss of money. When a bank is stolen and taken hostage by a racist thief (Clive Owen) and his team, the Detective is set up to force the thief to surrender? he tried to prove that he was innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a robust woman (Jodie Foster) with the secret and intentions set out to restore the item from the bank's savings deposit box and have a three-way dilemma. Unfortunately, I built all this in the movie and paid nothing at the end. Denzel Washington is not interested in an irrational and terribly egocentric performance. The only saving grace of the film is the adult co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are better than the movie itself. In fact, Jodie Foster plays against the most amazing and high caliber game turns. Cleveland Ouen does not give the baby anything but the depth of her existence and her ability to work more than her little role. It is strange that very little talent is spent in this film for little or no interest. When creating this movie, you are surprised by what director Spike Lee thinks. The most striking aspect of Inside Man, however, is how groundless it has been. For a movie that seemed to have all the makings of a pre-summer blockbuster, it falls horribly flat.
