<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> was "thrown" by the "R" certificate. The site is strong, but the film is about 40 minutes away. Goal and durability were very good. It was a strange thing to do most of the time, and he did a good job with his characters. The bottom part of the film is definitely the genre of "chipping". While some violent scenes exist, none of the violence should give the R rating. There are no nudity or uneven sexual scenes. Actually, there are no sex scenes. Her Grauer (incredibly beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa, and Glynis Davies were all guests at the SG-1 series, but this movie did not do anything to improve their career because they were used as low-level actresses. Robert Patrick, as usual, was spectacular and Mitch Pileggi was thinking of me on a modern day about Lee Marvin. The talented Megan Gallagher, who acted as an actor during the Millennium era, did not find it difficult to show his skills. The biggest disappointment with casting was Tracy Pollan. Apart from the following actresses and particularly attractive, her voice is completely weak. I have interrupted the television during dialogue. I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves Lifetime TV programs. However, I do not recommend paying any money to see this movie. Given that I find something that causes cenosis, this is just a movie worth watching, because nothing will be cut off. As a television movie, I value this figure as 5. As an artistic film that has a "R" certificate and a strong player, I estimate it as 2.
