<br /> <br /> Someone needs to explain to me why each film that reflects the characteristics of poor people and has a lively look is considered as "realistic" by some people? <br /> <br /> I did not see anything realistic about the characters (although the actors were doing their best with bad things) or situations. Instead I saw a forced, self-motivating effort in becoming "edgy", "angry" and "low and dirty". Unfortunately, the camera suddenly takes more and more hands. or do not hesitate to ease the movie to reach any of the main and the above-mentioned features. <br /> <br /> The only film that sees the movie has a sad comment about the status of independent film distribution. The theater is now heroic, with all its carbon copies, bad cinematography, non-existent camera orientation, and many of them themselves, like "Art". <br /> <br /> I found this in the "Bedroom" or "Schmidt". <br /> <br /> I found that they had a very good view and very close to the middle level, but only for the independent clones like Victor Vargas's removal <br /> <br /> Several years ago, the "independent" is likely to intervene in dealing with some originality, multiple energy and care, and perhaps a few technical defects causing lower budgets. this is a two-hour clock-camera-camera-filter, which is the result of the lack of tailor-made independent distributors today, which means that your chances are getting another number today, and that's all, of course, to serve completely unrealistic and flawed characters and situations. Is it surprising that the independent market has fewer or lesser companies? When k films such as doing nothing, the worst of them kopyalayırsınız previous films.
