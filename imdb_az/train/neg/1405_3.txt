An "Angered Damsel" is not necessarily one of the better musical compositions of Fred Astaire. But Astaire's bad movies have always had a good moment. At the Damsel, Astaire - Jerry Halliday, a musician in the United States, Jerry Halliday, is in London for personal appearance. <br /> <br /> Jerry, Alice Marshmorton (19-year-old Joan Fontaine), faces a beautiful Englishman. <br /> <br /> Jerry believes Alice is forced to marry by her rich aunt. She is trying to save her family from her home in the country, but soon she finds out that Lady Alien has been betting on her. <br /> <br /> Keggs (Reginald Gardiner), a respected butler and Albert (Harry Watson), help each other alternatively, to help Jerry and Lady Alice win the romance, and sabotage . <br /> <br /> Music has many problems. First, there is a structure based on PG's novel. Wodehouse (co-authored script). The story is slow, painful and nervous. When Fred does not dance we need to (a) Fred romantic Joan Fontaine or (b) Keggs and Albert endure them endless boring scenes that connect them and each other <br /> <br /> The butler and the house boy are particularly irritating. They are the kind of children of one-dimensional fond zealous characters, only the kind of children who want to punch in the mouth. <br/> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>> Joan Fontaine, this a disguised leading lady in the film and a misrepresented music. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> After the heroism in the Black Sea, Gracie has some interesting lines. <br /> <br /> George Stevens does not do a good job for the movie. Sometimes cinematography is horrible and neat. There are a number of open spaces on the extreme foggy streets, trying to convince the audience that we are in London, not in Hollywood. (They should use dry ice tones in this film). Moreover, songs made by George and Ira Gershwin have turned into a very horrific and classical song. Of course, there may be dance in the film, thanks to Astraire and choreographer Hermes Pan. <br /> <br /> However, music and dance numbers are badly used and mistaken. At some times, they begin to sing and dance because they started singing and dancing. Musical numbers are randomly entered into the silver field. (At one point, the butler moves beyond the edge of the cellar and enters the operetta solo for no reason.) The numbers are:  "I'm dancing and I'm not worried anymore" - Fred dances full of smoky traffic in London. He is a "cane-twirling" with a rolled umbrella - but when Fred jumps past a double-decker bus, the number ends soon. (In Broadway music, "Crazy For You", Harry Groener, a good version of this number with a number of choir girls). <br /> <br /> "Give Me a Test" - Fred, George and Gracie dance a trio tap in the English cottage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fred's and Gracie's ends. <br /> <br /> Stiff Upper Lip house, Fred, George and Gracie, enjoy a fun dance floor with barrel rotary and entertaining home mirrors. Fred and Joan Fontaine collect together a dance point together in the film and look like each other. The best part of the movie, but sometimes it is a bit repetitive. <br /> <br /> Has countryside forests. Fortunately, this is a very simple dance point, because Joan is not a good dancer. <br /> <br /> "A foggy day in London" - Fred touches around the foggy night at night, touching the foggy night of the night. first met with Joan in London. <br /> <br /> - In some cases, he thinks he's not sure of the way to the alert. The movie is misused. At a public event at the coast, Fred is singing the chorus of singers who sang this song. Every time Fred joins, other singers are looking at him as if they would leave him. (Nevertheless, Harry Groener made a better dance spot for "Crazy For You") • "Drum Dance Number" - Fred and Joan, Fred stopped a dance number and stopped drums. As usual, this is a great dance number. There is no need for it, except for the extension of the film. <br /> <br /> The most common moment in the film comes when Fred decides to throw a high stone balcony across the country to prove his love for Joan Fontaine. When he jumps from the balcony, he finds a trapeze, which is tied to a nearby tree-trapeze. <br /> <br /> Fred (or, rather, a stunt in Fred's dress) trapeze and shuts it off the ground. <br /> <br /> The film deserves only DVDs for dance numbers, but you feel you owe it to the boy who invented the Fast Forward button remotely. >> You can skip other horror scenes in the movie to get the DF button dance numbers.
