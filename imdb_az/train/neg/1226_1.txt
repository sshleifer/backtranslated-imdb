How dreadful is my power. Kim Basinger is a great actress, but he was definitely flattering when he took that role. This film is particularly bad for some reason: the gaps in the logic. When it comes to the 80s and 90s, it looks really stupid in 2008. <br /> <br /> Della (Kim Basinger), part of her life, begins to receive gifts at a shopping mall, and it's a pity. a band killed a gang, killed a police officer who helped him. <br /> <br /> From today on, she is followed by a street abandoned by these ironically-minded boys, and with a toolkit filled with tools, they end up with one another. <br /> <br /> Many things are wrong in this movie. As I said, this movie spins on logic every single time, and the player is bad for television, except for Kim Basinger. Hell, this pseudo tension is bad on TV. He has made a laugh, a way to kill every one of the politically right people (1 Kafka, 1 Spanish, 1 Asian and 1 African American woman who just loves America). The way to kill your Spanish son made me hysterically laugh. The sex scene was put on the left side with the main headline, and it shook your head with embarrassment. I just do not recommend it to those who love bad movies. Someone else knew who Basinger's fans did not possess this flick. Do not you want to see a respectable player in this filthy movie now? Of course not. You've been warned.
