This film removes itself from a momentous moment of self-enthusiasm and promises to become something of value. But it does not. <br /> <br /> A set set of drawings and backgrounds is not a movie, they are preparing a calendar. Such a troublesome socialist lying drama documentary ("the truth that really exists") can not convince not only to have fun, but also to function as a social history. Clich√©s combine with bad behavior, making it difficult to finish this movie, the fun factor is fast enough. These symbols are dimensioned and will not develop to the extent they do not feel. The director's ego is the biggest character in this film.
