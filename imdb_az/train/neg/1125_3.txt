I went to school with Jeremy Earl, I heard about this movie and I do not know if it really is in the theater. I do not remember your name. I saw that one of those who came after school. Acting is good, not good. The area was weak and the lines were pretty rooted. The only comment I could give the film was "Eh" from Jeremy, if I had been in a movie rental, I would go in the past and will not advise everyone in the past after watching it. When I was describing the children of the city, I was often differentiated from the fact that the rich seemed to be outdated or outdated. Many times I think their characters are incredible.
