Bob Clampett's 'Porky's Poor Fish' is a terrifying banner and one so-so cartoon that lives in one or two beautiful moments. Porky's Fish Shoppe is concerned with one of the "Porky's Poor Fish" standard black-and-white "Porky" cartoons and one of the most popular books of the Merrie Melody. Porki is one of the earliest Porki animated films, only in a pretty stylized open-air musical number and in the movie's footsteps. Seeing the fish shop as an opportunity to have a free meal, but the bargained gets more, the star for the remaining time is a scraggly cat. Unfortunately, there are fewer bargains for the audience. Sometimes, as in the books-life-series series, attention is drawn to signs that can also be used in non-animated environments. There are fewer laughter and fewer Porki's poorest pets are offered to any of the other Porky cartoons, as the cartoon is only saved from Clampett's energetic direction.
