He was drowned in tears while watching this film. Not a laugh, but a great Rodney Dangerfield movie. Candyshack was the first and played the movie, Easy Money made it the best, and Back To School is the 80s classic work. Then there was Ladybugs and began to show. Poor Rodney became old (Wally Sparks met Ladybugs was a bit of a move, but not much to say). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My 5th wife, Rodney Monte Now he inherits a large land of land and takes over 5 Wives, since the land is ruled by Amish. This is a great idea for the Dangerfield movie. The problem is everything. The scenario is so bad that Rodney will tell a liner to the camera and that all the side characters have nothing to do with it. The film seems to be filmed with some really stunning stunt sequences that are not obviously Rodney. Andrew Dice Clay plays a gangster that looks like he's killing F (playing PG after movie R) and Jerry Stiller has a nice 2-minute match. Do not get me wrong, sometimes laughing at some of Rodney's jokes, but the poor man is too old and the road is slowing down. We can see his jokes from his space. The film is not the only one in the 1970s and 80s thanks to the terrible thanks of the 1990s.
