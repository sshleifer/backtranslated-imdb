In the U.S., very few films have been filmed about Rome, Julius Caesar or short term. Hollywood's epic of sword and kingdom is largely Christian, and it is difficult to access Roman history before (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and encountered some resistance because it was not Jesus in Hollywood). Only Caesar and Messiah are interested in seeing at least one of the prematurely occurring images, but when the Rome is only one city between the many cities in the Roman peninsula and only hates it <br /> <br /> However, is not a historical film; These peplum and production values ​​are cardboard, not actionable and characteristic. I can only imagine what the dialogue is with Italy, but it's hard to dubbed with wooden English. First, I have not smiled a few good. <br /> <br /> In the 1960s, I missed the majority of Hercules films and did not see many films of this genre. <br /> <br /> Because you've seen this movie when I was ten and I really liked it. o At that time, I went for something with the Romans and the swords. So at least this flick has brought back a childhood memories.
