I have not read the negative review of this movie yet. I must have left something. The start is interesting, the three main characters meet at night in another empty bar and entertain each other with inventions that have been invented. The best part. After three different ways, the film is divided into three parts. The issue with Felliniesque babushkas, which creates dolls from challenging bread, is primarily of an eye-opening interest. Unfortunately, the director draws the lines of a desert that does not even hit any one of them. Bottom Line: Two-hour plot-delicate tastes. If you are suffering from insomnia, go through bed and sleep well.
