Before you see this film, investigate the fraudulent incidents on the Internet, especially from 7-8,000 Muslim men warned of a widespread truth drawn from Srebrenica and by the Serbian paramilitary. The documentary also applies to various free-lance American organizations. Watch this movie critically and read it in advance. Many studies have shown that although artists have raised questions that target traditional wisdom about war, they often take their documents. Review by NYTimes by Stephen Holden says "labeling this documentary Serbian is inaccurate," but many should question the submission of facts that are derived from reliable sources and lead to the violation of these facts. I do not advise you to see this documentary, but I'm afraid to investigate it with a critical eye (always at all times).
