Maaan, this is what I start with this terrible movie god. Explains the bad bad story. I do not know what the director thinks about this movie. Namaste London was a pretty pleasant movie to be honest. The soundtrack was good. But this is one of my ... best for a movie ... designed for a music ... the songs are soooo bad. AR Rahman should be music director. <br /> <br /> Considering two major actors, the director should do better. The last 30 minutes of the movie is the first half though. Salman and Ajay delivered the film from the general disaster. <br /> <br /> If you do not have a better thing to do this, look. Watching the last good movie from Bollywood (and I watch them a load) is Dev D and Sid Wake Up.
