-My and my brother watched this movie. we laughed at the snow. Can he imagine stocks? Is there a nomination for the Oscars? - At first the musician mixes 4-5 different music styles ... and is not synchronized with the scenes and is characteristic ... <br /> - The main character Silvester is to sit there. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> 2. What is the idea when Rambo is going to jump, but was he shot? yarn blend 3. a girl? The best scene is when he is dead. It means a lot to him. Does he know the age? he cries ... he is my god samurai 4. so many arrows? The bowler bag is always full of arrows? I do not see a scene where I collect them - but when I was at the helm of Vietnam, I saw the scene - it's very important 5. How many missiles can helicopter carry? (real one) 4, but Rambos hit more than 20. <br /> <br /> The 6th key part. What do the Russian special helicopters do in Vietnam ????????? after the war? 7. When entering the Vietnam camp, the first scene ... the first idea was to free the shelter in the woods. Wow, the idea is again: 1. Can you cut the iron with a knife? Maybe it's just in Vietnam? 2. mortar - used to shoot a fugitive? he is my god, Americans really need to learn weapons! I know how much it takes to calibrate life (I think I'm watching more than a writer II World War)
