Omen IV (1991) is a bad thing for T.V. movie At age 80, managers tested the meth (selective drug in the 90s) because there is no other reason to explain this transvestite. Why were they worried about this? A t.v. movie What did he do when he came to this opinion? Even for a second we thought of this film's catch. Could they possibly accept this as a series? We will never know. But I know one thing. This film was one of the main reasons why I never had Oman trilogy. <br /> <br /> Omen IV is mainly the re-establishment of the first American movie. Instead of a snot nose punk child, we get a dark girl who is a common brat for everyone around her. None of the devil's experiences in the past would have taken place when the family had a juvenile. These parents need to lower their legs and make some realistic discipline! <br /> <br /> Not recommended, it's best to avoid all costs!
