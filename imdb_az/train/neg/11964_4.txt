Billy Kristal wrote about the fathers and sons, the underage irresponsible and the growing old, in this extremely safe and comfortable comedy-drama, and starred. Billy plays a cardiac surgeon with a heart attack (ha ha), which adds a movie that betrays itself as a great star, causing the search for his exiled father (Alan King). The scenario is Henry Winkler (who remained in sitcom mode) and a single-liners ready for a family conflict, sub-Neil Simon's shamelessness in an abundance, plain, inaccurate direction. The Crystal and the King try to do their best, but the King is very eager and often overturned. JoBeth Williams has one of his extraordinary roles, but he tries to bring his native, lower home class into an ordinary girl-friendly character. Here is a comedy, but one who puts his tears back ... shy. ** from ****
