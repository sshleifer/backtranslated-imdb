This is just a bad movie. It looked like a nice budget, had the potential to be better. That would mean. Almost like the hero of Salma Hayek, heroes fighting like Jackie Chan, battles almost like Crouching Tiger and duels ... almost like Conan says music ... etc. Almost ,. But in the end, it's hard to find something so boring. Perhaps John Rhys-Davies, flying with duel like a warrior or hero like Crouching Tiger, previously mentioned, ... I'm really ashamed of the old old John. He is a very good actor and better dignity. So, as you are - even if you still have a chance, look at something else.
