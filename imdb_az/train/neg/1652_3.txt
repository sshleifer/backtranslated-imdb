I will come to the corner and to the point. This movie is not good at all. The buff part of my movie hated actorship, writing, story, direction and almost correction. Amanda Peet has proven that she can act as she has a high point in "All Nine Yards." So he had to shoot this movie with a ten-pole. But my infantile part of this movie was very laughable. If you forget about the quality of production and find the mouse jokes laughable, then you will get better. It's your choice for those who can not get out of your kingdom. My inner child died, and I laughed fairly. Even though only three of them are really sad because of the film.
