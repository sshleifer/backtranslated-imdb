I appreciated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer I thought it would be pretty cool. "Everyone's grief is guaranteed!" said the trailer. Yes, it hurt me because this movie really swallowed it. The comedy is not difficult as we laugh for about two seconds during the entire movie. And what is all gay in this movie? I am not gay and I do not have problems with myself, but what is the point of adding too many gay scenes to the comedy movie when these scenes are not completely funny? <br /> <br /> So, my advice is: if you want to spend a good comedy, a million times a comedy you can see is better than watching the Lousy Comedy Mom. This is really a general twist.
