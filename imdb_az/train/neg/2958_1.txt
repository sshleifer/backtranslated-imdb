This movie was amazed. It's not ugly. I often met a group of friends and went to the movie shop to find horrible movies to watch comedy values. Dude suggested that, but as we watched him, people began to leave. I wanted to finish it, so I wanted to say, but I could not. This is bad. Terrible gags are barefoot. The main characters are a pesky dinosaur clutz and Whoopi Goldberg. I would have watched Costener's The Postman twelve consecutive times to see more of this movie. I think some dinosaurs are trying to deal with discrimination, but a really different piece of the film is that the dinosaur always tears things off and then relies on it. This is frustrating. If you are a volunteer masochist, leave it alone.
