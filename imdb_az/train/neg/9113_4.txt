There was such a potential for this film and it was totally destroyed. In the First Terrible Intent, we are forced to act on what the symbols of leadership are and how it behaves. There is almost no NO character development in this prequel. In fact, this is a very sad event, but this movie has not done anything for me. They have left a good post instead of unnecessary written f-words. And the latter makes no sense in any sense and does not reveal anything. The writing was just terrible. Another thing worrying me was the fact that the EXACT SAME limit, which was original, was used on lease. I do not remember the "Little Boy" or the kissing scene and some others. Robin's player did not affect me, but Amy did a great job. This is about the only thing that can be reconciled.
