This movie resembles a game called "Blithe Spirit" written by Noel Coward. The structure of a ghost wife and the middle is linked to Coward's writing. I'm glad to see these nature movies accept the concept of the original writer. <br/> <br /> <br /> Simply, since then, these movies are very expensive to produce. When a script is original, I love you. Even before there is an innovative way to create a free job. Some examples have been shown (like Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I understand that movies are still a relatively affordable type of entertainment. However, when I am accepted by the taste of the public, I also ask. <br /> <br /> In this case, despite the taste of the people, it is obvious. <br /> <br /> We look forward to making better movie entertainment. <br /> <br /> In this case. I see more games.
