OK, I know that Watership Down's classic Watership Down is a standard part of the majority of people, but when I first saw this movie until the age of 18, I know that many people will re-evaluate this opinion. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie because my sister read a book and was really excited and many of the people who were saddened by Watership Down - the memories of the movie, tear their children and feelings in the lane. I did not worry about being honest. I gave the benefit of this doubt; generally I do not want to stop watching a movie half way. That was an exception. In fact, it was really exciting and boring. This movie was probably the slowest thing I've ever seen (imagine a sparkling snail in space) and really did not do it for me. Art was good; <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> is a group of bird heroes who are largely deprived of their protection due to the infiltration of people in the region. In general, a moral story about human dangers in the environment uses anthropomorphic rabbits to print the message. Not because I'm a sort of terrible sadist for me, but I wish that the characters would give me gas because it's dim, annoying, boring, and pretty rude (oh, I'm terrific English). When I watched the movie, I always watched the clock and it took about 20 minutes or more before it actually happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax. <br /> <br /> I praise in any way that I have to adopt the concept of building children in the village, and I hope to make people arrogant and so on. Maybe all these are general holiness and propagation, but the message they are trying to put forth is good in nature. <br /> <br /> So this movie is weak enough. I could not follow the whole path, or they probably missed my legs. Of course, "Torque" is not bad, but it still does not differ greatly in my eyes, so I gave it 2/10. <br /> It helps.
