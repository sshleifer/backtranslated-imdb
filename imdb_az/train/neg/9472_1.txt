There is no way to avoid a comparison between the Cat in the Hat and The Grinch, who stole Christmas, so let's take that part out of the way. Above all, let's start by saying that I think Grinch is a groundless and unappreciated movie. The cat ... well, it was just terrible. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey was poured out for being a brilliant physical comedian and dreadlessly surpassed the top, ugly characters. <br /> <br /> Mike Myers has returned to his old tricks. <br /> <br /> Why, why, Mike Myers? Children can take less care and the Austin Powers demographic movie will not spy on this movie. So, what was studio thinking? <br /> <br /> The cat was related to Linda Richmond. We may talk? Why A New York Accent? Dr. Seuss is totally incompatible with something he has never written. Myers were even secretly allowed in the Scottish shtick. The director and the studio can surprise you with the few different voices that sounded differently than what you say and say "what you say". Meyers could not find any comfort with suits, makeup or dialogue. <br /> <br /> Sugars did not fit into a few, raw and age. <br /> <br /> Myers closes a garden and brings the camera: "dirty ho", everything would only disappear, even if the rim shot was not there <br /> <br /> Whoville 's and' Cat ' he had one of his hands. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of fun with Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> / This cat should be a lizard and should not be allowed to repeat again. Please do not give any results later.
