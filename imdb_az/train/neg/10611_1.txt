Hero Potter is a straightforward structure with no tension. And when it comes to feminist polemics, it's funny. I saw this trash when it was first released and I'm glad to look at it, and I found it very tiring. Now, I'm now "What is the worst movie you've ever seen?" I immediately responded to the question. Of course, for the rest of my life, I have the comfort of knowing that every movie I see is better than the Tango lesson. <br /> <br /> I was struck by the fact that Potter wrote a script that would earn the largest number of art councils in the world (as seen from impressive loans). <br /> <br /> I just saw Orlando recently and I can see how the Potter learned the wrong lessons to make this movie. All she did was a whole lot of suits, the lady's camera was an empty structure to deceive a few harsh dark public movies. Why should not he think that Tango can move away from anything that does not depend on himself?
