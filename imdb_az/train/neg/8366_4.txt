'SherryBaby' is a very painful and complicated melody in Cersey, a story of a young mother who went out of prison in a dungeon after a prisoner-related conviction and fought to stay clean, to find a place in life, and especially to regain the girl's love for her Brother's family. The only reason for watching the film is Maggie Gyllenhaal, who is very well adapted to the role of the film and is at the forefront of his entire career on the shoulders. It's not enough, but as the story line is very simple and anticipated and emotional focus is put in the wrong place - I wanted a mother or middle-aged child as a director and writer, regardless of past and possibly future drug addiction. Even Maggie Gyllenhaal's player could not convince me that I should not be more interested in the child.
