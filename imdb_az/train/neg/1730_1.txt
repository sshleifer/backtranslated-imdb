First of all, I would like to note that only my little sister always knows about the show she will follow. I find the worst program on television. There is nothing funny about the "jokes" and the cannon hero is unbearable. If the film is shot in front of a live audience, the show will work better. How to show laughter in such a way would show 'unfunny'. However, I appreciate the talents of young players. It is up to me to look at the show in the future and think how bad their first television program is. The show has a good relationship with CBBC presenter's overall boring sounds and style. Why do you need to scream today's youth? Thats it.
