People are really hard to believe this curse! I think the kids can do it, but for me, this baby film is for parents to sit. The predictable plot is dull Belushi and maybe the worst child player of all time. I'm going to give Leader a child, but it was really painful to watch. People are ashamed of him, as he knows he is. Star Spangled Banner had to turn off the sound when he sounded - then I came here and did it because they earned Star Search. We always had to be ashamed to trade Jim Belushi on his beautiful, simply missed brother, and why this crap shows up. For the stars.
