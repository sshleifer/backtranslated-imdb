This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. As I loved the novel, I was primarily concerned with the negative, and I did not want it if I did not. Less than an hour later I quit it, though in five minutes I wanted to close it. I wish I could. It makes the novel a lot and all kinds of factors change. If the movie was not able to survive in the last 50 or few minutes, I would not recommend it in any way. An insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I do not know that many people say that The Bell Jar is absolutely inaccurate, but it could have been done without special explanation. I would like to see a filmmaker and a screenwriter today capable of doing justice.
