I knew Casper was having trouble with Van Diem as a coach. Words can not describe the horrors of this film, nor do they justify it. But let me try to describe it: Through horrific action, terrible dialogue, dark situations, and all this, you've come to feel that you have strengthened Trinity Broadcasting Network's beliefs and propaganda. Hollywood is a weak attempt to show that a movie can give a fun and deep religious message. They failed. It was the worst movie I've ever seen.
