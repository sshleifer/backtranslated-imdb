Years ago, when I was a poor teenager, my closest friend and brother took a policy that the filmmaker should pay. I'll never pay for some deals, I have to go for a free movie! I came to see the shit of the second Conan movie and I never say it! Even though it is an unhappy movie, it's fun to watch - in the brain deadly. And technically stunts and camera work are good, so my rating is up to 2! Why is the film so bad? Unlike the first Rambo film, it does not have any plot, Rambo says only 3 words (except grunts and hawks), unnecessary and totally irrelevant and unfamiliar "romance" and the movie is a giant (and stupid) special effect. And how surprisingly special effects are. Rambuda has 12383499143743701 bullets and missiles, has no effect on anyone, and shoots almost every bullet or arrow Rambo! And while the bad guys used AK-47s, helicopters and missiles, some scenes were a bow and arrows that seemed like all Rambo nuclear energy tips! The scenes of a bad guy's fired, slowly and calmly get ready for those who are watching with silence as they launch one of these exploding arrows! The URF's main role was a wonderful parody in the UHF. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; !!
