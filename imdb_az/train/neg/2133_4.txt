First thing first: I'm not conservative. Even though I have not yet appealed to myself as a liberal or democratic one day, I was opposed to the war in Iraq. I think John Cusack is safe and I'll probably see the eyes of politics, in fact, I'm sure we'll be with our friends to tell how great Adam Curtis is about the BBC's. My idea is that I'm not a part of the choir, so do not be afraid to think. It promotes Cusack War, Inc. WI's policy is in line with my demographic appeal, but the problem is that it is luxurious, non-standard, and the film Cusack produces and writes, and stars are worse than cheap costumes. <br /> <br /> "Good intentions are put on hell". Cusack, co-writers, director Joshua Seftel and even actors, Robert Althman's M * A * S * H, unfortunately, for the audience, the US policy, foreign policy, and war " "the current situation of his efforts is absurd and eventually tragic and miserable. and, sadly, funny - just watch The Daily Show and see for yourself. <br /> <strong> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> put it in a hurry. To do this, Cusack crammed a shopping list mainly from Grosse Pointe Blank (cannibalized one of his best films), changed the setting, and raised ideas from Naomi Klein's collected work. Most of these ideas are put on your throats in the first twenty minutes of the film, and how much immorality they are is jokes or gags, or Halliburton, Neo-Cons, and US explicit references to the invasion of Iraq - they are creative, clever or funny. Writers have hidden themselves by themselves, simply by referring to these issues, the film would be funny and destructive. Unhappiness ... not. <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Now these ideas are today's the news and the jokes that you live or rock or ignorance, denial and simple fool (read: a right-wing Christian), these jokes are unfair. Of course, WI would have worked even more nuanced, devastating, abusive, and busy with detailed research / concepts. Here, jokes and eyelids are all surfaces, and they have very few elegant, sensitive or satirical filths, and they have done little to hurt me. Homer Simpson once said, "It's funny because it's true," and "The Daily Show" proves that every night; War AS, however, proves that it is not funny because it's real. <br /> <br /> Hyperbole is not required when it comes to lamping the new US conservative policy ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
