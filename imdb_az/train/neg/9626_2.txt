Do not bore any bones about it. This movie contains a lot of things wrong. Not very ridiculous, predictable and unreasonable, the whole way klichéd. Begin at the beginning: characters. Aniston is playing well, but really no need to do so - really just pretty, his love interest - the alleged wild, his boring, mischievous boy strap Stiller has another hook - a dull, unfortunate boy - fat, Jovial friend and then the variety of clichés: a teasing daredevil Australian boy, a reliable Spanish boy and so on. Storyline: The start is a bit unusual, but then comes into any movie style, the average knock-knock joke. The biggest problem was that the "development" of Stiller's character was, in fact, nothing like a secondary school, where the writers began and where they were going, but the middle bit did not make enough to say the right thing. Finally, the alleged "jokes" were nothing but a high level of humorous humorous watering; <br /> <br /> As a result, it's a simple fact about the film that learning the meaning of the word 'condition' is the only good thing. <br /> <br /> One of the oldest guide in Germany, Stiller and Aniston, could have imposed sugar coatings on the audience, but the taste remained the same. <br /> <br /> Aniston chose a better friend-season film than Kevrow's angry Marci X.
