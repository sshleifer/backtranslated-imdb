First technical review. The scenario is very slow, actually a 25-minute story that actually blasts for 1 hour and 40 minutes. The dialogue is very straightforward and really one-dimensional. "Operation" is painful, they actually raised pupils from the classroom to read a few lines from the family structure. The whole point of the story is "war is bad" (oh, shock!) Really exists. No one in this movie will "talk about it" and "get to the stage and get bigger acquaintances". Too bad, really worrying about thinking of the better things you use for this money. Believe me that I have seen a few bad "emperor's new clothes", but what I can say for them is at least good and well prepared, and the camera is angry at two scenes! Read all other analyzes - avoid any responsibility and do not talk about it.
