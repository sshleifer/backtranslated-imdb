I love the episode of Jimin Greenman. This is great! Jim is priceless to look at his face when he knocks the child out of the window. When he began to call the Priest on behalf of his wife to learn that he had become a prophet? In addition to great writing and excellent toys, you also need to see a great cast. I'm trying to find a specific photo from this episode. I would like to use Greenman as my avatar on the message board because I think it's funny. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of everyone like Jimin Greenman? Can anyone guide me in the right direction to find such a photo?
