Gods, I have not watched this terrible film for a long time. Perhaps since the 'New Guy' or the various Freddie Prinze Jr movies. Yes, it is surprisingly terrible. The empty and wooden effect of Mira Sorvinon must be inspired by Freddie. Filming was unusual (not like a game, and detention is not working well in the film). The actors have no idea what they are doing, especially Sorvino. His attitudes were terrible and his sexual orientation was not there, so it was painful to see the "deceiving" other symbols and fall into it. What was the shooting of live viewers on the beach pods? Nonsensical! I have to turn off the DVD player, it would hurt itself to finish this movie.
