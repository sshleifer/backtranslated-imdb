A model based on the alleged Domino Harvey's life turned into a ghost hunter. I would say that 95% is ready. When I came to the movie, I always keep an open mind, but this movie, the story throughout the movie, became clear to me that I could not stand it and lost the chance, so I wanted to end it with the head of the story, which was described as hateful and arrogant. It's something under the brink of some ignorant snobby brat who think it's a very cynical, very sensitive, and very boring way, giving a crap kinda story and I really think big time directors have to make a movie based on their own imagination or a writer.
