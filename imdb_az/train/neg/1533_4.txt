I will not spend much time and energy on this statement. I just want to add that because all the comments were very positive, so I felt that I was so excited to be so excited that an attempt to create an intellectually attractive philosophical kinematic love frustrated with this initiative. Some scenes, playing with dimensions, seemed encouraging, but could not keep the rest. <br /> <br /> How much did the Dutch film do for the new heights? <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard. <br /> <br /> Gert de Graff is not Jean-Luc Godard, or Tarkovsky, and will never be seen.
