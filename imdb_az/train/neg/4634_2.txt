Of course, there are some talents, Maria Bello is always good. but it's just a good time to film a "fascinating" story that describes each character as everyone is jealous and exploited. Well, I hope they have left the system. Unfortunately, there is no view, sensitivity, context and really humanity for the audience. there would be no horror, no horror, no context, and nothing better than anything constructive about the story you do not want to say. If bad things happen, you sit and watch, do not worry, what? At 99% of the time, the words "based on a true story" make an unusual warning to the audience. the director and the screenwriter are lazy and are amazed at some of the events they hear in one place, they just throw them on the screen and do the work without the filmmakers wanting to capture any "true" nature of the story. I hope this film has been a great time. ice gets worse.
