Adaptation to a fairy tale of talented and inferior children is not just about the attraction of her father, but of her ability. Mike Myers is a clear demolition of what Jim Carrey is doing, but not all ashamed of his horrible performance as he must act together. If you can spell right on the movie, it's a great loss to get out of it. Sets are ugly and kinematography is very weak. This year I've seen a lot of bad movies, but it does not accept the cake, but surely the worst films have been made.
