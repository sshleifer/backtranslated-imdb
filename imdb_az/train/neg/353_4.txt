As noted by other reviewers, the film is dying in the last 1/2 hour. But before that, he was exposed to the anticipated and pragmatic performance by Kate Capshaw, who never discovered his character and destroyed every scene. Connery is as beautiful as Fishbourne, but most scenes are heavily affected by the reality that is incompatible with the reality of unequality. And the latter is just strange. When filmmakers brought together this turmoil, they knew that all they needed was a sweet potato and pumpkin puree for a Thanksgiving dinner, so they added a "dramatic" score to compensate. Each small jump is accompanied by a crescendo of the orchestra, to the point where it is ridiculous. If you want to see a bad example of a great league movie, this is a vision, otherwise skip it.
