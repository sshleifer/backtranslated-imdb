The nose was shrunk for what I wrote. <br /> <br /> Several weeks ago, I had previously commented on a movie that was not part of this movie, so it was rejected, even though it was a normal rule. <br /> <br /> I'm the performance of Jordi Mollan, a veteran actor, who appeared in major film production such as "Blow" and "The Alamo" for the first thirty minutes of this film. Leonor Watling is also pretty good. Unfortunately, everything actually sank under the weight of a terrible, melodramatic script. <br /> <br /> There is also a great many unmatched nudity that does nothing to interfere with the adoption of the Prophet and even to an impressionist nuance that has nothing to do with contempt of art. <br /> <br /> A real day trip on the coast of Valencia is less likely to be anywhere than to meet these fictional characters.
