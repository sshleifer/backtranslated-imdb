This movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen. There is absolutely no story, the gags are just for retards and there is nothing else that is worth watching this movie. In the whole film, Fredi (Oh ​​my god, what a comic name ha ha) does not ask ONLY as he arrives from an airplane. The names are so stupid and totally unfunny characters that should sound funny. for example, called Gandalf Almghandi, called Sam Pupsi ... and so on. All the movie did not smile at once. Gags is developed by people with negative IQ. If you smile at someone's coat door (this is about 5 times), this movie is for you. Another fun scene: They are trying to find the code word of a closed door (why not - "why" in this movie) and the code word (ha ha): dung. So, if you laughed in these examples you can love this movie. For all: Return to Youtube and tell the "Lord of the Lung": it is much more fun.
