Never the best plaintiff for the worst movie ever. The character of Joanna Pakula is I.Q. less than 3 writers and directors. Scenarios were not in the middle school grade; "jokes" is a young child; Concept of confusion. These performers were desperate for work. I just stayed up to see if it could get worse. It did. Life is too short to spend any part of this movie.
