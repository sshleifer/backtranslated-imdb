With MassID advertising Nickelodeon and Nick Jr enter, and he first made us wrong to see him. Among DVDs and theaters, outstanding (Incredibles, Shrek) really did see (Wall-E, Brother Bear) really bad things. But this was not the worst movie I've ever seen - children or children. When this "foolish thing came to an end". type of practice? Okay, it's directed to the child (or better than anyone else - it's being insulted to anyone over 3) but I have not seen anything reminder, repetitive, and slowly moving. Once you're finally fed up, but there's nothing surprising that you're thinking of setting up for a joke after releasing it, but there's nothing wrong with it, although it's hard to say what it's trying to do. 3-D effects ... Yes, if you have never seen a Viewmaster, they want something bigger, but on the contrary (the same process if you look at the screen without a seam). My son was bored even to the end. Both my husband and I looked at each other and eventually said "wow." It's bad in every respect.
