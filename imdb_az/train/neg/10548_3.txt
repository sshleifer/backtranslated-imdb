Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! No, I did not like it. What was the purpose of the film: laying the wheels and shakers of the film makers? In some cases, they are people who are different from themselves. I did not need a movie to tell some people in the film industry how brave they were. <br /> <br /> I am not a filmmaker and film class, but it seems to me that something like the "Roman holiday" was part of the film. a "two shooting" series (main), where actors (!) come to their senses and create a dialogue. Henry Jaglon claims that he wrote the script along with Victoria Foyt, but the impression was that the actors who knew the general direction of the film had a dialogue and that it was not always successful. From this point of view, Ron Silver is really talking about some of the words that have not been dumped along the chat line (and I'm going to look for it!) And Greta Scacchi was starting to scream, because it was such a table. An impression is that an actor deliberately tries to mislead the other player and breaks its concentration. An example of this is that a Producer's Silver "to bring the documents" * * # # # "(3 times). Silver lost word with words. <br /> <br /> Jaguar's Greta Scacchi (no strange to Australia), Ron Silver, Anouk Ami and Maximilian Schell show that they are a 'slow news week'. There was something Peter Bogdanovich always looked at, and I heard him saying, "Look, I'm not a director or a screenwriter, I'm not an actor", and the state would be unnecessary! Faye Dunaway was more interested in promoting his son, Liam. In addition to the horrific conveyance of the dialogue, the hand-held camera was irritating, even for verisimilitude, because I suspected that there was a "natural" dialogue - and the interest in the principles was of interest to different young people who were interested in trying to hit themselves. At least it's close to Cinema Verite. <br /> <br /> I like it, you should not avoid such apotheosising films. It is wrong to try to get value in a smaller movie to confirm the detected transcendental level. Indeed, there was nothing about this avant-garde. It has not been seen as a work of art and is still not a documentary. I know that this is a document, but whether the real test is fun. It was crazy! It had a paid feature: this was 'Cannes' correctly and I gave it 3/10.
