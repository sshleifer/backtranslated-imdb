I saw this movie a few months before the film was shot and MAN looked at this horror, in particular, how this film was a real life phenomenon. I was very interested and thought that this was a decent horror / tension movie that was later discovered. As you know, you know that film clips look better than the movie: perhaps showing creepy parts or overdramaticizing certain elements. <br /> <br /> The film's advertising made both of them, which led to my last dream. <br /> <br /> In no way is this "the worst movie in the year". I'm sorry that Hell is the worst movie of this week's freedom. <br /> <br /> This film is exactly something that is actually "suspended". <br /> <br /> This film was not a full bum. I must admit that my interests were upheld, and Micheal Keaton seemed convincing that he was looking for supernatural ways. Moreover, this movie is a great cliché. After John's wife dies, she receives information about the EVP that transmits the dead sounds to everyday electronic devices. He suddenly receives a message from his wife! My God! This is not the only one who does not reach his wife, but the other dead. Gee, imagine. A movie about helping the dead. Come on, call me! The clichés do not stop there. We also have the same-exact-time-every night trick and three evil-minded souls that stop violence for our hero. Not just a movie clip, it's NOT POSSIBLE. The film had two jumping scenes, and the two scenes were almost identical. The latter is terrible, as the door is then widened by the WIDE OPEN. There is also a message ending with a message that only threatens a happy melody with only 1 of the X voices heard through the EVP. The road that covers you guys. Jeez! Finally, if you want another unforgettable horror movie, look at the White Noise. Perhaps one of the reasons why everyone thinks this movie is watching is this Keaton fan, or they are interested in the EVP. Of course, the aspects of the EVP may be a little curious, but I have to throw my movies down my throat and blast my grapes. This film is trying to be scary, original and disturbed, but on the contrary. You have a naked film when you use dreams to talk about the ad about the movie. "THIS FILM IS NOT GREAT".
