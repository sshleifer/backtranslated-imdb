<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> MUST be the first to read my reading and its logic on ACTIVITIES. <br /> <br /> This anime surprised me because it abolished the high quality of comedy and mango and OVA. The only thing left is simply something that could be. Many characters did not have depth in the slab. Alucard is a sympathetic character who wants a secret death. Walter's story is irrational. And in the world war, there is absolutely no specific intrinsic villains that cover the world. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is not that it does not go beyond the animated pillar, but rather that it deals with such a poor job.
