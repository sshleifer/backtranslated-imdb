It can be a bit tough for me, but unfortunately, so far, the management is in the truth. Just look what you have done so far. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding in this film, his performance is all about the film. I hope he gets a "blockbuster" and falls into the bigger actor league, he has clear skill. <br/> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Only "horror" is short term flashbacks and they are less than 2-5 takes a maximum of 2 seconds. I personally called it "drama / tension". <br /> <br /> But, despite the fact that the story really is interesting, it destroys bad orientation, editing and action (buying from Lucy). There is nothing to do with transmissions in something like this that is so important to a story. You will sit there and you will not feel anything. <br /> <br /> My advice is to stay away from this movie ... or something better, just move away from something else, Hurst.
