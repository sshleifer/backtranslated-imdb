Johnny Dangerously, the second film by Amy Heckerling, is a parody of the gangster films produced in Warner Brothers tradition in 1930. Keaton's mother (Maureen Stapleton) continues to face health problems, as Keaton's a middle-aged gangster looking at his life when his mother (Maureen Stapleton) holds a child who wants to steal something in 1935, because he is exposed to a crime. Early life through Peter Boyle. Meanwhile, Fargan plays Richard Dimitri Boyle and Keaton, a rival loser, eventually rising from the ranks. Joe Piscopo has a cheerful turn as Danny Vermin, yes, right, do not! Griffin Dunne, Keaton's younger brother, regional lawyer, wife Glynnis O'Connor and Marilu Henner Keaton's mullah. <br /> <br /> Film shoots begin slowly as expected after half an hour. With a combination of dialogue and gags, the film takes its first half, but then loses its vapor rapidly in the second half and penetrates into the middle and vulgarity. Keaton stands for James Cagney's best impression. Stapleton has several vulgar lines that are very unpleasant and funny. Piscopo once more "too" once. A number of supporting actors, such as Danny DeVito, Dom DeLuise, a street vendor like Ray Walston, Alan Hale, Jr. a table sergeant, and Sudie Bond, trying to remain as a cleaner lady. The second half is turned into a hit or run TV show-type tone and is never restored. Using the Roaring Twenties, the final scene is an anachronism like Call of The Wild Clark Gable film seen on a marquee at the start of the movie. I think Heckerling should be better acquainted, because the intended audience would really be aware of the 1939 end date of the Roaring Twenties. 1/2 of 4 stars.
