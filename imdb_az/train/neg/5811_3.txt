I have not seen this movie for centuries, but I think I'll comment it anyway, but on the contrary, memory that I do not like most burned in my memory. The original GETAWAY is no prize, but at least 1) Sam Peckinpah's movie, 2) Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens, 3) Different from the 3) <br /> <br /> The 1994 version is red hot Alec Baldwin and his divorced wife, Kim Basinger, come less than a short space of time. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Of course, McQueen and her husband, Allie McBride after the release of the movie was split soon, and someone discussing who's a foolish idea to shoot the film. Alec Baldwin has never been to the Cooler King, and nothing will ever happen and one of the reasons for so much criticism is the arrogance adopted by Baldwin. We protest against Steve McQueen's lead role. Like any other, Peckinpah's 1972 film was part of a parody of parody type in the action / adventure heist genre. On the contrary, Baldwin, Bassinger & Company, tried to make a more serious sound just like Michael Madsen and James Woods, the bravado-free heroes, as real people. <br /> <br /> The film is essentially inspirational and unmatched at the fundamental level, which is hard to put into words. There was a lot of visitors, not just because they were something new, not just because they were nothing new to offer. The Peckinpah movie was a little bit of fun, with an unpleasant mood that was actually a long-lasting friction of this version. <br /> <br /> I do not know if this was probably one of the movies you've been helping, perhaps not the good thing, the idea of ​​a wave of remakes, a huge budget that has been kept around the brand name actor / actress. I will always try to make a film director feel at least one new idea for a movie and get straight to the original one. This movie just wanted to pull my eyebrows and this shows that Mr Baldwin came out after 15 years since he was recognized as one of Hollywood's greatest naked. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Thank God for putting him in place for Team America
