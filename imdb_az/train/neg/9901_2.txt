It was really a star, but many, clich√©s, predictable twists, I've seen all this before slasher flick parallels that really made me laugh ... <br /> <br /> I often do not comment on movies , they should be as if they were really bad or in that situation. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I knew it would be poor, as I have written many times. <br /> <br /> There was a unique nose to choose the worst films. <br /> For MR T's hilarious voice, it's probably not for MR T's support, but if you're concerned about watching it, you know what you mean), if you watch it, make sure you do not pay to see it. It could've worked really well though, but I'm sure you can find here somewhere amazing and strange laugh!
