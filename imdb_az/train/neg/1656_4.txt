Except for those who respect silent films, this highly appreciates the lyrical camera work and the full (but scratchy) serial price accompanying 1933 freedom. Although the voice was commonly used in 1928, there are fifty words to say the story of an unpleasant married woman, after a romantic intercourse in the fast, leaving her husband to a younger man. <br /> <br /> The jealous husband who stands at the scene of the most vividly photographed film continues to normalize until he realizes that the man's wife is a lover, giving a youngster a ride to the city. In anger of jealousy, he moves towards a railroad passage, but at the last moment he loses his nervousness and changes his mind. <br /> <br /> HEDY LAMARR has been approached by Marlene Dietrich for her treatment, but her beauty has not been cleared by cosmeticians as it was during the Hollywood transfer. His performance consists of looking at the sad and morose despite the frustration of the loss of marriage with short glimpses, when she sees her true love (ARIBERT MOG), wearing clothes after naked swimming. <Br> <br /> The swimming scene is not worth the cost of a very short, cautious and all-inclusive heat. Later, the lover's scenes were filmed in the form of lyrical photography in most of the film. <br /> <br /> More than just imagine with the alarm - another thing that announces the film is lyric masterpiece. <br /> <br /> It is not. These loyal portraits merely disappeared in the soundtracks (including symphonic music in the background), and, of course, Miss Lamarr saw the movie and based his career on Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he did not see anything in his work. <br /> <br /> As you can see, it was a silent film with the camera that did all the work. On the stage of his wife's "worker", the result is a very long time and is a crushing intervention where there is no need. The movie does not end with a proper note.
