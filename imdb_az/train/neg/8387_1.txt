It was the worst movie I've ever seen in the theaters. It was just the recycling of materials. The people that hit you are not funny. Tapping people are not funny. For the third time, a boy was thrown into the ball, and even the young audience was already laughing. <br /> <br /> I went with my little sister. He really laughs loudly in the King of the Hill, but this cynicism clamped him. I'm not surprised. The story is pretty bare. A midget thief stole a great diamond on something that is definitely the easiest heist in the history of Hollywood. Then he hides a family that acts as a baby. I know that anxiety arises, but this is a story. Talk for more than 1.5 hours on these two lines and you will receive a picture. There were lots of jokes learned. After seeing it, I really fell. I did not expect much and I'm still upset. Keenan just wanted to write jokes and / or some of her next scripts to some joke writers. It was worse than White Chicks if possible. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this movie. I do not want to go down my fun.
