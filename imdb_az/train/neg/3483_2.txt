(2004) Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Catherine O 'Hara, Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, Jennifer Morrison, Udo Kier, D: Mike Mitchell. A light yuppie thrown by a girlfriend does not want to be alone in Christmas because she decides to return to her childhood home, now living there and giving them a bribe to become a family. Affleck's seemingly delicate and lucrative performance, with a sensual smile, reveals his character as a mere psychic climb, but Gandolfini and O Hara take a breath in this excitement. Even farce, his silliness is not lumbering, but rather the stage scene sense and his sentimental messages are fake as Affleck's grin. 91 min, rated PG-13. * Â½
