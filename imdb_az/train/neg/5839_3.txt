Death in the Winter is a comedy-terrifying comedy-triller, from the very least known director, William Richert, who is terrified, impartial and very disappointed. While watching the film, I just felt that I was the emperor of the classic author of new emperor's clothes. The film felt like a fool because I could not do my head, tails of the serpentine field, and unusual characters. But I was embarrassed to admit that the movie closes my brains with knots. So, I hope that all confusion will be solved. Then I realized that the movie was serpentine, it was sincere and illogical, because it was the whole point. It is a satirical attitude to conspiracy theories and theories by the nagging of the structure used as a metaphor for knitting truths, half-truths, and lies to determine each conspiracy. Even when I was joking with me, I felt the Winter War was a terrifying movie. <br /> <br /> Young Bridal is younger brother of former US President. He was killed in Philadelphia. There is Nick when a dead man claims he has hit the president and gives details of where the gun is hiding. Nick follows the tips, but every step of the people who help him dies in a mysterious state. Also, his father, Pa Kegan (Mr Huston), is a vulgar and abominable businessman, who hinders Nickin's investigation. More deeply involved in this conspiracy, Nick realizes that he has fallen into a network of complex lies and red breads, nothing is invisible and can not trust anyone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is a shameless nightmare for watching, and for many reasons, it is not worth watching for the above reason, intentionally confusing itself. Casting is full of unusual talent, but most are wasted. Toshiro Mifune has one of the shortest and most meaningless community roles in cinematic history; Elizabeth Taylor appears uncredited and does not have a dialogue line; Richard Boone seems to be an interesting part, but his character goes nowhere. John Huston plays a very good role as a powerful patriarch and delivers a few fun moments to delivering the film, acerbic. Anthony Perkins takes a creepy role and works well, and the timing of the screen is too short to do the fullness of the character. Some nudity and sex scenes are not thrown out for any real reason, and they are actually a different film, if they are quite timely and can apply for the voyes. The semi-romantic heart of the film creates an attractive and frustrating but strange paradoxically memorable one. Of course, there is a listener who prays somewhere to kill in the winter, but I'm not counted among myself.
