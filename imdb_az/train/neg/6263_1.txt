Henry Sala's "Nightmare Weekend" is a piece of rotten mud from Troma. This is a young, drowsy and stupid low-budget horror film about some young girls who spend a weekend in a mansion. The bad assistant professor leaks his daughter into a strange scheme To make malicious experiments, she turns her victims and dates into a zombie. "Nightmare Weekend" is a piece of completely braindead with lots of nudity and cheese features to celebrate laughable musical score. is full of fear and the scenario is not completely contradictory. Why does this kind of spinning leave me aside?
