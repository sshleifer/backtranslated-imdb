At the outset, we see the beginning of a sort of secret council. Everyone seems more encouraging than going. When some supernatural elements are thrown out, the mystery becomes more exciting in the minute. The main character that seems to be a good bloke is a temptation and other factors, due to his claim to money. You really want to know with certainty about what happens with the boy. Normally there are several options in his situation. There are no options in any way. Although it is clear that there is no crime in this film, there is a solution. In the blue sea, the church is facing symbols of prayer and prayer about God. And they answer for his problem. At one point in the film, we must explicitly state what this solution is. Now I want to report that there is nothing wrong with this message. It's always useful. But hiding this message was really important. This religious element actually broke the viewing experience for me. Although the message is good, simplicity can not escape the need for more in real life to solve issues presented in this movie. The secret presented to us is never solved. Instead, you have to deal with another topic, which is largely related to the plot. Do not be fooled by Malcolm McDowell. Once a brilliant actor is enough, but if you watch closely, you see that it is not serious. He really should be desperate for the money. Otherwise, he will have a caliber actor to act in such a film.
