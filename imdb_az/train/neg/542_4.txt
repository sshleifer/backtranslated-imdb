First there is Gujarati Theater, then there is Bollywood. Both are strong and admirable. The author should look elsewhere at the Gujarati Theater during the production of Vipul Shah in Bulgaria. Initially he made Aankhen (adapted from the Gujarati game) - there was a unique area, but he could not hold it as a Hindi movie. Now he has fought another Gujarati game and named it Time - racing over time. The goal is to remember feelings. Field development is not for Hindi films. For example, do not bring a Hindu film, the Gujarati Theater, which plays the role of father and son. Even the comedy pathways are the best for the Gujarati scene. All speeches are average - nothing to declare - Chef Chehay Shah.
