Thankfully, I watched it in a friend's place and did not pay for it. The area is terribly transparent and the entire movie is felt like an episode of a TV show. If you have any information about computers or electronics, please explain it carefully. You will notice that the film is insulting your intelligence. <br /> <br /> The famous actress has become a Much Music VJ. Amanda Walsh shows the worst things I've ever seen, except porn. Matt Lanter is lucky to be truly worthy. She carries the film. <br /> <br /> I am wasting about two hours of my life following this movie! In fact, because I am an admirer of the original, which is a good thing, they are a shame to call later.
