(following various spoilers) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly. Sometimes it is not Georges Guette who is criticized for being too young and non-French. Sometimes it is not Leslie Caron, which is criticized for its very green performance. <br /> <br /> In any case, it would be Gene Kelly. he is very ambitious and has a focus on having him as convincing artist in Paris, there is something about his screen persona, the content is facing frolicking, frolicking with little children and older ladies on the streets, and putting off. In SINGIN 'S RAIN and other films, he played so ambitious, focused on him. Jerry Mulligan is a cousin of Tommy Albright, another Lerner story with Kelly's miscast Kelly, as an American-like Brigadoon, a fascinating European location and a virtue that unforgettes innocent women who embody his virtues. <br /> <br /> Only Jerry weakened Tommy, or even did not want to. There is something else about this movie. Jerry is sometimes worse for Milo and a cadet. When he first sees a club, he plays a dirty game to dance with him. When you sit down again, it's a worse game to get your phone number. If he calls her next day, she takes it as a sign of falling in the workplace and pointing to it. And it is clear that all this has nothing to do with it. When he starts laughing at his jokes at the perfume shop, he believes he is interested in Milow's paintings. Sure he's ghost and playful, but he's a gentleman at the opening? <br /> <br /> Henri looks confident, partly because of the fact that the actress has to come up with such antipathy, so why should he rule her. If they play a role like a high school, they say, Judy Garland, will glow with Jerry's angry insults and glow. If performed by Cyd Charisse, one would be amazed at one. But when he first played by Timer Leslie Caron, he looks and acts as a shy, sensitive teenager, and ultimately Jerry looks just like a reptile. And all the story is that when these two young people depend on the affair of poor Sweethearts (why not they are the ones who want to solve the changing things), why not download these other actors when disentangling themselves to their loveless commitments? Only Gene Kelly Guet and Foch are older enough to be Caron's father for several years above. <br /> <br /> In a word I would like to have some young comedies relief-type dancers cast like all Jerry, usually appearing in the roles that support music ... for example, Ray MacDonald GOOD NEWS or Bobby Van at the SMALL TOWN GIRL . Perhaps not necessarily, but some of them LIKE. He could chase Lise and play it in a harmless way; someone who turned out to be living really happy in the Chapkinsque-in-the-wall; who contradicts the Oscar Levant's sarcastic hearts with humor and naivety. Probably, this ballet could have been better. He could give Gershwin a voice that could sound better. <br /> <br /> All this can create an impression of my love for Gene Kelly. I love her. Most of those films were terrific, not just that (good and several others). I do not despise the EIP itself; has good points as it is in the direction of art. And despite the inexperience, Leslie Caron looks pretty attractive and really looks like she's out of a painting. Georges Guette is a wonderful work and his favorite number in his "Stairway to Paradise" movie. Nina Foch was beautiful and touching and should end with SOMEBODY. But Jerry is not Mulligan. I do not ask him about it.
