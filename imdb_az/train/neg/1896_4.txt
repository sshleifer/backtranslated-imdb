This film does not show us something original. Each idea or action (action) scene can be found in many earlier releases. Interesting Nick is completely right here. Even Patton is calm, bad, and good. Mr. Duvall is okay, but he has a very small part. And Angelina is so, so how can we determine her newly created stardom? In general, there are so many characters that nobody and nothing is particularly detailed. This makes it easy to forget the movie. Too bad, do not you think?
