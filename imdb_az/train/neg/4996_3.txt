I really love the first half hour of this movie, but, wow, it turns into a kind of horn or I just say "stupid". This is another example of obsolete humor. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell could have been funny in 1940, but it was not. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interested to watch. <br /> <br /> He was as good as Jimmy MacDonald, but the rest began to slip through his lover's music and the music of Busby Berkeley. at least, Maxford House Coffee Company boss (Raymond Walburn), who did nothing but shouting at all. He was brutal to hear and greatly hurt the film.
