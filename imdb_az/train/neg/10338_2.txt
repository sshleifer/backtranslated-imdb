<br /> <br /> Mike Hammer, filmmaking from Ralph Meeker, to an oily peak, is a wooden predictive exercise. <br /> <br /> Mike Hammer is in the real sociopaths of detective artistic works. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who set tracks to solve the mystery, Hammer is separated from each other to reach the truth. This film turns Hammer into a fungus with bad guys ... well, it's a mute thing to confront something. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Velda, for example, dances in the barrele or accidentally bows his boss on the back crazy bad guy. And sustainability disturbances are shameful: Frau Blucher falls below the center line when it's tight on the lower legs of the camera, but when the camera rolls back for a larger shot, it's the side. The worst break is before the popcorn attack. Therefore, it was so bad that a few days ago, it was so bad that it was the only reason to collect two points from 10.
