I called this movie for some reason - Al Adamson. Ed Wood, Jr and Ray Dennis Steckler and the horror pantone are among the worst executives of all time. But I was a little surprised, because the film was really bad, but it never came to the terrible level of its previous films. That's why it was not fun for us to watch the movie's admirers. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a Naughty Stewardesses movie title pornographic film - something is not about reviewing IMDb. However, this film has sometimes appeared to be this time - especially in the first 10 minutes. But for the majority of the film, there are no titulus and you can say that the film has been subjected to many changes, as it does not go out of violence and definitely is not a sexually explicit area. !! The result of all this is the general confusion. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, none of the many parts is good. For example, as a porn video, this surprisingly little shows, and some of them are unclear why some 71-year-old boy will leave. Of course, 71-year-old Mr. Livingston looked very good - but he was still an old man and nobody would ever want to see him with a young nymphet! Then, in the last 20 minutes, it became very severe, like Livingston Rambo! <br /> <br /> Generally, it's too little to recommend this sad movie. It's not pretty enough or it's not sexy enough to care, and the movie becomes so dull with such a crazy hood as "Naughty Stewardesses".
