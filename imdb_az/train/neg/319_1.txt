A friend bought this movie for 1 pound, and was even overpriced later. Despite the great names Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and unusual talented Burt Young, this movie was funny as a straight-through drill. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Adam Sandler, successful for women to succeed he wants to become a comedian. When a resident of the ship is a comedian - Dickie, a shamelessly-called Dickie, because of his unsuccessful success in the sea, Sandler's character Shecker takes a great break. Dickie is not dead, she is locked in the bathroom, most likely, in the sea. <br /> <br /> Maybe he's been crazy about the worst movie of all time.
