"Visitor Q" is an unsuccessful attempt in black heroism. This is one of the world's most dysfunctional families, including sexual harassment, heroism, and sexual harassment, and so on. The film was met with a very critical acclaim and built a small cult following. Nevertheless, "Visitor Q" with home video quality and slapdash does not remain just a matter of interest. Sexually explicit and sanitary techniques are apparent, makeup is terrible and everything is the best amateur. Loss of time. (C-)
