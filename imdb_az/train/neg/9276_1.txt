This is a really bad little movie. Undoubtedly, the original (un) holy trio was regulated by a law regulated by the third film, "Last Battle", so it is now possible to turn into a ridiculous subtitling about half a part of the film, "to be the raison d'etre for the series. But then take on this jumped-up TV movie (avoid Omen Box Receivers on DVD - Do not deceive by broader screen ratio of transfer, it was a serious small screen products) and, in general, are the producers and the producer of the first three films, Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I'll give it to the scene where ordinary death scenes (which were hopelessly designed for television sensitivity) and some of the bad things I've seen. Everyone involved in this project should be embarrassed by the fact that this torture should never be screwed up to the catering people, and masked under Omen's name. If someone agrees with my research to prevent this confusion, I will feel better.
