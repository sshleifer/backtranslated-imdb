Someone claims to be one of the worst films in the world when it comes to movies like this. This is not one of the worst films ever, though it is still a good movie, but not the worst. Look at something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake, and then come and tell me you think Charlie is the worst of the night. <br /> <br /> The film has a better camera work and a straightforwardness. It's almost too much for unusual dark movies. <br /> <br /> There is no death on the screen of the movie, there is a death rip into a neck that saw its pruning, but all other deaths are tough. But the lack of graphic violence on the screen is not a movie, it's not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The movie was not meant to be very serious. The film came to the end of the second slasher era, and, of course, it was reflected in the traditional slasher elements in a tongue tongue. For example, after an assassination, Charlie goes to the "welcome" sign of the city and reduces the population a little. <br /> <br /> If you go to this movie, give this movie an hour. It's a little different from your usual slasher movie, but not many. The comedy of the movie tells us that many listeners will enjoy a rest and a movie. If you forget the movie, you can remember it. I remember because I remember the name.
