I'm a big fan of the B5, and I'm only at the end of the season. I watched all the past seasons I had syndicated, and eventually became one of the best thought-out stories for television. Even filling episodes were interesting. <br /> <br /> Films were also well-produced and enjoyable in theaters. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to the "Mount of Spirits". Of course, after seeing everything I had high expectations. Martin Sheen was not a serious Sci-Fi story, but an Ed Wood film. The story itself could have looked good on the form of a survey, and even brought it to the story team. But when it's time to write a concept in a 2-hour film, it's obvious. There is no special impression to entertain us with the absence of an attractive story. They have places where there is little time left, and they only prepare a dialogue to fill the story. If it had been a normal season, it would remain among the worst episodes.
