I've seen this movie a long time ago ... fortunately it was free. I have to be one of the 20 people watching this movie in the theater. I do not remember a whole group, but because of the incredible difficulties, the apartment has no meaning and at least I said at least I never saw what the worst movie was now when I left the theater. I was pretty worried with just one thing: if temperatures are too low for human beings to approach the sun, why can not they turn a comfortable temperature apart from being warm and sweaty? How foolish do we think?
