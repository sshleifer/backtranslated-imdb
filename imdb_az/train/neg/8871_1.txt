Perhaps I'm watching 200 movies in both theaters and at home, and I can be sure that this movie is in the worst case I've been seeing this year (though not the "Delta Element Map" yet). <br /> <br /> This movie is a bad joke after a 13-year-old joke, and I am uncomfortable with looking at a bus journey that I'm not going to go the way. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a blessing and it's in the horse's lease. Four dollars can be used to produce any movie with numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.
