When I saw this movie for the first time, I would think it would be a good sasquatch movie. Usually there are ONE sasquatch when you are watching such movies, but what is it? 7 or 10 of them? The act was good, the plot was ok, the scenes that sasquatcher killed the first couple, loved the camera work very well. I was expecting it to be a movie, but it was very small. This movie was better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel really needs to make more sasquatch films, that is, I love Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, something I would consider, but I did not have a Sasquatch movie, but I would not go back to the road. This movie is good in rainy Saterday afternoon, but in any other case, no.
