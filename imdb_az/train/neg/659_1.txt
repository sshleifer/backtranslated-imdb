This film is a good example of the overwhelming lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. People have been paid for this paragraph to show that there are no original ideas and talent in the entertainment business. <br /> <br /> The proposed teacher (3 years ago) kills the young man's family because he wants it. Kill her mother, her father, and her brother for no reason. From the first five minutes you are looking at the bad movement and direction. Years later, a teacher in prison leaves the prison. HMM - a typical bad article - nobody knows in the city where terrorism is at the last moment. The Obsessive Teacher is like a Seal, hiding around, exploring people, and super-murdering a knife. Sure !!! Now the obsessive teacher kills the hotel servant for some reason, stabbles his bellhop for fun and hunts teenage teens. Now there is a perfect way for a girl to love you. The obsessive teacher leaves the hotel --- still stupid, but the police knows his face - but he's going to the right. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> If another profession is dealing with this poor quality, would be dispatched. But these stupid people spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to write and manage the garbage.
