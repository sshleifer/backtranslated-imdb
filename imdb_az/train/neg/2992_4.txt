The second most popular horror sub-genre was the probability of the dead who died after the 1970s and 1980s. Slasher films were 'Black Christmas' and 'Halloween', to get all the stuff, zombie flickks were George Romero's Dead movie. Shortly after the first two successes in design, other filmmakers wanted cash. Many Italian directors like Lucio Fulci, who brought us a "Zombie" one year after Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" was interested. , Italy and in another country, known as 'Zombie', and Fulci's film was known as 'Zombie 2'. The trip has nothing to do with Romero, but a good movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Awesome" Acting is not exactly good, but it seems fun to play and experience. After a slow start, the movement acts as a moving figure. Unpleasant surprise for those who love bad cheese and bad movies. Good work on makeup effects. <br /> <br /> Media: Nothing you've never seen before. "The Return of Living Dead" spoils some of the first pair of films. Cardboard characters. Last ideas: Not so aging because of rock music of the 1980s (All rock music of that era is not bad), clothing, First of all, it continues to Fulci's cult classics. Actually, I do not know if the film is about to go out of the place where it has not been released. For those who did not know, Fulci was ill and abandoned during production and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mattei movies are pretty funny, but most of these movies make fun of fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (So-bad-it's-good rating) 2/5 (Serious rating)
