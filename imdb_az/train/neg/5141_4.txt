1914 was a beautiful year for Charlie Chaplin. It was the first film in the film and appeared in more than 30 films! The majority of these films were not particularly good, allowing him to slow down his screen identity. However, the "Little Tramp" character that was introduced in this movie was still in development. Undoubtedly, Charlie looked at the section, but his character had not yet had the sweetness and animosity he had developed. <br /> <br /> Along with this, Chaplin often shot, hit, or did other harmless things to people. <br /> <br /> As for this very small movie, it is interesting to watch for the shooting. Although not familiar today, along with Chaplin, Mabel Normand, Chester Conklin and Mack Swain, all the stars that are famous for the Keystone Films. The problem with this film, despite some beautiful scenes, is a very uncertain and uneven development. Chester and Mabel came to the racetrack (a very common subject of the Keystone production - to be placed near a racetrack). Charlie and Mack show and hide. Charlie checks around Chester and Mack is being persecuted by police when stealing her daughter. In the end, the police take Chester and Mack to no avail - Charlie and Mabel (who strangely do not seem to have been abolished by Charlie's fraudulent behaviors). <br /> <br /> A great silent comedy enthusiast or film historian is a very unforgettable film that is important in the evolution of the Chapel. It's not particularly funny when it's seen today, as it's not unusual for a keystone movie, if she and other actresses really are doing on the stage.
