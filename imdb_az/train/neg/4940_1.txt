This show has proven that a 30-minute pre-DVR hard disk space is lost. I did not expect much and actually took less. I do not expect this show to be canceled by the second episode, and I do not believe Geico will not use the cavern advertising campaign again. I would like my daughter to spend a night watching her hair on top and watching this garbage. ABC, what happened to this show '07 autumn rush, possibly adapting to a hospital / crime / documentary reality show covering the AFLAC duck? If I have not commented on this show, let it be clear to me and not be very good.
