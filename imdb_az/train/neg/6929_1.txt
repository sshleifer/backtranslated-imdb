I'm looking at this movie and decided to give it a shot. After me, I was an open-minded person, and I gave good looks to some pretty flips. On top of that, the loans I made came to me to say a meaning and a good thing. Here's how it goes on: "This movie was short in kind." Therefore, the Sets and the visuals were well-prepared and helped the music of the displaced people, but the film was painful to watch, and endless dialogue was far from good luck. I used to laugh at this movie, but laugh at your best friend who is embarrassed in front of a large crowd. <br /> <br /> I came to the "chicken dance" in the final. they only decided to shoot the film and throw their bodies into the place where they fell. I do not know if he can save this movie. The player did not have a bad look and his budget seemed to have been, but there was no way to wait. even having beautiful naked breasts. Perhaps you need to create a doobie or drink a beer to get the full movie experience. In any way, I'm not really watching this movie really depressed. Then I told myself, "At least I'm Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon." I'm better than those guys. "
