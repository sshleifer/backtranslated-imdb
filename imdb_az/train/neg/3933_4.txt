A great hit with the Australian audience can still be funny today, but the top political mistake and blunt, unusual humor can make a crazy blow to this. Extremely long; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Of course, the attitude of the ouser Aussie it's funny, but the movie is boring as well. Some say that Crocker's songs are the best bit, and they are, of course, original, but "cheerful"? Barry McKenzie's adventures will go as a turning point in Australian cinema, but we have to do everything we can to prevent foreigners from seeing the majority of Austrians as Barry McKenzies (or Mick Dundees!). . Rating: 5/10
