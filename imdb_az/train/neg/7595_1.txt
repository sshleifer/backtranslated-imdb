"Ask Powder" appeared interesting from the novel, and especially like all actors. Unfortunately, the film was not as attractive as a drama and was not funny enough to be a comedy. It did not appear to be practically saturated and enjoyable. Seventy minutes after waiting for this to happen, my wife and I have never spent more time in this nonsense. It was simply fascinating, immobile, entertaining and artistic. It looks like a middle-aged child writes, produces and controls; The worse, still the embarrassing loss of talented actors, did not remember our time and money.
