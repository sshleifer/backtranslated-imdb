The late ridiculous, the characters are incredible, the dialogue link and the end is absurd. Believe me, I'm an admirer of Kevin Clan, but keep Pepe Le Pew's shot for 2 hours while waiting for it, because it's not as fun as a Frenchman is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> <BR> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Meg Ryan is also a lizard and seductress on the one hand (pick a choice): kewpie doll, baby, puppy, kitten, everything you think is the most creature on the planet. <br /> <br /> This film is not really the same as a human being. <br /> This movie shot me and my friends with Lawrence Kasdan and Kline in Paris and in southern France as an opportunity to strike. o That is why I do not really blame them.
