It's still not difficult to understand that such a movie in Hollywood would be bad. The player and story are simply miserable and the direction is awful. I do not see any logic behind this trash, maybe the director does not have a good job. I've been tens of thousands closer to my precious thirty rupees. It made me excited that I would spend more time in this life. I think the film was shot in less than a day. I do not know what category I have. Please refrain from taking this film for granted, just do something, even pull your head off the wall, but do not go to this movie.
