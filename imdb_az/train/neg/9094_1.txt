Okay, I'm for you guys forty ... THIS HORRIBLE! <br /> <br /> If Roger Kumble had such a fancy work in the first cruel intentions, why did he do such a bad thing? Sorry, but this movie is not stupid, although it may have been developed despite the release of its array, but it can be real ... this movie is a naked! Many of the bugs in action * Knitting scene * "Kissing Cousins" ?????? What is this line? "Slipery Time Wet" ?????????? We call DUH-M! This movie worked hard, I'll give it to you, but it was a stupid! In fact, they even tried to make homemate workers so funny that they were actually foolish ... FUNNY IS NOT! It was a pity. Do not tell everyone that they did not actually look at this one. They thought they had turned them into something different or something! I really want to watch it when I'm really a fact that sometimes happens. For your likes ... OK, what did you think? Perhaps you can choose this great movie starring and wonderful Sarah Michelle Gellar? Sarah Michelle Gellar, DUH! But this is not a movie, Amy Adams is not a crime. Oh, yes, because Sebastain has a heart when ????? UGH!
