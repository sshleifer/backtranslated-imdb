When I make a worse movie than Fassbinder, I'm sure I do not want to see it! Everyone who complains that his films are very talkative and claustrophobic must be forced to learn to evaluate more reserve style that he chose for perfect films like "Petra von Kant Bitter Tears". This movie seems like a parody of "art-movie" with short symbolic images. The scenery in Mezbahada and the 10-minute walk of Elvira's prostitute are just two of the finest examples of a true test of the film's loyalty to the audience. But what really amazes me is how many scenes characterized by Elvira and her ex-spouse and / or daughter. These are the only moments that prove the true human emotions and prove that it is a beautiful film that fights to release itself in the mainstream of this horrible film. Which is a waste.
