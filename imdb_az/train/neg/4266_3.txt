Of course, NOMAD has the best horseback riding scenes, swordsmanship and doubtless landscape cinema, but this is not what makes a good movie. This helps, but the story should be brilliant on these works. <br /> <br /> <strong> Nomad escapes. <br /> <br /> The story stilted just to make it look like a "cold" movie that's just "big". Most of the main characters are not from the region where this story occurs (and obviously known as Lee and Hernandez). <br /> <br /> Filmmakers who want to have a culture like the Caucasus and the refugees should use the actors / actresses that are partial towards the party. <br /> <br /> War tribes, prophecy, brotherhood love and respect, love of love that we attach to "heroes" have touched everything, but a little bit more that the audience will not damage the next battle sequence, the scene of the next horse's horse, or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape impact and display time. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that during the shooting, significant changes have taken place, especially for the director and cinematographer, Nomad.
