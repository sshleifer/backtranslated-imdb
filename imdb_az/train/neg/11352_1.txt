This is where you are allowed to write a story about a 10-year-old (manic American) journey a month. The absolute garbage that has no rescue quality maybe a bit surprised at the 3D division. but it did nothing to wast an hour or a half as a narrative and fun animation. Protect your time and money and watch BOLT instead <br /> <br /> Damn it. There is not enough line, but I feel it is summarizing ... it's a good thing, and I'm reviewing - this is a cold war propaganda story. Perhaps, the moon or the flies would give more information about the flies that occurred in the first minute. BTW - Why are all the main characters deformed? - There is no definite definition of the signs of anyone!
