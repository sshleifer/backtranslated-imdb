Look, there's nothing strange about this movie, it's just boring. There is a typical rom-com with a seemingly visible trail before coming to see as a trailer. The main difference is that the wisdom of the classical romances is lack of elegance and claim. There is no claim in this movie, but there is no sense of action, as though you were coming up and feeling like you were going. There is also a debut movie made fifteen years before the film's production. I recommend Harry Sally to watch a classic movie again when it comes to Sultaya instead of this artificial imitation. Oh, another big problem ... no chemistry. If you use Michael to see all the cute looking Michael like Aliau Vaughn, he'll be seriously disappointed with what he's looking at here.
