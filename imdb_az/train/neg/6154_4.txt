Portly beautiful guy falls for a sweet blonde; He loves it, but not because of what you can think of. Writer Pat Proft's little black comedy shows a very good performance by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, but still does not have a lasting effect. It is a luxurious effort by Norman Bates himself, by Anthony Perkins. A similar "Raoul cooking" is a better price at the B comedy level. Here's a definite entertaining structure here; Unfortunately, there is no place to go to the second act of the picture. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting attempt, but that's wrong. <br /> <br /> ****
