Why not go to theaters after watching this movie soon? This movie is about the "prequel" label. Instead, there is a common theme in Hollywood, before good films are disastrous prequels, sequels, and so on. Wipe it off <br /> <br /> The structure of this film was spinning somewhere like a ping pong ball and the character's development was void. I felt as seriously as I was watching a comedy in some polling stations because the player was very bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Carlito's Way Great, I do not advise to watch it. When it comes to watching it anyway, treat it as if it was dismantled from the original because it is exactly what it is.
