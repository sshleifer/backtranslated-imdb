With intense comedy entertainment, musical intervention, humorous and floral complications create a quick theme that carries processes throughout the tempo through a maze. Boris Carloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre form a very bad betrayal. The scenario contains all standard mysterious film props-sliding panels, secret passages, thunderstorms, and lightning and toxic pulse darts. Carloff, Lugosi and Lorre are going for heavy duty lyers and open melodramatic era. Kay Kyser and his team offered great fun because people in the 1940s were trying to forget the horrors of the Second World War.
