After watching this movie, the only thing that protects my vomit is that it is just TV actors, and it's not a strange show that is not usually seen on the television show. TV fans will not love the film, but it's not the only reason. This movie has a lot of fun as it gets a root channel. This is approaching the depth of the film and gets worse. I will not waste time explaining this movie in more detail; I regret the poor cameras who are suffering from watching this c ** p for the first time.
