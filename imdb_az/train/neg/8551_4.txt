In 1982, after a dramatic SAS Rescue from Balconys and two days after the siege of the Iranian embassy in war with Argentina on the Falkland Islands, what better way to make a movie than Gung-Ho "SAS"? - When using the UK's number one protagonist, Lewis Collins, Iran's hostage besieged. Throw Edward Woodward and some other well-known players and win them. Good! Although the film itself is not serious enough, the player is second-rate. The film resembles the long episode of "The Professionals", but without the formula. This movie is fast moving and is predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli watched this movie and decided to replace Lewis Collins's Touted James Bond for Roger Moore. If you are a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS's works, watch out for your time.
