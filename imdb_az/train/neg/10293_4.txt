My husband and I watch many films every night, which require no carelessness and thinking. There is a lot of patience for films that are slow to flower. My husband has twice as much my attention. All that said - this movie is just empty and BORING! They did not go anywhere. It never flourished. He started strong enough with a promising ammunition ... then he cooks desserts ... goes to Spain ... he sulks, he stares .... loan roll. Irregular, hollow filled, starts wrong, and dead ends. We are FF with a few extended sequences that range from space to space alone. Artificial depth was designed when he played with the mud and cried. Zzzz ...... looks like a beautiful shot about talking about becoming a deep or artisan. You never know nor understand Morver. No more than half now. We just wanted to see at least one of the plot lines. Do not waste your time on this. I was shocked at such a high price.
