I would like the best of interest. When I look at a single trailer, we can tell you all about the movie; I could save at least an hour, forty minutes, and about twenty dollars in my life. This film was a disaster, and this is a shame for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film shows a live ignorance of reality. For example, this child's remote-controlled racing car goes to the neighborhood and even enters this house. It is even covered with clothes. Is it unreasonable to believe that a remote signal can not be sent remotely over these conditions? Hollywood obviously did not believe it. It reflects any concept of general logic and electronics; I could go to the street even if the race car remained in the house until the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence that criminals have. In all these films, why are these criminals the rocket scientists until they reach the age of eight? Is the child the most intelligent person in the film instead of professional terrorists? There is more reality in the matrix. Also, the leader puts a real pistol and selects a "casual" plastic pistol; Probably could not tell the difference. Even if you have a glove you should do it. It does not mean anything for the same thing; There are other feelings after sight. Salts are also non-real; If one of them worked, the criminals would be dead. Hollywood intends to "laugh" in the "comic" results of the traps. I did not laugh; <br /> <br /> I advise anyone who thinks this film is really a bad movie; The film they see will look like this with Citizen Kane. Otherwise, throw one out of your pride. Home Alone 3 also generates a question. We all know the stars in the film Alex D. Linz, but he also wrote?
