<br /> <br /> At that time, when I walked halfway through the Twin Towers, I watched Ping Jackson's version of the Lord of the Rings, and it was absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> At that time, the animated version of the Lord of the Rings was released on the DVD, but I told myself that before reading it, I will read the Two Towers and the King's Leader (as I think it shows all trilogy). <br /> <br /> When I finish the trilogy <br /> It seems to me that I missed my book for 20 minutes because the book's lover, <br /> <br /> It's at least 1 and would have thought half the time to fit a movie of 2 hours and 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> There was no feeling of emotion when talking to a conversation without any symbol. reading a page, even Gandalf, which is my favorite character, does not seem to be interesting. <br /> <br /> This film is based on animation, orchestras (awesome) and part of the movie because of Aragorn and Sam. <br /> <br /> I did not even know this movie, but it was released because it was not a good fit, but because of the fact that the movie was not better, the manufacturer ran from the money. <br /> <br /> I hope that nobody will judge the books in this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
