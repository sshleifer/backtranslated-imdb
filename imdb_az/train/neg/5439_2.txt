The revival of Cecil B. deMille in 1922 The revival of men finds the beloved Leatrice Joy as a good heart, but as a woman who deals more with money. His disobedience leads to his imprisonment, which leads to his restoration. Thomas Meighan is an enthusiastic area in Lydia (Joy), a private cypress who carries goodness and loyalty, but contacts with alcohol and helps him to rescue him after he is released! <br /> <br /> If the terrain does not sound too bad, you will be repeatedly presented. The quality of DeMille is very low, and does not show the specific skills it has. Photography is standard and straightforward and straightforward is not difficult. One can easily be classified as a fashion show and can be quite accurate. DeMille can wear many different garment clothes (night dresses, golf suits, suits, fur hats) that can be seen as the "1922 fashion" of Miss Joy. <br /> <br /> Something more frustrating is the actor who is more flat and wooden than photography or editing. If this is not the case, it is simply a recurring silent gesturing, rounding eyebrows, twitching eyebrows, and deliberately pointing and moving the ball. It's hard to keep track of what's happening with the sounds of the worst snooze films for modern audiences and scenic chewing. Lois Wilson, the only member of the triumphant victory, is not only beautiful, but of course his role. He is convincing and convincing in the tearful approach as long as you have not read the morals title after you open it once. As I said, everyone is in something else, Joy, Meighan, and even Julia Faye. <br /> <br /> The worst and most entertaining part of this film is the heavy moral tone that carries all these. Meighan's character, American youth, has diminished in his moral position and has many controversy about Rome's going to collapse. (Enter absurd flashback) The film's morale is described as Victorian, but it's more. <br /> <br /> This film is less sensitive to the moment when modern viewers are less serious than they can do. <br /> <br /> This movie, without knowing, is a 'typical' silent movie, archaic moral structure, wooden movement and bad orientation. DeMille shows that he can be an admirable director, no pacing, camera deployment or scripts, or ability to look at actors. I do not think seriously about anyone's right thoughts. Irresistible, slow and irony, I only come up for heavy silent films like myself.
