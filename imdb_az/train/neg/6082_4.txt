Although there are many "television" names that are related to the "A Man Called Shledge," there is nothing unusual in either the film itself or in the performances. In fact, the only thing that distinguishes the 1960s-70 television series, like The Rat Patrol, is a big shot and more violence. <br /> <br /> James Garner is the biggest star in the world, and it seems he has all his light comedy ("Maverick", "Support for Local Sheriff" - "Gunfighter"). Unfortunately, Sledge is a humorous character with the cash of the Clint Eastwood's spaghetti western popularity. <br /> <br /> <strong> Economy> <strong> The Economic Development Ministry, the US Institute of Economics, is a filmmaker of the Slow-Speed ​​Combat TV series, Vic Morrow, and a co-writer with Frank Kowalski will feel the connection. Take some fashionable slow-motion shots and solve a crystal, instead of focusing on a story-telling purpose. <br /> <br /> This is a standard "big heist" that calls the question "Sledge Wagon". His team includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The issue is that the movement of 40 passengers in the movement is maintained and locked into a toner inside the terrain while suspended. <br /> <br /> The story can give an hour-long television, but it's too old like a multi-ply film. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> > Garner does not allow any of his attraction to spoil his attraction, and does not make enough room for the film's interest. <br /> <br /> The party is finally a gentle and totally illogical card game. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know? I'm just a kid.
