I will write about this movie and I will write about "I'm not forwarded" (in his famous scene). If you have not yet seen the movie, you are notified. <br /> <br /> The changeable smart Rosario Dawson is really good, and for almost a decade he has a young man (like a teenager). other words). This guy is good, but loses his "bad" touch before it's over. If it does not really change, then why is a woman going to shut it up? It would not have been the time. Then we also have the bartender / 2 rape Dude. Actually, I do not think you need it. At least for the 2nd aggression, and then more. <br /> <br /> Let's reflect on the story. Rosarios's character is sexually unstable, and may even have lesbian tendencies (see scene with a female friend). This is not intentional as Rosario itself says, but there is sexual tension between them. The nature of Rosario meets a boy with all the bad feelings, a Predator. <br /> <br /> Rosario said that her character was a boy before. I differ. Because she is acting as her first lover who emphasizes her phone conversation with her mother. Talking about her mother, there is another problem. After the first aggression, the character of Rosarios does not tell anyone what is happening. His relationship with his mother is very close, and nothing will be investigated from now on. The Rosarios character will no longer call her mother and if she behaved strangely, her mother would be nervous. There was a lot of potential here. <br /> <br /> If you feel like a pinch, when you compare it to the ending (rape) that you feel like hitting a hammer with a hammer! Not after the attack. We take scenes that extend beyond 1. The topics are open (for example, its construction work is an indication that it can be a pleasure as a state where one tries to hit it), but remained open. If you abandon the son of the barman who is entering the 2nd and last rape area, no real social contacts are set up. As you can see, she is not a "nice guy" and her character is slightly reduced. However, when the character of Rosaryos is again in the class of an aggressor, it seems futile to be in the movie. We think the Rosaryos character is already "bad" and can harm people. (Too) Many scenes show exactly what he is doing with drugs and other things. Return to Rapist # 1, cheating on a test, was captured by the character of Rosarios and decided to stay together again (really?). As absurd as it sounds, the boy did not see us in advance, and he did not see another girl (he harshly pursued it even though we did not see it) and his football career. A good career is a stretch and intention. This is an attempt to deepen his character and almost works, but staying with you is still very clich√©. So the Rapist introduces the # 1 Rosarios character ... why exactly? Because it was the day he had promised him? Again, really? Such a guy loses control of a woman, especially because he has been harassed at first, and will never lose it ... I think it must show us how stupid it is. The bartender would have acted as someone who wanted to hit the head or something, but decided to approach him, but they just felt wrong. <br /> <br /> Thus, the aggressor # 1 is robbery, and his eyes remain stranded, and the Rosaryos character is locked in a bed .... seriously, it's crazy! But what comes next is even better. At first he speaks to him, then he is "shouting" and sends him something. It's hard to look like the number one rape scene. It's not just about whether this guy is worthy or not. And, of course, they were aiming. Now "after the barman's son" comes in and aggression ... aggressor # 1. If it really should act as a revenge movie, it would have been Rosario's "revenge." <br /> <br /> Having a fleet of this job takes everything that has been built. <br /> <br /> This entertaining / enjoyable, night is a challenging hour, Art-house. But 10 minutes (I did not think) aggression at the end of the scene, it just crashes everything. Rosarios is more or less characteristic, just watching what's happening. <br /> <br /> Unequal Comparison: There is an "irreversible" case of harassment, but the film was filmed (even when it was time out). Rosario finally looks at the camera and says something to go on. First, it should come a little late and say it after the first aggression. Second, and most importantly, the place where Art-House should come here. It is even more interesting to see that the Rosaryos character will go after the second aggression and understand what it is doing. <br /> <br /> Good intentions (Talia and Rosario worked in the past), but they are set off, even though they do not hesitate to convey most of the things (though they must be convincing, they will not work). ..
