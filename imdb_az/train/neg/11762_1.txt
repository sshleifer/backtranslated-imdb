Like South Africa, it's insulting to think that someone has actually paid for this nonsense! <br /> <br /> Although the director is one of the original Shaka Zulu mini writers, this "extra" series is horrific! The original series was based on historical facts about a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who plays a major role in shaping the history of the local tribes in South Africa. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is a hogwash, taken from the barrel by the writer. <br /> <br /> Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what is David Hasselhoff, crying and weeping over the slaves who drown in her red bush? <br /> <br /> I did not expect that blonde, busty women would not appear anywhere, and that little red beach suits would go away from the screen. Probably some of the caveman suit would be more strange than a fantasy item that fell asleep after 10 pints of beer in a dress dress inspired by the return to an African theme for the next "blockbuster". .
