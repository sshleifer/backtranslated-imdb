This movie has a scene about 42 minutes, which is one of the worst I've ever seen. When F. Scott Fitzgerald (Gregory Peck) and Sheila Graham (Deborah Kerr) are sitting on the beach, suddenly things get tense and Sheila starts crying - she talks about her past past. This "dramatic scene" could not help me but came to my wife and it was an exciting situation about how stupid it was ... like dramatic music on television, like a shady crescendo. EVERYONE does not have such moments - no one. Now I can not say how true the rest of the movie is, but this particular moment was counterfeit, like $ 8 Rolex, and some of my other viewers think it's true. many beds. But I'm not an expert on the lives of these two people, and the internet did not clarify it. <br /> <br /> Who was only F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sheila Graham, and what was their relationship really? What I know about Fitzgerald seems different from what I see in the movie. Was film suave and decent man we saw first in the film? Yes, he was married, I think he was taking Graham and drinking like a fish, and I was not. Was he so surprised and caring, as we saw in the movie later? Perhaps, though, this is bad, though, when Graham remains with her, it's not someone who wants to be a complete puppet and want to see him in a movie. If it were not for him, the film had a poor effect on his memory. In both cases, it has been prepared for a painful and especially enjoyable viewing experience. <br /> <br /> The total of this film seems to be a story of two particularly unpleasant or healthy people. In darkness and righteousness, some may seem very entertaining, but most see it as a train crash without any surprise along the way! Unpleasant but brilliant production values ​​(especially lovely, but up-and-coming music) ask, "Why did they choose to do this primarily?" Responds to the question. Bottom line - this is a pretty bad movie around and probably not worth your time - even the great Gregory Peck admirer of mine.
