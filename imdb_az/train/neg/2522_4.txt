What a terrific movie! The idea of ​​robots fighting each other is cool, but the story is archaic, laughing, laughing in real human activity, showing non-existent and special effects (dependent on such a film). I was surprised that this was done in the 80's and since 1990 has been seen. Five years from these strangers! Okay, many people said that it was good considering the low budget, but only "what?" I think so. looks absolutely incredible. I still do not see a remake with modern special effects and a rewritten story, as the great robots still look at each other's ideas.
