I knew that I was falling asleep during the movies, but it was really a really tired, warm and comfortable group and a combination of things that just got too much to eat. But on this occasion I fell asleep because the movie was rubbish. The field was stable. Always slow and boring. Things have happened, but there is no explanation for why or why. I acknowledge that I left some part of the film, but I was watching the majority, and everything seemed to belong to me without any real concern. I do not recommend this movie anymore.
