(THESE CLAUSES) <br /> <br /> "Rosenstra√üe" is a film about heroic women in the German Nazi era. But a very long way, touching and sometimes even boring! <br /> <br /> The storyline is bad. Just like Cameron's Titanic, an old woman remembers what happened to her. Well, now we have a point of view. There is also a woman who knows another woman. Both are confused by the experiences of other people's lives! Come on! This is the lack of information about the main story ... How can Riemann learn about the fate of the little girl's mother and the question of the matter? <br /> <br /> The scenes are displayed incorrectly and you know rarely. For example, when the Riemann Fabian offered. When did this happen? The scene looks like the 20s ... <br /> <br /> Riemann's character is, of course, a talented pianist, not even a Baroness! Amazing! Wow. His brother returns from the East Frontier, he has bought some of the Ritterkreuz stages. So he is a hero of war and is still a wonderful person who keeps his conscience protected. He learned about the massacres committed by the Germans. He even photographed several photos! <br /> <br /> Military operations against the people living in the Caucasus continue. </ P> <p> And in the end, it's very simple. Riemann finds a way to goebbels bed - and so on! - everyone is free. In the beginning, despite the claim of a "real story", it is not a historical fact but a pure consciousness. <br /> <br /> It is not clear from a known incident like Sass. <br /> <br /> It is sad, but true, this is a typical German movie today. That's bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br />
