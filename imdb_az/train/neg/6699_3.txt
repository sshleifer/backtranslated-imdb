"Algie, Miner" is a bad and unfunny silent comedy. The time of the collision is completely extinguished. It's kind of humor with definite sequences that surprise you, whether it's funny or not. But the true quality of the film is important. This is essential for movie enthusiasts, mainly because it is one of the earliest examples of women's cinema. The main character of Algie is a very effeminate man who acts as a stereotypical "pansy" in many early films. The film has a general homophobia on time. "Algie, Miner" is terribly terrifying, but historically interesting. (3/10)
