If you follow this movie, I said, "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus." Hehehe !!! Every time you say "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus ..." Jesus, Jesus, why did I hire this movie? I do not believe how the Oscar awards such as Freeman and Spacey appear in the back part while Timberlake and LL Cool J display WTF Timberlake- Dreaful is moving! I think someone like Joshua Jackson would have done a better job! This work was perfect for Joshua Jackson and I believe that I'm not a great entertainment ... but I really like Timberlake android, but an actor <br /> <br /> Dylan Mc Dermott had worked very well on his bad man, but it was fun, but I think Timberlake has destroyed them all. <br /> <br /> The music was already ok, but suddenly every time the music appeared, the movie became a MTV video clip, blinking, low immortality, and so on.I thought it was a wrong idea for a police movie, and perhaps they wanted to make MTV clip for Timberlake.
