The film was a big disappointment. It was very pleasant to see these sad standards, especially as it was run by Priyadarshan. The weak script (almost impossible) and the sequence of songs with bad songs every minute and in the most strange times killed the humor that the film could offer. Some of the scenes were funny, but the whole duration was only 5 minutes. The applause was applauded. Dismal! generally disappointing as the lack of movie story seems very clear. <br /> <br /> Although the film did not miss something that was not watching, several people were left to watch the second half of the film. Do not value valuable tickets in this movie. Wait until it appears on TV ...
