I read every book on the left side of the array, and none of them was unfair in the film. Of course, I saw bad movies, but it was incredibly disappointing. This movie would have created a good MST3K episode. The scenario was a terrific adaptation of the book, and they were telling the truth of the actors, as if they were reading their own lines. The heroes were tough and distinct. The effect was cheese and was terribly fake. The last was terrible. First of all, it did not even go through the first book. Secondly, it did not make any sense. You have not read the book, you will not know what will happen. The most favorite thing I ever saw in the film was to finish as a movie student. I'm really sorry for the fact that I've made money for this movie. With some miracles, if they are released, they should take Hollywood and completely rebuild it. These two wannabe film makers and filmmakers should be filmed for wannabe directors.
