Slow motion was really unnecessary, choreography was not essential and inspirational, and most of the kung fu scenes are not really fighting, but training in the kung fu positions. How ridiculous when a little and a tiny girl faces big and muscular boys and runs away from their feet. <br /> <br /> This film is different from Europe alone. It's very easy to introduce this movie - the first martial art movie in Denmark, but do not be fooled, this is not it. <br /> <br /> There is a drama about a young girl living in prison and her problems.
