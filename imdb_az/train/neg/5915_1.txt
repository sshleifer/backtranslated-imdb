China, Hong Kong and many other films. This is the worst. No, the worst was the 'Unknown Pleasures'. I watched "Platform" yesterday evening and thought that Jia Zhang Ke's two other films should be better. I was again disappointed this evening. I will not be watching Xiao Wu tomorrow evening because I've put all three movies in the building! Who gave this movie, then you need to watch more movies on 'Platform'! The photography was very weak: it was very difficult to distinguish between some characters due to the lack of close work. I showed that the storyline was too complicated, so I quickly reached the end of the real frustration. I do not recommend this movie to everyone. Give me every day Zhang Yimou or Chen Kage. These are true masters of Chinese cinema, not the ambitious men!
