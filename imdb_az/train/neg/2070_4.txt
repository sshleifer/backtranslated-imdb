After many bad memories, I skipped this episode by jumping every second in Season 2. Recently I just watched him to remind him why. <br /> <br /> I always value this worst ST: TNG episode (except for "Black Colors") as the worst episode. <br /> <br /> 101 Teacher writing a red-writing with the author's written listening to a rough dialogue and thinking: "SHOW, DO NOT TELL!" Remarks of Deanna Troi's announcement and reminders that everyone is attractive, dangerous is how dangerous is Okona, to tell us how funny Guinan's droid joke is, is not a point of confrontation and a trick-point where no point is highlighted, There is no moment. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is a very slack shark to be in the center of plot fraud. On the other hand, John Barrowman (from Jack Harkness to "Doctor Who") will not be able to take part in this unregistered participant. <br /> <br /> (Though you think Joe Piscopo thinks he is funny decades ago, there was nothing to work with Brent Spiner, Jerry Lewis also had a foolish way.) <br /> <br /> might think a good day, less original Series episode as a charming little counter. I would like to go through "Time Squared" or "Q Who".
