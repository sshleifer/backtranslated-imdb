Hip Erotic. Terrible sexual ... no matter what. <br /> Yes, it's not serious. The police girl (waitress!) Rescues the great monster and refers to itself as a 'defender'. Chief actor Ryan Alosio is doing a very good job to hear Kyle Reese ... there is a slaughter in a police station ... the bad man is a red-eyed muscle ... and even "You'll never stop." Horrible post first once comes from the screenwriter, thank goodness that he has not sold anything since then, and all this was thrown out by direct evil director Richard Friedman. <br /> <br /> The film opens in a barbecue bar (always a good sign) and an attractive biker leaves the boy without a reason for three persecuted by the police. One of them is black and (shocking horror!) Is the man who was killed in the first five minutes. <br /> <br /> A few hours or a lot of delayed film is shot, and after a little bit of luxury, it is selected with some good movement schemes. <br /> <br /> For most of the cast-able actors can do with a bad script and with a director who can come to a lesser agreement. If nothing else, they show talent signs along with some supporting players if they are learning how to act in this movie and Alosio. In his human form, DarkWolf is performed by Kardigantuan Kane Hodder, famous for numerous illustrations by Jason Vorhees on Friday, 13th. <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> <strong> joined the tradition of the old 'Power Rangers' several times. And it's not surprising that the editor spent a lot of time on the WAY on this stage ... Perhaps the main paid feature is the excellent effect of the physical worm and the worm design is not bad at all. But CGI is bad. It's just dirty. I want to say that you can not reach a serious level of realism - why worry about it? Just throw a little extra for makeup! In addition to the horrible script, there are moments in this movie that most are unwelcome and laughable. If you do not have a better thing, it is good for a laugh, but do not spend any money on it. Please.
