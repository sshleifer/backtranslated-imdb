From all films (and I'm a graduate of a movie, this is something for you), this is the worst movie I've ever seen. Probably, I still do not see that there are some bad guys, but I've seen it, and that's the worst. A friend and I rented a night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and weak. It's not uncredited! His role was incredibly small! How did he cover the lid? The IMDb does not show such a list in the filmography. This movie was very bad, when we returned it, we wrote a little bit to the video store and lost it. "Get rid of more customers than see this complete and absolutely bad movie!" Something to read.
