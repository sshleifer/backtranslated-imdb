When evaluating documentary films focusing on a relatively small group of ugly ultra-right wings and similar conservative groups in the United States, you should consider the following. The United States, with a population of 270 million and its complex history, is eager to secure democracy and its hopes and human rights. Of course, there are a large number of extreme right-wing groups and ultra-conservative groups, but smaller and more isolated than the population. In Europe, England and even Europe, there are direct direct-on-wing groups, in fact, the real size of the Neo-Nazi groups in Australia is actually higher than in the United States. Due to the abovementioned reasons, it is unreasonable to prevent the American people from discussing the level of debate with the American people and their educated American Society by making this ultra-right wing set as a representative of the American Society of Psychopaths very deceitful and deceptive. So Greenstreet chose deliberately small and isolated groups opposite the spectrum to set up an American image that was intentional and deliberately fraudulent. This film is designed to intensify and frustrate the views of those who hate the American people and lifestyle under the subconscious and illness spurist fashion and clich√© idealist left wing ideology. This film was created not for the benefit of American Society and Humanity, but for profit. Greenstreet can make documentary films that focus on ultra-right wing conspiracy, the Military Industrial Complex, but fail to provide alternative solutions to the failure of a vibrant democracy, to a sound and balanced actual debate. Film Summit is disclosed as anti-American with its support for this trash. SENSATIONALISM is shameful in the worst anti-US trash.
