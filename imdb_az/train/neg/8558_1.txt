This movie was absolutely horrible, and I'm not even worried about calling it. A typical "mumblecore" film with a weak group of twenty-one stumbled around zero plot and trying to "pull out figures". <br /> <br /> <strong> I tried to give Mammadaliyev a chance, but it could be terrible. </ P> <p> Do not escape synchronization with movies, I appreciate Dogme95 movies, Idioterne is one of my favorite films of all times. <br /> <br /> Everything is strange in this movie, the player was writing (or was it all improvised?). , but the main thing, above all, the camera job was just plain and simple ridiculous. The camera was never logical, no matching. I have to admit that I have a nudity in this movie, so I have the nastyness (although I know I'm shaking), even though it's the most terrible thing I have. Thanks to the good uber crappy camera work you never really see anything and do what you see, TRUST ME - SEE. This film wanted to vomit a lot of levels. <br /> <br /> Dialog wanted to vomit me, the camera business wanted to vomit me, but it's mainly the idea that some of the film's critics praise. Now he wants to vomit more than anything else.
