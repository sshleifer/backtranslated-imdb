An uninteresting addition to the stroke of the 1980s, which controls the horror genre. It was shot like Pranks, but it was dropped like Dorm, the Blood of the theft, which was explicitly stealing from the house of blood in the 1970s anxiety anthology. Daphne Zuniga is the only known face on the cast, and this was the first horror movie (also appeared in The Initiation and The Fly II).
