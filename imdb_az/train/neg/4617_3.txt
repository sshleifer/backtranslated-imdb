Eight Academy Academies? This is not beyond belief. I think it's just a bad year for Hollywood standards. <br /> <br /> Like Huston's director, like Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner, I've probably eaten it, but the Oscar nomination really sold it to me, and eventually I feel really cunning. </> Does such a black comedy exist? Can anyone tell me where humor is at Prizzi's Honor? Of course, the tasteless (the hit of a police spouse, this is something else in Persia meant for mafia life), but except for a joke about "your favorite Mexican cigars" (Americans officially banned to buy something in Cuba last 50 years) funny nature could not prevent anything - I also tried. <br /> <br /> Mafia has a lot of clichés, but the cliché does not make humor in my book. <br /> Is a romantic comedy? Never. <br /> <br /> Do you have a cleverly prepared parody about the Mafia? Heroes and their relationships are as incredible and as simple as Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli. It's not in a million years. Abuse is not just absurd, it is basically absurd and usually just feels really bad (and inexpensive) Mafia movie. <br /> <br /> Very little in the form of humorous characters with one-dimensional characters, and the actors draw the terrible habits and faces. Well that's not enough; the face of the funny facial expression Jack Nicholson (replicate with the lip lip ... even now that Brando padded jowls in Brothero is drawn that means a parody ... Oh, who is someone! <br /> <br /> Some slow, whistling (like this movie is dropped for 2 hours), like some desperate daft and klichel dialogue. "Do you remember Camora? We are watching you wherever you go," and this quick forward before you can say klichelist behaviors and "capiche" Prizzi's Honor Huston is far from being a "masterpiece" and an extremely bad thing, and it's definitely a work on the ceiling of a genius director, he must be given a concrete cover and thrown to the Hudson River.
