Let me start by saying that I'm not an admirer of horror films. <br /> <br /> That's why, for a couple of years, Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Happy Feet, but I'm sure this is a better movie? In any case, we did not expect it to be really good ... in fact we just went in to laugh. Cool with me ... I have problems with other people in the theater for breaking the film, but it did not differ from the other couples who talked and talked about. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, 2 other guys left to go borat, so I'm happy again. The movie was not scary but foolish, it would be funny ... it was just boring. It was not terrible as "Baby Genuises", it was terrible ... it was not fun. <br /> <br /> Now I am no expert, but today there is a problem with the horror industry, because today you can have a horrifying and scary PG-13 horror or R <br </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> See "The Grudge". <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as a plague ... because it can cause death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
