Okay, I've been a great fan of Black for a long time, and NOT after seeing this movie. Let's name the problems ... First of all, there are a lot of people in the first two of this film. Also called PREQUEL for the original Black Shoes. Why can not the name of Sheetah's store be correct or colorless? The Black Stallion Returns, we learned from Sagr Black's CHESTNUT mom, and this film is a gray belly named Jenny?!?!?!?!?!? WTF? And it was built in 1946 and 1947 in Africa ... I may be wrong, but the first one was built when the boat sank in the 1940s. The time line is not right for me. Also, as someone else, there is a corn in the head of a film that Shintan should be his father ... appears to have come as a warning after being warned. This is the only character left to show that this movie has nothing to do with the previous two. For some, it may be a favorite family movie, but this year's biggest film frustration.
