<br /> <br /> Jason Miller is the highest point of view (more erosion than Exorcist IV). <br /> <br /> It's a bit of a country, a little rock n 'roll: mix with Christopher Walken in a dumpster with a dessert mummy with two drunks with money dragging their children (do you think you're still figured out)? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The problem is: What we need now is that the grandmother might be interested in Gaelic, or Celtic, and maybe you can do something that's the best she can do, there's a habit of tobacco. <br /> <br /> Problem: They are defective like husband, he is a writer (may he sell his wife to Satan? Maybe she can look at her trust fund) or the type (all have good hairstyle and beautiful clothes)? Drinking and drinking, he is not a bad person. Not good. But unpleasant. <br /> <br /> How much did they do with her? <br /> <br /> There is no problem: an old man speaks. The husband threw it down. She comes back to break her husband. <br /> <br /> PUBLICATIONS: - He is an alcoholic, alcoholic person; she may have just been married for her money. Granny locked in bedroom. The blind cousin takes your hero to the basement to show the womb's mummy (do you follow it?), Which can be his wife? In fact, you know, she will come to life and inflate music. A little girl lives at home, grandmother draws tea (she opens the door to do so) and provides an old marriage for cigarettes. The grandmother is regular. But nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Husband and his wife lose their child at home and then lose their bedroom. Uncle broke his throat in Bodrum. Leading lady has nose bleeds. The husband is drinking. They both drink. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, the terrible truth is the abortion - the leading female lady who was charged with the first vote - abortion at the age of 12. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, none of the components could get a story on the screen. There are no bridges, moody disturbances, horrible horror, no bridge to long-term slow scenes that do not go anywhere, and do not really care - and there are places to go - in innocent innocent child, a locked, grandmother, but not the worst of the cigarette smoker. She has beautiful hair, good makeup. <br /> <br /> In short, there is no plot. <br /> <br /> In the dark library, a little random (predictable) violence, drifting sounds, and sounds that sound us. We need to shoot a couple of drunks and Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​were good. Oh. Beautiful scenery, good wardrobe. Cameraman knew at least what he was doing. <br /> <br /> I bought it. I'm weak.
