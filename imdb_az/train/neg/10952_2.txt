I hate to see a creative introduction of this movie. I know that going to realism, but I must be sincere, I just do not want realism. Realism is boring. If you want to see everyday life, I'll live. Talk and talk about an exciting story. I'm dealing with low production costs, I'm not an absorbent for low production values ​​of hell, but at least I work in some good ideas. The move is just about to catch a camera and walk around a bit, but obviously I think to dig it because things are more realistic. The use of Hitchcock meant dramatically the life of dull bitters that had been finished. I can say it is not just a long shot, it's a drama. Rosetta go somewhere, Rosetta's working on a bakery, a Rosetta's eye-carriage yacht, Rosetta's bags, Rosetta's going home, seeing Rosetta go somewhere ... it's not fun. There is really no deep meaning. In this film, I started looking for some of my life's ideas, but it's merely realism, the most appreciated quality in business. I think I should love it, but come and there is nothing.
