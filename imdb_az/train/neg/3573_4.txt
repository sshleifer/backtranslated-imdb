This movie is special to Pia Zadora! As I watched, I recalled a classic cartoon showing the Hollywood star; with an urgent need of another role, but afraid to be a font for 'B' movies or soft porn roles; "Of course, I do not play rogue roles, but if the film does not have to be necessary with craft ..." This recollection has brought a very nasty view of a similar animated film from Pia in such a session: "Of course, I do not usually play a role that requires actual action, but I really am exposed to having enough to improve my sex status ........ .......... ". This is probably a very unjust, very strange fairy tale of the book Harold Robbins; Given the nature of the story, Pia's exposure is certainly not paying attention, and maybe Pia (who once won a player's prize at Butterfly) is trying to move in an almost unrecognizable role. Critics usually view the actors as an issue, although they are often disappointed by a film, but this is fairly unfair; scenario authors and directors are more guilty parties. The true problem with "The Lonely Lady", as the original book, is not a matter of scenarios, but a sense of it, and nothing can help. <br /> <br /> The scenario of this movie is terrible, but can the story be better succeeded by a better script? If released, I would rate the rating of my viewers as to whether I value my personal opinion or the purpose of the film. That's why my personal rating would be two; but to a certain extent this film clarifies what its sponsors are saying, and on this basis, the quality rating of the four would be reasonable. I'll give you a quarterly IMDb rating that I want to be in a charity mood and to announce that we have not blame Pia for my disappointment.
