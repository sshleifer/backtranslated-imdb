Many thoughts come to mind when you think about captivity. <br /> <br /> I hated these movies after mid-90s, when I missed Scream, but these new Saw knockoffs had begun. for these movies to look like classics. They still look like demographic indicators that have successfully succeeded in other films, but now add a new degeneration level that targets twelve to sixteen-year-old girls to feel heavy and hip. br /> <br /> This movie is a dull one! What happened to hell Larry Cohen? His name has not been added to a good thing since 1993! I was still amazed at the fact that something was so bad about it! Everyone was astonished when the love of the film was one of the most interesting psychopaths? Did not anyone know when you saw him for the first time? Nobody ever seen another movie in his life!
