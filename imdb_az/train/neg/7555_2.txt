Let the fugitives deceive you - it was a comic movie. Problem - it did not have to be a comedy. The story can never end. Even worse, the structure is never disclosed.

Everywhere there is absolutely nothing to do with the movie, there are strange quirks and interesting types. Take this video before you lose your money.
