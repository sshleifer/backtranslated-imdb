American filmmakers decided to make a movie they thought was a Japanese. All the characters are badly represented, the actors are not even Japan, and the set is cheap, non-real, and is not necessarily represented in Kyoto in the early 20s and 30s. Understand that anyone who reads books is not adding extra value to script writers. Worse, they even changed the original area line with a few goofs. Rob Marshall uses the two main characters, the tiger, for two well-known Chinese actors who are confronting the secret spouse. Marshall probably saw a Chinese movie, and they represented the Japanese culture. Seeing these two actors makes movies more laughable. Quentine Tarantino's latest scene in Kill Bill # 1 is 10 times more than this movie.
