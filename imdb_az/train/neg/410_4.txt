Unfortunately, one of the best efforts in the domain of special effects is to make an elderly person, with a foolish and equally meaningless plot, and placing it next to unsatisfactory, cliché scenarios. Hollow Man is a very profitable film. <br /> <br /> What's here is that the heroes, the only really exciting element made up of ideas and moves (especially lifting shaft!) are the impressive effects of the film. However, it is still a special effect until the end of the movie, which is still repeated and at the same time about the death. Without looking at Hollow Man, they hoped that the subject of an unprecedented Adam would be the essence of something new and more exciting. This is not the case. <br /> <br /> Long before the film is turned into an extravagant blood bath and ineffective sensitivities, the mounds of clichés are accumulated so rapidly, that is almost impressed. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon is doing a very useful job and his support is hardly doing his best. Good scores can be a semi-transparent Jerry Goldsmith account (but no competition for better efforts), a very interesting use of thermal imaging and special effects. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I want to give this movie three out of it ,
