O God, I only saw this when I was 11 or twelve (no matter how) I was young, but I was not a fool. Everyone saw that it was a bad movie, bad, gross, irresistible, and very stupid. I saw more impressive impressions in Disneyland, I had a good performance at a school and saw more convincing crocodiles in the zoo, where they did nothing, they sat in the water.

It soon becomes clear that there is something more dangerous to water. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the past fifteen years, the best of Lake Placid and the worst thing is its continuation. <br /> <br /> Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, with over a hundred results being produced. every year injuries or deaths. Films like Blood Surf, but not the fierce appearance of such a creature, destroy a good half an hour of the spectator's life. Escape the bloodstream if you do not really want to see it.
