The only good thing about this nasty rash is that I have not paid for it. I saw it for free at the college. <br /> <br /> If a college student can not find humor in something that is free, he is hopeless. <br /> <br /> True and poor jokes can not be masked by an excellent, but stunning design (that's way out) to sell Volkswagon Beetles. I did not know what Michaels Mice was in this movie, but I did not see anything more painful. It was an open effort to capitalize on Grinch's previous success (his rivals, but I'm so glad). <br /> <br /> It's hard to surprise you how good projects are to succeed and fund this failure. <br /> <br /> Do you want to have funny Seuss adaptation? Go with Grinch.
