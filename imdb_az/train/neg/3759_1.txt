Oh where will it start. Cinematography was very nice. When the movie started with the first start-up scenes, I thought it was a good movie. Then cgi Bigfoot appeared .It was like a cartoon of the lion king and the heart of the king. It was completely away from the character of the character. I knew there was no Bigfoot around the woods. no clear reason, but a joyful cgi cartoon. It was then shot for me in the whole film. Patcherson poured down the toilet for a cgi they spent on a costume. His best was the Bigfoot costume, and nobody could match it. I am an admirer of a hardcore cheesy Bigfoot and I've been warned about this movie, but my compulsion led to watching this movie and I was disappointed as I warned about previous reviews. After reading this review, I know that "I have to watch Sasquatch hunters, watch Sasquatch hunters." Why did I spend the money I earned on such an over-the-top trick?
