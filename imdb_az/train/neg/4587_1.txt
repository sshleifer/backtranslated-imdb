<br /> <br /> "What Bleep Is Knowing Us" is said to be inaccurate - the genre masterpieces such as "The Postman", "The Dungeon Master", "Merlin", and for the fourth time as the only worst movie I've ever seen will fall into history. <br /> <br /> So far, the masterpiece of the modern cinema is a two-wing section that ranges from a foolish and prejudiced plot to a highly offensive act. the photographer has been abducted by her husband and forced to take anti-depressants to survive, and many speaking states talk about quantum physics that supposedly justified the new-wise philosophy of philosophy. Basically, this movie is for you to get an idea of ​​Enya and Kenny G's lovers. If you have a sense of humor, a group of people who know how to have fun, and many good seeds, this movie is for you too. Otherwise, stay away. <br /> <br /> The first thing that hit me on the subject of "Bleep is what you know" was made and brought together by the same kind of people who made cheap weddings. camera, complete with pink heart effects, computer sparkle on screen, and other silliness. It's a secret for me to allow these people near the theater freedom. You know, it's Kenny G's doing a lot. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> writing by someone who has no writing experience was written. All the symbols and conversations were extreme and incredible, but "writers" had to shake any information or even more disinformation, and most of the film was down the throat. Yes, given the target audience, this idea can not be worse than one. The main character, for example, is a semi-filming pill. Apparently, it was not considered satisfactory, so in most cases there are at least a few dialogues that refer to the anxiety-capable pills in the event that viewers are unable to deal with pain and suffering. She takes less white clothes when she feels. Imagine ... Well, I've seen better Ed Wood movies, and that's not an exaggeration. Heck, a small game I played when I was 12 years more inspirational than that. <br /> <br /> Whether part of the government or random conversation, a strange mixture of strange scientists, rude doctors and self-proclaimed mystics, go here and go physics, of course, by practicing the life of a man or a woman gives a "explanation" of how they create their own truths. You see, reality is a probability of various possibilities, and when the Observer chooses to do so, it is built with only stones. When there are more than one observer, what happens is neither happiness nor kindness. Listen to anxiety, think, explain and you are God, no one is critical thinking, logic, and so on. It will not be cursed about such sincere and archaic things. As people jump on their own paths, "change the paradigm" and "lower the rabbit hole". In addition, the principle of Heidelberg's uncertainty is an alternative to realities, parallel universes, and evidence for that. <br /> <br /> When talking about rabbit holes, the analogy penetrates the film. All these people are talking about entering the hive pits. I'm not sure if they have anything to say about what they say or do, but what I'm sure is an anal sex. In fact, the film is an _extremely_ anti-genus. <br /> <br /> In any case, the heads of the conversation are talking, the main character is harmonious with the coloring of the heart with a magic marker on his body, ugly, ugly and anti-clear. <br /> <br /> We want two hours of my life back. <br /> <br /> Here are some random notes I have mentioned here: <br /> <br /> "What I think is unreal, has become more real to me, and the real thing I think is often not real. "<br /> <br /> - Some conversations about the spirituality of quantum physics occur. <br /> <br /> "What does a person need for erection? It's just one idea, there's no change abroad, it's all about changes." [Looking at the mirror] "I hate you! I hate you and you hate it! "Fat, you are crazy - the main character, the fat and the ugly photographer.
