I saw Dick Tracy and thought it was terrible. The paintings on the backdrop of cities seemed horrible. And the mob's heroes seemed strange. Warren Beatty did not do a terrible job like Dick Tracy, but definetely not one of his best performances. Madonna should just be able to read the song. Glenne Headly did a great job in this movie. Al Pacino made this movie 2/10 for the beautiful game. Although he did not have a high mark in his career, he still did a good job.
