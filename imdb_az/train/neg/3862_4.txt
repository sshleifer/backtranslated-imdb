I just watched it. A few laughs, but there is nothing to write home. Jason Lee looked like a fun. (Long) The DVD gag reel corresponds to almost uncontrolled laughter. Selma Blair once seemed to hit the clock, but still his character had to be a stick in the clay, so I said "good"? Jim Brolin was surprisingly laughable. (Marriage with fathers can not be a picnic). The soundtrack was hip and eclectic. Larry Miller, with Julia Stiles's father (hilarious), laughs here at 10 of the hate you hate me. He is great, but the best feature of this film was the fall of Julia Stiles. I can watch two hours lid and I feel like myself.
