There is no real space for this, and some of the strange sketches come from many old jokes. I crashed once or twice in my head. But it's been about 73 minutes, but this movie has long been pleasant and weary and tiresome (with some nakedness here and there to keep awake). Still, the movie has a gem of comedy compared to quite a lot of ANYthing by such bad (and pretty ugly) as Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg (historical film, epic movie, meet Spartans). Also the song is simply an attractive type. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> </ font> For this movie trailer; "Behind the Door", "Dead Pits", "Farmer", "Obsessed Ones", "Power Play", "Sole Survivor" and "Wacky Taxi"
