This show is still amazing in the air. There is a couple who have stayed together, married and have children, but everyone is separated. What is the purpose of continuing this? At the beginning of the show can be fun. If you see all the girls thrown over one person, almost all of them are instantaneous. Just like in real life! The girls begin to draw sides, show each other (or think) of their own. <br /> <br /> In some cases, so many people's spouse so far, how can you go for someone when you have to choose them? This show is incredible. You thought you were online talking online, but people should go to television to find love? This is not real. How can a girl be with someone when she's with some people? None of these questions are answered, and you know that at the end of the show you will not have a happy ending. We know that everything is scripted.
