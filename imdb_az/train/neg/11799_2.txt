It could have been a good episode, but I just had to turn it off. The British office was terrific to watch. Did the manufacturers set foot in England before filming? At least did we stand in the UK? I do not think that any Englishman has the word The Royal Family different than eight comedies! Together with two English boys ... Since the British prince William and Harry's respectful public appearances, he was not considered an English boy, speaking or wearing any Englishman in the history of the English nation. American filmmakers .. There are more than one country in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .. More than 1 culture! I can handle some stereotypes, but I could not watch it. The fire looked cool though!
