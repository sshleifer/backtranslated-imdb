I was very pleased with this movie for a few reasons. It's really pretty decent for half an hour. Although the player is not much better at finding a rap video, the hilarious comic and cost of production does not look bad. In fact, I thought it would be as good as Perico Ripiao (another last Dominican movie) that was far better than expected. The structure of the film shows not only how to deceive husbands, but also how women are viewed directly in the Dominican society, and especially in the Dominican Republic. Unfortunately, the creators of this film do not believe how good a movie is and how you keep your salty linen in front of them. About 30 minutes in the movie, the main character remains behind the male and female role after spending some kind of spell on her husband as a result of her cheating habits. Only this transition depends on how old I am predicting, age, CGI effects, but the whole area is just dropped down from the drain. The rest of the film is nothing but an evolutionary predictor and an intelligent liner. For all the upstairs (and I must now be aware of ** SPOILER ALERT **) comes out to be all your sleep. Did not I see it all? Oh, I forgot about the most funny thing about the movie. After a good hour I start to think "hmmmm something just does not look right on the piece of sound but what can it be?" <br /> <br /> Here's the FILM MESSAGE INTERVIEW WITH THE VIDEO AFTER THE FIFTH FIFA 95. <br /> If horror is, give us a movie, art?!?! Perhaps a motion swear to meet France's Amelie or a match with Thai Ong-Bak, Akira Japan, Layer Cake to England as a spectacular criminal triller or Waking Life here <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
