I saw this movie with my trainer climbing crew, and we all felt very regrettable. (First, if Stallone climbs up for free, there is no need to transport any gear, but still, this carabiners seem like "eight mountain climbing"). For those lobotomic people who think Kolorado is something like Dolomites in Italy, there are more fun and dirty things to swallow in Hollywood moguls.
