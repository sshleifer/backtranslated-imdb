In this film, with the words of Charles Dance, "Bollocks!" <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> > <br /> <strong> Errors are full (Bulgaria trains in London?). It's full of elegant and artificial dialogue. Correcting and correcting the director is terrifying - hand-drawn hand-drawn shots, with no exceptions to the film, with a feeling of inadequate seasickness; mixed jumps; there is no structure. <br /> <br /> The character of Wesley Snipes is not entirely indifferent - why should we pay attention to what happens to it? Direct to video? Towards the trash bag!
