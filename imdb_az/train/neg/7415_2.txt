What is the story of fear without horror and story? <br /> <br /> This is the most irritating thing about the film: the writer really feels that he really does not really know what happens in the movie! It's a different thing to know about this, to give tips to the audience and not to explain it completely, but here the scenarioists do not know, the characters in the movie do not know, and the audience sees no one knows! <br /> <br /> Because I have deep roots in this movie, I have consumed more than 80 horror movies. However, many important things are missing. We really do not know anything about the characters. The empty lines are repeated again. The story does not really grow - it's going nowhere. There are B-players in this kind of horror movies, but there is not much to do in the script. We are not interested in symbols. There is nothing to remember them. There are even no surprising humor or unnecessary sexes. And most importantly - no excitement, no carelessness. <br /> <br /> You only get some commonly used elements in the horror movie genre. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this is not just something. <br /> <br /> Indeed, and equipment. Yes, filmmakers used to do it - and more - about 20 years ago! As the film ended, I felt the audience's shared feelings. Very bad.
