Low budget discount is increasing, and you generally do not pay for Frightworld ... <br /> <br /> Writer / Director: David R. Williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park, surrounded by the revenge of a murdered serial killer received. Not an old building, but low budget errors. The camera work tends to be very elegant for the audience, and they constantly use it to hide the fact that they are not intimidating or intimidating to show us. This is what we see as murder, and it is clear to us that it is the most terrible thing that can happen in the long run ... After a long, painful headline we are still in the modern era. the player remains the same. <br /> <br /> "Frightworld" creates pretty rare cinematography while displaying decorations inside the entertaining house, but can not keep the movie below the average indie hell at a very long working time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> B-Movies, spend a lot of money.
