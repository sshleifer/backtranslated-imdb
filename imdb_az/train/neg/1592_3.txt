This is a special ward for "difficult situations" to raise the drama of a dark birthday story. The main story is Loretta Young; He leaves the prison for a long time. Can doctors take care of their baby for life, or do they see her husband's appeal? The sense of melodrama is dominant and at least is not honest. <br /> <br /> In some cases, there is a psychological gate next to the hospital's birthplace and allows a woman who has a hysterical pregnancy to kidnap children. <br /> <br /> There are just enough laughs and sarcasms that many warning movies, especially Glenda Farrell, are like water boiling hot water bottles while waiting for their twin. There is a law against the call now. An example of his repartee: "Be careful". Farrell: "It's not too late to be careful." Aline MacMahon, of course, is a beautiful reputation as the head nurse, but is not expected to give her a dramatic moment. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the film is a baby's eyes mush. Even if there are real restrictions, this movie should be better.
