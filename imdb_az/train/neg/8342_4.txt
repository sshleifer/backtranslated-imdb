Salvage: From 10 to 4. Groundhog Day Christian Coalition welcomes the horror movie. Perhaps this is not bad. <br /> <br /> Klaire (Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren played by Currie Lewis) was stalked and apparently killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry is quite dangerous and cruel). Maybe it wakes up and I say because it's all a dream .. Or was not it? (Cue music) The main problem of the film is a fifteen minute episode (very good for the first time) and it is repeated. And Claire is waking up every time, and every scene is a clear dream or an alternative, because I just stood up for what happened to Claire, and wondered how much the naked bum will draw together. <br /> <br /> (It would be more logical to be more logical) was an effort to make an effort, but instead became one of the most obvious ones (halfway through or below) where the half surprise ended. The Yup movie faster than Donnie Darko was cut off from its directors. All the great twist endings in horror films, Wild Snatchers' Original Invasion, Sixth Sense of My Happy Work, worked for the audience not to have the left field commentary. (Huck, the canoe, which ended on the original Friday, fell to the 13th place) <br /> <br /> On the other hand, salvation cries out the end of every scene change. Another nagging mistake is a recording piano soundtrack (although the portrayal of the songs is good) is clearly full of time (Claire, dishes, Claire's mother's subplots), Claire "any greetings" <br /> <br /> > <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Also , some of the secondary role-playing roles (for example, a Mary Kay zombie, played by Claire's mother, Maureen Olander) for the first time show the roots of the actor's low budget. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The problem is they are not really.
