Carnosaur 3: Primal Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terry J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why are you considering this movie? Top secret warriors are another stupid dinosaur film, discovered by the deadly (and very fake-looking) prehistoric monsters trying to kill people in the murder. The original was bad enough, later it was worse. It falls somewhere, although it does not belong to one of the previous CARNOSAUR movies. RATING: 10 to 2. R. Assessed for graphic violence and strange, strange images and blasphemy.
