This movie is really bad. Except Michael Ironside, the player is a terrible thing. I can not get the story. Richard Grieco fled alone after the war between the two McGroups. He comes to a city and is suddenly chosen to fight the evil people who want the Indian land. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieko was a strange city. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieko is a bad player. Hard and ugly. This is his line. And we will not talk about Sean Young, he was not one of my favorite actors, but an Indian woman playing in love with Bolt (Grieco). He is terrible. <br /> <br /> When I rent it, I chose Amanda Pays to choose between this and Subterfuge. I chose this because Michael Ironside plays in the game. <br /> <br /> <strong > I have at home. When I saw the movie, I wrote it down.
