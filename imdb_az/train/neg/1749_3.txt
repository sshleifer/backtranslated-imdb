This is the worst movie in the world about the best film of the contest (along with the freedom of its director), it has no concrete character and is directed only to actresses and some silly comedy sequences. I think priyadarshan turns back as it has gone after giving some good entertainment, as well as govinda and Davut dhavan as they are very browsing in their comedy flicks. For this, try more scripts and a number of changes in His direction. Instead of giving duds as a matter of fact, give us more heapers and malamal weekends!
