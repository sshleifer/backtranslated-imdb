One of these films has awesome video boxes, but there are unknown actors who talk about cable television and bad dialogue. The murders would have been so dark when it happened that the film was difficult to understand. It's WCW's Vanessa Sanchez (WCW before WCW) and a good actress. I love low budget movies, especially those with errors, have fun to watch, but few of them have been cut off. It's okay to see you're not interested in this movie, voodoo and cut heads, but I've rented it to watch if you need something new, not a blockbuster.
