Before I start, I need to know that I'm a great admirer of most of Sonny Chiba's films. His master's life, Mas Oyama's biographical series was incredible and amongst the best martial arts films, like most of his Street Fighter movies. The action was practically non-stop, and Bruce Lee was the biggest martial arts experience in the 1970s, except for whom he asked. <br /> <br /> I saw at least 15 of these movies and recently bought a little more. Unfortunately, despite the love of these films, I am not a zombie who is worshiping a person who values ​​me at any rate of 10 degrees. There are some such reviews about IMDb in this regard, and I really think it should not lose everyone's attention. technically such a bad film and that Chiba is not the best thing to do. 10 points is a real rating - it's some movie zombie fan trying to make a comment about Chiba! As I said, technically this movie is terrible. Some of them have not seen the American dubbing version, delusional prology, and bad dubbing. But most of the problem would still exist with the original Japanese edition. The camera work is just as embarrassing as it was to the chimpanzee (smart chimp, even chimpanzee). Frequently, most of the martial art was missed because the camera was too slow, or the tops of the actors were cut off due to the production of the production. <br /> <br /> Repeatedly repeatedly, as with the new toy that the camera has put into use, there is also a new toy, and editing is in a difficult situation - cuts are hypnotized and embarrassed. <br /> <br /> I know that the Music account is genuine - but it was too, very bad. <br /> <br /> Like in 1970, a rocky rock band was weakly mixed with Ennio Morricone's "Spaghetti West" music - it was boring, entertaining and straightforward. <br /> <br /> As for the art of martial arts, choreography would fix a little. Instead of the big battle scenes, I was waiting for a Chiba movie, the battles were short and often abducted by the camera! So what's your story ... and that's just the worst part of the movie! Sonny Chiba should be an anti-drug film starring ... Sonny Chiba! In Japan, he promises to destroy the drug trade. However, the Mafia promises to stop Chiba (complete with a member of the Italian, but facing all of Japan). And when a woman comes to Chiba with her promise to inform her about how to deal with drug trafficking, she is willing to help, and in no circumstances endangers her life - even if she does not relate to what she knows! In fact, she tries to use Chiba to protect her while selling her a huge bag full of cocaine and she continues to try to protect her! It does not make sense in any sense, and most of the film shot the film without a single scroll, for example, when it enters bars and brothels and as drunk as Chiba. <br /> If so, why is it still worth 3? In the 1970s, many of the most feared marriages in the 1970s, many of which are from Hong Kong, are the battlefield (now bad) with gorilla costumes and kung fu and their 3-foot long tongue. Secondly, compared to other Sonny Chiba films, the action is very bad, but this is not bad compared to contemporaries. <br /> <br /> Of course not, when you wonder if this is the worst Sonny Chiba movie! In one of his first films, INPUTING THE NEPTUNE PROVINCE, Chiba plays a leotard-wear super hero who fights the point-armored invaders from the planet Neptune. <br /> <br /> Like the majority of the latest Chiba films, it's very intense and boobies have its share. Do not allow this child to be scanned for little children! Despite watching their tearless R-D martial arts films, let them wait until they grow older!
