Guy Ritchie's noble efforts were beaten, subjected to blows, raped, hit, shot, stabbed, spat, punched, dropped, exploited, and left Madonna's deadly performance. Her player was reminiscent of Al Gore's graduate of the Dramatic and Social Consulting School. Guy Ritchie made some immoral attempt to rebuild it, and if you exclude all of your spouse's scenes, this is the best film. I think that the best-working employee should encourage Guy to be good enough not to reconsider her husband's imagination. If you have the opportunity to watch Swept Away or watch your legs break for 89 minutes ... go to a great pedicure.
