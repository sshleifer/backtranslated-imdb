This film was written down, directed and acted very badly, believing the beggars. It should be rebuilt with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is the actor. On the one hand, there is Jenifer Beals, polished, professional, and completely convincing, and on the other hand, Richard is wrongly mistaken. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just as terrified as a couple who owns (and carries out) the slave, even though they are doing just fine. Actors (and director) should not try to emphasize it - they are incredible and incredible. In fact, much attention should be paid to doing a good job in English. Casting is ridiculous. Why is an African "merchant" drawn with many brightly-colored adolescents (less socially-oriented for sex men's societies), and has therefore shown the socially-desirable Marcel African characteristics as "fro" painted openly? Casting directors will not be able to read their scripts and choose the appropriate actors from a large pool of talented and physically diverse actors. It is very strange! It's a great movie and should be re-created, but with people who respect material and choose the appropriate and experienced actors. There is a very good actor and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben will have proper casting, good scripts and decent leadership.
