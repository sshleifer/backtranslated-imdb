I think this would be a better movie if Cajuns were described in more convincing light. My family is from the southeastern region of Louisiana and I live in South Texas (approximately 20km from Lake Charles). I have not heard people who grew up in the conversation like these people. Cajuns are described in the form of returns. The majority of Cajun I know are well-educated and proud people and have never read it when talking to people. All this was an OK movie with a great scene and music. I understand that writers are from Charles Charles and know the area, but they all want to learn the language of actors for Cajun's love, live among the people you describe and how they go before they go. In my opinion, when your actors convince you that this is a movie, the movie is more pleasant!
