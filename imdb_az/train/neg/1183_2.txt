These and Immoral Tales were both a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk hates sexual intercourse, and these two films are clever tales about what will happen if they are sexually explicit. As a movie, this is not very good - some of the players are really epic ("the American accent" and the "American" woman). The young woman is suddenly concerned about the flip-flop marriages (although it seems to be on the other hand) and it is unreasonable that sudden realization of the secret of a young man's mystery. I also did not like the relationship between the girl and the black man as a sign of immorality or immorality. The central idea is that this "sex beast" living in the forests could have been a mistake, but the basis for a fun story, but instead played only bad, sexually-moral and spiritual.
