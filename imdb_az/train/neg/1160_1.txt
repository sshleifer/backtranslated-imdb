This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. It is a story of a rebellious college basketball player, a challenging but fair coach, a girlfriend and a friend (played by Michael Margotta), who have constant nervous breakdowns. The story does not go anywhere, there is no zero character development, there is no one to care, except that Bruce Derne's trainer is terrifying. It's hard to believe how a talent like Jack Nicholson will direct such a horrible movie. Be sure to avoid this turkey.
