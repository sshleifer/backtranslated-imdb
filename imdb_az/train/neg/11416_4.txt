It's shocking me that this movie has the most successful film in the history of Switzerland! This is at the same time bad. <br /> <br /> A flick about the Swiss Army may be a good thing. <br /> <br /> The story is interesting at the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> Melanie Winiger plays the role of a powerful Michelle Bluntschi mediocre, personally I found her very frustrating. <br /> <br /> There is a romantic comedy that does not work as expected in the story. The romance piece is very funny, and the comedy part is not funny, it's just a cheap attempt and it does not change throughout the movie. This fun comedy is fun for those who are looking for, but for children aged 12-13. <br /> <br /> What's your height? Cool! Burglary? Cool! <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> ">"> Because it's very funny during the Marco Rima screen. There are not many tables though
