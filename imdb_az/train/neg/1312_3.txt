Tom listens to one of these old radio broadcasts, something from the 1950s to the present day on TV. However, when this cartoon was created, they did not give television, so people gave communication to comedy-to-music stories - entertainment. <br /> <br /> Tom's trembling with his boots, listening to some stories about "imagination" literally. In fact, he does everything he can to say, "At the end of his hair, the ice is drifting down his chest, he threw his heart into his throat", and Jerry follows Tom and thrills the door to his fear - cat antics. <br /> <br /> We get a taste of what Jerry Tom will see after many years after this 194 cartoon, which has no other cause sadistic torture than to enjoy. If the cat wants anxiety, it is something, but when it comes to thinking about it, and Jerry is physically (and in that case, mentally) abusive, it's a difficult time for the "little boy". <br /> <br/> All these early T & M jobs were longer than the one followed. Sometimes it's a minute difference. It really drifted for a while. Short sketches could take five minutes without losing anything since it lasted too long. This is normal for Tom and Jerry. In general, they are moving faster.
