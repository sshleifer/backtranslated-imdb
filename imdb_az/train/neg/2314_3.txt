Table Synopsis: When a spouse is abducted by a news reporter and replaced by an android pair, Secret Service agent Eric Phillips watches him and sets out a plan by a weapon salesman to create an invading android army for assassination of world leaders. /> <br /> I did not expect too much when I saw the fantastic / hybrid "Cyber ​​Tracker", Richard Pepin's low budget, for the first time. The film is not specific to celebrate the direct relationship between Terminator and RoboCop. This is followed by a motion reaction that opens the film. There are many explosive, heavy weapons and a huge body of corpses, as well as some martial art movements, such as the star of the film Don "The Dragon" Wilson. All movies appear as a series of action scenes with the minimal plot. At the point of action Wilson is a bad player. Personnel transplantation really needs.
