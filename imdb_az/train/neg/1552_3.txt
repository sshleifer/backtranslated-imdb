This movie was advertised very well. I'm an enthusiastic film, and for months I've seen preview for this movie. Although somehow I doubt that this movie will really be fun, my friends thought it would be great, and I was bothered by this. Then I went and saw it, I paid for this movie, it almost drowned when I sat down until I remembered it. I'm not going to feel bad and I've been laughing at my product at the very least because of destroying good mood, plus I wanted to make money on movies! I always go into a movie with an open mind, not with many expectations to enter them, but this movie is not so funny. If not the worst movie I've ever seen, HBO is worth the wait. If you like many previews for the movie or you like very slow and comical comedies, but the real comedy is called Id for fans. Perhaps see the Comedy Kings again. Something told me to meet with my parents!
