'Mojo' is a story from London for 50 years, the rock star, the world of violence and forced homosexuality. 'Mojo', using a method often used in films in the 1950s, emphasizes the physical differences in our time and also provides a very exaggerated dialogue (paying attention to the display of the films in that period); People do not know that they talk like this outside of the film, but today there are no movies and they use this stylized language built in modern times. The stylted expression of the 1950s scenario serves as a common shorthand for a past that seems to be a far-away country; and therefore it is not universal in the story, it is specifically emphasized. 'Mojo', Ian Hart and Aiden Gillan and Evan Bremner, have a great performance, which is frustrating; the latter still struggles to set up a 'neutral' career; but as part of a period, it feels like a modern film, which is incomprehensible in an outdated claim. Very dull, in fact.
