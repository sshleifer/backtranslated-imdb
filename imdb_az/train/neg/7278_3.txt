This hard-to-watch movie was a bit difficult to sit. None of the sections are good, but at least the first was soft, and there was a bit of imagination. The latter was just frightening and it was really painful to watch a third party after sitting with two poor comedy shorts. Even with the low standards of a National Lamp film, it seemed particularly boring and cheerful.
