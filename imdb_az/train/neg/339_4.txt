The Golden Child is the horror films, such as "Buckaroo Banzai's Adventures" or "Big Trouble" in Little China or "Conan the Barbarian", which has some coolness and self-praising humor that transforms this puppet into emotions. <br /> <br /> The article itself is not working and there are some funny moments. But here Eddy Murphy's "flip attitude" story reduces the feeling of any tension or danger. And special effects are so foolish that it can hurt more than this tension. <br /> <br /> Tibetans are lamping, not to bind the "mystical secrets" of Buddhism. <br /> <br /> Why should we take care not to feel that nothing is in danger or that the characters are in real danger? <br /> <br /> Who should see this movie: <br /> <br /> - Eddy Murphy's great lovers who can not help themselves <br /> - I do not think <br /> <br /> I'll give you 10 to 4 for this casual joke.
