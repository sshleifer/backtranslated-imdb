Trit, klichel dialogue and trickery (the same kind of things we have seen with fantasy films of the 1980s), hockey music, and one-color characters work for most hardcore admirers. <br /> She keeps this movie out of the drumstick, tells her how beautiful the wheel of the novel, Rotoscope and Frank Frazetta's animation work. This Frazetta ... is on the move. Violence is spectacular and is different from the direction of art and other swords and magic films of the animation era. <br /> <br /> I love to sing on the first Conan movie, putting it on the sound.
