<br /> <br /> This is a good movie, but it does not have real depth in terms of emotional or storytelling. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real-life events, and it does not imply practically any action, nor is it realistic. <br /> <br /> Washington is convincing in guiding it, but it's not a dream that goes with it, but there's no way to bend any moving muscles or supporting sands. <br /> <br /> The story was merely a little flat, even though the latter was open but the latter was open, but unlike other such unfair films, there is no sensational effect, so it does not really care about it, the motivations seem more academically <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong>.
