There is something that should be said about this movie - the scene where Francis Capra, who wants to be a junkie, is in a musical number; Never watch this movie. The story is awesome, the player is strange (c'mon, this is Shaq!) And I would like to see Capra twice in the Willy twice (even terribly) twice before seeing this movie.
