I'm going to go to any movie to see what a great Ziyi Zhang fanatic and purple butterfly takes. As long as I do not want to love this movie, I have to agree with many others commenting on it. Very mixed and very slow. As all the movies are shot with a hand-held camera, the majority of this is out of focus. <br /> <br /> There is little information in the film, and it does not matter much. There are endless scenes of people sitting in a room facing smokers only and looking at each other without talking. The film's time is too cowardly and difficult to watch. Even before reading a number of reviews and having a general idea of ​​what the film was doing, it was hard to figure out what was going on. <br /> <br /> I knew in advance that the film was not like Ziyi Zhang movie, but hoped to see something different, but unfortunately it was disappointing. She never smiles in the movie, smiling, and there is nothing to smile. I would have done without sex scenes that they were not sexually explicit and did not feel any clarity about their hopes.
