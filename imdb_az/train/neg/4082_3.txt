This film is not a dramatic way to dramatically shake up dramatically for the well-developed heroes in dramatic situations (yes, I've spent too much of this penalty), but it's just a totally boring way within two hours. Now, all of you, I think, are just some of the ignorant reviewers who do not respect Shakespeare or the "fictional structure" ... well, you will be mistaken in both accounts. I love Shakespeare's works, especially Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth and Hamlet's tragedies. I also watched Surreal and well-trained Eraserhead and Fellini's 8 1/2 "Arthouse" movies. but it's just over two hours lost-in-translation Shakespeare, WAY was very nudge (I understand artistic nudity on BACKGROUND scenes ... but not in every film shoot! There's nothing for the story!) And mostly just the extreme film structure. There were very high expectations for this movie, it was not "very artistic" and it was Shakespeare's "The Tempest" match ... but it was just sad. I found this movie to be just like the scenes of acting on Sir John Gielgud's performance (not all the names in this movie) and cinematography / set design combination ... But many of these films are paintings with a sketch below it would be better. A real disappointment ... It would be better if Zeffirelli was transferred to the director's office. But this is one of the audience that many can use more than I do. If you can not find any nearby video stores (not on the DVD), do not try to get away from it to find it ... it's really not worth it.
