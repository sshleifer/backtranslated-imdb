It's hard to accurately clarify the fearsome words of this movie. An entirely new vocabulary must be invented to describe the absolute absence of anything known as the "humor" or even "fun" in the Rabbit Test. So, as a small contributor to these future efforts, I would like to suggest this: <br /> <br /> "Hubiriffic" (adj.) "Hubristic" and "terrific" combination; Joan Rivers and Hollywood Squares producer Jay Redack have made their modest abilities at this 82-minute misfortune. . We're trying to unite the plane! Stagli's comedy, Gags's moldy collection (mark Joan: German doctors have not been funny since Vaudeville) abandoned their graves at Catskills - it's pretty bad. But it's a director's way of combining cinematic crime, best describing it as 'ugly' and once and for all, a dump, even the most vulnerable to the garbage sticks, is excessive over-extreme excessive excessive excessive over- they want to overdo it. <br /> <<<This Sargasso is not Billy Crystal in the role of his starring role as Adrift's ruthless hero Lionel in the Sea of ​​Sudan. To watch the Crystal on this pic, it's as much as a blind man watch a picnic in a mine; <br /> <br /> I can only talk about the number of viewers who can be interested in the Rabbit Test. Cabbages, mollusks and gentle climb lizards are likely candidates. But for those who are self-aware, who are thinking - before I suggest the "Rabbit Test" I would be eager to pour bleach in your eyes.
