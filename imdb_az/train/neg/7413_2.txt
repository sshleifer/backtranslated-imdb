<br /> <br /> After looking at some of the movies, I am very pleased. <br /> But when the first lord of the monster appears, all ends. You only know them from the band lord, but they are forced to make a serious film. <br /> <br /> It is said that the deadly monster with terrible corpses and piercings is the 80's. But there is no clear story about what happened and what happened. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this movie, with an interesting start and with some good effects, I thought that someone would take care of the product better. Lordi is surprised that this film is just to prove that his show suits might be scary (not alone). <br /> <br /> So, the film believes in visuals, I think money should go somewhere. But from the rest of the rock band, it's a shameful attempt to scare their step-by-step monster nicknames.
