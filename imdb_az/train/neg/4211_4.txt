I liked this movie about 4 years ago. I would watch it again and again. But now I'm not. In fact, this movie would be great for Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think that many commentators have a heavy player (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a pretty cheese-maker. My favorite part is when Culkin bikes and comes with a network and says a bunch of members, "Hey, Tyler, Where do you happen to be?", MOON? "Also look at the classic line," Do you feel in your feet? "<br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is better than" Good Son ".
