It's hard to figure out. <br /> <br /> It is said that most of the film complains about the nature of the Seqals brand, Masall. <br /> <br /> What to do with the sound,,,,,, What was terrible voice overdubbing? Can they find anyone less talk like Seagal? <br /> <br /> <strong> Chechen or Chongun sounds would be better. <br /> <br /> This film was boring and totally stupid. Avoid all kinds of pricing!
