Unfortunately, the ads appear to be 9 times more than the "Bird" claimed by advertising - a hopeless pursuit, perfectly reproduced and stylized, as well as plodding and unwanted for general consumption. <br /> <br / > Malden and Franciscus use a wide range of Chromoscopes to deliver a hi-tech world of Argento's dark scenario, followed by cinematographer Enrico Menczer (DEAD ARE ALIVE), but the euro starlet Catherine Spaak (LIBERTINE), as the romantic interests of Franciscus, Highlights are an unforgettable encounter with a ghastly murder at a massive railway station (cult film travel has been set up by transparent assurance by Franco Fraticelli) and a nighttime episode that searches for an important clue within the mouldering tomb of Malden and Franciscus The killer's plot, but in spite of these glows, the film usually stops slowly from a stage, slowly pressing it without any boiling. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that Cat was unable to imitate Bird's fugitive success when it was released in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
