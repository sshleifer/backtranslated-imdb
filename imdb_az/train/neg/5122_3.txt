My accusers were charged and accused of expressing my dreams about this film. I am embarrassed by similar phrases: "I did not love you, I do not believe you!" "Everyone has donated their time and nobody paid for the film! It's not a Hollywood but a church, and we have to spend our money on such films! They only used $ 100,000 for filming." "This is the true church and Christian school in Georgia!" He wrote a monk and directed it. As you can see, I do not like this movie just because it was made and used to make money, and it was given by Christians. <br /> <br /> This is what I need to love the movie for me. <br /> <br /> Look, I took the movie without mentioning the movie. I had never heard of it, and I had no idea what to do except football. I watched and watched as I looked at any movie. I was disappointed with the bad edit and bare script. After the speech, the solder liked it very much. Do not ask. There were other cheap movies and other interesting films that were less respected than me. Not about making a movie. This is the final product. The writer admits that God does not say "yes" to everything we pray as we want, but when we want to show it with faith, God changes our lives. That is right. But God can change our lives, and we are still unequal. God can change our lives and can not get out of our business. God can change our lives and our car is still an old jalopie. God can change our lives, and our house is still fragile. Why did not you describe it in the movie? Others have expressed concern about the writer / director's issue, but apparently he was a defender. <br /> <br /> I did not think that the player was terrific and that it was part of the landscape painting. <br /> <br /> I love the idea of ​​loving God and recognizing his awesome power and weakness. <br /> <br /> Writing and guidance were very weak. It is easy to distinguish, because many characters do not develop. Indeed, not all pregnant women we get from a co-spouse (well, until the end of the film). As you can see, there was only one ball player who had an interesting character and said, "I have an unfinished father and I can not play football well, but I win the winning goal." Nevertheless, I did not make any real goals. "The other problem was a Christian school, Umm, I worked at two Christian schools, went with myself, and became the nephew of many other Christian schools, and generally I had a very close relationship with ten different ones. <br /> <br /> I have seen a real dose and how God can do it. I'm going to come closer by telling the artist that he's playing or writing, and he shares the worldview of the artist with the world view I've been telling "The people who pray the right way earn ball games, can not buy new cars, can not get them, stabilize their homes, they remained firmly intact. mix. "I know it's because of the sincerity of the people who just make the movie, I think I love the movie, because I've done a good job and for some other reason.
