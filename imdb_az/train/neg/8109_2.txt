<br /> <br /> I did not like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I found it strangely rich and superficial. proposed topics: ultimately we should die, how should we treat our lives? "Light" way of Thomas; Teresa's "heavy" way; Should we find ways to avoid such a problem as Sabina? How Important Is Loyalty in a Relationship? How many occupational lives can your life spoil for our friends? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to understand, <br /> <br /> I do not agree with many positive comments that describe the film. masterpiece I simply do not see the reasons. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are thrown to you and it is difficult to understand the things that drive them when making their choices. 2) The "secondary" characters have to fill the gaps, but they do not add anything to the story and are surprised if it really is necessary. <br /> 3) As Thomas looks like someone else. Nothing is good for her. He is very selfish and selfish. It is not a human being in a sense. <br /> <br /> <strong> Despite the events in the Caucasus, he did not rely on himself and when he realized that he was dependent on others and was emotionally attached to one, I did not think that my comment was valid. <br /> <br /> 4) Sabina's style of life in a communist country in 1968. In addition, each of the three main characters is very successful in their profession and sounds strange to me. a) How can Tereza be a good photographer? (b) How can people do well in a country where there are usually no economic incentives that motivate people to succeed? 5) The fraudulent accents of the English-speaking people are laughing. I am not my mother tongue. Moreover, Sabine's letter to the United States is written in the Czech Republic. I found a lot of discrepancies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> 7) I found the end of Trivial sort. Teresa and Tomas are far from the "metropolis" of the lonely village, losing their social struggles, dying away from their professional life and living in a car accident. But after they realize that they are really happy, they die. So what? When the film was unhappy, the message was different? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> 8) The only light that is not filmed in the film is the way the director describes the characters. You see them for about three hours, but in the end you will not stay. <br /> <br /> 9) I hated saying "How much did I hate" on the stage of "stopping music in a restaurant" (some comments were highly praised). Why Sabina took such a reaction? Why Franz agrees with him? I really do not see the point. The only thing you learn is Sabina has a very bad character and a very strong personality. This is so. <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, there are two scenes I like so much (for giving it two). <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Prague by the Russians. Funeral pictures are taken to inform the world of what has happened in Prague, and are used to identify people who are involved in mass disorders. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film "Tomas types" goes so far that there is little chance of being "intentionally" intended. it hates and hates "those who are teresa". This situation (undoubtedly, of course) must be seriously revised.
