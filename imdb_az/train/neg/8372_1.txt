<br /> <br /> This is the worst (absolute children) movie I've ever seen in my life for 51 years on this planet. <br /> <br /> I took three of my grandchildren to see him, and even in all the complicated 90 minutes he was struggling to smile. I would leave another day of sex indendoes, but they were delicious as the movie. You must pay for them to pay for them. This is really terrible, there is no other way to describe it. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for my spelling mistakes, but I'm afraid of the time I've lived with my grandchildren. Sincerely, Stephen
