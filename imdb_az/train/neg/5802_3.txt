Nicolay Gogol's "Vy" story was again shot and video was released at home through Faith Films in the United States. <br /> <br /> The original story is related to a priest who is forced to watch a witch's body only with faith. Films explicitly released in Russia (regardless of the English alphabet, regardless of houses, clothing and furniture) have been expanded and built, which is actually a non-working movie. America is difficult to get behind, but it is not clear. After a short period of time, the main character is sudden, deliberate, crooked moments, such as a journalist and a monk. Why I did it, and even after preparing a piece on a DVD I'm sure the other problem is a terrific dubbing. Everyone speaks when his lips are not in the camera, or when he has sounds, he does not remotely adapt to the lip wings. <br /> <br /> We're not very good at the film, I do not know if it's a Faith Films mistake or that producers who want to shoot down the West. I said that this is just technical issues that create a single ball cortex. Despite some really good looks, the movie never works as a horror film. <br /> <br /> They say that they meet with their spouse. <br /> <br /> My advice would be to find some versions of the 1960s Vy story and some definitions about a belief in God.
