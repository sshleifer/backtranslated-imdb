While watching a neighbor's summer camp home cinema, "Indian Writing" is a hole-dreaming dream. When eight graduating graduates are presented in a difficult way, the amazing dull flashbacks begin with the characters we do not know anything about. Beautiful actor Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton are totally frustrated in this film. An observation called "everything is smaller than I remember everything" is replicated at least ten times, and you are just enough to scream. If you do not think that the shorter wheels are a real "puncher", the expected pranks are neither funny nor original. This movie was a big disappointment with great talent. "Indian Writing" took me out of the house, just sick. - MERK
