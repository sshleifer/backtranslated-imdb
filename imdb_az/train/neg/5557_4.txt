Okay, but is it a good movie? Well, indeed, in my opinion. It is not a lot to recommend this much. It is very slow, tediously, in fact, obvious and really one and two predictable, but not many. I did not think that this movie was really in line with this series and character, which was sometimes very comedy. Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this charge. he was a decent enough actor, but I was thinking that the film was over the sounds. It would be nice if I liked the movie, there was a very bad liners. .Annold Vosloo is in the lead role, but very little to work in this film. As I have hoped, the character really does not develop. This is just my opinion. not terrible, pretty bad. I voted for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
