This movie has taken a lot of time. <br /> <br /> I was also watching this movie with a group of cinematic enthusiasts in different languages, but in the movie there was always a genius commentary on this site for commentators on this site to label this steam bust?); None of them found a single payment quality. <br /> <br /> I will not be able to repeat my articles here. <br /> <br /> I can estimate that positive reviews here by Sir Henry Hopkins. Afterall, who financed the film, as one of those reviewers? Because no one in Hollywood or anywhere in the world will endanger a penny or good name on this issue. Do not involve semi-famous actors that appear in the movie to your clutches? <br /> <br /> Slayder accepts "qualified" features that he / she has signed into the movie without reading the film or without knowing any details (I am sure will not be repeated). <br /> <br /> It is a person who writes, directs, produces and finances and accepts that everything is not created (and if you do not believe me, ask me to go to the Google website, Anthony Hopkins and art).
