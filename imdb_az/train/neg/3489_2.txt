It was my first and perhaps the latest Angelopoulos movie. I think Mastroianni is one of my favorite actors and I've heard a lot of The By The Movies. Opening pledged a long shooting on the jeep of soldiers on the Albanian-Greek border. OK! but that was all. There is nothing left. There were great gaps in the movie, and I do not know what to write first. The main story of the story is given to the journalist by an old woman. a long walk time. Like a 15-minute monologue, it kills the patience of actions and viewers, nothing appears on the screen for 15 or 20 minutes. All the things that were meant for the motion were simply not the camera of the elderly lady. For a moment, the television equipment was directed to the bar. Turns the corner and immediately begins the winter! Probably, it was shot on different days, sustainability leaked. Many stories about the story went from giving absurd questions that did not answer the audience irrespective of a mathematical style. The weak Mastroianni was given a role that had no integrity and charm. On the other hand, when many Greeks or Albanians or Balcan people agreed, the film showed only a few historical, ethnic or political mistakes to film a "humanity" like red. To talk more, but not for a movie movie, not a film maker, there is no time to lose a lunacies movie and a poor film paid by state money.
