Unfortunately, the only spoiler we have to consider is nothing to spoil on this movie. Although B. Mattei did not have any master piece he used his job to use with a little humor and madness, he even made him a fun Eurotrash director. But in the past 10 years, it seemed to have lost her. This movie was just empty, there was nothing to wake you up in the first 10 minutes. no actor, no dialogue, no worse than a 90'TV movie. It's worse than the last cannibals and zombie epics. Peace in the Peace Bruno, thanks to such memorable, will remain forever in our minds Zombi 3, Robowar, Rats, l'altro inferno, Virus, Cruel jaws and a few others. If you want to see B Mattei's new movie of jess Francoun's soul, watch out for this beautiful artist's career in old movies and have fun.
