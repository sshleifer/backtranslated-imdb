That's why. Speedy, expensive cars will only handle up to 1% of the time. Girls with them in the Gearhead magazines. Secondary and nominal actors. Cheap promotional images by people from Niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is a garbage offered by Hollywood. Do not take me wrong; I love the flick of the stupid move with the hot chicks as the next guy. But, please, ask the collective Braintrust to stop these materials, count it up, breathe, heartily "Woooooosaaaaaah", then pull back twenty years and once enjoy the movies? Can you take such a movie later? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker, all the pop culture I've won over the last five years is ridiculous. Everyone and mother is now thinking of Maverick (half of them will refer to it). Some executives said: "Hey, what demographic do you want to get $ 9.50?" "I know, sir, Sunday, 18-35." "Okay, give them poker, girls and speed machine." "Brilliant idea, sir." The result? I play the role of Dolph Lundgren on the Spike TV late in the night and the movie I have seen many times a year. <br /> <br /> Now do not get me wrong, I'm not a movie snob. English Patient Arty flicks over my boat, even if the DVD should not be flattened, the general movies worry me also hell. Only adolescent gearheads will attract this to their engines and I'll see what's happening to those on the top end of their IQ range: a junkyard.
