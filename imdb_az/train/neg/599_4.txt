Okay, I must say before the "monster" is detected. saying that he really did not fit into this category, it was just a strange thing, an annoying embarrassment! And personally I could have fled this one thing, but anyway. I actually went into this movie, a drunken main character and a heroine-addictive appeal. However, when he escaped from the train, he saw the scene and the figure in the door courageously, the guards were also killed, and the 'monster' put his hand on the screen. However, after the disaster was established because of the monster, but with limited excitement or fright, you have a mean horror. I slowly became more bored and wanted to close the job. For most people, homeless people, especially boys, gave me some cheap laughs. I think this movie can really be something, but instead of what it is now! <br /> <br /> According to some reports, the volume of cash flows has dropped. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that go, but for all these serious watchdogs look elsewhere, there are better films there.
