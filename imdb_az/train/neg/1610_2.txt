What I'm wondering about this movie - I've seen a 4-hour guiding version, it's a strange thing. According to one film, very sensitive men - Castro and Cea, are almost completely emotional firefighter engaged in jealous political struggle. The scenes between Benicio Del Toro and Demian Bichir (at least a loud-voiced second-rate actor) have no drama or depth, and mostly Castroya Che said: go here, go there, and do it with Kastro to play with Joaquim de Almeida There is still a player with the right power, but he has been thrown out in a small part. second half. Without tension or passion, which seeks to shield men and their followers, the film shouts and shouts about men in dark, bearded, and shoots an epic length movie that has no purpose or an end. Some of the reviews I read have praised the work of director Steven Soderberg, almost excluding the actors. (In fact, Soderberghin spent much more time with new digital camera directors or actors, or just about English subtitles in Spanish). This Soderbergh was the only rented weapon in the film, and b) when Che's visit to New York, he did not see a job that did not resemble Oliver Stone's JFK in the black-and-white camera. If you imagine Andrew McLaglen's reds instead of Warren Beatty, you will think of the neat skill of this movie.
