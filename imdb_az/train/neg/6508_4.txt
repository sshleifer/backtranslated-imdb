It goes beyond the old Frankenstein principle. A famous scientist is killed in an embarrassing accident, and his father preserves the brain surgeon's brain. Then it is put on a robotic body of its design. His brother, a genius genius, gives a "ghost" momentum to mobilize his thoughts. <br /> <br /> <br /> The script is incomplete. And it is humorous that it is a bit scary. Well, very small children think this is good. <br /> <br /> The guides are played by Otto Kruger, John Baragrey and Ross Martin. Ed Wolff played "Colossus".
