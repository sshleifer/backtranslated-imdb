Revolution is a terrible film, history teacher, news writer, Al Pacino admirer, is unlikely to be able to win a legitimate '10'. <br /> <br /> Tom'a Dobb (Al) tries to get money from radical patriots who buy their ship. Everything happens around this note. Tom's son joins the army to celebrate, Tom joins the army, enters an adventure trying to escape from the army, after which the war is over, and finally can return to the boat. The last one. <br /> <br /> There were several martial arts scenes and the best was mediocre. The transition between the scenes "five months later" and the magic put some characters in the famous historical battle. The story of love is a joke, and it's hard to watch the movie as a whole. So, follow Patriot by storing "Notes".
