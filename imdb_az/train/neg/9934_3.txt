As a casual listener of Rolling Stones, it could have been interesting. Probably, this film is older than the 1960s. I'm viewed as a hippy purist propaganda propaganda (born in 1980), but I'm sure that this movie is not for me, but the 60's. I thought Stones was waiting for drugs, I was disappointed, in fact I showed her real life and worked in the studio. So, I worked with them to reach the outcome of this terrible movie god. I have not seen any movie except for directors, but I think they are watching the same kind of style, amusing "amatuerish", like a Eurotrash television show, a badly directed, fun place to put in place and not having real entertainment. The only good thing about this is that I did not spend money, and I was released from a market paper.
