At Steve Irvine's show he's hillarious. He does not even want to be funny and not just a movie, but I'm not going to tell a movie - I said he was trying to kill a guy in his car, he says blocked! and looks straight to the camera. She pulled her face to the camera! And then you did not wait for the guy to die when the boy hit the car? And Terry was the worst I've ever seen! When the crocodile eats almost Steve, he only says "Steve." He was afraid or nothing, only 'Steve'. That is to say, but it was not worth seeing me. I love Steve Irwin, but the film was very stupid.
