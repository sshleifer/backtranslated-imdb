We must admit that this "re-imagine" the original 1968 film is a great disappointment. Especially considering that it is Tim Burton's film. <br /> <br /> I am a great admirer of his work, but something went wrong with the next flick, Planet Monkeys. I liked the original film very much. For the first time, people just waited for another Cheezie's science fiction movie, but one surprisingly proved that this theory was wrong. There was a really clear message. An obvious war message. Fear of the world's cold war and the fear of using nuclear weapons have played a major role in the idea of ​​film artists. These reasons are that the film is above all expectations and immediately became classic. Although the new movie, "rebuild" or anything, does not give us anything. There is no message behind, no ideal. <br /> <br /> Outstanding Tim Burton does not leave you. The dark and creepy parameters were very good and, of course, the makeup was terrible. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, it's not enough to make people watch a movie. Must have an interesting plot or story. In this film, the plot is not very interesting and is considered bad. The scenario is very bare and full of gaps. Apparently, this movie was written in a great hurry. <br /> <br /> Why explain why monkeys are there and why the dominance of the planet is really stupid and the ignorance of script writers. <br /> <br /> He raised many questions that did not answer these questions. <br /> For example; Why did the monkeys speak English? What other ape species were there for lightning on the planet? (Since there are only chimps in the spacecraft that crashed on the planet) Hell came from all human beings? How many chimpanzees have been able to overcome the excessive increase of all kinds of monkeys in just a few thousand years. <br /> <br /> Finally, the end of a bad surprise was just a rectangle. It was probably missed because the original film ended up, and then the audience thought the same thing had ended. The latter gives me many questions, and I know, do not answer intelligently. Did Teyid learn the cosmic boat, learning less about power and flying over time and learning to miss the world on one hand? And what did she do with all the women? And it will almost certainly happen that I will doubt that the history will be the same as that of Washington! (Do you have a big banana instead of a memorial?) <br /> Well, just do not say anything about the movie. Some of the castings were large. The character of Helen Bonham Carterin was interesting and good as Theid like Tim Roth. He was very good at some points of the film. Michael Clark Duncan was also good. I'm happy with Marc Whalberg. He is not a very actor and plays a very colorful character here. Very unbielevable and nothing compared to the original Hestons character. There was no reason and place in the main female character. It was just removed for the image. <br /> <br /> Behold, I think that when thinking of the Planet of the Monkeys in the future, they will think about the original. Most will be forgotten.
