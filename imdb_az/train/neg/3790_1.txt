I really do not write comments, but I would be sure to warn people about this movie. A never-ending student film with no irreplaceable features. At the technical level, it's totally amateur - always an unusual jumping adjustment inside the scenes, dubbing in bare nostrums, and so on. Totally clichÃ©, the structure is laugh and the player is embarrassing. I do not want to be too tough: I created my share of my student films and it was all terrible, but there is no reason why this film is not for the innocent fans. /> <br /> Securely, it is very similar to the film's hammer, friends and family.
