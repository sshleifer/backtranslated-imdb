I think it's an IMDB cult that loves the MST3K movie. And after reading the comments on how brave this is after this and the "Wizard", there are some misunderstandings here. Most people say that those who hate it are "just scared," "I do not know good horror," or such things. Yes, I really do not like it, but I do not want it to happen in the movie! She is the only wife who lives and looks around! Or ride around the house / garden! A movie requires something to give the atmosphere, just around and surrounding people. Oh, and do you think? Yes, I would think "MOVE! YOU @ # $ 0 &% !!" I have a scene from one of the worst horror movies! <br /> <br /> For P. Rekord I am a great fan of the old style of horror, Dracula, Frankenstein, Such things.
