Dear God! I did not expect to "start" this movie ... then wait for it to endure ... and when I did not know what to do, I just sat down: 1) maybe it could be bad; ) I just spent a few hours of foolishly. Drew, I believe that a movie can not do this mess ... and son, did I lose faith? Do not worry with this! Drew tried, but the film was written poorly, acted badly and only thought badly! I do not believe this badly-funded script! In fact, there was one million luck to do something with the idea (the concept of "concept" is so great to suit this movie!) And it did not go anywhere! Only hurt! The place where I think that the other reviewer is not the worst is baffle! Believe me, if I suffer any wrongdoing, I would cut my wrists before I finished!
