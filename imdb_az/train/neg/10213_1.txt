Many people like the movie, so I feel a little worse by giving a bad look. But after 96 minutes I have to do it. The story is the extortion in this movie? I should have left him, I was waiting for the story to open, and nothing happened. Of course, the end was "a little shock," but it was not built. Forget about the half of the time, so they really did not develop symbols. The player was a long time, he was often convincing, but often I could see him. So without saying anything, you have to say that if you do not like the actors in the movie, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I might be wrong, but I did not understand why there were so many or more films. I can not decide what to do, so I'm telling myself a judge. </ strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> "> </ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; I feel really loud and I'm still with my votes.
