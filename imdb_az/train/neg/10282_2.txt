I did not expect this movie to be a great movie, but it was not so scared. I hated the main character who had to turn the channel. I hope it's just part of the movie, but it's back. Are you embarrassed to get up or go to work or get mad at home? You are joking? I was dutiful to my mother (and even frightened), but if I had to prove that I was being harassed in my home, I would like to keep her at the nearest hotel. <br /> <br /> I did not buy anything from him. I tried to give it a few luck, I did. Sorry.
