How good is his "message", but this is a very badly prepared trainer - a terrifying player, a naked camera job - I do not know Carr is trying to click on it and it agrees to pull the belt. If you are looking at the extras on the DVD and have a camera, if you're watching around it, it longs for you to be in the spotlight. He is a bad actor - I'm reminded of another arrogant director, Eric Schaffer. Carr's film showed in the city's Youth Centers and New York Churches that the damaged people are attentively watching how the tough and focused films touch them and perhaps touch the film, but the film itself is so confused, predictable and as if it is.
