Many fans of fears will not be very popular by saying that they love fears, so it is very boring. The idea behind her was interesting, but she was very dragged. I think that the main problem is all this is in the dark. Sometimes fear movies (such as humongous) that are created in the dark, but in the darkness of the scary movie. Often, it's hard to figure out what's going on, and it's hard to see most of the scary shooters, though it's creepy. Maybe it would be better if a little more lighting is used. <br /> <br /> In my knowledge, which is better than the terrible dark night, there are many films about the killer fears. I recommend scaring every day.
