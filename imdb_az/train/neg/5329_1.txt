As a true Elvis fan, this film is a common embarrassment and script is a disaster. The film was opened with a beautiful son's "thick bold" and the scene of the Grand Canyon gives the audience something special. Elvis takes pictures and takes great time in his talents, especially in the rest of the songs. I've been filming this movie twice, just to make sure it's a bit dissatisfied! From 1 to 10!
