In a very successful business life, but a very successful executor in his familiar life, responds to a child with a syndrome that runs from the seat. Both characters are very lonely, and a less intelligent man with appearance will show the beauty of the small things in life in the execution ... With an atmosphere such as amelie and emotional music, I did not expect but a moral riot. In any case, as in some interesting scenes (the guy is sometimes extremely fierce), and the interpretation of the actors Daniel Auteil and Pascal Duquenne was very good, I decided to watch the movie. French cinema is generally capable of showing something that is opposed to more stereotyped American cinema. But for this reason, it is even more frustrating to see the joy of the boy after the absurd end, the death of the child, the charming tone, the happiness of the executive body, the cheap spiritual, the unbearable laughter. Do not wake up from heaven like Michael Landon ... Really bad, in my respectful thought.
