I often love movies like this. Documentary style was drawn, but toy and writing were just horrible. Acting is wooden and tough, and writing is not just a clich√©, but a good way. I was surprised to find that IMDb was at 5.2 / 10 when writing this. I am convinced that most of these voices have come from relatives of people in the film. I guess if so, you can manage a few laughs because it's always funny to see that your loved ones and your friends always shoot a movie. Yes, in a way, it's all about coming and coming writers, directors, actors, and so on. Hopefully, you can do so if they can do it. Even though you should do it.
