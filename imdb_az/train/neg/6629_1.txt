If you see Sholay in 1975, do not watch this movie. If you have not seen Sholay in 1975, Go WATCH IT. But do not watch this movie. This film contains all the items that are wrong with the restoration of Åžolay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan is a good psychologist (probably only 40 minutes of the rug that should not be burned). If you see the rest of the movie, and you only see amitabhunu playing with its symbol, it still deserves a watch. But Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal does not justify his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is extremely secular, and the only reason he thinks that Raj is carrying Prashant Raj is that he has a striking similarity with his younger Amitabh. Sushmita Sen is well-behaved with grace and makeup. But "The Best Performance and Any Role in History" prize must reach Nika Kotari. <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> :)
