I do not remember the "Barnabey Jones" in any Quinn Martin show that there was nothing else but a very harsh and standard detective show for the act of committing a crime, Part II of the Criminal Code (another character was murdered), Part IV, and Epilogue Betty Lee Meriwether), his father-in-law Barnaby Jones (Buddy Ebsen) understood the crime and then in one <br /> <br /> One thing I remember was the best theme of the late, great composer Jerry Goldsmith. Strangely enough, the opening credit line wanted to show me and the show was in the air for seven seasons. Even though Ebsen's badly worsened, I will admit that Ebsen is beautiful somewhere other than Jed Clampett. <br /> <br /> Renewal (1/11/2009): I watched Jerry Goldsmith, composer, interview with their American Television Archives Archive on YouTube. Let's say that the Barnabey Jones show is better than Goldsmith.
