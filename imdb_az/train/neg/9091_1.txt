Seriously, I've read some of these movies and you have to ask, did you watch the same movie? <br /> <br /> Yes, I can give a lot of credit to my directors, but what is it to re-create the 1930 Los Angeles Province? <br /> <br /> Karen Black is not just a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just icky. <br /> <br /> This is a creepy child actress, scary Billy Barty and others. was. <br /> <br /> These films love film enthusiasts, and the rest of us look at each other and say, "What a heck!"
