Okay Who was it? Who gave the Revolver 10 to 10? Did you cut your head off the Ecstasy pipes? You've had many. Did you do it for courage? Is this a cult like that? Or was Guy Richie registered for 788 times under different names? <br /> <br /> I will say this before I say anything else. But you do not understand a movie, but it does not mean it's not good. Maybe if you had a bad day in your business or you came together with your comrade to sit down to watch a movie, then you were not in the mood. Perhaps you have a more discreet stumbling block - you do not have the mental ability or just enough developed philosophical meaning to deal with it. BUT. And that's very, very big. XXL elephant-sized mega-but to end all idols. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, do not mix the inconvenience for complexity and do not skip this two hours for an interesting movie. Indeed. You think it's pretty smart. You can even think of yourself as a somewhat romantic figure: an independent thinker, a naysayers like a sheep prepare a masterpiece against a choir. Please do not. You embarrass yourself. <br /> <br /> Revolver is the loss of everyone's time. If you think in a matter of minutes, you know it too. No loss of shedding, loss of crew, loss of canteen and absolute precious moments (you will not be able to get them back) is undoubtedly unhealthy, unhappy <br /> "You just do not understand its NON-LINEAR, which means that the story is not in STRAIGHT LINE, it's an AUTEUR complex and SUBTLE work, it's hard to ask questions, and in any case - when they first came out of FIGHT CLUB - did not you hear them? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < a traditionally so-called statement does not fill me with fear, I have learned a few years ago, I was very interested in philosophy, for this reason I did not like Revolver, and I do not like it, because it thinks of heavy, carefree issues, I'm not a lot of chess player, but how Richie's chess is The claim that he had claimed belongs to a quaternary era, and I do not like it because all the exceptionally exaggerated characters have completely fooled me. "Aha!" Richie cried. "Guy cleverly hits his breast!" Maybe you're right. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus Fight Club has a laughing, acidic, nihilistic dialogue. Revolver rejects a liner to bleed your ears to your old fortune cookie. Fight Club revisits what's happening. Revolver can say to me that there are a few incomprehensible boosts that do not agree with ... because they are unreasonable. If you continue to pull the carpet under your hands, you will be taken out of the house. Then they close all the doors and windows. <br /> <br /> <strong> Mostly they are spoken, but often on the screen they burn with their attributes. This is almost non-pathological. <br /> <br /> But what makes this movie particularly noticeable is a way to get a very incomprehensible thing in a neat way with all the tired gangster clich√©s in the world. Finally, it's so insignificant. Do not care about anything. You do not understand anything. <br /> <br /> In fact, I really liked a bit: the uptight assassin who was in crisis. He is great. But I do not advise to see the movie just to see it. It's only a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Believe me. Terrible.
