My dear. Some of the best talents on the British TV series have made this series so I believe they are working under incredible time and that many scenes should agree. <br /> <br /> Some scary scenes in the Highland (mostly exposed to "monster" attacks and we see it from the point of view), but I'm afraid that I accidentally found the story accidentally! As soon as the hero finds a piece of body in a golf course: Oh wait, there is one hand ... oh, there is another hand there ... hmm this is a little surprising ... <br /> The admirer of the English cult TV For many years, this series is launching to broadcast on VHS or DVD, but BBC has always said. Now I understand why!
