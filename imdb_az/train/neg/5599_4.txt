A thought you are fond of with love almost comes to mind, "God looks like a really bad sitcom." <br /> <br /> A lesbian couple living in Karla (Shirley Ng) and Janet (Natalie Sky) in Vancouver. Janet came to her mother, but Cara's parents are still in darkness because of their daughter's homosexuality. Nature itself, though, is when parents come from Malaysia to their younger brother's wedding. That week, the British Columbia legally grants gay marriage. Janet, who wants to marry, needs to decide whether or not to announce that she has heard from a Chinese mother-in-law who cares for her. Will he be? Would she like it? Can be? Cara's condition is compared to Jesse (Trent Millar). Jesse has declared homosexuality to the world at the age of fourteen. His biological father, Andrew McIlroy, is coming soon. His father, Norman (Michael Robinson), is finally afraid of the fact that Jesse has accepted that Daniel is gay and that he is not. <br /> <br /> <strong > Full House-style melodrama is sometimes enough to win, and comedy attempts are largely unsuccessful. McIlroy, Millar & Sky, is the only performer who takes care of maturity in this misconception, but takes into account the materials they need to work, and no one will be surprised. It is possible that the camp is purposeful. Frequent scenes should try to imitate the lower sitcoms of the day, even though they are really bad. This really should be written more than this review. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Desiree Lim has come to a memorable one, bringing together a mixed fest that is composed of one another. It was only enough to make a note on the screen when it was only a clear homosexual hero. Then he went. Today, we also need quality.
