In Africa's jungle, muscular human-ape is hunted by a opportunistic expedition group; his favorite girl, who is the team leader, first finds her. The ballyhooed version of the Tarzan fairy tale has an OK production, but I'm crippled by the one-handed worst part of a movie I've ever seen. John Derek, inspired by cheeky-slow-moving moves and beyond the look-a-boo glimpses of his wife Bo Derek's unclothed body; Like Ed Wood, there's a lot of talent behind the camera. We are working for sexuality in the hype, Dereks has the elegance, the fastest time and taste. They have a sense of self-parody and bravur abolition (they throw cautiously for the winds), but after a hopeful opening, all goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (maybe all the marbles in his mouth) is a starter, but plays John Derek's third pin, expressing his ego and Bo Derek's importance. * from ****
