"All Saints?" Where ...? <br /> <br /> Is the story and theme of all the Saints Holidays edited? <br /> <br /> What is an excellent title? There is nothing in the story that has far-reaching connection to "the feast of all saints." There is nothing in the story about the "All Souls Day" of that time. If you do not intend to include any story or topic about "All Souls Day" or "All Saints Feast", why are you worrying about this title? <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, very bad articles and amateur writing. How did they create a great talent for this club? The enthusiastic writer is the faces of those who turn each other into long-term conversations on the history of life for those who follow their lives. People do not talk to each other. <br /> <br /> What was the headman's idea? <br /> <br /> The director is equally bad! The compulsory and very deliberate style feels like an amateur. On one stage, a character shouts "separate your hands from me" and it does not touch me! <br /> <br /> The scene, which is the worst scene at the start of the film, is an incredible battlefield. <br /> <br /> Excessive Gore in the fraudulent, fierce battlefield. <br /> <br /> There are many dead on the most fake combat scene. Saturday night looks like a live sketch! You can see annexes waiting for their requests to go with the camera. Everyone plays the scene of death as fourth-class boys - inflated to every little strange and twitching. <br /> <br /> The blood of a victim is a very extreme and careless way that someone used a ketchup dispenser and made red lines straight on the suitcase. <br /> <br /> All this battle scene is really a favorite war movie. <br /> <br /> Almost like a father like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers, and delivering a punchline. <br /> <br /> Who in this real life will not go on this path? <br /> <br /> Some writers, directors, and shots are actually in the center of the stage: <br /> <br /> The little girl stands next to her dead body of her dependent father - who is very scary and creates bloodthirsty wounds. He was even stupid, he knew he was dead! However, he is very monotonous - repeating "Baba, Dad ..." when looking at the screen at once. <br /> <br /> Even though a small child had the ability to act, he conveyed a lot of conviction and passion as you would expect from a non-actor child repeating the line for cameras all day long. the scene is completely unbelievable. The little girl will not be in the midst of the battlefield even after the slaughterhouses - it stops quietly, surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies! Natural instincts screamed and fell in horror, ran from the bloody massacre to AWAY! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The mouth and cheeks are great a fork. It looks like a fish in the hook! Awful comic details, all scenes fake and terrible. <br /> <br /> Fantasy La-La-Land, Mothers and Girls are the same periods! <br /> <br /> Some funny details are the same as the central character - the little girl's mother - at the end of the scene and 20 + years on the next stage! She is still young and beautiful, and now with her daughter at the same age! <br /> <br /> I also made the movie because the direction and the writing were obviously terrible, but I wanted to see Louisiana's settings because I love all actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < A strange way to start the film is that the rest of the time is aimed at romantic reading to be romantic to a woman. The strange inconsistency in tonight!
