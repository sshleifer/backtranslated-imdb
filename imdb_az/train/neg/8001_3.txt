MONSTER - He was great; I liked the special effects of this monster, like an updated version of the "Black Sea Being". SOCIAL LIBRARY: The majority of the story occurs as doctors in quarantine (with government orders), and this is a state of the disease, such as SARS. Instead, we get the story of the government we are familiar with. You know, with Hollywood movies, I always look at this liberal paranoid idea as corrupted our government, but Koreans copy the format and are very tedious. Here, away from the excitement and withdrawal of the "monster". It just drags the movie. <br /> <br /> MORAL: A typical "not to pollute the water," said the main family in the film, "a young girl in a family," may be a message because it can be a terrible mutated monster. <br /> <br /> HUMOR It was mostly foolish, and I usually laugh at the slapstick, but it's not funny, Korea's humor is not so bad, or the movie is deliberately trying to be ultra-corny with the old "Godzilla" movies. <br /> <br /> TRANSFER - Video transfer was good, It was a picture and the sound was very noisy with noisy noise.I watched in Korean with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> It was a word but a big frenzy and even a lot of spots q It's been a jumble for a modern monster movie, and it's been two hours long for this story, and I do not know if this movie shot a record in Korea. Most people do not have to use and support movies.
