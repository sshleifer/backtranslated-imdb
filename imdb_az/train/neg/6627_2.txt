What happened to RGV? Repeats itself every single movie. Does he miss creative ideas? If you have one, the rear seat is time. Wanted to see the film without a great deal of expectation - of course, I did not think it would be near the original one. I did not know, all promotions said. But even then I thought Ratvidine would be a great RGV treatment, is not everyone the same as Sathya and the Company managing? Or is it I have doubts after watching Aag. If you really want to walk and see if you can play a fun game with friends, if you define the scenes taken from the original, I do not want to talk about it or from the story. Give your own and your own ratings! Thus, Veeru turned to Heero (how old is it?), Heeru did not sound so much. Ajay Devgan is a disaster such as Heero, the comedy is tense and the silent speech, which is really effective in the company, is fake. There is no chemistry between Heero and Gunghroo (Nisha Kothari). In fact, the more attractive the niche she gets even worse. It reaches a peak until the end. Raj is not really bad in comparison to others, but a man to follow in the future. I was really disappointed with Amitabh Bachchan as Babban, he looks like a cartoon of Gabbar Singh. There is a scene from a glass covered in a glass, but it looks like a beggar in a fear of scare. The only performance he really performed was the author Mohan Lal, like Narasimha. I'm afraid that I do not have the patience to write more.
