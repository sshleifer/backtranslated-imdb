When I saw "Rachel's Attic", I was going to be unpleasant visceral, ride. But this did not happen. Visceral, yes, but pleasant? It will be big, fat, no! In fact, the only reason I give "3" is that Gunnar Hansen (as soon as possible) appears to be one of the decisive characters of the film. How did they attract Hansen to this job ... I will never know. Story idea is interesting, but poorly executed. Movement is pedestrian and moving mediocre. The only thing worse than that is special effects. YIKES !!! I've seen better effects in a classroom student game. Give it to him, Mr V, it's time to change your career ... I heard he was employed at Mel's Diner! Very few, very good, Ind movies come from Michigand ... and Rachel's Attic is not one of them.
