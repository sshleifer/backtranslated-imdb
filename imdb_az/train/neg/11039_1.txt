All the funny things happening on this sitcom, Jim, is basically a bad father, a bad husband, or generally quite logical. How can it be funny? Of course, a character in a sitcom must be defective, but Jim's character is quite defective. <br /> <br /> And why? I guess that "he should be good". Jim is not a stupid man, he can focus on those things and have the opportunity to do so. But he will not choose. Unless she wants to buy "baby products," she is a conscious choice she chooses, and is a choice she has recently dropped out of her relatives when she goes shopping. <br /> <br /> Other characters are only visible in the series, so Jim can be a crushing one. If Cheryl's character was a real person, he had previously abandoned him and would not have died for 8 years. But, unfortunately, it is catalyzing only for Jimin's quirky middle class extreme selfishness.
