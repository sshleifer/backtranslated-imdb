You should love cheesy low budget movies. This is accomplished with bad effects, props and bad behavior (really bad). Plus, whenever I see Mercedes McNab (sister) every time, "Caution!" <br /> <br /> For those who know Buffy / Angel. <br /> <br /> When you want to spend money to make a poor taste and confusion, <br /> <br /> I do not know if the film's writer or producer is more upset than I'm going to <br /> <br /> I want to say that it's simple for small children, but I do not know, I would like to give this issue to the child ... <br /> <br /> umm ... 1/10 because this will go down the lowest.
