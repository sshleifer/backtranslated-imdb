<br /> <br /> In the last post released by a woman claiming a military background, she says, "The life of a woman is no better than a man." <br /> <br /> This mantra, which is right with politics, is not as incorrect as history. Biological Show. Societies, at times with exciting speed, have been able to recover from the heavy loss of male populations. In 1914, despite the war of 1918, in 1939, war broke out in 1939. <br /> <br /> In South America's Triple Alliance War (1865), paraguay led three neighboring countries, almost all male populations were destroyed, but in 1932 they faced Bolivia with a larger war in the Chako War. <br /> <br /> No society was able to survive the loss of women. Only women are sent to battle when the nation's life is in danger. <br /> <br /> Israel faced this situation in 1948, but since then it has never accepted the united fighting units for the Defense Forces, despite the famous image of an Israeli girl soldier. <br /> <br /> "GI Jane" is Hollywood's mouth.
