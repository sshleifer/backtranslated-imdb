Because all the things that make up this film are barefooted for a good reason. When the Tarzan ends by a snake, suddenly it removes its clothes. When a boa constrictor is poisonous? How was it poisoned by Tarzan? All of this film was twisted. They could not get the right kind of animals. Does the Orangutang hang around this chimpanzee? He had gone far beyond a very good film. Yasam tribe men group caucasin.Why? And why was Bo and his dad painted if he would then eat? It may have been a naked pretext to just show his chests and show them crooked. During the hunt, attitudes and actions around a hunting fish, whenever the real African bull elephant was not outside the circus, the father would squeeze the cover of this moron. Every wise hunter began to take the minute he saw. If the camera was on LSD, it would show different scenes in slow motion because there is no reason. Tarzan seems to be the boa constrictor fighting the water. You can buy a 12-inch rubber snake at a local Spencer Gifts.Tarzan, in this film, perhaps it's a movie that goes out of itself. I 'm sorry, but this is a bit like a classic Black and White Tarzan movie with a better story .Do not say the words .There is a scene I have forgotten everyone' s word. * (ALDER ALERT) * The scene where Jane and her father were trying to rescue her, she sat close to a flowing water. Eww! In addition, her and Jane dolphin on a beach, jumping on devious monkeys, and screaming. Certainly, they would see his father's death really good. * (END OF DISPLAYS) * This film should be a warning to the Surgeon General. In this film you see Bo is very naked, you will go blind.
