I have never seen a higher rating version since 1973. I am a Nicholas Cage fan (in the meantime, as I always do fine moves). This film probably takes about five minutes to break the entire episode (this can be seen on a cocktail napkin at dinner) that you will not be able to understand the end of this hurricane in the first thirty minutes. Perhaps you find this movie fun. Take a few things to see if he later earned a horror / mystery / tension genre for himself, fearing that the audience could not afford enough, and that he was afraid to write a fresh, intelligent and modest scenario, jump a bit and send your last circus to your local theater. At least, there was no hand-held camera syndrome.
