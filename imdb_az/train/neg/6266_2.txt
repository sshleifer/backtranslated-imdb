Now it looks like someone can shoot a movie. It's a group of people, a script and a little money and wall to become a camera, cast and crew like everything you need. The point is that talent is always part of this equation, and often such low-budget movies become duds. Video store shelves are full of so-called films. They are not even guilty pleasures, they are simply lost forgotten celluloid loss. Troma Entertainment is known for its garbage films, but most of the films are golden. However, some films, like Nightmare Weekend, have nothing to do with any of them, and no cause for some to release. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Process: Some unusual emotions. It moves at a good pace (should be 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Deficiencies: A dirty dialogue and an abusive article covering countless field holes. Especially night scenes and bad lanes do not come to an end. Logic is not licking. Flipped threw. Cheap and very historical effect. Character development is not general and you will not care for anyone. It's supposed to be a fright film, but it's not missing in this area and is not the least scary. There will be nothing interesting or interesting. <br /> <br /> Recent thoughts: I did not expect this to be a forgotten gem, but I did not think it would be bad. I do not know if it is the worst movie, it's a certain contender. Troma should have allowed this film to be released instead of a release. <br /> <br /> My rating is 1/5
