This film is probably inspired by Godard's Masculin, feminin and I urge you to see this movie. <br /> <br /> The film has two strong elements and they are: (1) realist actor (2) is extremely good, picture. At the same time, the most striking thing in me is the infinite flow of calm. Lena Nyman must be the world's most vindictive player. It's so stupid in this movie and it's all nude ... it's not tempting. Compared to Godard's film, the intellect replaced the indispensability. <br /> <br /> Without much escalation on this issue, it is derived from the ideal difference between French and Swedish society. <br /> <br /> The film of his time and place. 2/10.
