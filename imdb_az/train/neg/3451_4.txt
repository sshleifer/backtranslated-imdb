Frank Sinatra was far from the best actor for the West. He was a great actor, and here is a manifestation of the Infinite and the Golden Grail, but you did not have the western hero's body. But Johnny Conchoda tried to see the film well, but did not remind that the film was a failure. I accuse it of two factors: a) The story was very unusual, especially as Sinatra acts as a hero in the film. In a genre where people are expecting a certain pattern, the film should be very good to get away from the movie. (b) The story is not convincing, but it is difficult to believe that the whole city will allow it to do whatever it wants because of its fear of Sinatrana's brother. When a man shows him a special door that opens next to him, it is surprising that he does not involve a weapon, and if it makes it unbelievable, all unarmed warriors have not accepted it. I think that this film should not be filmed because Sinatra is worth watching and it is still pleasing, despite its shortcomings
