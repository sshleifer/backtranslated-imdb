Take all these costs. Bad stuff, bad leadership, bad behavior, bad design, bad sound and bad music. Get the Idea? This is not a movie that tries to get a swirling aroma of this movie. It does not mean that he is trying to create severe violence. Trying to present a fresh look in an old genre does not do it. The actors work there the best way, and my heart runs out to them. But it is difficult to shine with something like this to work together. For me, this is the first time I look at the whole picture of the movie "The world is going to hell." Freshmen movie artists often bite over that or they can tweak their budget. The best thing to do is take a few steps, re-evaluate what is possible, and then work within their limited budget.
