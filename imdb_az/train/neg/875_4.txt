Unfortunately, regardless of the severity of dealing with conflicts, such as the conflict of culture between Muslim and Western cultures, by adding to the prejudice of generation conflicts and gay / lesbian, it allows the solution to be easily resolved in a simple, easy-to-use solution. movie <br /> <br /> It leads to the impression that those who have mastered have a very big task for themselves, and they can understand after trying to be deeper. <br /> <br /> However, this is a direct film because it is an indication of conflicts that are quite convincing and entertaining.

The comedy and the players were very convincing and gave spectators a chance to recognize themselves or others. If the speeches were not a disappointment, I'd give the movie as easy as 7 or 8. If you love this movie, I come to the film "East East". cultural conflict is better, entertaining and attractive.
