<br /> <br /> I had some expectations from this film, and it was more than that that was a Yashraj movie. <br /> Jimmy operates a call center and one day, her principal Lakhan Singh is invited by Pooja Singh to teach English. . Two love oversteps and decides to flee, but Pooja tells Jimmy that she will not pay her debts to Lakhan Singh, also known as Bhaiyaaji. But they will decide and get money from it that Jimmy Bhaiyaaji / Lakhan Singh finds a Don. <br /> <br /> The first film directed by Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapur and Akshaye Kumar is produced by producer Viay Krishna Acharya and Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra. <br /> <br /> Tashan should be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Yes! Decoration is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her very popular weight) looks good. But the plot looks extremely thorough and sometimes does not give any other meaning from one scene to another - so why I was talking about the beginning of a more genuine Yashraj production. Unfortunately, with reference to poems, there is no song I can now remember. <br /> <br /> Someone has some laughs, and mostly thanks to Akshay Kumar and Saif, Kareena Kapoor played well. But for Anil Kapoor it is impossible to say anything - it did not suit him like no one. Finally, Aditya Chopra, who designed and directed good movies like "Mohabbatein" in the past, did what Yesh Chopra did by producing such a garbage film? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Bad movie is not worth spending time and my first and last impression.
