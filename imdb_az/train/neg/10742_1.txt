I wanted to sit with this bomb very long ago. What a disaster. The actor was atrocious. some of the most miserable motion scenes that fell flat like a leading balloon. This was largely due to the reactions of actors rewritten by Hitchcock's original "Lifeboat" in a modern way. I think Hictcock would turn circles in his grave. No matter how hard I suffer, there's nothing brave about it. Film.it has several semi-large titles, but their characters do not make any effort. You know, to be fair, no one was really wrong. Almost the script exploded in the first explosion. It is possible that LOL.it is completely developed. For me, I will not spend at least three days to find myself, unless at least three days are at least three days a week in the horizon. this is stinker / 1/10
