It's a pretty good cast, but the movie has no place near the original Italian comedy's Big Deal on Madonna Street. Anyone looking for an entertaining kaper film should visit the original. William Macy can be one of our greatest live actors, but here's less use. And the role of the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I'm sorry to try to fill my shoes. Try to imitate the bogus or young De Niro. The art direction is rich and textured, but it does not bring anything to the story; the extra plants they add to the story feel completely unnecessary and what they take. Even if they do not start, they do not seem strange and go away from the original surprise. Sam Rockwell has a single and charming charm and Luis Guzman has this alone charisma, but the film's love story is just polished and flat. We talked about how this film was made for the first time and how it was done for the first time, but then we live in a culture that we feel we need to do is to build incredible things instead of really learning originalizations.
