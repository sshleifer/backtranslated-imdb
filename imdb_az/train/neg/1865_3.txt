Yes, I can say, there are B-class films and B-class films and this is definitely the last one. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers know that this movie is not a credible movie (see crediting credits). <br /> <br /> The perpetrators are mainly murdered by the psychic killer. It was mistakenly mixed with some experimental acid that combines its genetic material and then lost in the snow. The killer is now in the form of a snowman - you believe. The snowman put Jack Frost behind the bars after the country's Sheriff. However, Jack Frost kills half of the city. <br /> <br /> This movie does not have any real fears and effects are only reminiscent of the B-Gradient of the 50s. This is just worth a look at a laugh. A movie to go away for a while.
