Elizabeth Taylor has never been able to act, and in this film he has only been his usual, annoying, untalented self. It was before getting so much oil, but it was still too short and the depression was still there. Rock Hudson Bick was as good as Benedict, but it would have been better for a player with more space than William Holden. James Dean knew how to get a way through a movie. All movies are incredibly slow and lasting for a long time. All actors were very young and light, and none of them were aging convincingly of poor makeup. <br /> <br /> Hudson's appearance was funny, and Dean and Carroll Baker were just the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
