Amazing! Wow! This movie is really terrible. I can not imagine how everyone reads this writing and gives them a green light. Casting is almost the second unit with almost a few really horrible performances on the entire castle. The story is not fragmented and fragmented. Presentation, set up and predictable. No mind, no charm, no humor. It's not the most sexy. Symbols remain flat like a pancake. As the film continues, there is also a strong force that causes the stomach to aggravate. Your lead (Carrell) is unfunny, and is not boring at all. When it came to the conclusion that love was a victory over lust, my stomach became ill. If it goes for humor and social comment, we are definitely condemned.
