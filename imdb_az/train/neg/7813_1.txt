In my eyes, this is just the perfect example of the Hollywood Ego, beaten by the new king kong film. Superman, though wearing an original super hero and bag, is worthy of respect. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen since the film, but he just wanted to erase the kryptonite piece from his throat. She just seems to wear the suit. But about her, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for the lois lane, she needed to be a heavy donkey reporter, but this movie seems more like a schoolboy. The field was weak and could not be predicted (WOW was actually the son of a dead man, he would never think ....) and the player was terrible. There is a good thing in this movie, and this is Kevin Spacey. Lex Luthorun's illustrations were brilliant, but could not save the movie. This film was a "lois and clark" (except for Kevin Spacey, of course) and another story. I watched this movie after watching the "hills of the hills" and then I traced it to find out that there were even worse movies.
