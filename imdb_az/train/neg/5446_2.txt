For those who are loyal Duran Duran fans who want to watch a good music video, go to this one. Manufacturers have decided to create creativity and make more than 80 videos a fantastic story that has the name of the evil Barbarella murder. <br /> <br /> This idea is unsuccessful, in the midst of some of the tremendous 80s Duran Duran, scene-staged and frustrated scenes show a fictional antagonist trying to stop the band in one of the concerts. Not only is good music repetitive, but a bad Dr. You need to suffer with some cheap spin-off story hosted by Mario. Very few to keep in mind. 2/10
