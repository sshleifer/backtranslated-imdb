I agree with the previous comment, the film's start is pretty good and it's about going on in the future ... All open stories remain open; First, the two characters that may appear to have some significance are completely outside of the picture, except for 1 or 2 short stages. If Ilya does not do better to just leave her alone ... When it comes to a character, there is nothing with it. He only visits one god-terrible place and is not about the film, but about some geriatric witches that make puppies from their days, drinking vodka, and illuminating each other. Some movies are a negative taste, bad camera job, bad author's reviews, and terrible bad direction. So I can not judge as a predecessor: 1!
