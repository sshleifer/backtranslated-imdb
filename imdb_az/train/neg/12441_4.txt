Some things should be clarified. Mark Ferris's photo is not Mark Ferris who took part in this film. I know he was my dad. Please remove this picture. And Mark Ferris was a writer, at least one of them. I wanted to find a copy or a way to see this movie again. It would have been a good one if someone could show me a copy for a year. The film was all bad and was trying to compare Star Wars and other high-tech philosophy to today's world. If you watch him, he likes the flavor and humor that he has. Become a movie snobs and enjoy less creative and updated movies.
