In any case, a woman who works with a scientist puts round metal balls into the mouths of those who change the personality, but in reality turns them into horrible, zombie killings. For practice "guinea pigs" are nubile young women who need to go out of academic classes. This film is terrible, miserable and strange. There is no logic in the script. Indeed, you will have a problem despite what happened. No special effects. Perhaps the computer screen, which provides a great scientific development, is nothing more than the old Atari screen. And even worse, there is also a puppet with shouting hair (looks like a single child in a summer camp), named Jessica (a "actress"), a personal servant / friend. Throughout the film, this puppy will be exposed to neat, sophmoric utterings. But wait ... You also get soft, unerotic, but naked scenes load with girls with some bars guys. Despite all this, the most annoying soundtrack was played in the background as a kind of spiritual discovery. None of the actors are good. There are different variable rates. Snow and "horror" aspects are particularly strange. The film seems to be really like a teenager. No coincidence Henry Sala, the director did another film, not commercially. I was bored with a comedy watching this stupid, foolish, shabby! And how much does it cost? What's going on? You know, let me keep secret, because I can not understand it for my life. I know that I spent the night watching this trash, which was the true nightmare of a hole in the beginning!
