Thus, they were exposed to violence and labeled as sick. Violence I'm scared, but unfortunately, why the heroes do not develop enough to understand why the smoke is not (completely predictable). This movie really has a terrible script. We will not be able to get acquainted with Robert and his actions are simply sad. The player is not the best, or the worst of them are TV chef and school teacher. The altitude is enough to send you to bed. What is the school movie on the ground? Perhaps you have a comment on the film? During the Climactic murder, the use of the newspaper laughs. These guys clearly think that they are intelligent, but desperately go out of their depth. How big a Jorgos Arvanitis was lit on Earth, I will never know it. And, in the first place, it's a bigger mystery to make money. Absolutely terrible.
