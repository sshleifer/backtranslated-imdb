I have this movie. I'm not through the election. The other day I was very upset and the box was interesting to me. I left it in the old VCR and spent half an hour of my life asking, "Why did God connect?" She was crying. The storyline was not so bad that I appreciate some of the game. Perhaps you will enjoy this movie if you are entering the scenic satellite cheetah romantic scenes. "I always thought like a Vulcan who you know as Dr.Spock like myself ... did not love" There are very few good things to say about this movie, it's really terrible. But because it's really a bad movie, it's the one for you! <br /> <br /> I would like to summarize this movie in one word: <br /> <br /> LAME
