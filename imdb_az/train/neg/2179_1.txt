I just loved watching a movie and having fun with its common misery. I saw this movie with the help of Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I owned the DVD. If you turn to the other side of the DVD, they show a real movie, so they gave you a chance. Seriously the nation is this grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> Operation, special effects and overall plot are very cheesy and unreal. "There is no need for lungs," Crow said, while talking about his head yet unclear, and Tom Servo just said, "No, he has the neck juice!" He says. The latter is just classic and this soundtrack with K-Porn can not touch anyone! I liked the "cat fight" between the two strippers. After the fight and the scene, "Meow", no matter what, was classic. So in some cases this was a fun movie. I think for horror supporters, maybe you can do that. <br /> <br /> MST3K version: 10/10 Deaths: 1/10. Following the MSTK3 version, you will be a great laugh for a good time.
