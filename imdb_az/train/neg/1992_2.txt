Though it does not deceive the film, in fact, Jake Speed ​​is perhaps the most delicate actor in the film, perhaps the character. When Jake Speed ​​does not rescue his sisters from the bad habits of frequent offspring, he is seriously resting. Perhaps this adds to his charm, but in my opinion, when a hero gets a chance, he says "cold". In addition, in contrast to the courageous esteem of a talented squad, this person has no sign, and of course we are talented. In any case, this film is actually worthless, the writing is subtly and, in some cases, the action is very lying. (Jeep crashes are not bad, but it depends on it) So if you are in a mood to watch a treatment movie for insomnia, this piece is perfect for you - there is a hero who does not let himself sleep, but also the audience.
