Stay away from this movie. This film is also scary due to B-film standards. It is also insidious in this regard. The main subject is that people who reject society and do not respect anything are cool and worthwhile. People who respect others are victims. <br /> <br /> <strong> Guncrazy is a film that is better than this movie. <br /> <br /> No normal child knows what Trent will do. The State Poets do not work as in this movie, and so on. While watching this movie, he realizes that writers use one-to-one cliche. Mija, yes, is a totally indifferent prostitute living a terrible life. But he is such a terrible person who can not identify himself with the audience. <br /> <br /> Usually there is something that can be recommended by a movie, there is nothing in it. It is such a funny movie that insults the person trying to identify with the main characters. The player is adequate with B-movie standards and the direction does not give anything new and exciting.
