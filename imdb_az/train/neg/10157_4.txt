Slashers ..... If you love your horrors, you will surely see, but do not worry. This movie has a very small budget, for example, you see a warehouse, and in most cases a mike boom shadow and a camera mans shadow, as there is a film shot, and I do not need them to rely on me. And if you love them, try not to see worthy actors! Several people decide to enter a game where they want to live one night in a large maze. Because they are three times killed, and whoever lives in the end becomes rich. There is something in this movie, which is continuing its course and rarely with cheap budgetary horrors, for example, when I looked at myself, I thought I would not think of leaving this game! especially $ 12,000,000. Anyway, I recommend watching it and preparing your own mind.
