It is strange that, although Thomas can do "gaps," Thomas is as tough as the actor. <br /> <br /> This movie has become one of the most salient and cheerless films I have ever seen in my memory. So I love it. <br /> <br /> The only reason to earn more than one star is that Thomas has a great form, and his small, muscular body has the ability to see different gymnastic skills on scattered fever shaped cliffs and pillars of the Eastern European country (Thomas's various shameful villagers including a nice "pommel horse" in the middle of a village square used by his feet to plant his legs). But the poor man opens his mouth and tries to emote, and any illusions he may have as a movie career are instantly whipped. <br /> <br /> Thomas says he was not at least one actor. Everyone in the movie - actors, directors, editors, camera boys and so on. At least bad, even worse, and most of them are professionals. So, Kurt does not look so bad as you think. <br /> <br /> I hope that poor Wolf took the money and fled. If someone is asking me to repeat it with a periodic art movie, I think it's at the top of a boy in front of Tomas.
