A good actor (Robert Loggia, Ellen Parker), a good area (a mysterious rocket from the ground, threatening the planet's burning) and many scenes (Air Force missiles firing, have been used). Unfortunately, it was violated by a very melodrama and an impossible time line. <br /> <br /> The film is linked to a rocket from the Soviet-era spacecraft and is mistakenly directed to the low orbit of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It loses one million degrees at speeds of more than 5 miles and 4,000 miles, burning all over the surface, glaciers, Distant Early Warnings (DEW) and Eskimos. <br /> <br /> The first flaws of this film appear early. We will not expect more films than low budget, some things like some research will not be forgotten. For example, missiles, both Soviet and US firefighters, are fast on the rocket. However, the first successful ABM tests were not made by the Russians until March 1961. <br /> <br /> There are so many melodramas. Dr. Loring (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Ellen Parker) are romantic about trees like a log cabin. Parker's character, he's screaming at Loggia's victim and boo-hoos, as in the screenshots. Loggia is heroic as a bored businessman. A scientist (Phillip Pine) likes to see William Shatner as a prince. A bus driver crashed to the end of the scene after the scene. Only the best actor is the author of a film by veteran character Lawrence Dobkins ("Naked City"). <br /> <br /> All this can be overlooked, if not for the time line. After sending the rocket information to DC, the Pentagon brings a group of scientists. General Larry Kerr announces that the missile will attack New York City for 63 minutes. After that, scientists are discussing and there is a fatal shaking as the Palestinians have been asked by the ambassadors to see if there is an attack on Russia. <br /> <br /> The film is completely exaggerated in the film. Civil Defense people leave their jobs and go to their stations. Eight million people have bought millions of school buses (and at least watching New York City as I've seen it, while watching 50's fantastic movies). The press is kept in darkness for ten minutes. Incredibly, a Pentagon man has announced that the rocket will hit Canada in Ottawa for about 51 minutes! The event took place in 12 minutes! In order to add fuel to the fire, Loggia is thinking of a way to stop the missile. It slowly brings a plutonium into a rocket base far away from the DC to launch a jeep, put it on a rocket. On the way, a wild drive is disassembled, broken down, then crushed. It finally returns the plutonium and draws it to the base to capture the rocket. Yet all of them are in the same 63-minute period. <br /> <br /> The film also demonstrates Ottawa for the salvation of men, women and children. It was then said that the missile was five minutes to reach New York. Logistics is still in the base (4 miles to go). The rocket's base and weapons reach a two-minute countdown. Within five minutes. <br /> <br /> Probably, in New York's regions should be at least fried. <br /> <br /> By the way, the rocket is destroyed if you do not guess. The ABM warhead eliminates the massive plutonium-based nuclear explosion. Five seconds later the explosion collapsed, and everything is clear. Yes, they have caused a nuclear explosion equal to 100 Hiroshima at the edge of New York, and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The film had all the elements needed to be a good film, but they were frustrated. Loggia played his character, thus sacrificing himself for not betraying himself. You did not even care about the other characters, even the smarmy scientist you performed by Pine. <br /> <br /> The tension that causes the film's filming is not physically possible over time (this is not the case today, even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> Finding this movie is very difficult. As you know, it has not been re-released for any medium and good reason. I do not know if it is a movie or a standard experience, but there is a scene where the government's best scientists, military men, and businessmen are in deep shelter because they are very valuable to lose. There is no woman or minority in the group. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the movie and plays a short piano. <br /> <br /> Worse than "27 days" that belonged to some of the countries. He said five planet earths had the chance to save or destroy the planet, and that they did not include any black or Spain. <br /> <br /> I do this on a special Sci-Fi Night Turner Classic Movies and I do not expect to see it again. If you find a single copy of this, you can place it on Amazon.com.
