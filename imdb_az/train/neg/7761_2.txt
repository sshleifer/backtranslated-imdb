After a series of power cuts in a remote island zoo, genetically-made sabertooth tigers split the island's inhabitants away. People have made some fantastic "original" movies on the fantastic channel, but maybe I think it could be the worst ever! This badly written and directed "Jurassic Park" rip-off offers all true clich√©s (crazy scientists thinking of the dead by monsters, just a long way of treating, filming a terrible death, etc.) and there is nothing surprisingly no tension. Special effects are very strange. The nearby puppets of the monsters resemble hard plush puppets, but the CGI, which makes computer-generated dinosaurs "walk with dinosaurs," is just a terrible thing to look like. There are some eyes, but most of them seem pretty unsatisfactory. Oh, and in the end, the scientist's death scene is one of the worst things I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> At the same time, there is an interesting trivia for you . This movie took pieces from the 2003 movie "Alien Hunter".
