Call girls witness a murder and become the next target of the killer. Director Brian De Palma really plays an ambitious role here: his camera shadows around the corner of the museum (after a long time on a monkey), divvies to the split screen for arty purposes, practically its area While watching a television program with two characters transsexuals and first) a sequence of scenes in a rain cloud (split on the screen). The "Kill Outfit" has to be exhausted since we have been trying to swallow us and give us nothing. Most of the players (except for young Keith Gordon) are mediocre and De Palma's "Carrie" is not called "Psycho" at the second finals. Explaining dirty actions is not a parody of Hitchcock's, it is not a respect. In a cool cold way, final results are cooked in half. ** from ****
