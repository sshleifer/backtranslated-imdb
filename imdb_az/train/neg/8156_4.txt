The Prom Night 2 OK is a horror film, but it is better at night than the road and in 1957, these films were shot by little Queen Mary Lou's lover and returned 30 years later for revenge. In this film there are actors Micheal Ironside and other actors of the film and actresses like Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I) .But Mary Lou has several good gore scenes as she killed her daughter who wants to hide in the fridge to shake one another and students are on a computer and Mary Lou turns her into death. All this is ok / good afraid, and my rating is from 10 to 4.
