Fellini is an all-time disaster. The line between the Absurd masterpieces and the free-bondage bout is very small, and in the end, what is a category that will fit into the film depends only on personal emotions. <br /> <br /> "Kazanova left me with a cold surprise and could not be more incompatible with Bukowski: <br /> Casanova also died, a great cock and a long tongue and no courage, really spit in the tomb without the feeling, ladies generally go for the biggest fool, so the human race is here today: smart and longevity Casanovuu, as well as the Easter birds that have come in and into our poor children. "<br /> <br /> Fellini takes his position on the subject; <br /> <br /> There are sensitive behaviors towards people living in the Caucasus. <p style = "text-align: justify" The sequence of subgroups is mild pornographic character, and Donald Sutherland is delicate in terms of confusion and cunning. <br /> <br /> However, describing Casanova as a foolish fool and I urge anyone to refrain from expressing this point, Fellini does not know where he looks like an ugly old man, as always - a maestro, but more than anyone who has the first place. I imagine a spectator, not to talk about this story.
