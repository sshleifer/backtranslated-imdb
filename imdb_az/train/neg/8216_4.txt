And maybe, Fred Sandford said to one of the lips. For those who cast this movie to a suspicious public. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was not good for the person at the Rue Morgue, who called the "Fender Hellbender". <br /> <br /> Probably, when you get a short home away from the middle school soccer game, stop being in the missing and asking directions in a few smaller stores in the middle of nowhere. The driver accidentally hits a parked SUV and turns off the headlight, but all of the girls do not decide to leave the car and go. The driver came to find them, and not just light through it, but for some reason girls still do not understand. When the driver first grabbed them (yes, that one), they shot a weapon and compressed them and continued shouting, "How much have you seen?". Of course, girls are afraid of death and do not know what to say. <br /> <br /> As the night goes on girls, with a SUV driver ends in a cat and mouse game, injuring any gunshot wounds and screwdrivers on the girls who are too strong to shoot where they do not want them. Finally they learn that something happens after staying in this store, which is the cause of the woman's psychological anger. <br /> <br /> This film has many worrying and intimidating elements, but unfortunately, those moments have been violated by bad behavior. , a great lapse of bad dialogue and reliability. A girl is shot by a gun gun explosion and looks fatal injuries and she feels cold, her life passes in front of her eyes, but is she better? And how much can a mini van work almost in an empty tank of about 80 kilometers per hour? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> </ BR> <br / </ Strong> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ Being totally horrifying when it's terrible and terrible. But it takes a cake for this very hysterical, and you may want to put two on your ears when watching it. By the way, I do not really advise. From 10 to 4.
