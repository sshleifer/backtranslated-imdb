I saw this movie for the first time in about twelve hours on Saturday. This is really the perfect time for this. I have never seen any movie, which is more predictable and stereotyped. If you want to see an exciting action film, do not follow it, because you lose the will to live half a lifetime. But if you want a good laugh, you can watch it! Thanks to the very happy Saturday night, I got the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection. Especially what I shoot is that every scene that thinks it will be valuable is pasted from a Discovery documentary or from an old US television. Moreover, I was surprised that they did little to make the production look real. Afghanistan, I remember that nowhere in the sea, and still with one click, Deke escapes terrorists from a sandbox with a jet pack and is taken by a submarine (probably Intelligence). Then, in the film, Deke throws an Islamist terrorist into the wall. You can see the long hair of the Korean staple flap in the air when it is removed against the walls in slow motion. Need to love. I advise you to look at some of your friends and a good amount of beer, and then you realize that I'm crazy enough to spend on the 6.99 euros box.
