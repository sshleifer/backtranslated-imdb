This should be one of the best overrated anime shows ever shown. Yes, it was even shown in the "Evangelion End" and still hated me more. <br /> <br /> I do not remember the numerous punishments of this show! <br /> <br /> I do not care about psychological and philosophical confusions, but Evangelion drags into the grass as something else! Most of the heroes were not very interesting. Interestingly, it was Asuka, Misato, and Pen Pen. Moreover, most of the people were foolishly losing control of a group. <br /> <br /> Even the "mega" and "remote battles" did not help. <br /> <br /> "Yes, these are robots, and when they get wounded (!) Blood is really cool because they're flowing, but they're really angry, they take the angels, so sometimes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am very sorry, but I do not recommend Evangelion to anyone, anime otakus or not. <br /> <br /> I'm in Macross, Mospea, I have the "Run", "Run", "Run" -Dim "and" Robot Taekwon V "solution.
