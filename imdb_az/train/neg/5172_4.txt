This is the second movie I've seen for Horrorfest last weekend, The Gravedancers first. Gravedancers were good. I'm just not content with limiting it. I accepted the start of life in an interesting way, but eventually fizzled for me. We have not been given time to really sympathize or misunderstand any of the characters that make the loyal characteristics of each one even worse. It should be noted that the attitude of a 12-year-old boy who spoke as a sheriff was a little bit different. The only reason I was sitting in the whole movie was to learn what this great mystery was. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is so enthusiastic that I could not even put it down. On DVD. Four ratings are for the story's start-up potential. This was one of the fear.
