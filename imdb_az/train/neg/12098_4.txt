I rented it after leasing Ben Desen's Expelled, and it would be interesting to compare them. Just before you go, you just look fair, I think, or the reader sees me. <br /> <br /> I love Maher's HBO show now and then, though I rarely think it is a source of humor. And though I did not get up. But he puts a couple of good points on the show and thinks me politically correct, but I'm still politically correct enough (I think it's too negative that Orwellian or at least fascist). As for my religious ideas, for the sake of simplicity, I will say that I am a non-denominator. <br /> <br /> This was not a bad "documentary" because of reasons not yet touched by many reviewers. The ones mentioned are also valid. This is not a convincing reason to argue that the main purpose (and its purpose is not just a matter of logic or just "really really come." If you want a good argument, try David Hume. The reason for this is not convincing in the absence of experts on the subject. I've seen it two months ago and I remember when talking to a person who just mentioned his credentials as a professional but not just a spiritual person. Perhaps there are hundreds of scientists or professors who work with masters or doctoral candidates who want to make a series of rituals in History, Anthropology, or many other areas. <br /> <br /> Ben Stein's "Out of the way: No intelligence was allowed," said Stein, about 30 credible professors, experts, clergymen, and others. You can find talks about. It is made up of various sources of different origin. The film also has a point in terms of freedom of thought and education. Maher has easily overlooked the errors or the persecution they have committed for centuries through theocratic order. Instead, he is referring to the secular totalitarian regimes of the 20th century, as proof that humility and secularism need more social and political power! (this is bonus features standing in front of Anne Frank House I think). This is a true Orwellian trip. He is responsible for Christianity, especially for the most delusional deaths - even though it is his share, it is much smaller! Perhaps this is the argument that secular humanism is dwarfed by the perverted records of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Another striking weakness is that the medium or the "middle" wants to talk to anyone who is practically accepted. He chooses the weakest gazelles of the herd. How difficult is this? How does it act to deny common rule that exists exists? It is not. Wow, why do cults think beyond normal? How can they be clarified? Great job Maher! Still, it is enough to talk to someone like Laurence Vance and take part in his case to refute the idea of ​​"patriotic duty" that requires his country to participate in any war. <br /> <br /> It's not funny here. Some of the clips that are "clever" covered in articles / inappropriate ways can laugh, but they try to show that Maher is less credible about how to deal with a real contentious debate. <br /> <br /> He noted that good questions are asked for religious conscientious objection. and many ask themselves. He does not touch any of them. I feel that most of the interviewees are more likely to respond better than those who interviewed, but the deck is all about what's included and what they are doing.
