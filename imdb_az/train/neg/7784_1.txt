This is a wonderful example of a self-proclaimed, written and guided simplicity project ... A group of crew members John Carradine commented on me before I was bursting: "This is the worst thing I've ever worked ... and I've been working with so many things ". Also, when he faced Jim Mitchum lines and began to curse in the yard of Santuario (a Damascus temple), then the local "vato loco" turned into one of the lesser guards "... show some respectable people." As you can see, Jim led to his reputation, and then asked for a deep and heartfelt apology for his misbehavior. In any case, the crew did the delay and never was fully paid - but especially with strange stories - a 10 year old son of the producer / director to throw us in a minaret with the Burma tiger traps to break our legs. They say: "I love us ..."
