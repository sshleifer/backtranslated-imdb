This movie is ridiculous. Scott Backula as some technical director, but not important, is a great black man playing the 1st base. First, he must be at least 75 years old, still playing a small league basketball. Trainer Backula tries to move it for the first time, which often stays in place for a long time. Backula's (SPOILER) showcases a more brilliant training strategy, explaining the star player's "city center" to a home, clearly seeing the downtown as a good move. He hit the home and won the game for a team, a small league squad that plays the Twin classes. If only Royals manager Tony Muser, like Backura, had a nice coach, and told his players to shoot a home in every race, Royals would not have ended up losing any games.
