In 1979, I saw this movie and was released when I was 17 or 18 years old. The movie was probably 1/4 full when the movie started. Ten minutes after the movie, there were only two people in the theater where he and me went. The movie was really strange and there was no script or reason for its script, and people demanded their money back. We decided to stay in the whole movie ... Why would such torture survive ...? We wanted to be a genuine movie critic ... It's hard to justify saying that the best movie (10) they've always seen is a good thing to have a standard to take on all the movies. However, it is easy to get all the movies of the worst movie (and this is the best). There may be other really worthy other films, but I have not seen them yet. Now I put all the movies I see on the market, on a scale that is based on this evil .... I FLEX THE WEEK ...
