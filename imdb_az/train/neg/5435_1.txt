Was it uncomfortable to shoot this movie? Everyone? <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an older movie, go to '42 'summer season. <br /> <br /> This is the first warning when your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard and Sarsgaard is more likely to appear. Of course, for such a "crafty" movie, Sarsgaard emphasized the unusual, cardboard character with the moments that should be intense. Miller is famous for his appearance and knows what he wants to say about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie. Pittsburgh should disrespect him. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard his cardboard-style money. Amazing! Wow! <br /> <br /> So we have this weird triangle. Foster is suffering from Miller, but with his boss / girlfriend. He can not take Miller in bed and can not sit on his head. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he keeps in touch with Sarsgaard & Miller and looks at them. <br /> <br /> Then, after the sluggish moments of Sarsgaard, Foster & Miller "treat him" in every trail, gentle detail. Finally, Foster & Sarsgaard would like to do this in the role of Filler Miller, to completely replace them all. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, the disappointment of everyone who follows one of the two sides, the rest 2 is right in my pit's pit. Wait for OH! <br /> <br /> I want this movie to come out of my life.
