***** Caution: There may be OTHER OBSTACLES ********* How great is my problem with this movie: Consumers are totally self-centered and self-conscious! After stopping for a night with a bony psychic, he goes out with him. He always calls on him, threatens him, and even sends his nights together. It is very dangerous and very dangerous. The problem is that he thinks he is dangerous for EVERYTHING (and exposes his secret). In a matter of seconds, no husband was caring for her! He thought for a moment, maybe it was in danger of psychosis? When she realized how intelligent she was, her husband had to warn her, no matter what the consequences were. Maybe there was not a movie, but what really happened was not the difference.
