Amazing. When you sit down with this movie, you say. Simply amazing, incredible. Indeed, you do not believe everyone is so foolish enough to put money on building monster. This, my friends, is really scary about this movie. One was a good idea to do so. There is, of course, another strange original story here: a high school student (sometimes going to college) is a prostitute for a mother, living in a trailer park and a mocking "artisan" because her " ". Yes, of course, this poor laugh boy is finally killed, and here the original part lives in the fear of a soul (for example, his brave mama is killed by the last John). Then he goes around with the standard of killing all the people who are harming. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < This and Wal-Mart on a disc later $ 5.00 thousand. So this is a bit overpriced. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <Strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br> /> <br /> - Heroes Freddy Krueger and Freddy Krueger raise a liner. <br /> <br /> You will not really know who the Caucasian is and who was later killed. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, How interesting are the series of Sleepaway Camps like Pinhead, Chucky, and even Angela? All these are better than this oppression. <br /> <br /> The worst dialogue ever heard in my life. The scenario is full of weaknesses at a level that I can never imagine. This is a terrible step because I am serious here. Yes, do not get me wrong, but it's not as funny as hell, but I did not hear something similar to Slumber Party Massacre III. This film looks like "Jason X" as Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3/10 Story: 3/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 Character Development: 2/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 5/10 Lighter / Sexual contact: 1/10 (Nudity, mother's prostitute, girls will not wear) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (Low quality, inexpensive amount) Dialogue: 0/10 (Very ridiculous, clear, over-top and angry My first rating for dialogue in any movie!)
