First, a few members of the Titanic disaster and a member of several Titanic clubs for a long time, I have the right to comment on the film. The film's awards and prizes are not really important, but I'm still a terrific movie. Cameron had resources to make a 'slick' semi-documentary of disaster, but unfortunately, she chose to transform her into a po-faced romantic mushroom. The truth that many people in the world have fallen is just an indication of the taste and taste of the movie critics and followers today. Who said that all movies should fall in love with a hero and heroine? In fact, the most realistic events are romantic and the Titanic disaster is, of course, not the same. I think there is a need for a better script and a director with a semi-documental approach and as few artistic licenses as possible. "Dead" fell in love with the last line in which the lovers met among the other lost passengers and crews. Is this a clever movie? Ask yourself.
