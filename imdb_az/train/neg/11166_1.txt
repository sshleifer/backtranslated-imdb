Taking into account the character of Nako Libre, I'm sure it is deep in the depths of Jack Blacks, not entirely funny. <br /> <br /> In your opinion, jackets with a whale at one time play smarmy, slimy Mexican friars who want to become a wrestler, but this movie is a common idea in almost every department. <br /> <br /> Most of the film should be "It should be funny" and "That Tenacious D is the right person?". The truth is that the film does not offer it. EVERYTHING! It's an awful script with unhappy characters and really naff action and direction. We'll watch the endless moments you think might be funny, but it's not alone. I enjoyed running for about 10 minutes, but of course it could. He did not do it. Only 90 minutes later, I said that an aneurysm was painful. <br /> <br /> Well, just a few years ago, when I saw something with your fave actor, they were early pope because they were famous, and I was really embarrassed that the actor was actually in such a burden. <br /> <br /> As it is said in some of the films, it is very important for me. If you are still doing this, Jack will go there and kneecaps or something to draw. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <strong> <span style = "color: red;">
