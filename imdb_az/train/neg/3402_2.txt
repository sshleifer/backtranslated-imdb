Why Jane Show will not work. Once again, Canadian bonehead manufacturers and writers can not create a sitcom without having to split any kind of kind. In my opinion, these people do not look at the US more than just causing a downturn in the sitcom model. No, we have to do something different, we have to make a story totally absurd, and then have a meaningful B story to prepare for it. Heroes are two-dimensional and story lines are from the top: Forklift races ??? give me a freaking break. Have a few tips for the show writers, do not write funny situations, find funny situations. And remember, it's not just a good monkey that needs to be born with a sense of humor to write really funny things.
