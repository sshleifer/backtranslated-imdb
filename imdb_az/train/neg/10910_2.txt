I've interviewed Rob Schneider (playing the lead character Marvin Mange in this movie). He said that he wanted to emphasize so much physical comedy that he would extinguish the volume and laugh at this movie. Obviously, it should be hidden. I opened the volume. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I talked to a conversation that, after all, this was really a disaster and was totally unfinny - Schneider's "Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo" was a great disappointment after the hilarious performance . After a crash by a type of scientist named Dr. Michael (Mala), he began to loose control of "animal instincts" who had lost a large group of animal breathing fantasies. "" This is her "supercop". He can discover drugs hidden in the body cavity and throw horses. Of course, there is a bad habit to eating human cows and degrading goats, but is it a small price to pay? There was only one thing for me. <br /> <br /> The cast was very desirable. Is there any more irritating actor than John McGinley in Hollywood? Play Sgt here. Sisk, a police force, commander of Mange, was forced to look at Colleen Haskell's first "serious" player with many sad cartoon characters (such as the character of a famous television series "Scrubs"). Something in this movie can be called "serious" ) Of course, he has won the title of "Survivor" as a competitor, and he proves what we know: he is as lovely as a button. What does not prove here is that she has any different talent as an actress. What is Ed Asner as Police Chief Wilson? I mean, how old is this man now? He wanted Mange to eat some cows, and he breathed all the way. I was amazed at the movie I was shocked after. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was confused twice: Mange is playing with thundering toys on his police car and the scene has more orangutan mobility than Schneider Haskell and Orangutan! So, for two tracks - 2/10.
