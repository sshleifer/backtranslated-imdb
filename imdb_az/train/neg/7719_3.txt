The easiest way to describe this movie is a satire. Satira's target is far greater than the US government's corporate America. <br /> <br /> Think of this as a turmoil between the movie Kentucky Fried movie, Aircraft and Police Department series, a smaller budget funny. I can see that this movie is a line of fantasy disaster films from 50 to 60. <br /> <br /> I see this movie as a major impact on Tim Burton's Mars attacks. <br /> <br /> The solution is simple enough. Genetically gigantic tomatoes are "bare" and begin to attack people and cities. <br /> <br /> Shows the shooting and characteristic of the film: Lois "Fairchild" (Lois Lane Clone), a very ambitious Presidential Press Secretary Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent, not working since Fiqh Pi≈ü), an unfounded president CEO of Marketing and the Mason Group is an obese East German "female" swimmer, a salty diver, a WWII paratrooper and an African-American disguise specialist (George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally, as it appears to be attacking New York) hidden as a tomato. Do I forget too many tomatoes and many diet names? <br /> <br /> Every kind of tomato is available from small tomatoes, giant plastic tomatoes, tomatoes, tomato juice and finally tomato. <br /> <br /> There are several musical numbers on all of this. They are not good and can look dubbed. The best melody is the theme of the movie ("The Killer Tomato Attack"). It is very attractive and can lead to reading and reading to the public. Be careful. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film is quite entertaining and shows that various real-life situations and various entertainment genres are absurd. I do not believe that I was laughing, but I smiled mainly and shook my head. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for fans of B and C class films, but only for rent. <br /> <br /> - Celluloid Rehab
