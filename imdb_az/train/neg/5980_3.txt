Fox TV managers have a group sitting around a boardroom desk wondering for the new show commission. <br /> <br /> What is the purpose of something like "24" or "West Wing"? "One of them says, but if all agree that it will be very expensive and the cheapest television is being used, the station may be damaging. <br /> <br />" Well, how can some comedian combine some great writers and catch a good quality sitcom? " "You did not know that good writers had so much money!" <br /> <br /> "We can do another crime drama ..." says a soft suit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> People like the media, let's do another copy. <br /> <br /> "Let's add more violence and make it really impeccable." <br /> <br /> "Let's add more violence and make it really flawless." "We're Fox." Another suit says, "You'll get it right now." "We can do them a Deviant Crimes Unit," he continues to add a bullet accurately. <br /> <br /> "By Jove, he's there!" The big head laughs, 'Victims can be beautiful and sensitive women, very little on the screen.' Of course, people would go out of the middle and poor scripts, "Blandman said. <br /> <br />" Then it's been solved, we need a name, "he said greatly." We could say Police Violence? " <br /> <br /> "The Killer Instinct is very verbal about violence, but it sounds like the Basic Instinct, which is a very sexiest." <br /> <br /> "Puuurfeq" responds to the great president, puts behind one another and stops leaving the arrested development.
