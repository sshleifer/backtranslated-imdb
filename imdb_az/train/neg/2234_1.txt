I bought this DVD for 1 AZN and now I understand why. The player was the worst I've seen for a long time. Lighting and sound are good. (WARNING: I do not advise watching this movie when it's crap) This movie feels like you're watching a home cinema for someone who is out of sight. Is it really shameful that all the spending spent on this project goes to such a waste, is there another man still having a career outside Eva longoria, the sole "star" of this film? it was probably not hit with a bad moving stick. We are sorry that none of these criticisms seem constructive, but I still do not say James Cahill. "Its not good in its good division" with the words in figure.
