I wonder if John Wood did not play Dr. Falken until I watched the movie. BAD area, bad science, bad behavior and generally a bad movie. Please do not watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Ensure that the original "War Games" is executed if you feel nostalgia. <br /> <br /> I did not like the twist to crush the terrorist threats. In W.O.P.R first film, Russia had one warhead in the United States. This film was about to kill a terrorist before threatening the idea behind the computer. On the edge of politics, a good thing about the first film, stressed that at the end of a stupid computer, the war would be meaningless. There is no such idea in this movie.
