I hate this movie! It's not like this book and it's crazy to think about it. If you watch the movie before reading a book, yes, it's a good movie. But the King's book was AMAZING and this was not a movie. That is, it can be a common thing, but most of the film is completely different. Example example! So the book is very intense and Danny and Wendy survive a few seconds after the hotel's explosion. but in this terrific version of the movie jack takes them with a foolish maze ... Yes, there is no maze in the book, and there is no reason for that. It was a bit of anger that Jack killed Mr. Halloran! What is this, he is basically a hero of the book, and they just kill him as he is ignorant. Generally, the film was badly closed.
