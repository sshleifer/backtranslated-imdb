Storyline: The film covering the 4th time covers a fairly detailed coverage of events in the Kargil sector near LOC in 1999, when Pakistani infiltrators cross the LOC and return to India and India. To find out more about the story, I invite readers to read Kargile's news. <br /> <br /> Comments: If you are looking for a formula story in this movie, you can be sure that there is no. LOC is a clean story of sacrifice, patriotism, courage and plurality, and many stories of bullets and blood. The movie hall I saw this film was fit and full when it showed India's Hell. Film audiences seemed like the Audiograms, as in India vs Pak cricket match. <br /> <br /> Respect the victims of the film and characterize real-life heroes (4 proud heroes of PVC) Those who sacrifice their lives will see it today. The film has created a brilliant description of the army, which, in all probability, is in rough weather. The disadvantages of the film are very long and the songs are quite boring.
