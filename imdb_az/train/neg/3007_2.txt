In a search that has not ended in horror, we will face this movie, perhaps some time ago, on DVD for some unusual reasons. Transfer is old and quality only creates. <br /> <br /> <strong> Those who want to marry a woman living in the Caucasus, hack no talent, "Slaughter High" starts slow and does not accelerate for about an hour. First, see a 'nerd' as selected by a group ... I really did not even know what they would be ... knows? The chef is ultra hooknose so ugly it should be absolutely nerd beaten. Then the "great man" and a few boring and chickens should be "warm", but they are not. This is a mystery to why some of the rejecting groups are gathered on one of their own, but it is to think that the viewer takes them to a "great guy". Casting choices are heartwarming because most of the high schools play one-thirty. Other reviewers have pointed out that the actors (if you can tell them) are a group of Brits who sneak up on the stroke many times. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This group of children we should not think that this is the only student in the school. Because "reunion" is only at school, now it is abandoned and consists of them. <br /> <br /> The killer is naked, the core is not large, and scripts are like Scooby Doo with real people; "This place gives me reptiles ..." and "Someone gimme a beer" ... It's not just good. Skip it until you want to laugh at a true naked attempt on a slasher, with some friends wasting away. If you want to look good, Bava's 14 years ago, "Blood of the Bay" and a much better heck. If you want to see a good BAD slasher, see "Just Before Dawn" or "Burning". 10 to 2 children.
