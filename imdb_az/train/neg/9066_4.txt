This center is based on superstitious thoughts in dealing with sin. <br /> <br /> Merrill wounded a stingy boy to stop his 'leak' on Rennie's death. <br /> <br /> The challenge model and the car crash were to be effective on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Playing straight in spite of the flashing sequences - all narrators trust us (no matter what the "truth" or "neglect" of the dialogue), so there is no game with the narrator. <br /> <br /> So what we leave is individual performance and at this level Wynn's bantering is a virtual one-man show.
