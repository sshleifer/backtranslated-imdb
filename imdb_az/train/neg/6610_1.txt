This movie should not be watched as it is meant to be a flop. Ram Gopal Verma first wanted to make a remake of this classic bollywood movie called Sholay, but after having problems with original producers, he decided to continue the project and ... all the best parts of the movie (players, scripts, songs, music, comedy, .) Performs and shoots the film as he already crews the crew. Removal of money, time loss. After filming such films as Rangeela, Satya and Company, Coppola released us; What did you think of RGV? Anyway, the story is hard to follow, though almost as Old Sholay. A new guy plays Ajay Devkan, Heero (Beeru, Sholay) and Ajay, Ajay (Jay, Sholay). Both help the "bad yet funny" friends catch the police the first bad guy. Then, in the film, now retired police hire them as personal security and are protected from the bubba, most wanted by Amitabh Bachan. If you do not watch Bollywood movies, Good guys will end. I saved 3 valuable watches of my life there!
