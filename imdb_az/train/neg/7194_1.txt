In order to steal the Disney's well-known experience .. I want to say that .. This live action version of the proud cartoon class is once again worse than once in a year when buying and reviving renowned features. I grew up in the original cartoon series. Any episode of the original cartoon series gives more laughter than this movie. Penny has no nice computer books right now. It does not exist, but is full of commands that destroy the self, which has always been exploded by the president. A new smooth conversation gadget is an element of a typical, non-realistic Hollywood romantic (the original cartoon was a refrigerator that can convert a van or car). <br /> <br /> Do not fill out the money to get money for Disney administrators and even their _ex_executives - do not see this movie. <br /> <br />
