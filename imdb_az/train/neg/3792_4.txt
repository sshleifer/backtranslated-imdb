I've seen many products in the picture. Now we may have looked at this movie from the sadness of the theater director, but I was disappointed. I am convinced that people with special choreography perform this product effectively, but from theater to absolutely everything from design to choreography, I have found that "movie pictures" are unshakable and unbefitting. Traditionally, none of the "strange" and impressive suits seemed to be as intended (that is, candy did not look like candy, rats did not look like rats, but chocolate kisses) were too low for the screen, and choreography did nothing for me. It's as if all shows are going to be very satisfactory (in the best way), as if it did not go beyond any other production. But I remember that it was not a dancer and choreographer, but a straight theater director, not the artistic perspective of a theater director.
