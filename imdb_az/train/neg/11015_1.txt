I read the DVD cover a year ago at Best Buy and read it foolishly, and said to me, "Smiles you see, moreover, there's Michael Clarke Duncan, how loose!" I continued to pay $ 15.99 plus taxes for that. I took her to a friend's home and we both wrote down and stayed in a bad situation. Wooden performances are numerous. All "cheerful" and "outstanding" performances never came. After 90 minutes, I'm shouting, I know, I can not get 90 minutes or $ 15.99. I almost cried because if it were a "comedy", I would not like to believe in the movie anymore. My friend and I have always told the point where it is necessary to understand the horror of this movie to a friend to understand how bad he is. I watched him this year because he did not want to watch him alone during the holiday season. This was my next horrible mistake, as I was just angry. I started shouting in the movie and did not talk about the films. Everyone I do not know has admitted that they see the movie the best they saw. My humorous feelings are sick and bent and often offend my friends, but they could not even keep this movie. It is true that this movie is not in the 100th list of IMDb. His rating (3.6 in this post) is a crime against humanity.
