First of all, I believe that the Norwegian films are constantly improving. From the grueling emotional films of the 70s and 80s, films from this location actually started to drink a little humor. Imagine .. Actual comedies were made! The films were long, dark, surprising, and boring and funny. <br /> <br /> In the 1990s and in the 1990s, several real-life movies were produced by a new generation of filmmakers. After the film, the film praised the critics and collected money. <br /> <br /> He came to the United States as a whole. <br /> <br /> * MENU USERS * It's just ridiculous. Not once. Never. But it is ... We think it's funny. Because we were accustomed to being funny in Norwegian films. Especially a cast like this with a really really comic comedian. But .. They do not say anything, nor have fun! Where's the smile? Show me humor! An unusual secretary by Harald Eia? Would it praise the absolutely funny non-realistic football coach? Have comments by Arne Scheie? <br /> <br /> In some cases, many countries in the US, that is, predictability. (And I'm scared that Norwegian comedies will survive after seeing many other movies). All the characters will get exactly what they are presented at the start of the movie, and at the end of each of them. <br /> <br /> Generally, after seeing this movie, I can say that I'm sitting with a bad feeling. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <
