I'm happy! Mən bir həftə əvvəl Artisan Entertainment-dən Texas Rəhbərliyinin bu dəhşətli atası ilə bu cırıq pik atdıqdan sonra bir həftə əvvəl video rəfələrə çarptım və sizə xəbər verim ... Mən nadir hallarda həyatımda belə izləyirdim, bu qəribə megabom raylardan uzaqlaşır və "ən pis killer təlxək the film "could not steal the name fool full moon fiasco killjoy (I'm sure that a lot of us had suffered so much horror fan!) All signs <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Cliche, etc.) is as follows ... One executive (who produced and co-scripted by the director Ken Hebert ) skeptical employee Tracy (Amanda Watson) and frantic married couple, Mark and Susan (Hank Fields and Chris Buck), a weekly run to the nearest town, 12 kilometers away from the cab of a respiratory included. On the way, they take a rattling hawk (Melissa Bale) at the bar and end up in their destination, where one night night lunar tales come true and a fatal clown that works on the same wooded area, <br /> <br /> Killer fox does not appear in the movie, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> friends' no one gets to the end and box (except for obesity beyond the morbid) does not seem like a description of the devil. It is mostly spent in the wood for one hour, cuts wood and breaks the childhood hearts. I can not say enough bad things about casting, especially the two boys and the hilarious chick can reveal someone's unwanted dialogue with a minimal degree of enthusiasm or the most unpleasant moment. The scenario is totally and completely stopping, originality, intelligence, humor or lack of consistency does not really help. I can for a few days wonder how strange this film is, how much durability errors and how much all the production is, but as the whole package points out, the film also says that the film was released in the US (SERIES HUMAN CLINIC KILLER). Currently under the name of GRIM WEEKEND (original title). <br /> <br /> 1 point over 10 points
