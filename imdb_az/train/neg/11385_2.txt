Before I get started, I can say that the experience of this movie is influenced by the dubbing I've collected from other comments, and it's down to some. Thus, the new DVD version with subtitles or appearance can make a difference. I have not read the relevant books; <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> Blade Runner, 12 Monkeys, etc.), but I do not like this movie did not come. Although slightly subtle, it was tiring after just half the end. There are all kinds of problems; the most important thing is to start with the most violent events: dialogue. Heroes can not describe exact sentences; If you do not shout each other's names in the n-time period, they will be the monosyllables ("Kanedaaa!", "Tetsuoooo!", "Huh?", "Grrr", etc. This is the most sophisticated and two-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some movies are only a few minutes away from the stereotypes that visually present the screen, and is enhanced by some random, There is nothing wrong with bits and misleading fantastic ideas. <br /> <br /> Obviously, the last sequence of scenes of confusion and decay is an excuse to start, of course, there is something wrong with a good turmoil and destruction, in this case you will ask yourself, "What is all this and how much it is done?" the character development is less than Tetsuo in 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> The latter looks like one in 2001. One thing to decide or explain is that the viewer sees only a two-hour kaleidoscope. I am convinced that some people will claim that such things are art; but I just used a lot of color and pictures of betrayal. (Some music was also quite interesting). <br /> <br /> Tired of the taste? Want to watch cartoons intelligently dealing with "mature" topics? I'm sorry to say that you are more interested in finding something like this in South Park.
