Do not be mistaken, this is neither a fear nor a movie. I'm talking about this 82-minute failure; <br /> <br /> Kris Pine's participation is just one star-worthy reason. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The heroes are moving forward in their actions and will not work yet. There is a time to submit - thanks to economical writers and obviously embarrassed writers - before returning to the state of entertaining and entertaining (teen rock mounting). <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> Chris Pine's lightweight fights to keep himself on the earth while drowning in a strange unhappiness. Watch the "Black Road", watch '28 days later, watch the TV during the day ... but that's it; I beg you. You are suffering from this boredom, unlike the movie you believe, this movie is not a cure.
