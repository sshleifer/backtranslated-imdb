The opening sequence has to show the Legion to Paris on November 13, 1918. The troops were stuck in the train, wearing the uniform of the French Army, the Legion of War, in 1914! A sure sign that you can see is a Turkey warrior. In 1915, the French army did not work with the red trousers and the blue coats. The Metropolitan French soldiers were "horizontal blue" and colonial armies.) Claude Van Damme (sp?) At least made or reduced the uniforms. When directors make such mistakes, indeed, it is really bad when they make the effort to guide other things.
