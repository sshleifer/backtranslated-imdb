Just watch the trailer for Theodore Rex, this is a bad comedy cop comedy with a guy with Whoopi Goldberg and a dinosaur costume. That's right, but it's a futuristic story. It looks like Batman Forever in many ways and strange character designs. It is mismarketed and should be presented as a futuristic fairy tale instead of just a lying cop comedy. <br /> <br /> In the future, dinosaurs are brought to life through beautiful technology and they are talking about and walking around. Teddy is a strictly rejected dinosaur detective, but after a dinosaur is killed, the case is being reviewed, but all of them must partner with Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). <br /> <br /> Teddy's film begins as a normal actor, but it's up to the incongruity prayer to solve this crime. It is unbearable to listen to the end. Besides being a detective, he is also a bad comedian and a bad impersonator. It is a manifestation of the famous people and accents, and some really terrible lines. Whoopi blames her for farting and says, "This is my skull trump!" Amazing! Wow! For any child, a growing, untrained line for such a child's movie. Whoopi is both annoying and rude to anyone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> This movie never knew what he wanted to be. When there are futuristic scenes and actions, there is no comedy or humor. In non-motion scenes, the characters try to be as funny as possible, resulting in an unstable flat-faced boredome. Operation scenes do not work because they are very strange and not violent, and as it has been stated before, comedy is just a lot of slaughter. Nothing here works. <br /> <br /> To have a dinosaur / human detective prayer seems to be a pretty original film, if nothing else. Nope! This movie is a great rip-off of Kim Framed Roger Rabbit. Just replace dinosaurs with cartoons and set them up in the future, and this is the same trick. A man is killed, the dinosaur is killed. Solves a dinosaur and detective murder, a toon, and a detective murder. The bad guys in Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and weasels. The bad guys here are like a man called Christopher Lloyd, and there are children who act like naked. Roger Rabbit's stage scene, where Jessica Rabbit is performing, is imitated by dinosaurs. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's a bad movie, and it's not worth it even to fix it through VHS. <br /> <br /> My rating is 1/2. 90 minutes. PG for light violence, language and rough humor.
