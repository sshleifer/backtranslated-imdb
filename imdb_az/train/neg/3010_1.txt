The holy Sh * t was terrible. I sat in the theater for an hour and ten minutes and thought that I had to wait long in Oedipus Rex. dear God this movie does not charge a credit for anything more than a secondary school film buff. you can save your money, this movie can not offer you anything. If you did not enjoy movie festivals and sleep. you know, h3ll, bring your girlfriend and do some interesting things. you will only be the only one there. This slide show is F @ ck. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> This afternoon is more entertaining than watching the movie. it's sad.
