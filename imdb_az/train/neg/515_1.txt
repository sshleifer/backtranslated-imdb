Oh, man, this movie is bad. The fear runs out. The story is about a racing driver who is in love with him, and then does not like himself when promoting a chicken fast-food chain and doing so. He is trying to make the contract and make a terrible, painful unusual combination. Jim Nabors behaves like sleeping, does not move. While watching this stinker, you'll miss Burt sidekicks-like Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed. Loni Anderson's hair proves that haircuts do not go out in the sixties. Or maybe it was a crack. Undoubtedly Burt's parody was not bad in this movie. His worst "wig day" was "Smokey and Bandit 2". Anyway, this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie ever there, with "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper" with no thanks) are great, funny movies. This is not the case. Ned Beatty, a great actor, is also wrong. To hate it, you have to get rid of an entertaining Jackie Gleason type. And think about you, one of these entertaining movies is not in the bag. It's bad, clean and straightforward. Even the end result was exhausting and boring, all of which was the worst, unfunny. And at least "Stroker Ace" shows Burt's coffin that Boogie Nights, previously known as "Freedom," can act as one of the first heavyweights to keep Burt's coffin in another movie. It's a decent platform for you.
