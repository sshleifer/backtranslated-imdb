Boogyman's return is a horrible movie that does not play like a movie, while watching old episodes plays as a TV sitcom episode. <br /> <br /> Film shooting is a constant and boring thing from the first movie. Again on the same footage. <br /> <br /> This film is really about a psychic woman with a vision of the first film. <br /> <br /> I saw the first movie I did not want to see. I repeat the same scenes again and I know who it is. The whole movie seems to be quick to appear so quickly that it takes a few bucks.
