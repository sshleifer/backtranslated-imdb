NIGHTMARE NO WEATHER TO SPEAK THE WEEK. This is simply contrary to the description. Something about a computer that can change individual items for silver balls that fall into the victim's mouth is something that kills or turns into zombies. All this is surprising, that is surprising. She has a computer girl in her room and the computer speaks through a handful of dolls !!!!!!!! I do not prepare these things. <br /> <br /> Computer's control of the car, even though the computer is not connected to the vehicle. <br /> <br /> "Film" is a common trash. Surreal bad trash. Spectacular, one bad sort of garbage. There are many sex scenes here and there are not too hot or erotic. <br /> <br /> There's a scene where a woman's love is visible or France wants to kiss a tarantula. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it has become one of the worst films. Equally dark home videos with BOARDINGHOUSE or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with killer toothbrush!). At least we are trying to track it and understand what it's all about.
