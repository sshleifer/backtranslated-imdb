Dedicate the best to each other. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and great Christopher Walken. With such a cast, you can only expect the best. <br /> <br /> <strong> Nobody can save this catastrophe with "Gordon". <br /> <br /> Best friends and co-workers at Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) jewelry factory. They both live a good life, but because Tim has a better performance, Nick Nick can afford more. Nick is always a dreamer with new ideas for inventions. One day, Nick comes up with the idea of ​​a spray box that lets the dog break away (yes, I'm not serious). Nick, who is fond of this idea, decided to really invent this product. He offers Timha an investment to invest in her ideas and share 50/50 profits. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The example of the poem-and-poe-rize (still I'm serious) ends with millions. He spends his money on things like a bigger house, a horse, a personal trainer and a fancy desert. Tim feels an envy for Nick. That's why the movie's name. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it's still terrible. This film is from the worst dialogue and many poor performance. Then, as I mentioned before, no one could save this confusion. Even the great Kristoper Walken, a homeless character called "J-man," made this movie funny. <br /> <br /> I come to this movie if: * If you look like a shit (nothing is meant) * Jack Black's white tux / <br /> I'm telling you to avoid any distance from this movie, if: * If you treat humor in the bathroom, you love animals
