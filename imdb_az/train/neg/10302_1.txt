Since Rugrats is a mediocrity for two or three years in a good and comic cartoon series, and it's really a terrible price, the oppressors in Klasky-Csupo should not go beyond the ideas. After downloading all the characters, even the silent ones (even though I'm not Nancy Cartwright, not Chucky Finster) and some feeling of endurance (for example, the day in the episode, Tommy and Chucky each have a new dog, but this is the next episode, the above-mentioned dogs never seem to think that creators would kill the show of compassion. <br /> <br /> <strong> Even though not as terrifying as episodes, everyone, even the father (my God! The show was the best character, but now no true purpose). The latter is unnecessary, and the only thing that is different from these and other unhappy new episodes is that children can interact with adults ('98-'01). <br /> <br /> There are no stars for "Rugrats All Growed Up". Klasky-Csupo, please destroy this show until you get worse.
