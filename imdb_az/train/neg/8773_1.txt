If you see too few movies, it can be a great deal for you. If you see many movies, it's a joke. The actions of real heroes are described very badly. It is noteworthy that there is a song, there are many flashbacks, and most importantly, the battle scenes are played foolishly. Newer characters, good direction, would do a better job, but you can guess what will happen in the future as they contain all Bollywood heos / heroes. You do not have to worry about something, but just because we see this actress in 1,000 other Hindi movies, they resemble each other. Thinking about being a real movie but did not show it. There are times when you are curious, you have thousands of soldiers who are mobilizing soldiers, and Pakistanis attack them, and none of them bombs. The purpose of the Pakistani was really bad or the director had to look at them stupid? There were only a few good-looking characters, but it was weak, because of the tricky and frustrating activity. This film could have been short while playing, when it sounds, slipped to the point.
