For a film, I found myself in this incredible excuse at the very thin 3th act. First, the impact of the computer is totally mind-blowing! It's really a backside of computer wizs'. The rest of the film, though, is that none of the heroes, especially the above-mentioned negative minus 3, will act in a real way (I promise that I will not give it, but trust me. it's not worth keeping!). Many laughs in the film are unwelcome, as they try to explain how the eyeballs will not work. <br /> Some of the sex aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do if you did not see it? No one can arrest you! These issues have been discussed in more detail in classical The Invisible Man since 1933. In particular, this is extremely uncertain and there is an unexplained violent incident. If you draw more attention, Kevin's crazy scientist could have been a bit more meaningful. <br /> <br /> In fact, the film would be more successful as a porn, because the premise can be really unique and exciting. But this piece of work ... look at something else. Or do not, and live with the consequences <br /> <br /> 3/10
