An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) stumbled accidentally from an ancient, 40-foot mummy well-preserved in the Nevada Desert. They keep it secret and call on the Jewish translator to help them understand its history. Mumya, as described at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of the few giants he has seen in those days. To save his son from a devastating flood that would kill everything, he mumbles his son and buried him with several servants for centuries. At present, the fallen angels are still walking the earth, the mummy is resurrected, and the ritual is expected to happen. Most of the film deals with slow, biblical crap and some bad, air punching battles. Mumia looks decent, but not nearly adequate. It had to have a lot more connection, but it was so dragged ... eh. Please do not worry.
