Was this one of the most missed films I ever saw? Why do not I really know it? It's just a strange story about a boy who just wants to marry and begins to dream of someone else. The story was told a thousand times. <br /> <br /> I do not know what's wrong with this movie. Most actresses are really entertaining when they come together to make a movie that was made a million times earlier. There is really a little smart thing that's really not in the other. For some reason, this is not your concern. You can choose some funny parts or clever ideas, but for some reason they are not funny in any way, are not we smart? I wish I could explain it, but I do not know? Do not waste time just once?
