This purple paint resembles a dry land. <br /> <br /> It can not give any meaning to this movie. If there is no time, no one will wait or worry. <br /> <br /> According to some of the films, there are all great names in this movie, but no one will ever love this movie if no one is there. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I'll look at Vanessa Redgrave and think, "Hurry up and die!" It's not like the "Joy Luck Club", no friggin 'joy. <br /> <br /> The Ocean's 13th movie (nothing but the main movie) is her mother's daughter movies and completely anti-climate ... oh finally until it's over. <br /> <br /> I'm sure you'll be a candidate for Oscars ... <br /> <br /> - 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince a great actress to commit this trash.
