I've been to some non-liberal who came to see Steve's videos. <br /> <br /> It was a great experience in film shootings and debate propaganda. <br /> <br /> I was hoping Michael Moore's film to be an actual documentary at my local school, to the UVSC.

Golly gee Batman, this should be ranked by the entire President! Their ratings are as clear as the approach in this film. <br /> <br /> Yeah, it's going to help you make a smart movie like the sound of the IMDb. Maybe my voice will help balance it.
