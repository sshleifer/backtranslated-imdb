One of the worst films I've ever seen in a fierce camera, using a malicious filter, the height of the movie, the script was terrible, and I would also like to tell you how a big battle was eventually predicted ... <br /> <br /> The scenes were so funny ... ... get the horse like Sorbo and walk the end ... LOL, I mean, really horse? You can not forget how poor murders go through the whole movie throughout the film. First, after killing witnesses and federal agents, they think they are watched. ETC, ETC does not really worry about watching it.
