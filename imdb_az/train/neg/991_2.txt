If you want to watch a good movie about how women can fight sexual assault, this is not the movie you want to watch. A public comment on a victim and a fighter. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns the attackers into tables. Instead of using the criminal justice system, victims will try to be careful. It essentially abolishes the judicial system. "The Accused" was a better movie because the victim used the court system and won it. "Nishan" tells the victim what to resort to violence? Is the victim's prosecution better? No!
