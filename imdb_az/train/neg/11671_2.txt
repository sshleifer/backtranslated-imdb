I say - a stinker! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There is no tension, deep, shocking secrets do not emerge, there is no danger for the happiness of the hero. Several disagreements, mitigation of voices - are quite a few. <br /> <br /> The last "secret" that appears in the film can be completely predicted by this point. <br /> <br /> Life style is like a young man's name. An artist, Faith (Meg Tilly), invites you to take a number of wall panels in a large ballroom with a large, very rich, old widow and a growing mother and daughter. <br /> <br /> The old woman's daughter Cassandra died. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Cassandra's death still depends on it for a few years now. <br /> <br /> In this great mosque everything has a loyal child who looks like something to eat, to answer the door, and so on. Apart from the door lock, everything else is a single explanation of how one of these symbols goes into a room where people believe. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to hold your seats and move towards the edge of the chair, because there is no "mounting" tension in this movie - from time to time only mild, pitiful verses. <br /> <br />
