As the DVD box claims, it's not funny and terrible. I really love wrapped and wierd movies, but it's really boring! This is a penis that blows infant babies and is exposed to many aggressions! I intent on this amateur sleaze, It's-so-bad-it's good to do movies, but failed. Only bad! Several scenes are complete, but they are a complete error. If you like an amateur splatter like this (just one way better), I recommend Andreas Schnass's Violent Shit 2 and 3.
