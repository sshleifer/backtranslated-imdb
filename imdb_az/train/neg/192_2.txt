Only a good part about this movie is a beautiful look. This film was long and boring. The minister had to retire from the minibus when he was away from the teachings of his son Paul. In this movie, boys can take the name of the Lord several times from the Presbyterian Fund? This is not appropriate. Paul Paul (Brad Pitt) wished the depth of the boat to begin with to distinguish a generous, full-fledged, hateful story. So Norm is a teacher and Paul wants to get rid of Normu, but what he should do is become a compulsive gambler. This is very uninteresting. We see Paul standing up for his native American girl. It was part of some interests and could have turned into a real "wild west". Only what we have seen is a sleepless city where the children of two children do not do anything. 1. Norm follows a bare girlfriend and deals with her family 2. And when Paul is shaking his head, he builds susar stories in the newspaper shop and earns a lot of swigs and many flies. I would like to watch a similar show that will not happen again.
