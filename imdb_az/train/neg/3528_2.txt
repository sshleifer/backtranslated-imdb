There are a lot of comments in this movie, but I found them to be misleading. A corner cut is a commonly used scenario where a normal person is common in the offense against someone. He meets a rich girl. The girl takes a boy with a gun for something ridiculous. The boy was intrigued. <br /> <br /> As you know, the antagonist turns into a wild, free spirit instead of sociopathy ... Wipe out a few words from Alice Drummond and have a recipe for Love. Do you have a horror or just one embrace? The role of the breakfast club is simply a starting point. And everything else is a really terrible Turkish movie.
