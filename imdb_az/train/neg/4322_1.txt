<br /> <br /> We can save 88 minutes of your life (all this!) <br /> <br /> Sorry, this movie (I guess) is described in Capra style. If it fails, it will completely and completely fail. I'm trying to think something good about it and can not. <br /> <br /> In the first part it is said: <br /> <br /> Angels are actually the old cowboys sitting in the trees. Santa can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /> <br /> And the surface .. I will not spoil you for it, but it should be some light in the movies, though nothing but darkness, but nothing. Even photography is horrible - at the end of the cold, damp and miserable ice cream, snow appears. <br /> <br /> As you know, the film has a happy ending. What a relaxing experience!
