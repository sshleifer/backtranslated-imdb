I saw this movie without knowing anything before. The land was lost with huge gaps in the data. The "logical battle" in the film did not seem to me. Actors talked only about the mouth, and sometimes they forced me to squeeze my teeth as they groaned. Life could not predict except homo erotic scenario (I'm not homophobic, but I'm physically ill for my ankle), and even the end was predictable. The detective told Jude Law everything in a suit, fraudulent dread, terrible dental work, and a hairdresser's face, all pointing to a disguise. The whole movie felt like a waste of time in my life. This movie, like Jude Law and Michael Caine, puppet show and felt like a window to make the house look like a show, in my opinion, it really mounts.
