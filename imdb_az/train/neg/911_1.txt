This should be one of the worst Swedish movies. <br /> <br /> It is ashamed of allowing such a bad script to be transformed into a film and shown in cinemas as of 2006. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a very visible sponsorship product in one and the same movie. That should not be an open thing. <br /> <br /> Some well-known actors do not even think of such a film. Before watching the movie, I was sure that if I respect some of the well-known actors in this movie, she has already been convinced. <br /> <br /> I've heard that this video will be a follow-up movie and I do not understand how this is possible.
