The shape of the film has a shocking shock. Surprises, twists and queues, reverse and excitement. Sometimes this is really a "groom" movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> its character does not stay in one place. I refuse to "spoil" the film, but it will only say who we are in the beginning of the character we are facing. <br /> <br /> The second big disappointment of the film is a bloody slasher movie, with little bit of it. There is a slight difference between this and "The 13th film on Friday." <br /> <br /> Although the movie has a magnificent Sean Connery, it does not even fit its usual standard, and it often seems just browsing through the windows.
