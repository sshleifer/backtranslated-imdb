I believe that this is a filmmaker I love so much of this inert, indifferent and badly-directed film. LADY and DUKE (and no other words, "impatience") continued the experience, left me in a bad mood, just released by reading the IMDb user comment on ali-112. Rohmer was not only in the 18th century trying to look the world through the genre of France (but with success), but as we mentioned above, the two classes of class consciousness and the revolution were inspired by the unpleasant elite women of his time. The director has achieved a difficult thing, but I'm asking if he or she is worth the effort to do so, or the dull results of his work.
