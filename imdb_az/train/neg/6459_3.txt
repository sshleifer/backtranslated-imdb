Such a big disappointment of gamers. Marlon Brando plays and is terrifying, the movie is not funny, a subliminal message "A DAMN CRAP!", "IT AND GOOD!", "SEND YOUR FRIEND" and so on. It's simply disgusting and irksome. In addition to foolish schemes, there is a sense of humor, something else. Decorating rooms, colors. It makes me sick, everything is so colorful that can cause epilepsy. Generally, I do not care about the decoration of the film, but I was frustrated by this "Free Money". Avoid all costs! "Free Money" - probably for Charlie Sheen, Sutherland and Brando, but a spectator does not get anything! One is following with foolishness.
