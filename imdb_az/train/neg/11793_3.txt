Deep Shock plays as a television movie: the whole cast of commercial actors is more than just a lively and technical, political jargon and ideas to be a "bad guy" <br /> <br /> I checked the movie for the celebrities I love seeing hammers taking care of their designs in these cheap pictures) and I was disappointed because I was alive. The creatures in the box are not the only one in the film. The actors I expected because of the type of movie (not really quite common and have not gone through a certain point). The music was a typical, unpretentious action of symphonic music. <br /> <br /> I liked the design of computers and technical equipment along with the mini-sub design. <br /> <br /> This movie is up to 3/4. <br /> <br /> This movie is a 3/10 star IMO. The North Pole and the killing and destruction mission to protect these creatures are nude bare. Even the lamer is tagged-on love affair between the two characters you do not see coming. Be able to have a movie that tries to make your career guitar player and video. Please do not worry.
