This film has not been for a bit more testing the Jason (Herb) Evers station. Many early reviewers of the Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifuna of proving that. However, as they saw more critics, they saw it purposefully. Jason Evers is not obviously Toshiro Mifune, and that's exactly what it's about. Most actors in B classics were pretty good actors, negative Evers and showgirls. If you watch this movie, Evers says that they almost shouted every single line, that is, he smoked up and smoked his nose to cool air. <br /> <br /> In some films, special effects were parallel to this B movie. In the night, in my opinion, there is not much to do for this movie as good or bad.
