This movie was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was a kind of recurring, but then again, it is not really. I was very disappointed with Tim Burton's tools. He had a great makeup and existence of CGI and a lot of money ($ 100 million), but was it just as good as the original movie that we got less than $ 6 million? Heck no. In this regard, the film is unsuccessful. At least in the original film, the statue of freedom scene shocked, but in this film there was nothing shocking, as it is possible to see it. By the way, if you think, I also understand that you can determine the end. <br /> <br /> If this movie was on the line of the first film and accepted part of the "Planet", this movie would be bright and entertaining. Apeks ". <br /> <br /> An astronaut (who really should have been more than Marky Mark because he was not good enough to look at a movie, I put three boys) thought they would be another planet, not a mute), a city driven by monkeys, hunted, some good monkeys, some ruins, discovering that they are earthly. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> But, in my opinion, this film could have been more, but Tim Burton knows how to make a really good thing. Think about what's happening with the Batman series, which tells the story of an ugly filmmaker, and she's thinking about fashion, she's gonna be good, sorry, but no, it would be better and more satisfying was
