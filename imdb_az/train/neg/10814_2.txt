As a fan of "Jane Eyre", I was thrilled when this movie came out. "Finally, I thought that someone would actually make this book a movie by watching the story written by the author." Wrong! Of course, if the casting director intends to make a name for Jane, he has succeeded. But, of course, he could have found someone to act. Where is the tension between Jane and Rochester? What was the strange blend of the novel when Rose did not appear anywhere in the night? Where is the sparkle of a child who resembles his dance and dance? Finally, why has the plot changed in the end? The scenario is actually a miracle that reads the book. What a disappointment
