"A Guy Thing", "There's Something about Mary" or "Getting to Know Parents", but these two movies are more extinguished than refusing the cutting room. <br /> <br /> In some cases, I hired a rental fee of 5 days. Because I could not sit for more than 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> The presentation is good and I like the scenes that are automatically covered for other kids. Paul's mistakes (the supervisor was great at Save-Mart), but writing was completely terrible. The dialogue makes most of the time and when you think things are not going to go anyway, some unnecessary glances are inevitable for any reason. <br /> <br /> There are also people who struggle with violence in the Caucasus. It's so bad that I love Julia Stiles (I've hated him), but that did not help me to sit down on this terrible movie. Once again, you have to rent your dollars and go to rent "Something about Mary".
