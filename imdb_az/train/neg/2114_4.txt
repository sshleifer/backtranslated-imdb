It's not easy to look at and fix the sets, and there's no budget for this project. Perhaps Bela Lugosi is meant to overcome such thoughts. Young brides died on the altar after saying "I am". Their elderly elderly wife, Elizabeth Russell, is a well-known mountaineer who needs injections for the young girls' permanent fluids to remain eternally young. Lorenz (Lugosi) and a few freaky minions were stolen. A respected local controversial reporter (Luana Walters) realizes that every missing bride has entered the same orchid altar; An orchid that Lorenzin will give you most. A typical horror movie storm barrier is a bit strange when traveling to Lorenz's property; especially with a dwarf and a friction hunchback on the base. Other players: Angelo Rossitto, Tristram Coffin, Minerva Urecal and Frank Moran.
