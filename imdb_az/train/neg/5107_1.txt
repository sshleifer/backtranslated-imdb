This show has a less inflated version than the US version. The recipient will receive a new kitchen or perhaps a bedroom and a bathroom, and how thankful he is for them. The US version of this show is the lack of truth television. The whole house is being reconstructed, instead of making a few improvements to a home that the invaders can not afford or can not do. This show will show if you want to show that there is a bad system of freedom in America or if you are begging for it. Especially the most likely product placement by Sears is not required. Having made a family a potential millionaire, it would be better to help a better society than to divide a family, where to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in a house, build a whole community ..... maybe the diy and power tools can borrow and a place to return with building materials to help everyone benefit. Allowing one person to remain in the home can still cause great dissatisfaction among the rest of the local community living in the same home refuge.
