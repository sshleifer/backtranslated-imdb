He is so pitiful and terrible, but the worst thing is that detectives can not stop all the detective programs, such as wooden and dirty. What happened to detective programs with true mystery?

I wish to put more bbc bbc1 cos more comedy, now there is more space for this crap that ended with the bottom of the bottom.
