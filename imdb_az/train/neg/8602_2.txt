About this movie you really need to know that after a drop-down, a man is dropped from the lake and eaten. Then they start issuing loans titled: "Slugs!" In a big letter, shortly after "The Movie". NO! It was a coincidence that I was logged into the "Slugs: The Musical" or "Slugs: The Game Show". Anyway, the film is turned into a murder fest. A boy cut his hand because he had glasses with gloves, two men were attacked by slippers, and a girl who was back in the underground passage was killed by killer swords. This is a film that is falling into the category of "bad-it-good". In 1988 (my prediction of 1974), this film was shocked to be shocked to learn. I was so surprised that we got a high score as here, because most of the people here do not love any of these films. But if you are trying to be sad, but want a laughing movie, this is one of your main competitors.
