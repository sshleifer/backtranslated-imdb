Very ridiculous little boogers that create foams and multiply themselves. So far, this movie has elements of fear. The rest of Munchika is a really foolish comedy for about 15 minutes, so no longer can find something funny. Small children can imagine contrasts for these small boogers, but adults will be abandoned by "smart" references that translate things like Capt only. STAR TREK, ET is the most well-known scene, "Let's make a success in GREMLINS," an open statement from filmmakers! and cutting off a cardboard from Clint Eastwood ... what does he say to us? The last one has completely disappeared from me ... Oh yes, removing chemical waste in the caves seems to be a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The Munich is the most difficult movie to sit on. It's really really dumb. <br /> <br /> You can look at some of the movies. <br /> <br /> In some cases, yes, only the "dumb", "delayed" and "ridiculous" are the criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and, well, uhm, 6/10.
