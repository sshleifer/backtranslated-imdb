Everyone who has watched a few lifetime film network films is the first thing that goes beyond the plan's transparency plan. Thus, when the torn Lara Patti's house went home, he began to take homeowners methodically and did not break. When Lara finally stopped her activity to threaten poor Patti, and banned her from doing something about it, I just ran to my head. People at Planet LMN see that people are unable to act for any reason, simply doing so to continue their actions. Only Planet could have owned a house that was thrown out of his house by some of the attractive forces at LMN! Poor Patti - he just trusted, and Lara left his drug, and then, with a syringe filled with deadly stuffing into his stomach, this great fight on the stairs and an object bag turned out to be the front door. Horror! <br /> <br /> But take me away, this Planet LMN product is classic. Once you have to watch, you will only have great laughs. Improvisibility Scale 95/100 for this movie. Become a big popcorn party and get some apple slices. You will understand later.
