At first, animals have emotions. If you do not already know it, then I believe that you are terrified. But think of none of us as being morally upset. We all know that animals have emotions and we want to see how these feelings are in nature now. <br /> <br /> Instead, it's a tedious and ridiculously easy-to-use documentary that tells us how animals are. "human". Cinematographers search high and low levels for images of animals dealing with human behavior, and when it happens, "This monkey is almost human!" They say. <br /> <br /> Everything is human. They spend a lot of time on the theory of things that make them smile, but once they say what a wave well is. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Even in human clothing, they will not go for chimpanzee wearing chimp and cowboy hat. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for a deep documentary film of animals. I would like to learn how animals behave in their own language. Instead, researchers return to pedantic, anthropomorphic observations and assumptions. <br /> <br /> Add poems and chimpanzees that celebrate "Christmas Feast" and this was enough to open my mouth. <br /> <br /> But it does not end there. Half of this documentary is filmed in labs and experimental sites. All sugar cameras pass through steel sticks and we see that these monkeys are concentrated in sterile concrete cages. <br /> <br /> A monkey in captivity says in the sign language: "I want to hurry." Unusual references are "stress tests" and tremendous psychological experiments to imagine. Baby monkeys are separated from their mothers after birth, and wire dolls are provided to prove that the baby monkeys want "mother figure". After 40 years of experimentation, experienced researchers feel themselves behind their bright results: monkeys have emotions. <br /> <br /> Since 1966, a chimpanzee named "Washoe" is in a concrete cage and remains so far. We tend to tackle against a concrete wall with its very terrible expression of a short imagination (one more bars through it). Personally, there is no need to see any other experimental information. Washoe, I apologize for all kinds.
