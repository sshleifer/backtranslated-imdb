I was very surprised at how bad this movie was. Beautiful cinematography and beautiful scenes can only shoot up to date. I hope the heroine is replicated, but this is much worse. <br /> <br /> This film has a bad reputation for kung fu movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is so dull and heartfelt, because it reminds you because it is a very sad and frustrating thing. Trying to play a game with a child. You always think of a sense of intelligent fighting, and they invade another funny twist that does not mean anything ("Oh yeah, you just took me with super powers and 10,000 ray guns, but I ate my plutonium-tied vitamins and teflon, installations do not work, and I'm not aggressive towards your super powers .... do not touch any trade.) Can children keep going with this restraint because they really do not want it? Everyone listens for an enjoyable time. Note for Kung Fu filmmakers: (a) If your knife is a knife for you, however, see, for the VIEWER, is especially worse than a fight with an adult viewer, this long film is a malicious boiler. <br /> <br /> If the SPOILERS AHEAD is not in the PCP, the kung fu is not strong, b) If you hit the back with a knife several times, it will cause more damage and more damage. (c) when you are stabbed in the heart with a knife, especially in old china, where you are not in a Kaiser Permanente around the corner, (d) kung fu fights do not last for hours <br /> <br /> In any case, watch the hero again at least in their small world this is understandable.
