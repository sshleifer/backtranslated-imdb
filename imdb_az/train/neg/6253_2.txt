It is not a very good film, but it is quite accurate to describe torture techniques. The aim of the film was to show the cruelty of the NK POW camps, and this was done with striking fidelity in a fairly efficient way. Although technical flaws (and much more) exist, they see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some bad things - even worse, because it's not in the Gulf of Guinea, but in the Gulf of Guant√°namo. <br /> <br /> I do not think that any Korean veteran has been tortured when I go to the office, and watch movies like this and Pork Chop Hill compared to Vietnamese films. As you know, 54-year-olds are interested in the Second World War Concepts (boys tend to behave very cleverly) or appear to be in the same system after 16 years of war or whatever. Draw movies like "Go Spartans Tell Tell".
