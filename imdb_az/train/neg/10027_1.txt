In this film, Sunny bhai got up on the night of Qadr. Akshay Kumar, along with Spiderman and Superman, has the power of Leonidus in Neo's 300 in Matrix. It's funny. Besides the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy, I do not see anything positive in this movie. The story looks like the writer wants to write to a 10-year-old boy. The film is at least erroneous by the filmmaker Anil Kapoors shot by a shotgun. Except for the filmmakers, there is no other Tasan in this movie. I'm sorry to waste my money on this movie, and I do not recommend it to anyone. At least I would give zero if I could give 1/10 IMDb.
