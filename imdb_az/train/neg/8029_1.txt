a friend bought it (very cheap) and decided to present me as a birthday. I thought I would never watch it because it was a joke and the cover of the DVD seemed sad, but then my friends and I was really bored and looked. from beginning to end! I know very well, but in fact it is a work. it is difficult to describe. you must see that people believe that they are creative and intelligent, and they are a real lesson for what they can do because they are not actually. The "detective" sous-terrain (actually the "leading lady" can laugh in some situations, it's definitely the worst). It's stupid to summarize "story" and really sucked everything in this movie. Please pay special attention to "Sheriff". this man is great and there is absolutely no excuse for that. it's too bad. No matter what happens, there are some fun moments. Check, haha
