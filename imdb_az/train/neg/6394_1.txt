This movie was bad. This movie was terrible. The player was bad. The setting was unreal. The story was absurd: once a once-in-a-comet appears one night. Most of the world's population decided to follow this comet. The following morning, a few people selected by the radios of the comet turned out to be clean. People's clothes are still stable, there are still living plants, but people have become clean. There are no bones, nothing. It's strange. <br /> <br /> How can radiation harm people, but does not leave their clothes and other biological substances? <br /> <br /> It is better that the comet has turned some people into zombie meat monsters. Their makeup would not have frightened the newborn child. <br /> <br /> Insane Clown Posse has frightened me and they should look foolish. <br /> <br /> Then there were survivors. When the comet crossed, people surrounded by steel were expelled from the zombie and the death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <br /> <br /> Draws a movie and wants to shoot your television. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film is that two Valley Girls and Chakotay Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were completely non-existent. Whom would it be raining on the day of an apocalypse with eating meat mutants everywhere? The entire movie had four-minute horror scenes and most of them dreams. Among these scenes, South Park is an informal, seemingly informal dialogue. The silence between the elementary dialogue was painful. I could have made a better movie with four monkeys and a Gangster bag. Never watch this movie.
