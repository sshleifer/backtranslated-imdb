First of all, we can say that the first 20 minutes are large, the monster may look superior and CGI is considered acceptable. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <div> this movie is anti-American we can see that usually such stereotyping will not disturb me (we can get enough of Britson's Hollywood) but Americans are not slimming about brain dead morons. <br /> <br /> Because Yankee directors have harassed her mother, you left the realm and wondered. <br /> <br /> The sad scene was really poor, and it was part of the film that had taken place. <br /> <br /> Here, we get acquainted with the palace cousin, whose memory is included in the memory of Olympic medalist Auntie and his father, who has been charged with murdering his daughter, and then everyone hits her before she starts crying in her mouth. <br /> <br /> The whole virus crisis is ridiculous. If Americans know they do not have a virus, why do they explore time, money, and resources? <br /> <br /> The US government's agent orders the innocent Korean brain to be drunk because Americans appear to be bad (or stupid). > About film monster hunting. The US and Korean special forces are determined to find vitality, even though they are outside the invisible film. The only people who hunt for Korea are, in Korea, the ultimate home to the day, and some casual tramp! Of course, several US / Korean agents try to stop them along the way. <br /> <br /> His sister was only included in the movie, so she could eventually make life shootings. It was a clich√©, you knew it would happen, but you feel so bad that it upsets everyone! and my last concern is how this child survived the end of heaven. for about 5 minutes, the monster was flooded! Why did the wolf never eat children first?
