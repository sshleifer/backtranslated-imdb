Why am I watching this 1.5 hour of my life? Why did this movie make it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A writer I can not figure out who this movie is. maybe after throwing a pickle, a BODY, SOMEWHERE followed it and revealed a meaning of it. It's incompatible, it's not experimental, it's flat and straightforward. The film is not a plot line, you think you're just something, it's not good ... <br /> <br /> The latter has brought a bit of end to the movie (not meant), and I think the viewer can see what happens. I do not think I'll put my spoilers here, but it's not important. This film should miss the world in another movie.
