There are three films in this animated style that I remember with kindness from my youth. This film is called "The Last Unicorn", "Dragons Flight" and "Hobbit". I also have "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both are perfect) and have not seen the "Last Unicorn" for more than a decade. It was up to now and I did not want it anymore. The most disturbing script I am. It was pretty stunning and often believing. Things will not happen for no reason, and other things will happen without explanation. We do not just talk about small things; we talk about basic foundations! The story itself is not a big thing to start with, but it may have worked if it was worth it. Not even close. Moreover, the music was terrible! I do not know that in such films, music is rarely said to be classic, but the music of this movie wanted to knock me unconscious with a bowling ball. This is one of my films that I will show my children one day, but it was just cut. I do not think I can still sit with that purple feast. The dreamer puts it softly.
