Doris Day lets you get it down in a bad script. Even in the most exploitative conditions, it lasts 100% during the day and usually goes out of the wound. This comedy breaks down in 1965 a real-life New York City, but actually gives little to Doris adapted by French play in the late 50s, but actually violates his kindness, and the second half is excited (excited with excitement) The reason is that it's funny). There are some funny lines here, but the material has been dropped out of the game ... and some fun stuff inside Big Apple instead of a duck, we were trapped around. Doris's co-stars (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse and Terry-Thomas) do not fit in to her and they are not without hair loss. Perhaps this is not terrible, has some great laughs and is a must-see for Day-buffs. ** from ****
