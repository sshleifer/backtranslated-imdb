Forest is just an ordinary standard of slasher / backwoods fur, but also an interesting blend of unusual elements. The story is about two pairs of jungles on a camping trip. Living in a cave, the trees of life, and the spirits of his dead wife and two children, soon turned them into a terror. Every slasher has something you can not see. Director Don Jones is just "middleweight", with the exception of Jeanette Kelly, the dead partner of Michael Brody aka Gary Kent, despite the fact that the film is flat on every level. /> <br /> The film opens with some beautiful shooting of a valley and several hikes within a forest. People delay that some look like one another. These are typically sent to the slasher tariff. <br /> <br /> When you stay, a reliable hunting knife is used throughout the film, and even a flashback time when performing a gloves, pitchfork and rusty knife to send a cheating spouse to your lover. <br /> <br /> Forest has a good story line, the movie just does not work with it, I just found it pretty boring with a terrifying toy. 4/10
