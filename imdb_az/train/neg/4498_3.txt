The striking little semi-attractive, but challengingly charming. Still, two or three funny moments. What surprised me is how skilful and morally suspicious McNicol is. She plays a defective (foot problem), but she is not just an "ugly duckling" who is not afraid of men, even a man who eats and we need to feel for her! Oh, the poor little McNicol, with his foot problem ... Poor little McNicol! She constantly gets in touch with men and even drain them long before they blink! At one time she even had a nightly job with a messy studio, and then the newly found French girl friend says she took quite a bit of time to get her emotions! Everyone wants to shoot at him, but he is surprised at how rigorous he is. Well, almost everyone; The person working on the phone is the only person who is angry after he has touched his foot with metal. But otherwise, she treats men with goodness! No shyness, no luck in men, and throws them as toys; She was ridiculous at the way Carradine threw. Poor little flawed girl? I do not think so. But we believe that this woman is a great confidence problem; so he is preparing to play a flute for a solo concert, and in some way tries to put the notes down for nervous breakdown. Nervousness ?? The rest of the film shows that there is little or nothing in it that there are problems with trust, because the flute scene is absurd and does not fit into the bigger picture. I was also surprised at the speed and ease with which McNicol is friendly with a French woman who accustomed to a married boy. On the surface the film looks like a "synthesis story" of a fight for the reception of a woman (or something like that), but nothing is wrong; <br /> <br /> This writer is surprised to find such a movie and "something moving - movie of the 80s". <br /> <br /> Up to his feet: his fat, purple balloon, growing in the calf's muscle. He has a normal "normal" appearance on the lower leg of his leg, so the creators of the film try to show it as a woman Quasimodo or something. the beginning of the movie. It is not like the twin head that grows from his neck! Even though McNicol is a tremendous catch. <br /> <br /> But what is Carradine, McNicol and her (relatively) soft guy who is flirting with her? This man was a revenge of the Nard! But I think it's the same thing with Carradines as it is with Kennettis in the movie: no matter how ugly, how ugly and dumb you are, all the doors are open to film and politics. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus
