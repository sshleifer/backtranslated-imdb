Probably Spoiler, Maybe. I say "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst films ever. First of all, the movie was designed at Disney's later height. It was created at the same time as The Little Mermaid II, The Jungle Book II, and Peter Pan II, all of which were against their original film classics. (Disney also created "Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II", but I'll leave this topic because original films are not classic works first). "I'm a supporter of good Disney films and I'm totally the original Disney Cinderella." Cinderella " Cinderella was original and kind, and the new Cinderella had a lot of characteristic moments with her fragments of the present epoch, like "I will continue my way this feast!" This new Cinderella (I "Ewww" says that I am trying to find the best of people, not Anti-Cinderella, but later, Anastasia, is one of the best steps! Why? They all made it to be like Lady Tremaine and Drizella, poor little Anastasia just terrible family members sia My question to the world: People in Disney were following this post Is it true that it is not really like this, but it is an insult to Anastasia Cinderella, like Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I give it to everyone's help and forgiveness, but this film has nothing to do with Anastasiya. First, Anastasia was bad. Secondly, he is good. One can not leave such a story. Hopefully, Disney knows that this movie is the name of Walt Disney, among other films. Maybe you are now going to Michael Eisner, everything will begin to be formed around the Mouse House.
