Believe it or not, this movie is worse than the number, the action is worse, and the story is too weak. Not a good thing about this movie. The scenes of war were softer than the three numbers and I thought it was not possible. This is very slow 90 minutes. In fact, you really want to see this movie. It's hard to find a cheap rental it.it (for, that is) and probably for good reason. The third issue is that this movie has nothing to do with the first two.it. I can give you the best: without warning 2/10
