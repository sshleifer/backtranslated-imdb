Marky Mark is recalled by a flat woman who prefers chimpanzee touch after appearing in the fire without showing the characteristic dresses. <br /> <br /> The boats of the ship with genetic experiences in monkeys, pulling out of the Saturn orbit space station for no apparent reason. To carry out these experiments we need to travel about 1300 million kilometers to Saturn? The special effects group decides it. <br /> <br /> Marky's chimpanzee has disappeared in Time Warp in the 60s fantasy film movie. Then, Marky pointed out that the cosmic station is not considering the security of mind-boggling, while stealing a section without anybody's notice and at deploying a deep earth rescue mission to a worm pit for a spent test chimpanzee, limited fuel and oxygen supply by a million dollars. <br /> <br /> Before anyone could say "Meaningless Remake" before Marky fell on a planet, went into the worm pit and took the helmet without thinking of the atrocity of the atmosphere. Surprise! <br /> <br /> Marks Mark has come to show his pecs, because this APES is pursuing - or at least no one would have been surprised that no one had ever seen Ape Planet three years ago. <br /> <br /> Take off her trousers, or burn a smart white rap, she was characteristic. Michael Clarke Duncan's gorilla teeth have been greatly helped to prevent his * character from being crooked. Helena Bonham-Carter (aka irritating chimp activist), without a Shakespeare script, was a wonderful job like Marky and Clarke's many Cardboard Cutout. Orangutan slave trader Paul Giamatti has given the role of funny relief and interspecies klutz. Though I have been able to increase hearing ability about this film, a research title "re-imagines" the essence of the Apes Planet: "The Roses Of Apes". First of all, as Iran has been looking at Millions of Millions or Greystoke years, Tim Roth, like the Champagne Thade, has massive d√©cor and thoroughly throws kaka. It was as fun as the psychodic Thadean described, there was no behavioral character in his character: Thade, the first time we met ... crazy ... and at the same level of evidence at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The original character of POTA (1968), Taylor of Charlton Heston, had been left without any regrets on the ground from the accident scene. found himself locked in a fight to prove the value of humanity as a single champion! The original film was, nevertheless, a humiliating tale: Taylor had to understand that his kind was not the winner when he found the Statue of Liberty. Is there anything cerebral or ironic for Marky Mark's Leo? Or Roth's Thade? <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; people and monkeys in this movie they fell into one another, degenerated into the Cave, and allowed the monkeys to speak and to pick up a sensitive body armor, the monkeys to inherit the planet! Marky Mark, indeed, comes from anthropocentric arrogance, giving people just because they are apex predators. "In 2001, she was naked like a apes, complaining:" People evolved from APES? "<br /> <br /> Heston did not dump at POTA in 1968, because he was Muntezan, Michelle, Musa. a silent, loose animal in an outer society was to shake the listener's expectations: How can a world where our people can not respect Charlton's respect? Marky Mark has just found that he has a very tight dress. <br /> <br /> Heston The monkey board was constantly humiliated, although it manages the screen with its own charisma and spectacular exaggeration. Marky Mark, an unexpected boy at school, suddenly becomes a class monitor when the mongoloid tries to get embarrassed in people, and you stop pulling the penis on the board and throw a shoe on it. Burton tries to raise Marky as a symbol of humanity, but it seems like a deviant deviant. In the original film, monkeys regard Taylor as deviant, yet to the audience and monkeys, was a symbol of humanity. This is a recurring irony. <br /> <br /> Heston - the father of the primo scene of this game, Thaddeus Roth. Roth's apron father, Charlton, said to his people that this time he was against his enemies: "Let them curse!" The sound of the film is heard and dropped to the end When Thaddeus teaches an ass to beat Marky, "The monkeys are betrayed by worshiping these unknown creatures," said Marky, "and teach these monkeys to evolution." First, they are apes, not monkeys! Secondly, the monkeys are not evolutionary, but genetic interference and imbecilic evidence. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that Lassergun intends to teach them with a secret laserergey, not evolution, but proud. <br /> <br /> The end of the twist is only for the audience, Estella Warren the role of half-neck in fact <br /> <br /> He is the ultimate source of humanity's lasting hope In the end, the police monkey took Marky to Plot Point Prison, where he heard the last time, "This is a madhouse! A MADHOUSE !! ... '
