Irish critics have narrated this film. It was dubbed for every Irish film that was written by a group of Irish actors. Horrible writing, mandatory quirk (brown sauce). Emotionalize everything that is bad about Dublin. 'Oh, this is a rash, but sure, but it's not so good'. Many passwords for American viewers (supermarket manager and his frightening compulsory trail). The nail in the coffin was Colm Meaney's character. A great actor forced him to play because he could write it five years ago. Severe things. The best thing about this movie is Farrell and it's a bad thing to say. Well, at least, his fearsome American emphasis. An international audience should be warned: stay home and follow Snatch and Lock Foundation. You will have a better time. Behind the back is something beyond walking
