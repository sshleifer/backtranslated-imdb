Witchy Hildegard Knef perpetuates a group of people in an isolated hotel and carries them to each other in a twisted, disgusting way. I saw an unsuccessful person here, crucified, and I saw his head up to fire. Hildy is also a very prankster: she takes nagging harpy and closes her mouth ... then hangs in the chimney for a shooting fling in the drowning! "Witchery" made me sick. It damaged my eyes. I'm ready to write it as the worst movie ever made by other competent people ... until the final. I must admit that I liked the end. It has a fantastic tape recorder featuring a boy and shaded by his tape Blair. The scene only takes about one minute and the movie is over, but you say the old one: "If you reach a big end, people will forgive you for something!"
