Wow, how much is left! People think that this movie is scary, ridiculous. Special effects were the direct disassembly of the Ring. Story? Does anyone have it? Not in my opinion ... Only a very striking look. The whole movie was dull, stupid and mixed. There are always markets for bad movies with good marketing campaigns. But this is the worst horror film I have ever seen. And the buffy chick? Well, that's a bad actress! Barbie is like plastic and talented .. No, wait, Barbie will be an insult to your talents! I suppose that many children have helped this movie in the box office as well as in PG-13, and when R was evaluated IMO would be a bomb! Stupid movie!
