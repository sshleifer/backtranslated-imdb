this show is one of the worst shows of all time! definitely no original joke and they are always late for one year. As in 2009, they will eventually say something about Michael Vick's itfights. all members are people who want to be SNL, but they have to go down the lowest, terrible tv. An hour's insane magazine is not funny to start with the joke witch, the bees whom John Stewart wants by the terrible. If you have any problems, I'm glad to hear the comments of 3 people watching this show. Osama bin Laden hid in the same place that no one was invisible and hidden television.
