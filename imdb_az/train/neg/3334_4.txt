When I was a teenager she was afraid of paradise. Now I think it's more fun than scary, but with some unpleasant moments and some sort of sleazy quality that's unique to me. And to think about, the plot is really disgusting ... but it's some sort of taste. If there is a problem with this movie, there are bigger gaps that are not exciting or interesting. Also, the end goes on forever, Barbara Bach, with a potentially intense peak, shouts and screams for some time. Unfortunately, after the "monster" exposure, it is not very scary. The slightly funny look of the movie is also facing this, and it looks like a television movie rather than a movie made for cinema. But this is an example of films that are rarely on the agenda, so watching the fans of fear and feeling a bit nostalgia ...
