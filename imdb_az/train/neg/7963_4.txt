I'm a great admirer of old horror films, and since 1960, when I was old, a movie made before the 1970s was made in the 1960s until 1920. I'm not the admirer of a more modern horror movies, except one, thought Creepshow 1. I remember stories there, but I really liked the monster with Hal Holbrook in the box and it was a great deal about a really clean man. All stories were good though. Why did I like them so much? The heroes had a good development, it was clear that the mistakes were good and who was bad, the fears of fear drew a fearful face and the funny bits were really funny! There are no or nothing in the future! Because the film is full of time, I've watched it partially and put it off to make other things like IMDb.com, lol. When George Kennedy and former Dorothy Lamoure received an invoice, he said something ..... from 4 to 10. Romero's experience is hard to find here, they tell him a ton of PG standards, I know how valuable this is, but PG seems to me), and that's not a good thing for a movie that's not something else. To see your death (yuck yuck), you will be shown on the Encore cable channel.
