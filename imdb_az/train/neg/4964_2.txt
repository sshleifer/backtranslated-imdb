This movie is a fancy! Names have become outdated and everything has become something that is not recognized by the literary writer. Beowulf has a skin to give a ridiculous gun / lightning gun. Beowulf does not need such a weapon! With his bare hands, Grendel's arm slips away! I do not believe that scenarists did such a thing. However, the way Grendel described is an impressive situation. This is the only positive momentum of cast and cast. My English language teacher would have been crazy if she saw this disgust. If you are not a hero of the epic poem "Beowulf", avoid it in any way. And even then, I do not recommend it.
