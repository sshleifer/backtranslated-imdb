It is hard to believe that this book can succeed in frustrating it! The area is very subtle and incredible. . . starting with putting a ton of tricks on a small child that protects her pain! Then everywhere there are at least six and perhaps more people involved (including clerics) involved in involving any offense. At the next ferry-boat, he has a wife who is very short on his tracks and is happier compared to his wife. Many unpleasant and coo coo mom, supported by a politically upright group of friends, supported and supported! Still, the story did not help, despite the fact that an island beyond the coast of South Carolina helped the filmmakers budget. The monastery buildings were very beautiful buildings that did not look like a small island that needed a small ferry service to make sense of unreasonable golf carts. Kim Basinger, who loves me, is painfully gentle in this film, and his hairstyle is, of course, another ten years. And there is no chemistry for anyone with it and men's potential. I did not like the book taken from this book, and I read it all. The film I was looking forward to had to leave the saxophone music very often. If you do not have an incredible story, it is my advice to mix a wood-moving, religious / mythological / allegory mixture. Oh and maybe a small criticism is critical, but would a caring father give a little jacket to a small child in a small boat? This is the best scene in the film
