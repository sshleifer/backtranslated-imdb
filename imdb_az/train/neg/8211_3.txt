I read Heinrich Harrer's book "7 Years in Tibet" and I was amazed at it. then the DVD caught instantly and started watching the movie. I remember the first time I saw it in 98, and I liked it very much. Now I have watched a complete study of the book I took from him. <br /> <br /> When he entered Lhasa, folk languages ​​began to erase their mouths, and Thewlis and Pitt told him to create an impression in Tibet for saluting. Harrer, of course, is a sign of absolute grace and loyalty in Tibet and the ability to do so in the face of Dalai Lama, but for those two Europeans! not just his mother, but even Dalai Lama himself had bottles in the public. Harrer's book says that nobody in Tibet was wearing glasses at that time (forgot why they forgot, but also in the book). The young Dalai Lama did it, but alone and nobody saw him! and on the Mao tse tung lookalike, destroy the mandala in front of a young "live buddha"? childhood ... and tailor, Harrer, and Aufschnaiter are Tibetan garments of European designer suits! is it not entirely important to fill many events that are really excluded from the story, simply by the absolute love interests (female tailor ...)? All story about Harrers's son, rolf. The book does not describe a word about a family member or any family member. but "Tibetan 7 years" harrers is not a book about a person because it was good for me. About Tibetan. I was very disappointed with this "adaptation" of the famous book. and heinrich harrer also bet ... 3 stars, only for cinematography.
