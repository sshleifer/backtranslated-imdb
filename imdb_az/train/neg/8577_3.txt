In my summary, I knew they would take you. What is this movie like Pet Rock and Disco? Yes, during the 1970s or the late 80s, probably everyone wants a New Coke or a Pet Rock (and frankly, I do not understand if at least Pet Rocks)). They were just a few things that seemed reasonable at that time, but the younger generation became clear. We can say the same for Kay Kyser and his team. At that time (in the 1940s) was very popular and studied with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in the studio. However, if you did not live then (well before my time), you are surprised that everyone likes this kind of "fun". After all, Kyser and his team of friends are incredibly negative and their humor is very wide (ie, novice and cheesy). Certainly, I could not stop their ants, and I have admired that there are many musical numbers in the film. Due to these factors, a back seat has been greatly supported, and fans of these players will probably be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Kyser and the group live in a film with a young lady and her unreasonable Aunt. There once bridges werehed and strange events started. Finally, Sallyin showed a bit of effort and effort (some species). <br /> <br /> In some films, this film is not a heroic film, despite filming. Like a Lugosi and a Carloff fan, I feel crushed from having to follow Kyser and his knuckleheads.
