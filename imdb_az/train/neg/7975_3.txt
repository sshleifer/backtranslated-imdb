When I sat in front of a television watching movie, I thought, "Oh, Alfred Hitchcock, even Brian DePalma could do it!" There are luck. It starts with intrigueing. Los Angeles, a British park rescuer (Collin Firth) marries a beautiful, dark brother (Lisa Zane), who recently met in the park. One day, she was disrupted once. Police can not find any documents and Firth is searching for it. So far so good. Just as he declined to give up, he returned to his best friend, Billy Zane, in LA's drug, nightclubs and ametuer filmmaking, and then in the history of his mental instability. At this point, Firth's life is in danger and the film falls apart. None of the characters from Lisa Zein's past are far from interesting. The film is moving slowly and there is little movement. There is a subpot associated with missing narcotics, but this is not just a throw. There is no chase, no fuss sequence, and no tension. Many conversations with some dull beatings and boring symbols. It should be noted that Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brothers and siblings, but do not appear on any stage together. Until the end of the film, there's a tear in your mind about what can happen and what you're trying to stay awake.
