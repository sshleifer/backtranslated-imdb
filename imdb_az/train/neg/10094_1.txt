Mt's little sister and I buffs self-declared horror movies. EVERYTHING, especially about zombie flips. Now we've seen a good zombie movie and a lot of bad. This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life by FAR. Only acting was terrible, but special effects, graphics and "zombie" makeup were the worst I've ever seen. Even if you name it makeup (eye shadow around the eyes), this is entirely evidence that you never judge with the cover of a book. The reason for covering the film is just a sweet thing. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would spend a good movie night in this POS movie, which was so biased about this movie that went to the film to stop filming that film, "This movie sucks, do not waste your time, do not waste your time" by putting a sticky note inside the movie! I did not even know how much he appreciated, it should be negative
