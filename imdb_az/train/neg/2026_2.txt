There was such a rumor about the game show with Bill Shatner ... and especially from Deal or No Deal and from 1 to 100 right. So, of course, everyone's demonstration of a new game impression. What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is something about the events in the Caucasus. Sitting as a dentist in a full hour ... You look at the 10-minute intervals, but only a minute passed (but it looks like eternity), and then looked at the clock face. So why did not I just pass the channel? Perhaps for the same reason most of the majority did not seem to be optimistic. I do not mean that nobody really wants Bill Shatner to think that the show really is bad. <br /> <br /> Personally, this shows William Shatner's talents from the first 15 minutes. My main complaint was that gang was dark. Tracking turned me into depression. You kept keeping a little bit of excitement, but there was none. Dear white people: People can not watch the game shows to heal their insomnia. .. watch game is exciting and shows you have a good time. Please give us a grace and lose it in the vault.
