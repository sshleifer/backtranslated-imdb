I was amazed at discovering the number of fans on this show. Friends were the best 'average' sitcom and were not as good as others have prepared. Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, let's face it, who knows how long this show will last. I'm very skeptical. Despite the advent of the series, Friends were less likely to care about the most popular faces on TV history, even though it was more difficult, reminder and boring, either with whom or with whom. And the first four seasons were sometimes funny as funny. Although the film world was Hollywood actors, I still had no difficulty adjusting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify" If the cast wants more wages, the show should be stopped immediately, in fact, as the series infiltrates, on the other hand but the actors were bigger than theirs. <br /> <br /> After the end of 2004, I was very comfortable watching this sitcom, and now we are talking about a friendly talk show on our television screens, and still, I will not wait for anyone's will .
