This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. However, the young slaves, Alice and Jared Harris, imitate Christopher Walken, who is entertaining this movie. It is strange and interesting to point out Alice's cigarettes, drinking, and dishonesty at times. I have to applaud Jared for the imitation of Christopher Walken and Christopher Walken, who allowed the movie to be in this movie.
