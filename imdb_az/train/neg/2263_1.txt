Perhaps, we can say that Jerry Springer is not expecting a film that is happening with cinematic gold, all this is a movie ... it was not so. It seemed to be a bad home movie. <br /> <br /> The film's "plan" focuses on a "low" family and "Jerry Farrelly Show" is about discussing a lot of things between a mother, daughter, stepfather and fiancee. From here, the film fizzles and is a unique experience: the development of white-trash pornography. Is Jerry and his spouse even have sexual intercourse, have sex? (Yuk!) This movie wanted me to escape from the theater and get a second circumcision. At least it was short with mercy. Disgusting and insulting. African Americans and the working class should be insulted by America. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
