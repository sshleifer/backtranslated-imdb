As usual, I was expecting a new television and movie on a subject I liked - a wonderful change from a strange acquaintance about Kursk and Stalingrad in the History Channel. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for an Enemy Enemy in Pearl Harbor and Gates - but Hollywood's evil, stupid-powered power and roughly fell on the earth - and an absolute wealth. I was also thrilled about the 'Violence Strength', especially when I heard Ian Kershaw's presence, I liked his books. <br /> <br /> "It was an academic piece of Kershaw's book," he said. <br /> <br /> "Kershaw's book was an academic piece," he said. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What is happening? Are they completely nuts? <br /> <br /> Hitler's life was impossible without an "event" - yes, two volumes of Kershav Hitler's biographies were long and detailed, but they were. <br /> <br /> "Rise of Evil" <br /> <br /> Hitler was a very bad man. He was a very bad man, he was going to LOVE Jews and we would only emphasize the truth of EVERY scene of the film if he was to miss it. <br /> <br /> There was no effort to test and explain the mood of the time, and why would Hitler consider his thoughts and strategies. There is no need to say - unlike the "Nazis - a Historic Warning", this film never showed that nearly all the leaders of Munich communists were Jews and that they painted their views on this topic. <br /> <br /> <strong> Most of the people in the Caucasus are an integral part of the Nazi era. <br /> <br /> But many things did not understand: filmmakers Go there, so I got everything we know. Of course, we do not believe in the fascinating truth that Kershaw talks about, that Hitler is directly socialist / communist after WW1. Of course, it would be very difficult for the film to be ruled out, and it even lessens the "very bad" mantra of the unfortunate. <br /> <br /> We know that he is a bad man. But we also know that he is an admirable figure both in the public speaker and in the particular case. He can be polite and even sympathetic and, of course, many Guardian have some ideas such as vegetarianism, anti-alcohol, and anti-smoking that they can agree with. <br /> <br /> He was also a brave soldier at WW1, from all my accounts. Even though we saw him with the Iron Cross, we would not see how he won it (courageous actions were not in the script, it was not necessary to say). When Sassoon, Owen, Brook, Remarque and many others find it a very attractive experience, we can not get any idea how much it has fired on the battlefield. The Jewish / Bolshevik connection is still very important to everyone's understanding of the subject when it comes to the point above. Why did he like the war very much? Why, on the contrary, despite the massive evidence, is it always a good idea? Why did not he care for his dead colleagues? <br /> <br /> Of course, there was no interest in telling this story. <br /> <br /> It is often the case that a film is a classic example of "preparing a date" and of bringing in unusual facts to master the material or to fit in with the "present" is often the lowest common denominator. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <strong> History is really about how we see the past and how to see today's color better and worse. This trash was again a great opportunity. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br />
