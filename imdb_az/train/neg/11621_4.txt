I'm interested in seeing this movie because I knew it was Christian. The director made a good idea when preparing this movie, but it would have been better. We can understand that some still believe that the greatest love of their lives. However, I did not understand why the director was so indifferent, outraged and upset. The main character apologized to his friends when he was having his own. They were completely incomprehensible and used it as a reason to explain God's conduct. The main character, nor did anyone know that the old girlfriend was divorced, still married, but resisted the old feelings needed to fight her. Her friends have been thinking of becoming Christians and must be shown to be supportive of the decision. Many times we do not want to apologize for being hurt in the past and when we try to do it, we do everything against everything. Her ironic part was her new female friend, accused of stalking behavior because she was just looking for an old friend when she did something to catch her name, address and phone number ... she stalker !! he never looked like a friend, but looked for himself. God is love ... And I feel that God is doing something great with injustice, showing that he wants to be with someone who is with them, and that God is genuine love ... just stay with someone you've made a bad choice. We all make mistakes ... what are you taking to correct everything? I was saying that the movie was a potential one, but as it is mentioned repeatedly in a one-sided perspective and compressing the audience's throat ... well-meaning friends. This movie did not respect Christian love, but I gave it to C for the effort.
