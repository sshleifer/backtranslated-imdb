Yes, people are racist. People even become racist at college. This is a good point, and the problem of racism has been discussed many times in numerous films. <br /> <br /> According to some information, it is possible to deal with the problem of racism in the higher school, unlike those higher education institutions. <br /> <br /> This film is in this collective. racism Frankenstein is dealing with the most problems, and it raises you once and for all, in a ruthless and aggressive manner. Most cartoons are cartoonist, one-dimensional, cartoons (delightful feminist, angry black man) can be dramatically predictable and predictable. Instead of violating movie stereotypes, this movie is packed with them. Angry black men feel deceived, feminists hate men, and so on. (There is a sign of feminist even saying "Do not force the dead men") I do not want to give anything, but if anyone seems to be a codex, or as a historic strike, they will probably imagine exactly what they are waiting for. Changes made by characters will only be visible to everyone in the film. The big twist in the craftiness, whether or not the violent neo-Nazis will act as severe neo-Nazis. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is likely to be "strange" and "challenging", but they make the Nazis bad. I agree that the Nazis were bad, but that's my point. Everyone thinks the Nazis are bad; here we do not break a new ground. Since the 1930's, the Nazis have been described as villains. The film does not give any insight or courageous expression. It just deals with issues we know, just like before, out of school, with a special desire. Anti-racial, anti-racist and anti-Nazis do not hold a grave position on a controversial issue. <br /> <br /> Higher Learning is predictable, cartoonist and, in a word, folly. Avoid all costs.
