Actually, I love my films. I made it a habit to see as much as possible. Even their frustrations were cool as the EXORCISM and a KILLER call. It's just plain naked. I do not believe that DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE actually actually did this movie! JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN PUBLIC (it's pretty bad) is not even ridiculous. This is just BAD! That is, I can appreciate and / or forgive bad effects or naked special effects in a shelter movie, but this movie is very serious. I hope a TRAIN is better than SNAKES. Now I'm not a movie I've ever seen.
