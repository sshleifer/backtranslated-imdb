When I say I'm a female, I say that the opponent is diminished by Dr Miranda Jones, played by Diana Muldar. despite all the passionate glow and self-control, you have become a jealous, nervous baby rather than anything else. Now, while technically sidekick Marvik was trying to kill Medusan, a recurring lover, Ambassador Kollos escaped from a jealous anger, but from the beginning he looked at it. (You might think that she could go to the room after closing her eyes and empty the box), she took the facility to the non-navigable area beyond the galaxy until she could not follow her. The ship, of course, remained on the boat, and could have contacted and discussed the good lady doctor. "Spock has to make a mind with Medusan, we can go home. Do you want to run out of consumption and die until we die?" However, the imaginary Star Trek is a fashion gift, a lively and shouting creature, when it comes to saying that Medush's idol wants to shut it down and go with them. So, it's not a crushing thing with naked naked Spock, but she forgets that Spock is wearing a visor that's crazy. Kirk is certainly figured out of a twit and shamed him to stabilize Spock with his superior telepathic powers. Of course, at the end, Lady and Medusan release and all are forgiven. You say that the Battle came from Star Galactica to shoot the President with a flying airplane for a devastating stunt. However, in the land of Star Trek, women are allowed to be completely unfounded and cruel, but at the same time, there is gender equality. I want to say this sexist.
