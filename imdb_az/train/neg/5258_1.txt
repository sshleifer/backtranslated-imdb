Yes, I rented this movie and learned it sucks reallllllly. It's about the family and the family's same foolish fights, and then the cool son comes with his stupid camera and likes to hurt a perverse building, strange things and a strange movie, and then take his father on a side trip, and so on. p. and so on. accept ..... They go to a city where nobody knows (blah blah blah) And the most boring thing is the end of the movie, and yet do not understand what this movie is! I've seen many mystery films, but this was the worst, undoubtedly no description and I would like to see it.
