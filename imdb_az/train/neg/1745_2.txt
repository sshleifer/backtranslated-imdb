The first half hour of the movie remained at a constant pace and presented the characters. But all was happening suddenly, a foolish reason for Akshey Kumar, so far, has been called to three girls by Ahhey and John Abraham. Neha Dupia was the goal of the film, Paresh Rawal did a good job, but Hera's performance at Pheri is not good. in general, this was the biggest disappointment that the film did not justify the film's novel. <br /> <br /> Hara Feri and Hungama do not hesitate to watch this movie again! <br /> <br /> Summarize this: Feel good music for anyone who has purchased Dhoom from Preetam, showing no story or item's cheap scene and appearance! keep it up! The film shot in a room was just as it was the first film, but Akshey and John were created, and the director of Priyadarshan did not give the worst movie ever!
