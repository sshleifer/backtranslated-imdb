John Boorman's 1998 Director General was welcomed as a great turning point, though it was difficult to show what the film itself was. First Northern Irish criminal Martin Cahill (Ordinary Decent Criminal and Vicious Circles as well) about the three films, one of the film events and style has a (film painted, but some areas of the B & absolutely no effect and lasts forever. Witnesses threat in which the main character, vehicle bombs doctors hundred people work, causing loss of prison, to go out and cılgınlarını a seaside table from him to keep the network of one of the sexual təcavuzlu daughter trying to still a popular local legend, the wife of the only attractive as a personality remains , but his sister offers a trios, and really needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and film, but Brendan Gleeson may have the worst and most unexplained performance: he provides lines and stands in the right place, but there is nothing to offer a domestic hero or a complex business. Moreover, it does not shade a character who is nothing but a selfish murder, but it is facing a scenario that await us to love us and her anecdote. <br /> <br /> IRA "general" və kişilərə qarşı yerli bir nifrət kampaniyasını sürətləndirərkən, "Cahill öz qənimətini onlarla bir soyğundan bölüşməyəcək, lakin onun müvəqqəti qətnaməsi belə qəribə bir şəkildə vurulub - Cahill ilə bir balaclava bağlayaraq və biz sevgililərdən ibarət olan demonstrators to bring together - it's just been taken. the last third of the pressure and the army to fall apart things like the more successful, but since then it really too late. Adrian Dunbar, Maria Doyle Kennedy and beautiful Angeline Ball roles supporting good works, but Can Voight's hero, Garda, beat the police, looks more like American sales than a moral balance, a common crash that Gleeson's comedy does not seem to be unattractive.
