If I had accidentally had a camera stacked on the floor, I had enough of a movie to shoot at one of each film and then lost all the movies and had to spend a few dollars to buy a few digital video tapes and filmed the French Revolution more than 2 hours. and there was no set-up for my 4-year-old son-in-law's backbone and I was the only actor I could find in the same soap opera auditions and I was forced to use no music in the entire movie and the zoom function on the camera suddenly started to approach If I hate my stop, oh and my audience, except for one time, I will spend time with such terrible, but miserable, sly, hell. Finally, prominent but totally fake-looking backgrounds remind me of George Lucas's latest creations, which led me to more disappointment, because through the whole film, it was a small hope behind my idea of ​​a lightsaber duel / space laser battle climax. I do not mean to disrupt the movie for those who do not see the film, but this does not end. The only thing I thought to have spent more time watching this movie was this review. Peace.
