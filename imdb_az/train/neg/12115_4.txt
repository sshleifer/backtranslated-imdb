Recently, I continued my way with a collection of Lugosi films and just a few days ago, if I were blown up by the combination of Lugosi and Boris Carloff's "The Black Cat", I really hope to see their collaboration "Crow." Unfortunately, it did not work for me and I was very disappointed by the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> In the first three quarters of this movie or I thought that the story had no basis. Lugosi is a crazy crazy lover who is in love with a young woman (Irene Ware) who treats after an accident, but does not have her. Part of his job, and partly his father (Samuel S. Hinds) was disobedient. To deal with this situation, Edmond Bateman (Boris Karloff), who is a ugly man, wants Vollins to appear more acceptable. Besides Lugoshi's performance, I found very little to keep my interests. Suddenly, in the last fifteen or twenty minutes the movie is completely changed. Suddenly this is pretty suspenseful, but I thought Lugosi's performance was different, because the film tried to pass it as crazy and crazy because there is a difference. He plays the role of "crazy" in a very well-controlled and controlled fashion, but plays in bad. "Insane" is not a worse thing, and I did not think that Lugos was good. At one point, he offers some maniacal laughter that looks just like fake. Meanwhile, Carloff was a big disappointment. He never stopped me. On the one hand, at Lugosi - they receive the highest billing, though they are co-acting films - although Carloff is a clear Lugosi actor nicknamed "Prostitute". <br /> <br /> This, of course, gives Universal a clue as to whether the two starred horror star - obviously, because I always thought Lugos as a good player. <br /> <br /> Edgar Allen Poe's story "The Raven" - here is Poe who is trying to create some of the torture methods of Vollins Poe's stories, because there is no real connection. In general, a disappointment. 4/10.
