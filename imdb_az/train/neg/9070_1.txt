Slackers is another movie that really is not worth watching. Dave (Devon Sawa), Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael C. Maronna) are proud of their holdings at the Holden University. Three hospitable elderly students have been proud of their way in the last four years of college, and now, during the final exams, these great men in school want to be bowed by their most difficult friend at school. The site is very stupid and there is no reason to watch it until you want to shut your mind for a while. Slackers is a predictable teen flick that just adds something new to the genre. At Slackers, the comedy either hit or miss, but there's no real real funny and original moment in the movie. Its really just a gags collection and some really laughable. There are at least eight people working for each joke. The scenario is full of penis and nipple jokes that some secondary and college students can use. Even if they do not remember this movie after a while as a comedy that is very memorable. Jason Schwartzman plays freaky Ethan and after appearing in some of the best comedies he has pretty stoop down. Jaime King and Devon Sawa are some of the other star stars, but they're doing pretty badly in this movie. It is directed by Dewey Nicks, and this is his first film, so you do not blame him. Although the funniest character was probably Laura Prepon, it's not much in the movie. The film is just about 86 minutes, but it really can be too long for some people who do not like this type of humor. Slackers is not the worst movie of 2002, but of course, at a moderate level. Another teenage movie, American Pisi and its sequel, Scary Movie 1 & 2, and more in comparison with other films in the genre. There's something better than that. So, if you do not see the majority of them and look for something new, then Slackers can fit that project. Highly rated by the 4.3 / 10 level under the teenage comedy.
