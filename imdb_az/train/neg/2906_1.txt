<br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> This was my fault. I had a lot of shares until Steve Carell's history. 40-year-old virgin ... Little Miss Sunshine ... Office. Before I went to the IMDb, I did not see a 7.5 user rating. It was always a very good forecast in the past, but lately something goes wrong. Recently, I felt this embarrassing and watched "Blue Steel" in 1990 with so much pain in a movie theater. <br /> <br /> This flick jumped from start to finish. The scenario was unusual. Fear everything you write around. "Kill Your Love"? "Love is a talent"? Everyone writing this article suffers from the same difficulty that hit the writers of American Beauty ... waaaayyyyyy works very hard. The whole flicker was pinched by the moments of the three companies, like a terrible and flawless shower scene. Or a trivial / mixed aerobic scene. Or scenery in a terrible laundry room. When you think of something serious and / or real, it will be thrown into one of these terrible moments. <br /> <br /> And what is Carell's character? The man brings together some of the naked ones in a bookstore and suddenly gets up in love. Let's see this. Their conversation sucked. Both were blessed after a few minutes. Pay attention to the first conversation when you are unhappy with watching this movie .... Carellin's character tries to say something absolutely random and un-funny (I'm exactly one line "once a kid" ... it's serious), but both of the coffee nose they laugh too much to quit. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <strong> Hold a presentation of a movie from this site. I know it's not possible, but the first 20 or more ratings / comments were given by the 12-year-old or ignited by the studio by the employer. Consider Family Carriage rating ... if it was medium 5, then it was totally 2 ... and it would push it.
