1st issue 6/18/2009? 10 to 2 (Dir-Pete Risk): A strange psychotic movie about a girl with autism tested in a hospital, shakes her body, and then all hell remains empty. I'm convinced what the directors' intentions are about. In the nearest 1 hour half (at least not so long) was a very enjoyable horror / zombie / zombiefest / ghost movie. After leaving the government, everyone was missing in hospital, except for a small group, including a girl and a father. A typical annoying character, a creepy old man, and a typical tough man who is a lot of fears and, of course, a charming young girl drawn by the protagonist. Casual things, ghosts, and monsters occur at different times as they seem, are a sign of time stops, and are dead, as they try to escape from everything that is in this small group. Of course, the autistic girl is a part of everything, and I really hate the use of this girl's suffering and why it hurt her and hire a hospital where people care. We have never been able to find the answer to something very strange, so try to avoid that dog. If you do not want to crawl and mix for one and a half hour, this is not for you or any movie theater. When is the time lost?
