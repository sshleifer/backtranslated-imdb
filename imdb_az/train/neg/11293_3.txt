This movie was a real torture festival to sit. His first mistake is that he considers nuclear energy as an obvious "bad thing", but there is no need to convince its viewers. When confronted with putting their own arguments, the participants present a substantiated facts; someone who is missing is someone who is crying "when the kids are going to think"! While watching this movie, I was thinking, "I'm where you've heard it." or "Maybe it can not be right" - at least some of the information has not been backed up by any reliable source. The film "regular nation" is more common than those who understand the advantages and disadvantages of the nuclear power of the lidids; <br /> <br /> <strong> Cinema masters can be guilty of being fair, but at the same time sharing the film's rock stars. Now some of these people are highly esteemed musicians I love music, and I'm sure most of them really believe in that. But all this is looking for something to do with the old hippies, and now it's 60s. Particularly embarrassing, Graham Nash and James Taylor. Nas had worked hard - he could not believe what he knew (I do not blame him), but I feel proud. James Taylor should be a "starter" at "wympiest" label, "stand and fight", in the most unpleasant hilarious way you can imagine. In fact, when the majority of demonstrations are not patronizing, they are pretty soft. Nobody will work with this event, and it does not really mean to them anything. It should be noted that the movement behind all this event is the responsibility of the Orleans band John Hall and some MOR pops from the 70s. (Remember, if you dance "Dancing with me" and "Still One"). This is a symbol of the fact that the cause is not encouraging any real passion in music. Why life is death or death, but everyone can pass through their number when playing catskiller. Perhaps, with the exception of Gil-Scott Heron, "The Approach Lost Detroit" is at least the subject of the challenge but coincides with all the disturbances of high school students affected by the "controversial". <br /> <br /> Only Bruce Springsteen's performance boosts a pulse; I'm a big fan of Boss, but he does not ask. One piece thinks it is composed separately by another event and is filmed to wake up the audience. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> There are so many people who want to bomb the Caucasus. I do not expect a lot of sensitive camera movements from the 1970s, but shots are unnecessary static, just broken up for a back-up singer's tonsils by split-second cutaways. Now some of them are lifeless to start with performers; and * perhaps filmmakers are more capable of performing in documentary films, but one thing to do is watch "Rust never sleep" or "Last Waltz" to see a more skillful film. And with more interesting musicians. <br /> <br /> So, there are only two things to watch this movie: a sad snapshot of Springsteen's excellent performance and a decline in counter-culture.
