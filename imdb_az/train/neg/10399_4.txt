One of the biggest flaws in the film, while satisfying the ambitious yuppies' mockery, does not understand that filmmakers are guilty of being one of the ridiculers. One of the peculiarities of these yuppie species is that they are just an insufficient concept to develop the yuppies art. The film ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on the misconceptions of the audience, but the people who use this film are simply surprised by the same modest taste in the movies they choose to eat. If these wonderful characters in this movie have a video library at home, I think it will be one of the American Psycho films.
