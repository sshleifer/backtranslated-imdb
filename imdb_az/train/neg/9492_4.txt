A star for "Desert". A star for the player. A star for dubbing to the charming American. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, with the desire to wipe all their clothes. Ten years from him, from the "Manon des Sources", for two years before Emmanuel Beart believed. BÃ©art has been stripped several times, but even full dressed enough to watch this movie. Look at the scene for a girl about three "first time" conversations. The pretty laughably choreographed "love scenes" with Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau are more cornice but still very erotic. By the way, cinematography is not great; preparations for closing loans are a better indicator of David Hamilton's ability to succeed.
