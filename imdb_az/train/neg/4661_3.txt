This film includes Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. This is an interesting WW2 film and a statement about racism. It is worthwhile to grasp the facts reflecting what we think about the films they produce and the time they describe it. In this sense, 70 films are not 40 films (WW2). However, under the direction of the white captain who wants to capture a dam, seven black men have some good action scenes. The story is in the center of the Captain, who learns that these men are not just a service company, but soldiers. There is a scene from a civil war movie and it's not a WW2 movie that reflects the movie. Black Lt gives German women an innocent flower on the cheek and white Capt floats. Since the stars and the genre are interesting to me, I enjoyed the film's interest.
