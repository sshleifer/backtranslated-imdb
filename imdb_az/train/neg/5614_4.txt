One of the most popular renters in my local video store is a documentary about Jesus Christ, not Borat or Going. It was originally designed by former Christian fundamentalist director Brian Flemming. In a 62-minute documentary, Flemming claims that Jesus is a legend based on Pagan tradition, not a historical one. Using interviews with the authors, philosophers and historians, God's Son, Jesus, lived and crucified and resurrected for a long time, Flemming compared Christ's story to the saints with Isis and Osiris. Egypt, Dionysus, and Adonis in Greek mythology, as well as the mystery of the mystery of Rome and the very striking similarities. <br /> <br /> In addition to the proof of the Pagan Cults, it is the earliest sources for the story of Christ The Four Gospels are written forty or fifty years from the date of Jesus' crucifixion, and the letters of St. Paul are a small shows evidence. Flemming, unfortunately, is not just to conduct a serious investigation of Jesus' life, but to use it as a single point for Christianity and all religions for a full crisis crisis. The majority of interviews are adapted to the philosopher, including biologists Richard Dawkins and author Sam Price. <br /> <br /> Michael Moore's interview with Charlton Hester in Bowling for Columbine, with Sipus his interview is very severe while walking in the middle of Sipus. Flemming rescues the baby's God for God, how wrong Christianity is in the world of the sun, and then murdered 11 people and killed Charles Manson and Dena Schlosser in the name of Christianity. According to a report by LaHaye and Jenkins, Christians say that "all non-Christians are thrown into the lake of fire, shouting and screaming" Christians. In order to turn us against even more Christianity, Flemming gives us extensive pictures of Mel Gibson's passion for Christ, first of all, clarifies the field of violence and torture. It can be a serious debate on a very interesting topic, resulting in childhood rankings and polemics against all religions. While condemning those who use Christianity to describe Christianity, Motiel Lester, a prominent Christian pacifist, ignores Guatemala Maya as the socialist Muriel Lester, who finds Indian Revolutionary Christians and deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. <br /> <br /> The recognition and operation of his work for political justice is the recognition of Ter Terrace, which respects the worth and dignity of every human being. <br /> <br /> His most famous argument compares the Christian doctrine with the Pagan cults and, despite the good points, Flemming tells us that some aspects of these churches are similar to Christian doctrines, before the 300 AD, the New Testament no text or source material. It is also important to note the main difference. The immediate aim of the initiatives was to have a mystical experience that led them to feel united with their god. <br /> <br /> I am not a Christian and, despite some doubts, this applies to the Pope for a church hierarchy including spiritual and bishops. It is true that Jesus Christ is, in fact, a historical person, whether it is historically significant or not. An important message was introduced to humanity and spread to the world of mankind's spiritual evolution. <br /> <br /> Let us note that Christianity was a moral and moral law that respects the doctrine of compassion and love and our friend. <br /> <br /> I welcome the fact that the movie is being prepared and taboo is discussed, how difficult it is to try to use it as a religious battleground, but I see it as a common subject that can bring people together. . Although it is a place for debate and debate on religious issues, Anni Besant said, "Moral truths are seen in the best of fraternity and mutual respect - a good time to humiliate others.
