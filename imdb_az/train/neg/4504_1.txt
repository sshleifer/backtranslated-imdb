Slow, tedious and one-dimensional movie! Good dialogue with a small dialogue, drilling story line and Mr. Marshall's soulless direction! The traditional and predictable story of the most popular form of prostitution in Asian continent is the heart, lack of new insights and depth. Lead character looks at the ground due to its small fisique and fake-looking contact lenses. The lexicon, used by the geeks, is compulsory and slightly more sophisticated to compromise on educational paths. This story goes on and this little, dull, flat-haired Asian girl is trying to convince her son Geisha, but in reality, she says, "She is preparing to be a legend!" I make the case tougher! The film is simply boring, it's awesome, there are so many interesting moments you can find out for cigarretes. Basically, if you do not believe in the messenger, you will not believe the message, and this girl did not fill her shoes! Boring, boring, skip!
