The idea of ​​creating a miniature on the Berlin airplane seemed to me one of the more exciting German posters. This is still a very unexplored subject. However, those who did this series filled it with clichés. <br /> <br /> Luis Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann), when she heard her doctor, started with a DVD cover. <br /> <br /> (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia and after the war he struggled to live. He finds a job in the American base, gets involved in work for the highest quality and high-ranking officer (Heino Ferch) in the city, is in love, is pregnant, and suddenly all her husband turns. Come on! We have seen this much more often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play a very good role; Bettina Zimmermann never really believes in the truth. For some reason it always seems to be a little late to give emotional responses to the scenes. <br /> <br /> Moving scenes with airplanes and air lift, we are sometimes more exciting, more frequent. <br /> <br /> If you are not a great admirer of World War II movies, I suggest you spend your money on something else: chocolate ice cream brings more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> From 4 to 10!
