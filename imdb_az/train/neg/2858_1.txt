This should be one of the worst films of all time. The graphics were horrible, the actor was b-film and the effects were simply plain Nintendo 64. You would think it would make a little more effort. Of course, Scifi is a channel movie, so you should expect it to be low, but it gets a sack. Hell, still laugh. So, like shaking your head in a blasphemous movie, that's good. <br /> <br /> Although there are some "well-known" actresses and actresses, it's hard for me to believe that the quality of this movie is worth the time and effort. <br /> <br /> The graphics could have been good at the turn of the 60s or even early 70's, but this is 2009! If you've played Jurassic Park at Nintendo 64, you'll see what you see in this movie. <br /> <br /> It was necessary to sit with something not worth 2 hours
