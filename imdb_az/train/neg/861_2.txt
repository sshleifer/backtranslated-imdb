A disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> The story did not do much, as our chief protagonist, Chrissy, a 'young', a very drag-free individual procrastination. In fact, he did very little to bring the story out of action, so he was not surprised to see me focusing on his relatives. Unfortunately, Chrissy looks like an interesting character. <br /> <br /> The story was predictable and sometimes very formidable. So, the question now is to see stories about film art, which will inspire more breakthroughs for Campaigns, Jacksons, and Tamahor√≠s instead of enjoying two hours of entertainment. <br /> <br / Technically, a disgusting shot movie.
