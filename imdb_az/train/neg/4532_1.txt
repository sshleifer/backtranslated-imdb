My wife and daughter bought our daughter's old school Sesame Street DVD and want to say that I do not want to watch new episodes on TV because I'm worried about all the characters. Baby Bear and Telly? OMGOSH, ANNOYING, and the useless clutter can think of 'skits'? Elmo? Let each child love her again, let her tease her again and teach my child. Mr. Noodle? what does it reject. I think once I turned the "new" show for her, she and I have earned more money than before. The show has definitely taken a wrong turn. Yip Yips, Kermit's Breaking News, 1-2 2 Little Dolls, Mumford the Magician, Bert and Ernie, remember Grover Waiter, OLD SCHOOL SS Susam Street has caused direct boredom and shaking since all GREAT EDUCATION SYSTEMS Henson passed in 1990. The show has no educational, comic, and interactive sketches that it uses. I think the new version is simply packed with unbearable annoying and useless non-learning scarves. If you want, S.S. There is another cartoony show for manufacturers / writers to sit in front of non-creative, non-executed children, and they will come out of your hair. Producers / Authors: I suggest you start knocking old muppets and finding the first Susam Street similar content. The Lord does not want to talk like my baby Baby Bear or Elmo.
