My darling and I hired it because it could have been a good 'Halloween' money. A killer, a white mask ... who scares youngsters ... I have to slip. We have been mistaken! No penalty is provided We do not find one of the worst movies out there, but it's also a religious classic! Land plots are full and do not make any sense. Maddy's actress is very nice, but it's about it. I support a very low budget for filming - I always support such films. <br /> <br /> This movie is good for seeing you're drunk or high; otherwise do not worry. Unless I like to lose movie privileges as I did!
