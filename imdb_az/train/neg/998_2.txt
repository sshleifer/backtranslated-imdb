In the general movie synopsis, when it is more information than the film itself, it's pretty bad. A long "plot summary" of the item written on the movie page was unable to watch. Whenever I went to bleep, I always supported myself to see the details I could not understand. Unfortunately, if you can say that this movie is a story, this movie leaves the horrible fragments of the story. It was like trying to deceive us, thinking that we were in a movie, as if it were a movie, because it would suffice to make a story similar to the one and the rest of it. News for developers: I paid a movie to shoot a movie. I can sit in the house and imagine the scheme and the storyline free of charge. And Rosario Dawson? This is not someone I have not paid enough attention to, and why. A had one of the most artificial performances I've ever seen for a leading character in any movie. It was A or B. Perhaps I did not want his role, I just received a heavy offer for a movie. included? It's wrong. She was listed as one of the producers. If you do something in the future, if you can not move, do not celebrate yourself as a leader. Indeed, if you can, then create a decent character to become. Also, someone here talked about the white / Latin issue - yes, I hate to say this, but this film is seen as a revenge for white students of white students against obsolete lungs. This happens when the film does not have the viewer to love Latin heroes. The character of Adrian appears to be a ghost not better than the story's antagonist. As for the character of the Maya, he did not seem to be a real person. In any case, such a film was shot for Hollywood.
