Because both of them are pretty bad. The best part of the film is the horrendously imperial image of Faye Dunaway on the ladder. It looks like it can very easily take this picture, split bloody pieces and re-enter the portrait as though it were as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br /> I say that part of the film draws a movie to draw attention. <br /> <br /> I admit that I paid $ 30 for the DVD, as I have seen Faye Dunayee in a modern horror movie. I know what you are thinking - to win a $ 30 gap. And it would be absolutely correct. This movie is healing. There, obviously, is open. I was expecting some real fears and I waited, waited, and waited. Not yet. The swallow (probably the makeup blend) did not scare me; my small body organs did not scare me, and Faye did not scare me either. I am not brave, I know, so the film itself should be anxious. In addition, Jennifer was not afraid. His inner bodies were as if separated from each other and seemed to be more gentle than anything else. His life was rapidly approaching, and he was worried about making more money. Honey, you can not afford to go! <br /> <br /> Along with this, I had to deal with all the explosion films with Grandma (Faye): "I need money," he persistently says that his lungs collapsed and stopped functioning. . At first I doubted, Faye grandmother and all were playing, and I still suspect. There is another brother who lives at home, Jennifer and Mary Ellen have to be temporarily discharged from hell to hell, and I think it's the same as the grandmother. Here's a strange part - it looks like they're loyal to the eighth birthday party. Mary Ellen managed to escape only a prominent surgeon. Face elevators do not work miracles, but I think that Faye's appearance is important for a rice-paper document. SPOILER !!! Apparently, I do not want to apologize for the illness that affects the family's bad behavior, my little joke. Although serious, there are all the diseases that cause the organs to fail and eventually break down. Yuck, huh? Marlyn Ellen is still alive and all her bodies are broken. How to avoid family curse? <br /> <br /> Another reason to burn thirty-nine dollars for me - this movie has one of my all-time movies. I'm looking at a double end. This movie ends twice. I absolutely hate it, and I feel like the director is reading it, I do not like it and I want to forget it when editing it. Perhaps I think I should be scared, but you're just a movie editor. <br /> <br /> There is a bug for this bug, and there's a reason you've got on the DVD. The film's commentary is one of the features of Faye Dunaway and I wanted to see how it works when there are no lines to read. When asked how bad the film was, he was able to sit back. Drat.
