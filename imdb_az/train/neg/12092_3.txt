I know Haneke's filmmaking abilities. For example, I value it as a powerful way to create a strong sense of realism, with remarkable natural daytime illumination. However, I am very sorry to see that the content of this film is a challenge to patriotism in the 21st century, or the emotions (and / or BDSM experiences). The problem with the main character's mother is incredibly up-to-date, and it's a misunderstanding and misunderstanding by Walter (I do not mean repetition of the disappointment of a beloved beloved lover, and I understand it as evidence, or come as a monk!). That is, D / S is not a new thing in the world, and I think it is very discreet to treat it as it is a "freakish" or a pathological thing; this is not. <br /> <br /> So, for me, this film is a multi-program film that is disturbed by obsolete psychoanalytic theory, is not it really embarrassing?) and, indeed, the relationships with the real life and experience of those engaged in D / (personal experiences, forums, irc chatrooms, and even recent scientific studies will show this).
