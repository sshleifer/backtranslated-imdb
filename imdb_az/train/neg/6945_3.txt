Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) killed his child and his wife deliberately attacked home. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him with post-traumatic stress. Then Archer meets a man (Til Schweiger), gagged in a cafe. He is the one who kills his son and attacks his wife and can do whatever he likes. <br /> <br /> It is interesting at the beginning of the film (and shows the real limitations in terms of blood and protection), but it takes a minute and is very unlikely. the ground twists and turns. All of this ends in an old and foolish end, so I was thinking of using everyone. I'm particularly interested in how talented actors like Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer have been involved in this way. It earns three stars for the player but the stupid area and really incredible turns is a xore to sit on it.
