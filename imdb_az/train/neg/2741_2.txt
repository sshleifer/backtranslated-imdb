Spoilers! I like Brana, I love Helena Bonham-Carter, I love them at Mary Shelley's Frankenstein - but I can understand the desire of an actor to avoid the romantic stereotype. Bonham-Carter's dresses were three times strange, and sometimes it could have come out of a series of acclaimed "strange" Beatles movies, or old Rowan and Martin Laugh-In. <br /> <br /> I have no idea at all - other commentators say that the character of Branagh is a dreamer. I have never felt it. He was very profitable and, of course, he did not like it. Working with the bank robbery was simply painful to follow. <br /> <br /> Bonam-Carter's realistic attempts were as realistic as the first 15 minutes of the Full Monty in Lancashire. <br /> <br /> The poetic end of a hill buried under the monster of his plane was very similar. Do you have an angry chore or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Turn to something classic or a spine and a pedestal. Donate this to PBS. <br /> <br />
