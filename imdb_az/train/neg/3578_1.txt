There is absolutely nothing to pay for this movie. They took a small story, beat it, mistakenly wrote it, they made a mistake. <br /> <br /> This, as well as the art, leads to even worse trade. Who could be the target market for that? Which age group? Which Interest Group? <br /> <br /> Someone should take a film about how and why they did this movie. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies, and it's chosen from "Grace" with "Sailor Who" and "Manos" ... The movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Everyone who is related to VanDamme, follow this movie and conduct an academic exercise - how can you get it? ? I do not think of a way.
