That was terrible. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. That is, the throne makes a shoe similar to that it can do a better job. But then, remember, at the Fourth Wedding, as well as the excitement. England full of chocolate cottage and countryside greenery. It is almost like a school, perhaps a few schools other than Hogwarts? The two police stations were like Heartbeat (an English series series established in the 1960s) .This film could not draw anything that just wanted to be a serious test of weakening comedy or female friendships. After having been stranded in the past, the cemetery scenes and the stupor of the stomach can only have worked (I only say). But these scenes did not work with tragedy in the second half. And I do not understand if Kate can talk to Molly again after his terrible behavior. The last note - What is a good actress poo like Staunton doing in this stack? I'm not going to mention Anna Kansler. Macdowell should continue to advertise the wrinkle cream.
