<br /> Why, oh, why did not the editor / director have an editor to talk to snip, snip? snip As you can see, the writer / director has already made shorts; In short, this would be good. However, the lack of dialogue begins to gain after twenty minutes. Lack of music glitter. Rear noise (talking, traffic, and especially a helicopter everywhere) is really fast. But the worst is the story. <br /> <br /> After an hour, we saw the same repetition of the scene. I nearly shouted on the screen, "We'll get it, we'll get it !!!!!" After leaving the theater, we can go home, watch a part of the Daily Show and Colbert Report, prepare for bed, and we know that the audience was trapped in the theater. <br /> <br /> It is not enough to provide your vision. You need to give enough audience to share your vision.
