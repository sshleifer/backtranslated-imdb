Geared Fairy Peter Campbell (Lochlyn Munro) is set up in a small town in northern California where he is a renowned farmer who plans to become a holidayman, his darling Darcy Wagner (Chandra West) arrives to help with the weekend and his 12 year-old daughter Pamela Nicole Munoz) is a young man. When looking at property, Pamela meets a young girl named Emma, ​​who warns her of a new home that is bad. She explains a story of a bad old witch, known as a tooth fairy, which teaches teeth to teeth children and then kills them. . Pamela is worried and worse when she leaves the bicycle and when her last child comes down from the tooth, she has the eyes of Pamela's teeth on the toothpaste's evil dreams, and only she decides to kill anyone ... <br /> /> I was told by Chuck Bowman that the Tooth Fairy was just a poor flat-to-video low-budget horror film that flooded nightly night dark TV programs, mostly not very good. A script created by producer Stephen J. Cannell, Corey Strode and Cookie Rae Brown is a complete snooze festival for the first 40 minutes, nothing interesting in this period, and in fact, these things go as if it were an exposition to surprise anyone. It introduces the character, Gear Defines the legend of Fairy and that's it. The second half of the film is getting better, but then there is nothing spectacular, there are few pieces of decent scenes, but all of these are very predictable and unforgettable things. The character is not great, and most of them have to be completely killed, the story has contradictory tricks like the Tooth Fairy, telling her that she was killing children after she gave birth to teeth, so why not kill her deliberate murder with nothing to do with her teeth? What happened to him after the prognosis established in 1949? Why is it back as a ghost? Although he is a kind of ghost, he seems to be a lot of people who want to use his weapons and weapons to kill people, but there is no attempt to use supernatural elements, except for enthusiastic children playing for maximum mood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There is nothing I can describe here as fear or atmosphere, and there is no warning about comparing teeth since it is quite different from & & Darkness Falls (2003). Someone was dumped into a door and then opened with a bullet and was leaked to them by the sky, while others dropped into a wood chip machine <br /> <br /> The teeth fair was generally well-prepared with a budget of approximately $ 1,500,000, but a special there is nothing. <br /> <br /> It is said that this is not very good, but it's not very unusual, but I do not find it as distressing to kids. Gear Fairy, If you find a cheap copy of the plain-to-video horror every day, it can take more than 90 minutes, if it's not enough, it's pretty weak and unforgettable .
