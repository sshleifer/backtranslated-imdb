I was looking forward to a film by Grendel, written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. Beowulf was based on epos, but explained in terms of monster. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It does not look like anything. <br /> <br /> Along with this, writers should be punished for the worst offense of the original story and will help the ever-increasing ignorance of massive television viewers in the United States. <br /> <br /> Typical Hollywood is so wrong. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and full time loss.
