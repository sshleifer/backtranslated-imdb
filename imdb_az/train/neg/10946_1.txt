"The Malcom Show in FOX really kills ... can not make its own version?" Of course, I guess and I'm paraphrasing, but we all know that this is the truth in our hearts, and NBC is the only gender that is added to the Malcom metric. <br /> <br /> The thirteen-year-old Tucker takes a sandbag and covers her with a skateboard. Tucker suddenly goes to the night sky and accuses him of persecution and sting. She spies on the lovely girl in the next bedroom window and knows she wants to see her topless, but she smiles and hangs around the window and surprises her. This is a pilot. <br /> <br /> Take off a juvenile; a boy's adult right is not funny for a mainstream viewer who is driven by feverish and testicular. Everyone has just been in the movie for the first time and can count them on the one hand. So it is not surprising that Tucker's hot-water club is warm and appealing to the bathroom. Did the network really want to consider the children's adolescence? Will not people go to prison? If you do not doubt the severity of violence in the show, take these into account: 13 episodes have been shot, but only after 4 episodes NBC has abolished it; then there was a "burning" action that left the episodes in the MIDNIGHT because no child could see them. Children are originally targeted by the audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> even a terrible date, this ska was accidentally music and super-sarcasm. I did not want any of the characters to laugh at jokes and the jokes did not come full minutes ... NBC is shameful for this dirty rip-off ... they are better <br /> DATA: C-
