This film is a young scientist who creates a serum that revives the dead. She uses her brother for the first time when she was killed by a driver. His brother then overthrew other network members. In some scenes, zombies are rarely seen on picnics and move quite rapidly on other scenes. The player is mediocre, but the story does not help the movie. Makeup is made of blood before the zombie. I'm sure that this movie has a lot of budget. If the film's story had been more original and better, I believe the film could be better prepared. If you do not see a good zombie whistle, you do not see it.
