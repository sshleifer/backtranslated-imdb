I'm looking for this movie for centuries, because it's rare to find it as one of the video nasties. Finally, at the end of last year, I found that on DVD this is a very low budget movie. The story is based around Amazon Jungle tribes who live in fear of the devil. Laura Crawford is a model that kidnapped a murderer while working in South America. Laura is protected by some ridiculous locals who call themselves "Satan" and they must go all the unpleasant things that happens. The girls were weakened. The Devil eats the flesh terribly. Peter Weston is a devil hunter who goes out to try and save himself,
