Lame dragged the superhero motion movie. There was great hope for this movie, and I was not ashamed of those on HK friendly police action, but I rarely see a story like this and a ridiculous one. This is not always the case when, as in the case of such films, the act of reimbursement was unfortunately not. The movement has a bearing of the trade mark and the highest nature of HK's movement, but it is not terribly real, and is actually incompatible (perhaps it is associated with the restoration of American liberty, in most cases, the window places). I'm very upset.
