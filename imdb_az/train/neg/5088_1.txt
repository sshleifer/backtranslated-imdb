This guy has no idea about the movie. Okay, he has shown several interesting shows in his youth and deceived two acceptable film-communist censorships that are more political. All this is very good, but watch out: DO NOT WORK! Scenes are not full of unbalanced, inexplicable content and empty spaces. There is nothing to do with the topic, so it gives priority to violence, nudity and wishful thinking. How can such a corrupted body survive without understanding anything from cinematographic work and art? Why did I break her down?
