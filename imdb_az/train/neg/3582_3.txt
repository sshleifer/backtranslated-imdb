No, this is not a horror movie ... It's actually a love story. <br /> <br /> The Ring is a silent film for women who have been among the two boxers since 1927. Boxer is known as a "Round" Jack. The champion loves him until he leaves. Even though he is married to a Tour, he plays with a champion until a fight between the round and the boxing champion. <br /> <br /> This film was too early in Hitch's career, but when he came to the worst of everything, he returned from a round corner, and he was able to fight miraculously and love the spouse found. but the restriction of time should not lead to a continuous film. Although it has special movie tricks and some comedy reliefs, this movie does not just follow one of the next things. But this, along with his adulterous spouse, was extremely risky during the time. It could have been withdrawn in 1927. While looking at all of these old movies, it's nice to think that today's screen may be redone and that I'm really out. <br /> <br /> If you do not plan to watch Jackie's movies, skip this movie. You could fall asleep.
