There was such a word in this movie! A little-minded paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory is a wonderful idea to lose speed due to bad dialogue, poor correction and a half-written story. The heroes who started from the beginning were excited, but only a tired liner to get one dimension to lose their steam half way. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, if they spent a little more time in the story and dialogue, it was a great movie, rather than a bit later.
