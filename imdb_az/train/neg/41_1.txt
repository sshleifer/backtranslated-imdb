How can you say that a horror film is terrible? Of course it is impossible to stop laughing about it! <br /> <br /> Some research has been made in South America, and I think other African countries. It was some random island on the Pacific Ocean. This is exactly where it happens, secretive appears. The Cannibal tribe is a man who is adapted by some black men and some black men and looks like a young Frank Zappa cultivating drums ... Satan is a great black man with a terrible pink eye. One of the most striking moments in the film is that Pablito is one of the things that appears to be a piece of orange material hanging from a tree. (which is actually laughable), then the head of his partner falls on the ground and "Pablito" starts a bit because of my thought and "the eyes are really moving ..." <br /> <br /> Some of the films also associated with film shootings. <br /> <br /> Here is what I recommend this afternoon with your friends and do not let you do something ... go into a beer and start watching this movie, you'll love it! If you're looking for a real horror or protection movie ... do not worry.
