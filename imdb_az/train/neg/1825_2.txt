I'm sure what. I just have to laugh. I had an open mind. I did not want to be intense about it - it was about it. But I must seriously laugh at this movie. It's not just funny for me. Some parts looked like Ben Stiller and Jack Black tried hard. Because you put two very funny guys together, this does not mean there will be a perfect comedy. Some movies should not be left alone. This is one of them. Because there are many old jokes and the player was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. At least order. But I was not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can not give these two things down. And everything I gave. <br /> <br /> 2/10
