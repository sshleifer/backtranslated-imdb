This is a dry and sterile feature of one of the most important events in the WWII and the history of the war behind the frontline. If Hitler thinks it might be a dramatic event, the worst drama composition is the worst thing about this movie.

I believe Mister Bin will play better. Generally, the film appears to be a shadow copy of the German film "Stauffenberg" since 2004, but can not approach the movie about any movie. However, the film obviously takes the financial purpose of the pop-corn audience, which evaluates the art values ​​of Hollywood fast mood blood and thanks to art.
