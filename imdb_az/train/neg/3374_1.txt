Some people think this movie is classic - why is not it? It's scary to be smiling. <br /> <br /> With this film alone, saving grace is unpleasant, you are embarrassed because you have no choice other than you, but it is the delivery of the knots to laugh. <br /> <br /> There are some good songs and good choreography movies, but WHAT? There is no plot, it is built in a theater without a scene change, and Michael Douglas is astonishing as usual. My brother forced me to watch this movie once, because I do not believe it would be so bad! He was right. <br /> <br /> I usually recommend that these terrible people do not expect this movie, but in this case, people should put on any bad movie you think. in the future.
