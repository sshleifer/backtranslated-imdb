I'll give you all five. All five brands offer a very good set of latest day material for Hendrix. Unfortunately, the quality of the camera's work and correction is awful! Hendrix has almost a disadvantage of shooting that he can do almost anything, maybe he gets a job? We do not see your hand on the guitar. We also gave Hendrix a lot of shots. There are three cameras in Hendrix, but amateur fools manage it all. The man in front of Hendrix seems like Hendrix's only guessing on the guitar, and he is eager to take a stage-specific look. Despite the fact that the man behind is a good sound thanks to Wally Heider (sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider), though there are videos that protest against students, Vietnam and others. Machine Gun is full of wasting tracks like Gun! After two years of Hendrix's life, Berkeley is one of the things that will never see the light of the day as full of official freedom. An incredible stone in Johnny B is good, but all of this is a great person's pretty bad visuals and both Woodstock and the Isle of Wight
