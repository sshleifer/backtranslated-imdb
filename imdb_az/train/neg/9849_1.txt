This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Even though television is at movie level, that's bad. The area is diabolically flawed and mixed, undetermined characters are split into names in this movie. I do not know how a masterpiece coincides with this excuse - this is bad. It is calculated as a 'Psychological Horror Thriller' - this is certainly terrible. There is nothing exciting about this. And it can be psychological damage! The start-up scenes promised such a promise-a warehouse that could be a part of the soul's brain, but everything that came after the car's crash was on the edge of the faith. Although you have tried it, you may be less careful about the characters. There's plenty of sprinkled idea that the film is the best way to have a word collage away from Chinese philosophers, and the worst movie actually will make you Brain Dead! <br /> <br /> I bought more than 300 movies on the DVD, and I'll get my money back. FIRST. RETURN.
