Grand Central Murder (1942) S. Sylvan Simon Product: MGM <br /> <br /> This mediocre B 'mystery was one of the five films he directed in 1942 with Simon. Without a doubt, she could fit into another Red Skelton movie or its schedule! In any case, Grand Central Murder is producing chemistry from the foolish, foolish, charm and results of the Thin Man films. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin and Virginia Gray Nick and Nora Charer, Rocky and Butch Custer. She is a PI and she is partner and sleuthing partner. They engage in "joke" poems with each other. See it? It's already quite different. Heflin is the only person here who points to the bigger and better things, though he is close to such a shaking. Virginia Gray was another Thin Man, but still give stress, THIS IS NOT A FILM, NOT MORE. And if we begin to think that this movie is nothing like another movie we really love (I say THIN MAN), Sam Levene is a leading detective who neglects Van Heffin's sensitivity and all the important results. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> Soon, the 'murder' is a tragic encoder Mida King who wants to trade with wealthy men until she finds a richer man. Until he opens his mouth and turns to F, Patricia Dane looks like Hedy Lamarr's C-version. There are all unreasonable suspects with their motivation to ask for the dead. There are some kind of community, challenging chatter, strange, old lover and a shady theater impresario (Tom Conway, here's the likelihood of Frankie Ciro's). Roman Bohnen plays a frustrating, strange kind of thing, I believe in something he has done before. Millard Mitchell plays a dragon who does not stop thinking about a piece of donkey waiting after completing this job (right, Millard Mitchell, a sword). Finally, in a completely basic way to write stories, all the suspects gather somewhere where they say stories (like flashbacks), as Rocky's mentions take in mind, and eventually, despite the fact that the real picture is a bit of a dud , sadly, I think that there may be shooting of several parts of the 1942 era. Medium, but unfortunately, no. In the beginning there are only a few short strokes. Thanks for nothing, Grand Central Murder. <br /> <br /> Heflin is a good thing. <br /> <br />
