Devin Hamilton is probably known as the legendary Tam Moon entertainment. Unfortunately, the arrival of this independent studio took place at a time when the budget and production values ​​were at the lowest level compared to the years. However, Hamilton has set himself up as a creative director in his short career to make himself inventive and original stories. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Now these movies are good but at least they are in the horror genre of the traditional can be. <br /> <br /> In Debut "Bleed", Hamilton presents us with a creative twist. slasher sub - genre. Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a young woman who eventually fulfills her dreams. Not only that, a man in Shaun (Danny Wolske) found his comrade, who, as it seems, finally laugh after Maddy after a very sad incident. <br /> <br /> With his party friends, they say to him that they have created a "club" where members should kill someone to enter. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, they are joking, but Maddy wants to be confused, In fact, someone kills. After the event, someone is killing one of the members of the club. <br /> <br /> Maddy can understand what's happening, including anyone else's killer. <br /> <br /> Maddy is a very interesting character played by beautiful Debbie Rochon. As part of the suspects, it's a very interesting twist in the genre to get a leading player. The concept is so original, and Rochon's performance is so good that Hamilton is a fact that has not improved the whole story a bit better. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> and men's casting are painfully worse. Danny Wolske's pretty wooden and his performance as a yuppie is pretty stereotypical. Julie Strain, Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman appear in smaller komsomolals and are beautiful in their small roles. Also, nudity is more (both men and women) and very good looking, because that's really a lot. <br /> <br /> Low in the film effect section, because there are very few hero scenes, and it's not really graphics (probably they look bad); Nevertheless, taking into account the budget, the film looks at least good. <br /> <br /> Hamilton's latest effort, "Delta Delta Die!" is a well-prepared and common funnier movie. Although this is not as bad as other well-known films, there are still some drawbacks and may be of interest to Debbie Rochon's admirer or fans of extra-budgetary films. 4/10
