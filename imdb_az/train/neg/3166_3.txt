I acknowledge a very uncomfortable feeling about the ghosts films, and I sometimes have to worry about being comical, especially when it comes to comedy as the genre tastes when it comes to horror. 'His Dead Body' seems to have taken a little bit of life and seems to me in any way that I think. The story is certainly incredible, and I was unable to persuade me in a comedy or sentiment register. The choice of the main actress was terrible. Even though Paul Rudd seems to be at least a beautiful and beautiful person, Eva Longoria seems very slippery for her, and taste in her characteristic ladies needs serious development, and Lake Bell appears to be very charming (again sorry). It does not start with a romantic story without a good reason for romance. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were really good, but they only supported the roles. The rest are uninterested and thirsty with flat cinematography and cheap gags borrowed from unmatched television comedies. Naturally, nothing worth seeing is nothing to remember.
