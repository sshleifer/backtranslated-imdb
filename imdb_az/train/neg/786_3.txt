I saw that this movie was released and I looked 3 or 4 times more than last week. <br /> <br /> This is just a magnificent, magnificent film, which can not just say something ambitious for more than 4 hours - beautifully drawn and prepared. . Derek Jacobi, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet, Richard Briers, and others work fine. Then there's Kenneth Branag. If there was no space project for any actor, Mr. Baghdad did not give anything to Ham at the Hamlet. From the stunt casting (which gives us the worst performance by the lucky successful Jack Lemmon), he throws a gamut to one of the dull workplaces of the job thrown to get the sense of "nature." The most famous soliloquy of all literature is to shout every single line of others. His performance can be better seen on the scene, which is more important, but he has never been a great actor. The decoration budget can be paid for catering, Mr. Branagh eats long ago. His performance Shakespeare - "sound and strange, does not mean anything." <br /> <br /> We would like to note that it is related to the events that took place several days later. a playwright. The glimpse of his works is that his theme is universal and timeless. Although his works are not a "straightforward" way of playing, there are very good moving, good-acting, and bad behavior. Shakespeare himself gives instructions to players in the Hamlet text. I declare that Mr. Branag is "intoxicating," but I have not heard. <br /> <br /> Mr. Branag, of course, was a good example of how to spend some time learning how to say something, though he did a great job of building some fun projects. <br /> <br /> It would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the arts to apply it. Her leadership has always been better than her player. I still give him a big credit for rebuilding the interest to shoot Shakespeare. Put a great template for other production. So it would be interesting to return more than 20 ordinary. But I hope he decides to move more and move less. <br /> <br /> Is it worth seeing? Of course. There is very little joy in the film. However, it is a long, long film, and finally you can feel that someone is less used in life.
