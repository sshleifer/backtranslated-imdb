After years passed by large companies, a new darkness accumulates for parts of the world. Cash, a female cyborg, is traveling to a doctor outside to find out that she is pregnant. Cyborg 3: The Recycler third (and last), Cyborg 3 (The Cycle) tries to find a way to Cytown, a mythical shelter for Cyborgs. To access the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally planned for UNIVERSE CULTURES but was often re-written into the standard post-apocalyptic martial-art fest that has become something of a cult classic due to scenes of cat moving. CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that really enhanced with its predecessor, but was widely seen (and rejected by fewer people who saw cheap bait). <br /> This movie was to be part of the first two films that work for something (first, the second is an attractive Cyberpunk story), but unfortunately, both numbers fall short. <br /> <br /> The budget was lower than CYORG 2. The film was shot around old industrial buildings to protect costs, as the desert evacuated (like many post-apocalyptic motion films of the 1990s). <br /> <br /> The film's story, in a pregnancy device, pregnant kiborgu, is as absurd as it is, but this is not the first attempt at trying this idea, but anime OVA series ARMITAGE III wider. But the film falls into the same trap as the victim of a very low budget intelligence film, in fact, bayonets (synthetic organisms) are more than anodes. Visual effects are more than prosthetic weapons and makeup effects. <br /> <br /> The player is a pretty standard for this type of movie, the leading actress (Xrystyne Haje) is the worst performer on the screen. Instead of bringing joy to the news, she carries all the neat and strange moves as she gets pregnant. His co-stars are better, Malcolm McDowell is the usual gangster type that enhances the scenes he has seen and has many fun with Richard Lynch as the head-hunter. Especially notes that Andrew Byniarski will play Lynchin's right hand, and then the Texas Chainsaw MASSACRE remake & prequel will also appear.
