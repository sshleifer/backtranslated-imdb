Herculis Puaro is generally well-established "hero" and we know books and films well. This movie or this story does not work and I do not feel Agatha's mistake. Casting is not good, the actors are exaggerating and making foolish moves, and the purest and spectacular mysterious drama for the sophisticated spectator who thinks that the suits seem to be fake and that this movie can be perceived as a comedy twice. Herculis Puaro plays a wonderful actor but is a fantastic thing. The scenes are as perfect and fake as they were before. Despite the mystery of a story hero, the Iraqi weak and dark blonde woman is interested in the death of 45+ women, but it is not as spectacular as that! Not like "victim".
