The Cold Case ran for the first time on Danish television for about a year. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus> True fair morality and It was a pain behind non-standard actors with morality. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that it is not possible for a lot of money to be given to a group of investigators to solve the crimes of 10-20-30 years, or even 60 years. <br /> <br /> Time is just about 50 minutes to tell 60 minutes, probably, if they are currently living, they need to interrupt their work and restore time to recover justice from family members. <br /> <br /> It was combined with showing a complete irreversibility with the "personal" problems and the links with the investigators who had time to leaf. <br /> <br /> I give a 2 star rating for the latest music, it's really the only reason to watch it .... you will certainly not do it, because this TOO causes this shit.
