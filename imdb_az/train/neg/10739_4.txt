There is everything we can expect from the movie "Iedereen Beroemd" directly from the movie. A story about a man who believes his daughter will be a star. One thing that needs to be done is to cover it with scenes, cameras and journalists. It is a simple plan that you need to kidnap and blackmail some. The problem with the film is not a basic composition but how it is set up. Everything should be funny, but it is not. Unusual and calm, heroes are inconsiderate, and the last row is completely heartless or emotionless. The last sequence is probably the only scenario you feel like laughing, but how sad that all these things are.
