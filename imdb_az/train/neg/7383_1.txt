I feel blessed to have what's known as the worst Steven Seagal movie. I knew that when Steven opened his mouth and when someone else's voice came out. In the middle of the film, I began to hurt my eyes and dropped my cafe in an irresistible laugh. <br /> Steven Steven (with variable voice) and his role as totally incredible as ever. Is there someone in hell with her dying daughter birds and armored troops in Qala? She always writes to women of all ages that they have been at least incredible love for at least 20 years. All supporting actors appear to be stuck in the dark - btw, have they shot a movie with a torch to light it in the dark? <br /> <br /> This is really disgusting in every possible way. Invite all your friends around and create a public event from it - it's really special.
