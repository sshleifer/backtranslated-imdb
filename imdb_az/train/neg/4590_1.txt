Everyone who studies any physics or knowledge of science hates me, like me and my wife, in 40 minutes. The ignorant masses can have fun with the arguments that give up science, and the absurd "consequences" that come from real science (even for an illogical reason). I am frustrated by this nonsense presented to the name of "science". Only writers think that they received a quantum physics book, did not understand a word, then followed Matrix a thousand times and started writing this movie. <br /> <br /> For example, in Washington, criminal trials were carried out by the Transcendental Meditation Program. It will reveal the science of a short research method. (http://www.freedomofmind.com/resourcecenter/groups/t/tm/dissenter.htm) <br /> <br /> You can save your money.
