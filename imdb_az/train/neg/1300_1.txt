This movie has never been. Honestly, I have not seen it, I have a serious suspicion. Although the filmmaker has shot many films in the Netherlands, it is not a great actress and is a television personality that is a constant smile and very self-critical because of the young woman who has taken the main part. Recently, I was the actor who played the other key part of the Bride Flight, and though this movie was better, I was not even convinced of it. I did not read the novel based on the story to start with, but the script placed under the film is something that can be done with a rainy Sunday afternoon considering the children's birthday party. At the same age as a good filmmaker to watch a good movie. Something that really bothered was overturned dialogues, often called. My respect goes to the cameraman, at least trying to get something. Unfortunately, if the movie is made incorrect, sometimes the scenes are more convincing.
