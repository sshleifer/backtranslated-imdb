This movie shows a clip that shakes an animal vibrant animal, hacked by a machete and getting its skin disassembly. I know these terrible things happen around the world, but watching movies do not really happen on the screen. <br /> <br /> These live animal clips are not in the movies, they must show people belonging to certain organizations to help people deal with the horrors of other species. <br /> <br /> This should be banned and destroyed. I also contacted Netflix and other resources to get this movie out of the market <br /> <br /> This movie should be deleted from the public. The filmmaker needs psychological help.
