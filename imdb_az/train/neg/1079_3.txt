I'm in a city that is dissatisfied with Branak's performance. He was a good actor with many accounts, but he could not just pull his South accent. I mean, it was a pity. He believed that it was very difficult to be Yank. One of the previous reviewers has asked US actors not to participate in this film. The second is that understanding. Players / actresses are eager to expand their horizons, but the performance is very tense, which is a tough thing to do. Maybe he was Altman, but he was such a great director ... <br /> Of course, I do not want much to make Branag completely unkind. Everyone deserves to leave here and there. However, it is difficult to watch something very boring if you want to drown in a chicken or eat a better pumpkin than Gingerbread Man.
