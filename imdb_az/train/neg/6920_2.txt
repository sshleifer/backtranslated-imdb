Body Slam (1987) is a plain terrible film. Low budget reeks, directional pedestrian (best), and writing and acting are liars. But if you go into the old school wrestling (from the mid-1970s to 80) then you'll have more fun than the average audience. I have to warn you that this movie is wrong on ice. I gave it twice because I felt that I was generous. It was "directed" by the turkey stunt master Hal Needham. These stars are Roddy Piper, Tonga Kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c-list players (Dirk Benedict). <br /> <br /> This "movie" is a "rock about an entrepreneur who wants to combine hair" and wrestling. But these are those who do not want others to succeed. There are more, but I do not want SPOIL for you. If you are saddened by bad behavior and good faith, there are a few surprises in the end for the wrestling fans. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this to my bad enemy (and I would say that).
