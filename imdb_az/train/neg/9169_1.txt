It gets too bad. Only half the way the quality of payment is affected by the thousands of bullets used during filming. Everywhere there are mistakes in the context. Acting is terrible, it saves Kirk. This story kills the movie when it's no longer a corpse, believing that holey like a bullet and a movie is a video game. All this is a loss of your life. I would give it zero, which is a choice of rating.
