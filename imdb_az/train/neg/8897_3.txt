When I see this movie for the first time, I remember when it happens I was in the sixth grade. Before I saw this, I listened to Broadway registration here and really liked it! But when I saw it, what happened to me? This movie is missing many songs from the music to cry aloud! <br /> <br /> I really am a great admirer of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the worst music ever to do! The movie resembled one of the most beautiful Scottish mountains in Hollywood. And heck decided to cut all the Meg songs of the movie? <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, Lerner and Lowe would probably wonder: "Who in the world has decided to do this in our masterpiece?" It would be nice if Hollywood was probably crazy when they converted their great music to this empty movie. <br /> <br /> Sing and song Mr. Kelly, in a word, if you want a good movie to be based on music by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this is not one! <br /> <br /> 3/10
