This is utancomely filthy and awesomely shy for a Canadian. We produce good wine. Our writers and poets are the best in the world. National Ballet has been rated among the five best in the world. BUT THE BLOOD SEARCH ACTION! This is not particularly bad. Especially typical and typically bad, at two-bit hotel and thin in public parks, at high school level, and "gee whiz ... what does this button do on the camera?" photography. Michael Moriarity was going to make a Jack Nicholson personality, he could not at least make a good Jack Nicholson personality identity? If the film was really hit in Vancouver, one of the most beautiful cities in the world and the center of a yacht building ("part of the field"), why would not this endemic Canadian vulnerability complex in God's name want to be concealed? Seattle ??? I'm just stupid about this movie, I was embarrassed and a bit embarrassed. The Australians did some good things. We produce ambitious second degree piffle. Gawd !!!!!
