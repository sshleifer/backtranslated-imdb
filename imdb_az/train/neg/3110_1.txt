I usually go to this webpage before I go to the movies and I want to see what other people think about the movie. I read many reviews, saying "Thriller is not a horror movie". It wanted me to try this movie. I really should consider the issue of "tension / horror". I almost went and asked for money and if you are a lot of reviewers this garbage is good .... you should be good, easily satisfied! At the end of the film, people behind me said loudly that they "spent time", and I answered them and said "I could not finish it better". I was expecting something to happen ... but it was not. There were many good scary potentials (they were thrilled, though), but nothing happened. Williams had worked pretty well on this part, but I felt a short change. Protect your money, this is a turkey that will join you in the 'bargain box' of a DVD store near you in the very near future!
