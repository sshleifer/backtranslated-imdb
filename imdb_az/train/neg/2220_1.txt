What is hell? This film grieves! I earned more than every minute. I tried to watch the latter because I hope at least something will happen! Instead, I was surprised to find out how the latter was treated so well ... What is this story about this bloody "bogeyman"? Why can not he come and die? A bloody man for God! A kid who killed his smart sister 15 years ago. Then what? Did he stay immortal in a psychiatric hospital? This movie has a seductive foolishness ... This silliness is a must. I'm going to sell it back for an error guy who will understand this unreasonable movie.
