One of the worst scenes I have seen for a long time. I'm not sure if it's too awful, whatever the start or value of the start. The area is a real problem and I apologize for 'Sly' while performing a decent performance for myself. But that area ... Oh darling oh darling. In particular, I love the end of a helicopter on the way to the top of a mountain lane. A day or a climb takes you five minutes! I can: But it is not worth it. Apart from the unusual opening (even predicting the outcome of a five-year-old man), the rest will move. I'm sorry about the nations, but it's as bad as filming.
