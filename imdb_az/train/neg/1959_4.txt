Gear Peri belongs to the dream of a witch who is old deformed and gives the children the prize for their teeth and then to their home to continue their lives. The first few minutes will introduce you to the beginning of the legendary dance legend in 1949, and then switch to today. The horror of the horror is rescued by those who are very strong. They could do without Hammond brothers and without a few other scenes, but in general the hero scenes were bloody, but they were rapidly diminishing. Eye confetti is also good for both breeds. The camera work is good. Dialogue is fair but unloving. I was expecting the film to be a bare bone, low budget, slasher with very low paid factors. I was surprised by the quality of the movie.
