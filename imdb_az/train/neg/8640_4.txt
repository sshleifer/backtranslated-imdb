I watched 3/4 of this movie and why did I get so horrible views? It was easy to watch (3). There was a good cast - the role of Kevin Dillon's serial killer was very convincing - he was both cool and cold. <br /> <br /> This is your typical stalker / tension movie. A married couple can not afford silver to go to a fertility clinic for help. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the film is good enough ... We see Conan grows. to grow up and make a perfect family with the mother. Of course, things do not work as planned. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes were just terrible. I'm fairly tolerant with movies (especially on 3!) But I'm surprised how bad the end is. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I will not be able to sit still (except my end). <br /> <br /> Kevin Dillon's role is one of the best serial killer. <br /> <br /> Try watching other channels before watching it. But if there is nothing good, give it a try .. =)
