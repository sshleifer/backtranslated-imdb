This movie was pretty bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel, so I watch all the original movies playing. I do not know if this movie can be renamed. Starting a zoo / theme park on a distant island is quite familiar. What's up, yes, Jurassic Park. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; One of them, as one of the worst special effects I've ever seen, is a very horrible death. At the outset, there is a scientist who wants to make as many swords of teeth as possible to enjoy people, and three of them have already fled and have been invited by the tourists to eat or tigers the first person to come in. Again Jurassic Park sounds like. The expensive thing was the 1000 lb sword teeth around her fore legs, which was shot dead by a seductive scientist who had been killed by a dentist and passed through a boy's neck. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining death I have seen on television. <br /> <br /> Acting is very unattractive, special effects are terrible CG tigers are almost clay mo For example, when trying to escape from college students, he uses an ax to break a door, enter the ax, and hear about 2 seconds later. This movie was pretty bad. Lovely deaths were pretty laughable.
