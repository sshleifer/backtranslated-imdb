The statistics in this movie have been studied well. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore, of course, very well presents his work and is not surprised by the praise of this film. Al Gore is certainly a pretty actor. So worry. But the actions are more strange than words! <br /> <br /> In this film, there are references to his political career and his political career split throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is not the talk of the speaker, but also. <br /> <br /> According to US Energy Secretary Richard Carter, in order to ensure energy security, he turned the thermostat in the White House and wore a sweater. <br /> <br /> Al Gore should save us energy, while global warming travels on his personal jet. How much energy does its jet use and how much of its jet can create pollution? How much energy does it take to heat the back of Gore's pool? It would be great if we could save energy and use it to extinguish anything that was not used by using small appliances. However, if we did, the energy company had reacted to a 50% reduction in energy revenues and called it a "50% loss in profit", reducing its losses by increasing it by up to 50%. <br /> <br /> This film is a covert appeal to allow Big Goivernment to control everything in the name of the planet.
