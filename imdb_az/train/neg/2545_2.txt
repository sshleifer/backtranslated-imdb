This movie has laughs, so I am sure. Michael Keaton was a talent and he was funny before he decided he was a serious actor. But the most disturbing thing about this movie is how difficult it is for all heroes. In addition to the two main potentials, everyone is mad. Almost all those who lost this little town are as vulnerable as you can. If you follow and think of man, these losses should be unemployed. Moreover, the American factory employee is described as a lazy and unpleasant misfortune. I was interested in the fact that this film will be accepted by Japanese nationalists. I'm sure that eventually all of them come together, but we're not happy about a trip to get there.
