Okay, do not let my summary fool you. This movie is SUCKS HARD. But the worst movie? This film should not be forced to crush their brains to tell people. But it's no worse than Manos: the fate, the hobgobblins, the horror of the spider or the little bird film. As the film is saddened, it is terrible. With MST you can not see or experience health problems. But there are bad movies.
