On a birthday, a little boy tells his mother that he wants to go home, not his son. <br /> <br /> In some ways, Comedy De L'L'Occitane is different when filming, perhaps 60 or 70. Undoubtedly, this was a reminder of Los Angeles's Secret Ceremony (1968) and Richard Loncraine's Full Circle (1977). Both are engaged in relationships, relationships, and relationships between parents and "lost" children (in an exciting movie, Mia Farrow). <br /> <br /> All three films are full of non-sympathetic characters that behave strangely and unexplained. All three films have both an emotional and a sense of awe. All three films are directed at the mother-child relationship, and as a result, all three films are "what's real, what's the dream?" Creates a question. <br /> <br /> It is beautiful, but flawed, does not give easy answers and is very dependent, unexplained and strange.
