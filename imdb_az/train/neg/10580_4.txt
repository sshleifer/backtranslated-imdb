After seeing the DVD I saw it last week. I wanted to create an illusion that proved to be very interesting in my age. So, my dream was very small. I thought the leading player was very straightforward. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This kind of feeling Johnny Deppin demanded performance as in the 9th Gate (that is, can be completely extinguished), but television budgets are not always capable of doing so. I also thought that the direction was just mixed and boring, just to remind Carpenter that he did not make a decent film since he was in Madness Horror. When it comes to the story - well, I'm disappointed there! <br /> <br /> In my opinion, there was no way I could answer your expectations, but I thought that the profit and the explanation were poor and finally captured the film to say the least. <br /> <br /> You can say that one of the AICN's main contributors and its cinema is good, but if I did not get a better result than a good start. <br /> I brought the DVD to the DVD the same day!
