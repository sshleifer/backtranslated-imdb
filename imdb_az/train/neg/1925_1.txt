How about Ron Howard? In 1966, the animated film taught a simple lesson to children using a charming, simple field. In this film, Howard gives us a knife full of greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure his fault is not; Imagine, I imagine the scenario for a nastiest man who does not want to imagine, Carrey directed Tom Green and the result is a movie magic. Like Danny Devito in Batman, like Penguin, Carrey Grinch does not notice that it simply vomits any comedy that can be cleansed from its features. In a Grinch, a 1966 cartoon, Carrey Grinch is an angry, lifeless old man who saw us at one place or another, sitting in a car park or lying in the supermarket. The Grinch is accustomed to a degree of humanity, humor or any idea depth and the wrongdoing at the end of film rings. The whole movie is a liar: there are a few foolish Christmas lighting competitions, and Grinchin's childhood is such a horror, and why is it somehow unsuccessful to explain that some of these strange lip extensions and some of them are a unique mystery? There is none of them. Contrary to the cartoon of 1966, I thought children would find this movie full of tedious, irritating and controversial messages. Should we really see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the boat with his unwed relatives. Throw in strange jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes and other necessary Carreyesque low-eyed humor, and George W. Bush's rational, clear-cut thinking from the 1966 animated film (or inspirational book). It throws large oil on turkey.
