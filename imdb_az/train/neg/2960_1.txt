No doubt, the worst movie ever created. There is no argument here. That's it. The end of the story. The story is small and sub-moronic, seemingly astonishing at three-year dinosaurs. The whole concept is simple. Someone may find it foolish to think of something fun and fun. Sugars are also completely naked. If you have not yet seen this movie, consider yourself lucky. Do not describe it if you are curious about how bad this movie is. Words can not express how terrifying this film is. It's not as bad as being a bad movie. Even if there is no entertainment value, there is a merger. That's it. . . That's it. . . Ugh! Think of not worrying about the worst event and multiply more than 5,000 malevolence, and you're not yet as terrified as this movie. After giving Pok√©mon a movie, giving Movie a point, giving this movie a point, it does not look like nothing but a blessing. How bad is that! Producers and directors have even taken film classes? This is a perfect example of how to make a movie. This movie seems to be some amateur high in the paint thinner. If you lease it, take it back and ask for a refund. And even do not think about renting again.
