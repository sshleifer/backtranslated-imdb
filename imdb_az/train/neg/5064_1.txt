I do not believe what they did. Completely unnecessary. The first movie was good. But, of course, after a television series that is a continuation of a movie, there is no need for it later. This movie feels like a soap opera. Writing is very filthy, completely simple. These jokes do not fit, the player is straight, it is shot like a soap, there is no direction. The first film had a good emotional back. Each character was a little summer. At that time it was very simple, but it worked in some way and I saw the film's value. However, there are no related stories around this time. Heroes are mixed stereotypes and there is nothing interesting. Well, the Brazilian boy playing Axel Daeseleire's son is a very good game. This film was a moment of creative success. I have already taken a second television series for Team Spirit 2, but ask God to not let them set a third feature ...
