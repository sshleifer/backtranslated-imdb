We went to this movie because my wife used the original version of "Cute Martian". Our 6 year old daughter lived with us. She wanted to leave half of the movie with her parents! The parts we see are sometimes very soft or very humorous. This movie is accessible to children aged 9-12 years. This is definitely not suitable for small children. In my opinion, the original series was superior to what I heard and if you were going to "release the past," you would probably be disappointed.
