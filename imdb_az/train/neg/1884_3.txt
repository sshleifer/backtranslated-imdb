Fragmentaric movie about several people during the heat wave in Europe. This kind of movie is more often, and most importantly, better. These stories really resemble one another: "People are cruel". Ugly flesh, unpleasant people and really a movie that goes a long way without giving a point ... Ultra-realist? Difficult ... Boring? Indeed. Even the brilliant Franzisca Weiss can not save this! 3/10
