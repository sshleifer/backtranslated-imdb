This is not just a movie that gives you a sudden shutdown for a boring audience. This terrible scripts and errors are terrible in the left and right, it's also agonizing to watch too. Sorry, but I do not see this "fun". The excitement of showing only a few errors and fool liners. Yes, I think the first time this movie was introduced, I think about how dumb it is about the producer company. Perhaps like a sheriff, like a van, with a bloody wound, relying on a van full of antifreeze. Disease! Can I shake a shame with the burden of antifreeze that is not just a poor actor of this sheriff, but also an open body? He forgot about her when she won a very exciting victory over the snowman.
