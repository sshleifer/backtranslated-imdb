This movie is very much like "Flashdance", you know, dancing with Jennifer Beals. This movie is the most boring movie I've ever seen, because it's not bad enough to be funny. "GI Jane" is better than a movie, but it does not say much. Demi Moore here is a lot of sweat and loud music and want to see its struggle and everything, but of course not very busy. The idea behind the film is of some kind, but the script is too short and Ridley Scott can not do anything about it. Well, I said ... It's better than Flashdance ... (4/10)
