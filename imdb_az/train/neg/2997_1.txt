In 1992, a film shot by Konan Doyle's famous novel, The Lost World, was shot. And it shows that the film has just begun long enough. Undoubtedly, the lost world begins with a fierce organization that wants to return to defend the Challenger and the king from the beginning. Everyone is stranded on the plateau, and we left the first film with a weak, boring, long-term rehash. <br /> <br /> Dinosaurs are just laughing (very little). Are we planning to take this cuddly toy, which should be taken seriously with the Ankylosaur? And tyrannosaur appears rooted in place. <br /> <br /> Hold yourself a grace and a silent version of the Lost World 1925. At this stage of CGI, incredible and other advanced effects, the twenty-fourth version is the best, and will last until someone decides to do a decent achievement.
