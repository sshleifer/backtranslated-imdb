A friend recently met with NYC because I've seen a movie recently. After 30 minutes, I said to him: "Are you angry, this is a little joke?" He thought he was good. I told her that this was probably one of the coolest movies ever made. "What was it supposed to be?" I asked. "Was the propaganda film for children?" The field is stupid. Acting is the worst thing to look at this kind of trip and for most of life, love, and even life-related thoughts, and it offers incredible harmonious looks ... some psychiatric help. If someone tries to keep it in your DVD or Video player, think of it as a virus to your computer ... it will not destroy the players, but it will destroy the evening. If they did Razzies in the '40s, it won each category. (PS goes under the suspicious allegory of Stairway to Heaven).
