For those who have been forgotten or forgotten by those who have been forgotten, Disney went through almost the end of the 1980s. People have not already seen their films and the company did not produce the usual material ... at least the expectations of people. The biggest problem is blasphemy. <br /> Yeah, those crazy movies that make up Disney films over the past ten years - movies that have the soul's soul - can be wasted, including the name of the Lord, if you believe it is "family movies." Actually, it's here twice in the first 20 minutes! <br /> <br /> In addition to language problems, this movie has almost become unrivaled. Fortunately, Disney has woken up from the waking 80s and has produced a great deal of material. ("Touchstone" is Disney under another name.)
