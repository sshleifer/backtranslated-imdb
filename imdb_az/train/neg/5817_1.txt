The most difficult thing about this film is a positive thing about it. The characters were stereotypical "white-trash", the film's "plot" drowned from the start, and the worst feature of this film was that it was hilarious that the nakedness was very unhappy with the body. Unfortunately, it was only funny in the film. Ms. Jenkins should not use her life story to "amuse" people if they serve better in the future. It was just bad. One positive aspect of this film is that my brother is making money for this stinker, which has nothing to do with film quality.
