1st Watch 12/7/2002 - From 3 to 10 (Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate and Ashley work with a few more kisses. The girls are like me when I get tired of these things and they will be interested to share with them if they decide to share and go there on their own. Their adventures are interns in Rome in this episode "stylist". They put them in the post office to put them right (I think ..). Besides the typical flirting with boys, there is nothing else but the Roman script, until finally why they are put into operation, then re-employed, then dismissed, and then re-employed. It is really accepted by people who do not understand the corporate world, and this is in their commentary. Maybe the real world will have their next adventure (if any). Even my children did not believe in this dull "adventure". Let's see if they can be more than a couple of years before their legal competence. Then see what happens.
