In Bridgeport, neglected secondary school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is threatened by young student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); to kill her family to stay with her, but Richard was arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, traumatized Donna feels better, but still under psychological treatment and pills. At the Balloon Night, Pacific Grad Hotel is hosted by his wife Bobby (Scott Porter) and two couples. But psychopath Richard ran away from jail and stabbed his friends and colleagues on the road and was placed on the same floor of the hotel that followed Donna. <br /> <br /> The unforgettable "Prom Night" is a collection of clich√©s that have no overall defects. This stupid story is a shallow and silly, with a bad move by Johnathon Schaech in a terrible killer role. The predicted scenarios are extremely beautiful because it is possible to predict what happens next. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus
