Elvis Presley plays a "half-breed" native American ("Hindu"), which must be protected from troublesome businessmen. Everyone loves to be drunk, fight, and make children. War, wrestling, and stereotyping of each other are replaced by a hand-lit "How-to"? <br /> <br /> Although she is a makeup, it is clear that Elvis is healthier than it was in previous films; Perhaps he was getting ready for the famous "return." The script of this movie could not be anything to excite. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell, who wants to be deceived in his work "Stay Away" (really "Green Horses" in different words), "Elvis" and "Burgess Meredith" in "War Colors", should be embarrassed. The most embarrassing song is Elvis's "Dominic" bull-song song. There are some surreal scenes but it should not be enough trippy to succeed in this genre; <br /> <br /> Stay alive, Joe (1968) Peter Tewksbury ~ Elvis Presley, Burgess Meredith, Joan Blondell
