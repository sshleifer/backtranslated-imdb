Later, I would like to thank you very much for destroying the fond memories I used for my FORMER movie. When I was about 5 years old, I was one of the first films I ever saw. That is, I'm 16 and I feel fairly masochistic, and decided to rent this movie. So, I was able to poison all the memories of the original movie with this excuse for the film. <br /> <br /> In this film, Ariel and Eric's daughter celebrate Melody's birth and go to go to show him. everyone on the ocean ... BROADWAY STYLE! After the end of the music number, Morgana shows a sea witch and Triton threatens to kill Melody if trident does not work. So he gives it without a fight. Although Ariel is involved in the use of the sword and the melody, Eric takes a vacuum. Morgana runs, so decide what Melody will not go to the sea until Ariel and Eric Morgana are captured. <br /> Well ... uh, nothing will actually happen. Eric is a total vacation. Nothing really can do anything. Ariel is doing something sort. Melody tries to bend things. Plus, animation is a new low point for Disney. Computer graphics face background. The only opportunity for the development of the character is wasted. The songs bite. <br /> <br /> Look, do not waste your time. Little children, I believe, will even enjoy their skulls, since this is not a remote excitement. They do not want to sing a song. If you can get a copy of it, take it to the ocean and hope that no one can find it. Ever.
