We can say very little about this movie. I believe that the idea and the paper look good on the paper, but I'm afraid of filmography and performance, not the standards expected from many talented people. I'm very skeptical about these features in CV CV. Michael Caine, sometimes in the role of a doctors, was on the floor and never believed his character. The area was incredible, especially with regard to the son of the victims. Some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films, and sometimes I wondered if there was actually a nervous tension. Over time, light was dark, and it was added to a low budget movie with some of the big-name stars, and I was worried why I looked at it.
