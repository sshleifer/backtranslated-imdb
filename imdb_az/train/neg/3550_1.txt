To stop the comedy exploitation, I've worked with a group and heard the horror stories of comedian comedians to vote for the "Last Comic Standing" in the last two months. Even if there are no good mediums, more than 80% of comedians do not get the chance to be selected and are rejected before showing them their talent! If they were invited to vote, they told me that if they gave me a second chance, they would have been "predestined". Hence, television viewers are not the best novels in the US. <br /> <br /> If the comics show it on the show, most of them do not receive IMDb loans. I know it because I've given credits for the "Last Comic Standing" for all 6 seasons, and have earned money to do the work of the Producers. This is really shameful. A month ago, I asked "Last Comic Standing 7" on Facebook because the producers did not give IMDb loans, and I was banned from the Facebook page! I'm not a comedian, so I do not have any personal information, I just want people to know the truth. <br /> <br /> Comedians are exploited in HBO, BET, TvOne and other cable networks, but NBC must be ashamed of being responsible for allowing this exploitation to be the THREE THREE network. <br /> < The victim comedian: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
