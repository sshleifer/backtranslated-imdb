Oblivion sand was looking at the first 30 minutes and gave me great hopes. I went to a cheaper version of Mummy. The Board promised to fulfill the Ten Commandments of Cecil B. Demille in the 1920s. They use the real Egyptian works for the film they have put forward for an old and terrible evil (not permanent). DeMille is aware of the fact that the whole set of erosion is replaced by an ordinary practice. Hopefully, the evil will be buried all the time. Then, a team attempting to dig a site (the first mistake of the film, but costly suits and this Sci-Fi channel movie) to the day. The first look we gained from the Anubis monster did a good job, and this suit was a little effortless to the usual cheesy CG effect. Then the body starts counts. This movie went to the south for me. Reactions to the terrible and strange death of people are subject to harassment. Once they realize that the old evil has been revived and killed, what is the question of the man and woman's leading shareholder? They "stop knowing the truth but do not tell anyone". After gaining this important information, do they share it with friends in the drilling area? No, they stand in a hotel for a striking shower and some nice words. I'm not really the most motivating person, but if I knew that a devil from ancient Egypt had fallen into a deserted place and that he had killed everyone in the eyes and that he would come after me, I had not dropped a little. After this extreme and dull middle part, they turn around to destroy the Anubis monster in an ordinary way, to jump around the surroundings and shoot with a rocket shooter while standing with a phosphorus bomb. For a Sci-Fi movie, they were above a usual excuse they produced. If some people write an unfavorable article for me, it can be a lot more.
