This movie has a beautiful look at Danielle Petty. It has stunning green eyes and is in the first few stages and on the final stage. This is the only thing that is not surprising about the film. <br /> <br /> <strong> The movie is a movie that does not offer anything except itself. It's a good job if you do not have a good film or a good journalistic report. There is no skill in his production. It's like a bad student film. The horrible elements of the story do not make you sick, it is a very bad situation that creates the disease. I would give this movie ZERO stars.
