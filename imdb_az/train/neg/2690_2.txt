Hey, if you have more than an hour to kill and dye it is very exciting. If you like cheap b-movies like me, it's good for a giggle! Apart from this, I will not offer you a rental, and I will not wait until the round-the-clock clock on the cable / satellite provider's free access channel. This group, which made this soundtrack, was on the road about two years after the flick and did not sound as poor as it looked at two small towns in the city. That is a bit better, but it is good to watch the grass very entertaining, but do not want to see a low-budget movie.
