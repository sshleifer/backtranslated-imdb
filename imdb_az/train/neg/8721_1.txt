We're sorry, but it's just sad. A little girl was a brat, they did not have the pleasant symbols and the structure was sucked. At the same time, the film did not even tell us whether we wanted to convince us. If you check any complete instructions on the Reptiles, you will find that it is really a Crocodile, not a gator. Of course, they did not hire a real animal expert or knew that the creature was a croc. It's a sad excuse for a movie. Especially ending. I fell asleep about it.
