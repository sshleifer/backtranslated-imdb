A former, with a sick brother and a former girlfriend, climbs to a rehab addict. The "Life Dramas" presented here are presented in the easiest way (even when writing is not bewildered or not). The cast is smiling and attractive to the actors of attractive-looking music and photography (several visual effects are laughable, the indian-clich touches a reed bed). Although written and managed by a man, this is a woman prepared and I'm not sure, but I think these two men can come to our outer siblings and never see the natural, non-existent picture. This is an attempt to be a male affair, but a careful, sterile presentation is a deception. No one in his heart, living, breathing, or bleeding from this material. The "Perfect Son" is often dispersed in the kitchen by many chefs.
