Beautiful Christina Galbo is trying to escape from the isolated boarding school, which was brought to the fore in 60 minutes. Is a monster, a dark gloves a kind of strangeness to think about killing or supernatural evil? No, he runs away from a band. CAUTION After 40 minutes, candelabras tells the very self that the candelabras is walking around the school and looking for excitement or anxiety, keeping it in the dark, but it's more than just about great films about it, but in a better way, Alain Resnais tells the characters wandering around the corridors and stairs or you know better how to illuminate this staircase? We know that a killer is the perimeter of the school, but if the number of corpses is small and sparse and there is no visual horrors waiting to be found in the gialo, we will not experience the disastrous secrets / conscious secrets behind a faucet and want to be the god of La RÃ©sidencia cinema, but it does not know how. . We know something, because the girls are reported missing, but "nothing is wrong here, man" says that we never come to the mysterious atmosphere before. Serrador, when she tries to comment on the sexual pressure of the girl, she is often shocked by the hysterical and "shocking" music players in the background when doing so with her eyes and lips. Unlucky beauty and longing for PICNIC's HANGING ROCK can not be found here. Anyone who has no real meaning or no sense in the direction is a little calm and unimportant. Many people are presented as suspects, but there are very few reasons to care for the identity of a murderer who is not aware of the characters in the film. First, I love killing, a description of a knife that is targeting, a miserable face of a victim, like a bare jaw in the background, and above all for my taste. Do I have to say that Serrador works better with paranoid du Soleil that killed children and children?
