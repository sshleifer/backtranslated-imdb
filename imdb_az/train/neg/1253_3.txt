I read somewhere that Hollywood should pay attention to the restoration of bad movies and the release of classics alone. We can only hope. Although this remake is not a total waste, I want to get six dollars back to go to the original DVD. Violence and one of the worst I've ever seen. This version does not add anything new. Hollywood should just leave good products.
