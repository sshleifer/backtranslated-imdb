No, I do not have fun. If no movie ideas are offered, they should be dropped off from the studio. I'm serious. Their films are exactly the same in each one, and they are only traveling to outer space, easily solving a problem, getting popular and getting new friends. Think about it. If you have never seen a movie with a different structure, contact me and say the name. These "movies" are poor prerequisites for being on TV and going to other countries. There is one reason why films go to theaters. I'm sure that when you are really young and some O.K. movies, some studio bosses have bought everything for 15 years, so they can film when they're 17 years old when they want to shoot in other countries. Give me advice, stay away from MARY-KATE and ASHLEY! FOR USE!
