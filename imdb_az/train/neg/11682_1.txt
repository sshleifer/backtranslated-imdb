Is not that right now? Considering all the good work done by Daneel, Clive, and Jodie, the film has never become more of a terrible die-hard / heist movie copy. Yes, there are no double jokes, no unexpected folds, there are only unexpected moments to be honest, because both the director and the editor have made some mistakes, it's a shame for them and we have time to spend. If someone can tell you that they know this on Earth, knowing that they have a safe hole in the earth, that Rebe is hell, and know that science is in a special cell, Spike may ask for things to do with us, and something foolish it does not lift our eyebrows when it looks ... its another studio agreement is to relax and enjoy the movie ...
