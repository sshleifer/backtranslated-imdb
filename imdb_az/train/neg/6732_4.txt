I discovered this movie at IFC and thought it would be interesting. For "little" love stories, some of these stories are really drifted in this movie. Although none of these women have names, she doubts that actresses talk about her real sexual life, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I have to admit, when Odette Sinclair's acquaintances first began to think of romantic views of sex for the first time, as was the case in Strike! (1998), and Tweety said, "It was beautiful?" <br /> <br /> Some Re-enactments and flashbacks may think that this movie will improve. I think everything will go even worse. My focus is not to have a heavy punch, but somehow I expect more.
