This was one of the lamest films we have been watching over the predicted plot line in the past few months and pretty badly influencing (mostly supporting characters). Hugh Laurie's interview with the DVD was really rewarded by the movie itself ... <br /> <br /> Hugh Laurie has made a lot of effort to learn how to dance Samba, but his character is just a matter of hacking at the pool's note. The film is based on the look of your favorite girl and great music, but it's not enough to make good fun. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen Rio or a British bank ever, this is for you. 10 out of 2.
