Although I did not have any idea of ​​what to expect from this film, I had no idea where this hell was, but actually something. Once upon a time I heard of his existence, everything I knew was to have a movie called Do not Eat Daddy. Unfortunately, under the alternative title, I could find a copy under Island Fury. When I looked back, I lost it after I lost it. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Only the early 80s are actually flashback, which can actually be longer than non-flashback First, two teenage girls are pursued by two bad guys, and once the bad guys are around the neck of one of the girls, there is a coin over there, and some of these bad guys know a lot of these coins hidden in one place and everything is strange that these guys talk about a trip to the island just a few years ago when they were 10 years old I believe girls should know exactly where this alleged treasure is, so now we are in the past, girls are trying to pull back their steps, In the flashback, their 10-year-old colleagues are traveling on a boat with sisters and sisters, ending up by an island for an air of air, and mixing with a few children and their killer and grandmothers. . <br /> <br /> Any potential tension or persistent reasoning never seems to be, but the flashback is still so good to say so much. <br /> For a while, there was a story, at one point, probably the director, and I thought that it would take half an hour to shorten when it was over for me. Insignificant film inside this flawless film finally ends, and real things happen, but it's stupid. I do not know, I do not expect a movie full of foolish kids or a similar movie, but I was expecting a kind of B-fun, mostly simply a confused, confusing story with others. My advice will be to look for something worthwhile as the Beast Creatures attack. No one would just invite me to a serious B-movie collector, all of them, and most of them have an interesting brain injury. What really gets me is still saying, "Why Do not Babies Eat"? 3/10
