Yikes hurt this movie. The characters were weak, the pots were weak. I thought Christoper Walken would not be too bad, because oops. He did it, because he was bored and in need of money. This symbol must have been Irish, but no one was accustomed to Ireland. I do not want to find anything desperate about this without hope, except Walken did a wonderful job with a wooden character. Find or discover something to read, never see this movie.
