<br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "> </ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; "> DQ: Otherwise, Mr. MÃ¼kamaz will be working longer, IC champion Kerry von Erich has fallen here, and it was a third quarter where he had a perfect job, remember that he did not leave any games before him. <br /> <br /> The second game was very good, probably the best of the night, Ted DiBiase and Undertaker were perfect, while Jim Neidhart had one of the WWF's offices, with Honky Tonk Man marking Koko B. Ware, a new heel (Big Bossman and Yokozuna remembers the tradition of being the first to remind, which led Brett Hart's single career as he returned to one of them twice and almost survived the match, and he and DiBiaz met the wrestling club and dashed the point of the match with DiBiazan's Dusty Rhodes they have forgotten that a game. <br /> <br /> Although the visionaries are the first team where all members live, and only z 87 had the fourth survivor in 87 '), this was not a single match, and it was the longest match of the night and Jake repeated his performance '88' when he was alone and dominated by the fourth man. I think he can actually have a frustration. <br /> <br /> These days, the game would end in another way around. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest SS encounters was one of the most striking. Tito Santana was perhaps the least known wrestler, an inspiring wrestler of the night, and captured Warlord in Boris Zukhov, Tanaka and even the last survival match. So it was strange to go to his career after putting something so strange. Sgt. The massacre did well to get rid of Volkoff and Bushwhackers, but this is not just a surprise. <br /> <br /> I think that the only point in the life of the game is to win Hogan and Warrior at the end. <br /> <br /> This show was rich and the matches were also very short. The Undertaker's debut was cool, but Tito Santana is one of the reasons I remember.
