I watched this movie recently on DVD and I was not impressed. I know that there is a taboo to beat independent films, but this is no fun. <br /> <br /> The stage was interesting, but its execution was short. I thought, "I thought, they just come in, the story will soon take off," I thought. Before I knew it, the movie was finished and the story was never accepted. We can say that I have found the most effective ones. It was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> "Star Wars" trilogy is not bad, but it is bad. <br /> <br /> I do not know when I work, I'll take two hours (because it's a safe assessment). Anyway, after the movie was over, I felt that I was worthy of being recognized for the power I could use to keep the movie from falling and going down half. <br /> Again, and as a result, I was squeezed out of my thoughts. I'm not one of the fastest people in the film, and I'm not the one to ask for explosions, so do not start because I love it.
