Well ... in general, this movie was incredibly despicable and a horror film that ended up being a comedy mostly. I just rented this movie last night when I and my friends went to the movie looking for a scary movie. This is not necessarily what we are looking for but it satisfied us with humor. The actors of this movie (especially Brandon) are very funny, it's funny. Especially when Tracy's daughter sat in the room where she would be away from the clown. They have almost no emotion, and they are known to act. Also, the clown looks out of that black box paper and does not seem to be scared, even though Mark has captured the clown and begins to attack him. Seriously, if you were to be punished, would you just JOGGING? I would be sprinting for my life! (Even if everyone can get out of the clay for 300 pounds). I do not imagine that Denis and Tracy will throw Denise back in the head when the clown shoots Susan's head in the woods, then throws her head up. As with the previous one, the start does not mean that it is completely NO and I do not even see why it enters the movie. So, what was this movie in 2003? The music was called in the 1980s and the camera-ing (?) Does not really look really professional. Half of the time seems to be that the camera will not remain stable as it looks. Generally I enjoyed the movie. I'm trying to find something to scare you up, but if you're looking for something, have fun or smile, I recommend it.
