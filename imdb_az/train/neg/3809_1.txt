This show is just annoying! I'm sorry for the players trying to be funny (especially Bob Saget), trying to cover laughter sad gossip and the "Awwww" trail comes in the most unnecessary moments. Very dramatic children, especially Olsen twins, are no exception. And this is a show clich√© city. If you could search the word, you would read the "Full House". At the end of each story line there is a "life lesson" to be learned. A neat conversation makes everything even better, and even the most bratty child's ability to make the GASP a better way has not been achieved in real life. I do not know if anyone can watch this show, do not condemn the characters' behavior or the smile. myself say on television that "THIS IS NOT FUNNY / SAD / CUTE" Life was really like this, the world will fall apart.
