After seeing "The Victory of the New Year," I can say that this movie is terrible, and even measured at least "standards" of history. Of course, this is totally fictitious and harmful. Something about the German propaganda of the 1930s. Unfortunately, the quality of the presentation itself is hackneyed and inexpensive. Modern Germans should even leave the theater that holds their noses. In a genre known for its lack of identity and unapologetic incorrectness, this film is not even considered "bad." To achieve this, we need to improve significantly!
