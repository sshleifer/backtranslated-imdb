Although Bruce Willis is worth watching a movie all the time, it's better to skip this one. I watched it on television, so I earned money. <br /> <br /> If your spouse is 30 minutes or so convincing, it will be more incredible until the end. It is very doubtful if a major soldier like Lt Waters will not be subject to direct orders. And even if it were the rest of his sentence. They know that they are directly threatened and know that if they obey him, they will die, but what is he? <br /> There are still some beautiful scenes in this movie. They generally rescue the population from a village where the rebels were killed. Yes, they keep many peasants, so the rest are already killed. Strangely, the rebels said they took the truck back. They stand up. Perhaps the roads are dangerous, there is no explanation for that. Anyway. <br /> <br /> This film was offended by his brain and was therefore incredible that a group of seven soldiers could be killed by many soldiers. they can hurt themselves or be killed. Only a few close friends have died. And it needs to fight with an army of only 500 or more. <br /> <br /> Many of them are fighting a single army, killing hundreds, and only mislead themselves. And they have their warship and round. Never run out of time. Bomb and claymore mine, an M60 machine gun and even an RPG. Where do they get these? Go around or what? There is even a laptop showing the activity of enemy rebels. And this laptop has a battery that lasts for a long time. Really? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < / STRONG> If not, go from it. It saves time.
