Adrian just left the shelter, rich and parentless, his life seemed empty. One day, her mother gets acquainted with Gonzalo, a poor boy who prostitutes. Gonzalo is hopeless to earn some money, helping find Adriana's life and his parents. This is a new director's film and most of the film perfectly understood: the scenes are not directed properly, dialogues are a bit difficult, some incoherences in the script ... Anyway, the end is unexpectedly good (good, just a bit) and a little movie. Actors are known and of high quality, yet they do not inspire enough to make the film interesting; all made better documents in another film. The results of the movie are elegant and maybe you will spend most of the time thinking of how long it will take before the end. Of course, there are many bad movies, but I'm sure there are many better ones.
