Amelia and Michael are deceptive married couples. Amelia has a long time lover in the hospital, and Michael is working on a whore that does not agree with her. <br /> <br /> After the past, they resemble each other. <br /> <br /> There is not much in this short time. Movement is straight and forward, dramatic, good, actress is sincere, but the story remains a little bit. Why do these two people pay attention? <br /> <br /> It is difficult to see how this story came from another story of intrigue, it is no exception that it is more parallel and does not mean the meaning inside it (if there is something, the pace may change rapidly). <br /> <br /> I do not know, it's not possible to join these stories because I've never been to them. But the difference in these stories is usually the same, meaning that they talk with couples. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
