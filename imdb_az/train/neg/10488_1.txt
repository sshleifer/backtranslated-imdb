Elvis left the building and he was successful because he had not watched this unusual stinker. After the scene, stage director Joel Zwick finds ways to make even more fun in an extraordinary script. This movie full of unforgettable deaths, full of short gay characters and hacking jokes is more hopeless than fun. This is a hope that Kim Basinger has made Doris Day an early retirement. Let's remember her (talented) way and whatever. David Leisure, tasty Dennis Richards and the rest of the talent here are wasted. Zwick finds a way to minimize all his abilities. The boy playing Elvis sounds more than the King more than Gomer. Only a really good part of the cast is a young girl playing Basinger as a preteen. She really looks like her and is really pretty good. Another reason to watch this movie is to look for Tom Hanks community. The whole community is not funny, but at least it's not painful. It is worth to be surprised that Zwick has been abused by something that Hanks or this movie would do.
