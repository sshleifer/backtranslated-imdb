When I really meant to have a good post on this movie, I really did not live up to it; the problem is clear, that it is prepared according to a specific interpretation of the verse. One comment will deceive many people in my opinion. In addition, I'm a movie maniacam and those who act in this movie can not be completely admitted. I never wanted to give a negative result to a movie. So, if you want to be publicly advertised by those without authority, then take this movie. This comment is also a warning for people who love or love tremp because the title is deceiving many people. It was a failed film, because it was the main idea and the opportunities were wasted. The only paid quality of the movie is that I understand that the character in Time Machine should not be a little more moral than the direct behavior of the future.
