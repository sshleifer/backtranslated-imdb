Another nail in the coffin of this straight-to-duffer Rick Moranis career. Like the Disney tradition, quality is quickly sacrificed to make money; Moranis is a lazy pressure that can accidentally diminish himself and some of his relatives, repeating the best scenes from the original film. There are immediate visual effects and a small dialogue that does not give me no grass for the "The Incredible Shrinking Man", where nothing has been done, but such things are done properly. This falling shock is driven by the top cinematographer Dean Cundey, or should be chosen during the daytime or the next better material.
