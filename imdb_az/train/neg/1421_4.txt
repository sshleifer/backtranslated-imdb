I had leased the dubbing-English version of Lensman, so there would be some articles after it came from well-known novels. Despite being instructed in the film, the kiddie did not rise above the cartoon level. Perhaps the film was a bad adaptation of the book or lost a lot of dubbing versions. Or maybe the source novels were also light. But there was not much there, no matter what. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of details, derivative, neat, poorly dramatized, or otherwise. Some examples: The opening scenes were taken from the Star Gate in 2001 and the Star Wars image of the hyperspace. The robot in the bush looked like anthropomorphized "R2-D2". <br /> <br /> This is Star Wars trying to compensate for the comic relief style, but with grace (because it does not work). comedy and plays serious. <br /> <br /> In this regard, it is superior to Star Wars franchise, which has started with a clever sense of humor and eventually crushed Jar-Jar's crushing silliness. <br /> <br /> Agricultural details have never been seen by anyone. Seeding from the one hand to the other, and the silos that do not spill over into the already-assembled lines or into a truck, is the removal of a sack out of a non-agglomerated product, and the release of the silo to undisturbed plants. <br /> <br /> When it was necessary for her to face the fate of her father, there was no drama on the stage. This could have been part of a guilty voice in English, but the drawings did not show much weight. Kim's reactions on that stage are unique. <br /> Similarly, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris was likely to be close, but reacted very little. (Henderson's death is not a spoiler, its name is not disclosed until the scene.) He immediately forgets it. The expression of happiness of anybody makes it more sense. I think the voice actor is the most deserving of sin in this case; <br /> <br /> Several times, villains can not fulfill their commands. A legend leader frequently punishes these failures with pernicious deaths. <br /> <br /> I can not say that the memory has been removed from the war, or if it comes from a previous source, it is probably Lensman's book. <br /> <br /> The cosmic ship has an accidental scene. When you get down to the ground, the parts break the ship. <br /> <br /> In many cases, even though Chris seems to be a competent, harsh place protagonist, she has a sad scene, an inexperienced girl in a difficult situation. Someone who has a difficult time to escape Henderson's death, say, "Help, take me and we can not get my gun!" <br /> <br /> Character DJ with the most personalities (sometimes too often). Bill. It's Wolfman Jack, D.J. it sounded like. American Graffiti. <Span style = "font-size: The explosions were unimpressive, and Star Wars seemed to have been inspired by many, but according to his credit, the cause of the explosion was completely different from Death Star's main weapon. There was a good, interesting explanation for the cause of the dialogue, and many other explosions in the film looked good, not just planetary explosions. <br /> <br /> Some of the sound effects from video games in the late 1970s were very unattractive. it looks like primitive video games and may have some effects from the Tron, but the sound effects are very pleasing, though it emphasizes the cheese sounds. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a story, it's art, it's good to go away often from cheese graphics, and if a movie tells a good story, it faces a lot of production defects. But the plot was pretty light here, and a na√Øve boy tries to help someone with an eight-dimensional spacecraft and he has a great deal of incomprehensible power. He and his many immoral companions are fighting against a powerful, vicious enemy. He is friendly, learns his special power, and becomes a young person. If he is sufficiently durable and good, he can even defeat the enemy. Information on the road can raise such a story beyond simple imagery, but there is less in this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, this is a kiddie cartoon. But then there is no need to be anything more than the main targeted audience is great guys.
