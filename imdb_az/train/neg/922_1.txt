This movie is really the exact thing you get when you extend your skills - it's just like someone who has passed the driving test and then hitting the Formula One Grand Prix (I can add that the US Grand Prix can be just because of dangerous tires ), the shorter the movie. Now this is not a wrong way, I love B-Movies, and about half of my collection is B-Films, but I do not think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this film is. The first of the story (for the B-movie) is not that bad, it has the potential to make a B-Movie brand, but does not talk about 13 potential on Friday, but the potential is minimal. <br /> <br /> In short, I do not believe anything like watching the QVC, except QVC presenters make it harder. I say I've seen the worst movies, but I can not.
