Well ... I would continue to wait until I went to video to see this video, and I would really like it when I was caught watching a horror movie in the daytime cables and I was more like the same thing as the CRACK Airplane ... I was on Airplane or any other Leslie Nielsen vehicles will probably be in the sky, but if you are usually used for WAYANS COMEDY, you will be dissapointed, much more. Young hormones will catch candy teenagers in this eye happy, probably this is a box office it was. I had eaten 2 times more than the scary movie, and one part was five times more. Perhaps it is better than 3 is the 2nd part, but it's always better than Halloween 2, and I liked the original. The funniest part of the film should be the way to tell foreigners. But it was not worth the $ 11 he spent with my fianc√©e to catch a math of it. Protect yourself from cash and connect the second part to the cable again. Until the video is released on the ribbon, then rent it, do not buy it.
