This movie was written very badly and I was thirty minutes sleeping in my directorship. The jokes in the movie are fragile, and even though some aspects are very interesting, it is very far away and at some points - ridiculous. Whether you are 11 or older, you will be disappointed in the movie, but if you are under 10, this will be a highlight and I'll be surprised by all the stunts (I can add to it) and I wish you were a warrior. The filming in this movie was not very good and the music was very disappointing, because they tried to create tension, but did not fit anything. It is a moving song in this movie on scale 1-10 (10 excellent, 1 horrible). 4. Brenda's song is talented in comedy, but in some of the more serious scenes of this kind of film, his actress is laughable. When he created some of the "fight" poses, I laughed loudly. In my opinion, the worst thing about this film is absolute leadership, for example, the part of the person who is the worst enemy of his enemy, how his voice turned into darkness and evil, this was a stupid fool, and how Wendy's (Brenda Song) All teachers were all ridiculous. All this is a heartwarming movie, but it's good if you're 10 or under.
