<br /> <br /> I really was disappointed. The story line was weakly developed, for example, the events were very short and short, so the morality was not clearly revealed. I thought Brenda Song was doing a great job, but it was a difficult time for Tin Koyama to manage his role. I could see that the show had to be put in the western elements, but there are certain parts of Chinese elements that need it! For example, a villain. His physical appearance is nothing more than a Chinese culture, but a robot. <br /> <br /> Others can show that this is a 'Child show' and therefore does not need such a high level. standards. There are also other Disney shows such as Mu Lan, which is better than story development and presentation. <br /> <br /> In the end, I will have to better investigate Disney films and plan better. A good show is not enough, just a few martial arts movements.
