After watching many episodes, I decided to give up on this show, because it was not how much the mathematical modeling was. In the episodes that Charlie predicted future behavior of people using mathematical models, I thought he was joking. I'm not a mathematician, I am not a chemical engineer, but I work hard with mathematical models. <br /> <br /> Firstly, choosing the right model to predict a situation is a challenging task. First of all, what is said is close to what the prophets say. Charlie Eppes is shown as a genius, but even if someone is trying to guess who he's going to do or in the near future, he needs to spend a lot of time looking for a suitable model. Individuals are irregular and do not come across, there is no modeling for them. Ishak Asimov wrote about it in the 1950s. First, even if it is a model for a particular person, it can be a stoichastic one, which means it has a good chance of misinterpretation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> These parameters are constants of equations such as weight acceleration (9.8 m / s2) and are often not easy to determine. Again, Charlie Eppes could have been someone beyond the genius to know the right settings for his model. Model and parameters should be tested after selecting. Not surprisingly, they are not miracles, they adapt the exact situation. <br /> Thirdly, a very important aspect of modeling is almost always not just numbers, but movies: the computational effort required to solve these models. Try to solve a complex model with many equations and variables in Excel and find a Herculean businessman. Although Charlie Eppes has the right software to handle its own models, it can be compressed with a device that will be slower. In addition to the right software / hardware combination, the model can take days to reach a solution. It solves them immediately! <br /> <br /> I was very glad to use my computer in my research work. <br /> <br /> Like a drama, it's not the best show. The character is slightly blurred, but not as laughable as it is in the Big Bang theory. <br /> <br /> For some tough guys, the show may begin to work. For others, the way to do the job is difficult to swallow!
