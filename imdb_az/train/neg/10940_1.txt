First, let's just admit that Lorenzo Lamas can not be regarded as an experienced actor, but sometimes it's decent, sometimes just neat. <br /> <br /> The film industry, generally known as "SnakeEater," sank in. A veteran Vietnamese veteran Jack Kelly, aka Soldier (who will hardly be as crazy, and then some believe that when the two boys' feet hit the nails), the family was killed and her brother was kidnapped. That is why he will go to the solo mission to rescue his sister. <br /> <br /> Now, there's a moving force, but it's still pretty thin. To become an actor, I deserved to say that this was the worst of all in the history of art !!!!! Lamas is good. Finally, the action, Clampets / Deliverance rejection players must be torn and hit for everyday actors who are offensive to actors, especially talented. Fighting with a gun is so bad in the BEST, but the fight against fists is miserable. In the Renaissance Festival I saw more realistic fights (and quite fake)! <br /> <br /> Listen to me: LEARN FROM ALL VALUES OF THIS REGION! IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE FISH FILM, I WISH YOU WOULD BE HAD! Do not follow this with your brain cells!
