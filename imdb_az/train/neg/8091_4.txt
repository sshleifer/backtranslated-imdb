(This is Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, and co.), And is then an English-language review given by Disney. <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be good. Really, really. I've been a great curtain of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the brilliant reviews on this previous Miyazaki movie, I wanted to see it. But I said I was shocked by the quality of this movie. Later, the films featured well-crafted areas, 3-dimensional characters and best movie music ... well ... never. This movie is not just about it. <br /> Of course, though, you can start the positive aspects. Like all Miyazaki films, it is very creative, with a strange fantasy / fantasy setting in a post-apocalyptic world, where still the dominant species of insects. Nausicaa can also give other movies a great deal of animation over time. <br /> <br /> <strong> Even though Miyazaki's next movies are not as beautiful and fluid. </ strong> <br /> <br /> Heroes are the whole carton - from Sakarin sweet little Nausicaa, to the cruel Tolmekans, to everyone. After seeing each one in 30 seconds, you saw what's happening there. <br /> <br /> A film that loves life is in the hands of the composer, but Nausicaa does not give her justice. Half of the music is the 80's on the overdrive, and it usually enters in such a way that it distributes visual acuity besides helping them. <br /> <br /> I love my life. <br /> <br /> That's why there's a big message in this movie, right? Let's save the environment! This movie is so bad that it's hitting his head like a sledgehammer. There is a scene that embraces the Nausicaa tree. No, really. <br /> <br /> I'm a little sad to talk about how naked this movie is. But for some reason, all the other reviews on IMDb love him. <br /> <br /> If you're an anime worshiper, you're using a tree of 80's and plants, on the Arbor Day, you probably will love this movie. Otherwise, earn money for the movies you've just taken.
