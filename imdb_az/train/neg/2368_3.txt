On the contrary, this is a foolishness, they say that they do not have another Nightmare movie, this is the "last" thing ... And what do they do? They will not pass each other, the next one (PART 7), but why are they playing us? Anyway, this film did not understand anything in any sense, it was quite complicated, the characters were of some degree, Freddy was another joker, and that was a very stupid one for a good series. Too bad, which is worse than the 2nd and the 5th parts. I bought the movie, in the third year its a stupid tale, meaningless! Id says. I hated this movie so far, I still do not see all movies as a whole movie. It is different from pre-work, it works and works, but it tried to spend the most and it collided face-to-face. Although it was different, there were scenes of death, they sucked a lot of time. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> What do they see doing their biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5 doing so? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> ELM STREET LOWER 6 DAYS. It's funny to be classified as horror / excessive confusion / lack of movement / loss.
