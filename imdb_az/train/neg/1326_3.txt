The foolish dribble on the second coming of Christ in the form of Sandra Locke overlooking the hippies and the albino. "Suzanne's Second Coming" no matter how hard you've forgotten, it's over and over again on the frustrating theme song "Suzanne" until you're no longer "Suzanne's Second Coming". everything. <br /> <br /> This off-the-wall fixture filmmaker Logan, Jared Martin, is funding the project of the century, but it is very rude and disruptive to anyone who wants the world of banking. <br /> <br /> She plans to go to Logana, then places her in a seafront caf√© and Suzanne gets to know Sandra Locke. He reminds one of those who know another life: Jesus Christ. <br /> <br /> Logan's assistant and surrounding Clavius, Richard Dreyfuss, has won a $ 740,000.00 loan from Logan's bank to finance Logan's kings, and welcomes Suzanne as an actress who wants to film her talent. <br /> <br /> Suzanne's only lover artist, Simon, leads Paul Sand, but later Simon suffers from so much depression and brings his weapon alone into his mouth and blows his brain. <br /> After all, a young autistic girl, Dorothy, who has healed autism by Suzanne, was unsuccessful at a psychiatric hospital she had been in, with little association with Kari Avalos. I really know what Suzanne did in the hospital, but it seemed to be a kind or volunteer there; <br /> <br /> Did not this show us that, like Jesus, he could heal sickness miraculously? <br /> <br /> This is the newspaper columnist and great-time businessman Jackson Sinclair, Gene Barry. a very difficult medium-life crisis or a biblical appearance that changed his life forever. Sinclair wanted to know the meaning of life, the things that were related to the film, and wanted to know what all the suffering in the world was, as in this film, and he first found out his eyes on Suzanne. <br /> <br /> Sinclair, his special chauffeur David, Markus Rasmusser, shook his head after fleeing from the abyss like a kamikaze on Easter coast, stunned by strange and awesome hallucinations. <br /> <"Suzanne's Second Coming" continues with a series of incompatible sequences, probably after a while by the director and the filmmaker, to fill the pad and then go to the last stage in Christianity as Christ. like a hill. <br /> <br /> Just 2,000 years ago, the true Christianity of Jesus Christ, as Suzanne tried and tried to repeat, was moved by this terrible Logan's masterpiece. and "Suzanne's Second Coming" is almost impossible to follow, but by Suzanne, Logan and the creators of the film are putting you in the same kind of torture. The film tries to keep the arty, but it is an excuse to cover the story of an unhappy and uncertain story and even aggravates the terrifying and encouraging movements of everyone.
