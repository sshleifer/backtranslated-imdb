F * ck Me! I've seen some incredible horror films in my time, but it gets p * s! <br /> <br /> Honestly, I can not say how bad this film really is. Except for a structure that is not really there, it is an exciting betrayal of zombies who are blatantly dangerous pretexts; You know, I could go all day. Every little thing in this movie is foolish, senseless, crap or embarrassing. <br /> <br /> I'm talking to everyone who wants to watch this movie ... did not! <br /> <br /> I do not mean, it's on my shelf. It is hidden in the bottom of the great trunk of the goddess. Even for a movie, I could not give this horse an excuse. How bad is that!
