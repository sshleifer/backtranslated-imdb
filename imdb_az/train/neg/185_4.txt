Five or very good western Mannin did not sound like an ensemble in Hollywood. Even John Ford did not have much time with so many qualities. The interesting thing about all this is to what extent they are unequal. Ford's My Darling Clementine is worth about two-thirds of any of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> Other than Mann and Stewart, their true hero is Chasedir. Chase is responsible for the bright red tea. Chase wrote a remote country, bending down the river and possibly others. But none of them ended up like My Darling Clementine, but then very little movie, western, or something else. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Bend, Far, West Man, Furies, Winchester 73, and yep, six, Naked Spur. Each has a beautiful view after a spectacular scene. However, the Red River is still the most powerful one. So perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> Different country has a great, big hole. When Stewart and Mc Alley lock the horns, it's miraculous and really alive. The rest is quite pedestrian, except for Mann's camera. Mann is a man in cinematography. It's a good look like anyone who's behind a moving movie strip. Never in the wrong place ever. <br /> <br /> The far country has a beautiful moment. And as usual comes Stewart. No one was punished in the film's history. He is absolutely amazing: Look at Bend, Far, Winchester and Manam from Laramie: It is beaten in a cord and it is firmly attached to a rope, and it looks like someone who is drowning in boiling hatred, you are in such a hurry, He's accusing you, of course, dragged by Adam's fire, of course, looking for burns. What's the actor? At Winchester, the moment of the early period in the hotel room, as well as the moment when no one did. <br /> <br /> But this was Mann's territory: Fight with Man Jack Lord of the West with Gary Cooper. It's as painful as it's mentioned as a fight scene. Cooper, though not as convincing as Stewart, is still equally inexplicable at the end of the war. In short, no-one, no-one, did not show off to the extremists, along with Mann. <br /> <br /> What a great, great director. <br /> <br /> Look at every west that he has prepared. These are the real monuments, even if all is simple. But what? When they scream at her great scenes, they are as good as everyone else, including Ford. <br /> <br /> Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.
