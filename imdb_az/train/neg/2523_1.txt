<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Pluto Nash's adventures are replaced by "the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < We apologize for Adma Sandler and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) for hating the movie. This mixture of something makes these films worse - it's terribly terrible and not strange. This is the only movie I have ever said for me - from NETFLIX - NOW! 10,000 out of 10,000 found this idea helpful.
