This film is a mess. I'm sorry that even the theater has freedom. Robin Williams would go straight to this video. Poorly written. Poorly focused. It is a worse crime that has attracted an interesting subject and has caused a ridiculous and inflammable thrill that has no excitement or excitement, no internal or emotional logic. Particularly in the first half an hour, the movie turned into a ridiculous kit, and I saw that the audience laughed at it. Protect your money. Trailer is completely misleading - it is not a decline and no excitement - in fact, the film's worst threat is just drilling.
