No doubt, on Saturday morning, TV's children's show was so weak. As a result, these manufacturers should rely on the returning audience. Well, in this terrible proposal, at least they counted the money they had earned. The scenario could have been rejected for a long time for a forgotten space opera series. A few smarmy lines were added to the refrigerator Gerald Mohr to hate Stahard Hayden. No director has done anything right with this story, and that's why movement is just calm. Spaceship's details are absurd - for example, Bulova's wall clock and portable writing machines - but the film's history should be part of the worst. There are many pictures and everything is often immersed in a wrong red light. Even Mohr's naked feathered chest is used as a cotton. And that's why it's a bad thing - so fine as a cage. Anyone who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from Marians - and I totally agree!
