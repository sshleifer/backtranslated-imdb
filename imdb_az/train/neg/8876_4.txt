The parody of the family blends into a dark film, like "One Officer and One Gentleman", "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and, of course, other films that I can not remember now). Gags is always where you are expecting and Damon Wayan's lines are good, predictable. As I said, unfortunately, this movie will never surprise you ...
