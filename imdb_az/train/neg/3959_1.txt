this is not one of the movies, I'm not one of the biggest number of trips on the stage, the camera is trying to be sensitive, but it really looks like all the red shoes, but without sex, the only reason I bought this was to try a dvd and this is my life it was the cheapest thing I could do to get the worst shopping ever, and could have forever dropped out of the DVD, the noise was true and the majority of the film consisted of endless repetition of clips from the first two films. Why would everyone want to grieve a movie that was really trying to shoot an original movie and if it were unsuccessful, it would be better to refresh only the first two pages and then repeat it to the movie, perhaps from 1 to 3 Do not buy this movie in accordance with the original film and movie school students standards. this is the only entertainment that the dvd can offer, wipe in microwave and watch blinking lights. UTTER UTTER UTTER UTTTER unbelievable GARBAGE! 0/10 votes only if the voting system permits.
