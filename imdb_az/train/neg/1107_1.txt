I read the back of the box and talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought it would be nice! I'm wrong. The story was amazed. Actually, I still do not get it. It seems to me that all the characters did not drink, smoke (opium) and sex. These films are not good, but please! Where was the story? I've finished the movie myself, and I got it until the end, but then the movie is over. If you really want, rent it. Just do not trust behind the box.
