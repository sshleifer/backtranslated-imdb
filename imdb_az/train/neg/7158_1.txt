This is one of the worst things I've ever seen. I love Almereda's Nadja, but it's definitely a bit of a pain. Along with a few minutes of intriguing cinematography and music, this movie is merely immoral and horrific. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but no one is far from good. The area is a joke, but it is not so. I do not even know if you can forgive these bad movies. Please delete the last and the half of my life. How did this director make Nadja and another girl another planet?
