This is a very dull movie. As I grew up in Vietnam, as I did today, you have seen and heard all the movies and arguments hundreds of times. But the story of the director Carlton Shawwud is really the story of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you did not live up to Vietnam, then most of the movie you won, Find something new here. There is no new evidence to condemn new evidence for John Kerry or another documentary in Vietnam. Smaller viewers interested in the theme should see George Butler's "Aue Going" movie! The Stolen Honor explicitly intended to be a cartoonist in John Kerry, but it was difficult to fulfill this goal.
