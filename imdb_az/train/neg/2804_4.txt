I was cautious when I first saw the version of 1973 with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack, so adaptation in 1983 was such a disappointment. I just did not get any chemistry between 2 main stars. Many viewers and theater actors do not do this for me, and what about Timin's role in Rochester? The casting director actually read a book. Very strange! He's a nice player, but Mr. Rochester is definitely not! Zelah was only good, weird. The player who supported this was pretty good, and for me the adaptation of Lowood scenes was the best, but it did not affect the magic of the novel in general. No doubt, he will not want to follow anyone as a true adaptation of the novel. A real refusal!
