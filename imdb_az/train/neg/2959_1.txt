Despite what someone tells you, in the movie circles, you have the word "idle" - "what do you have to do with this film?" There is one truth. Religion has nothing to do with it, but it does not have a sound mind. <br /> <br /> On many levels, I tried to find where this movie was fun ... even to the average consumer. Star? Story? Unique idea? A friendly movie with children like a dinosaur and a black woman? Good, good! I am convinced that it was a good idea. But somewhere in the era of development, one should have noticed that the idea of ​​someone can not be transformed into a fun entertainment that anyone can watch or pay ... If they are not deeper than alcohol and drugs <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whoopie had a salary, but I was ashamed to buy it. I hope he hopes that this agency / manager / publicist has fired this career. Obviously, he went to shoot even worse movies. And worse movies. Sad.
