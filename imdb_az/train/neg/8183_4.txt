<br /> <br /> This WW II code has been violated, stolen, and so on. A very cautious piece related to it. The player is as expected from this player of the MGM "B" actors. <br /> <br /> One big reserve. The first two Flash Gordon series, Jean Rogers, who plays so much of a sexy Dale Arden, is just frightening in this movie. His character is extremely damaging. It provides its indispensability as never before. We believe that during the height of the World War II, there will be a clear secret code that will be available only through pop and outlet from any office chosen, even though it has no official function. In this regard, I'm sorry to follow this movie. The late Rogers has changed my perception forever. Talentwise, he's a slender sigh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lee Bowman, <br /> <br />
