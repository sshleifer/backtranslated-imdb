My husband and I also thought of this version of Manhattan's Murder Mystery for a television version ... it's good, but not great. Story is less interim characteristic of tension or chemistry and not in many areas. Woody Allen's character is just around the fledgling circle, and there is nothing more than just Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson. It should be said that there is quite a disappointment. The role of Ian McShane is just a widening look. <br /> <br /> The first thing that comes up to me is that I wonder how much the BBC should pay to Woody Allen to pull him out of Manhattan? He needed money, and they had to apply to expand the audience outside the two youth-attracted youth markets. I can give this movie 4 instead of 3 because it is unhappy background noise. If we need to do something while weaving or sorting the stamp collection, we will do it. I will not rent again.
