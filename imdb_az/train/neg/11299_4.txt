The Mummy's Tomb begins reviewing the Mummy's hand-held events and then moves to the United States for a few years and going to take revenge and take revenge on existing mums and mummies Kharis of the United States of America in the history of the ocean. <br /> <br /> The tomb of the past errors. I love Mummy with Boris Karloff like Mummy Imhotep and Tom The Tyler's "The Mummy's Hand" direct prequel to this movie), "The Mummy's Tomb". <br /> <br /> This is a style similar to the previous movie and has a somewhat similar structure even though it is in a new state. Lon Chaney Jr is as good as Kharis, but really not noticeable. And I'm the main critic of this movie, that nothing really differs. There is nothing really terrible here, but there is nothing really outstanding, so the audience is left with a fairly soft mummy tale.
