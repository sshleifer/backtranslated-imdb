The film's predecessor has nothing to do with Robot Jox. "Robot Jox 2": "Robot Jox" was a fun movie for fun, because "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars" had a beautiful structure of giant robots fighting each other in the near future. This concept has been abandoned for this movie and instead provides a totally boring story, not very original or cleverly written. <br /> <br /> A B-movie like "Robot Jox", but just like the B-movie in this movie, we tried to be very different from its predecessor. As a big difference, this is not a very good thing. Perhaps, despite the fact that this film was released in 1990, the B-films in the 1980s still had some attraction and class. Talk about this movie. It's just bare, badly made, bad looking and not quite interesting. This is what you think? <br /> <br /> What is the story of the story? Perhaps a good basic habit could be a good idea and something else, such as stories, some actions, or the main characters loved. /> <br /> Actors who play a major role are for this movie, all of which are not unique in their role, and especially as Don Michael Paul behaves like a mother-hero, a woman with God's gift as a woman and competing with anyone. <br /> <br /> If this film, which has a concept of building big battle droids for such a futuristic film, has absolutely no inactivity, it would be much more enjoyable to watch the movie if it were to move more and more into the film. <br /> <br / <br /> <strong> </ font> <br /> </ font> <br /> <strong> br /> 3/10
