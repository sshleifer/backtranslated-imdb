This ridiculous film offers a "hippie mentality" in a standard nutshell in 1970 and revives us in the process. An elderly sex is an attempt by innocent women to force absurd marriages. An unusual young hippy (Kay Lenz) played and lying down with all the wrong guys one day later, he met an old lady, Holden, as an actor, drinking a hard liquor, and she decided that she was "in love" with her gives. If you think it's a superficial film, all the movies cover such scenes. She says she loves her and only recognizes her, she is gentle and really quick. I could not help but laughing throughout the movie. But she uses her as a meal ticket, but the director is not competent enough to think that she will actually have any love. It's a disgusting scene where both of them are naked and have sexual intercourse, so I have to accelerate my inspiration to inflame me. Since the 1970s, the film has been rolled out. Avoid if possible. Lesson D.
