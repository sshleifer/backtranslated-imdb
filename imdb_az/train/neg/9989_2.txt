I have been in trouble for watching this fall on the cold winter night at Sky Cinema Max. I'm not a big fan of horror movies because most of them are just trash. This is even worse: this is one of the most horrible parts I've ever seen. Horror movie? Yes, there are such terrible things: actors, scripts and special effects - Gosh, I laughed at this ridiculous attempt to make a 90-minute whistle. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> did not vote because every time I was laughing ;-)
