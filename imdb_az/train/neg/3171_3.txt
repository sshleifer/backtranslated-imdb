Is this the biggest movie I've ever seen? No. Was it worse? <br /> <br /> As the mother of four children, it's nice to watch something light and entertaining. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> Other view abuse levels. They obviously do not care for Eva Longoria. I think he's better than Sentinel. I think films are a matter of thinking. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, the players did not have a job. Perhaps there was a lot. <br /> <br /> I just did not want to talk to a movie or something terrible. Only a chick pee can be. The film is Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband still speaks about it. :)
