I was watching this movie on March 21st. I say disappointment. But it is better than "Tridev" .Plot hackneyed. Provides information about Prabhat, who lives with his father, wife and younger brother. In any case Azar Jhurhad is preparing a trick to kill his younger brother. He sends a few people and prepares a plan. They come to school as Prabhats friends. Kill the baby. His father brings him home. Then he comes back to O and Aakas to Kenya to find him. Sunny gives a good performance, Chunky is a frustrating way in a good way, Naseerd is wasted.Divya made good, Sonam was wasted, Jyotsna was wasted, but looked cute. Sunnys's brother played his child's movie cute.Too was sad, his character was killed.The girl was cute , but was annoying. The other child was good. Alok was good. The rent was adequate. Amrish and Gulshan were good. Kinematography is poor in both India and Kenya.Script, but there are a few good dialogues. Also liked only one song that drags "Time Samundar" the lyrics of this song were good. Other songs were forgotten. Do not follow this. Rating-3/10
