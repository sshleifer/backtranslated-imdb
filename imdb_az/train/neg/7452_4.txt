For me, this film has just fallen. The main problem for me was the fall of Glover as a serial killer. I do not know that it is moving from typical casting or simply by its behavior, but the qlover can describe any convincing one. He is a good man and always in his speeches. Apart from that, the film is a serial killer story of the mill. There is not much innovation.
