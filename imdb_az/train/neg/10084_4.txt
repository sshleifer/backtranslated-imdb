This film was okay, but of course, it defeats the claim that homosexuals are "born of this", especially when a woman can get out of an unhappy marriage and fall into another woman. <br /> <br /> Kate's gender preferences seem to be overwhelmed and closed as a link, and this movie may look a little simpler. <br /> <br /> And, in general, this was a failure with films that tried to push the agenda. The characters in the movie, which contained questions or abandoned the gay lifestyle, were labeled "indifferent". And there was not a happy average. Kate's friends and relatives embraced her or completely push her. Interaction between homosexual and gay unrelated relatives and friends is not typical. This is usually a mixture of emotions and values. It is possible to love and respect people, nevertheless they will not be able to choose their choice. Unfortunately, the film showed no such relationship. For a movie trying to describe endurance and admissions, I was hit by a very intense film! Finally, after all the years he wants to be with Mac, Kate decides and looks like everything is not ovky dory - is it really what's wearing? Come on!
