As a fright film, it was supposed to be a tension, but I saw the comedy very funny (I do not think), so I laughed at the movie because of the ridiculous movement and structure. I do not blame the actors, I was not very good, but O.K. I think Cillian is a very good "bad guy". I liked his acting at Batman Beggins and Rachel McAdams .. whoa! he is also a beauty and a good actress, but trying to be a small part here, mm mm ... mm direction ... a very good backdrop is actually a really boring movie <br /> <br /> I did not know what the movie was, but there's a good thing, it is a short film, it's only 1 hour and 30 minutes (ME FOR 10 MINUTES!) is very high, and it's tall in tomatoes, higher, with good, rational and objective criticisms?
