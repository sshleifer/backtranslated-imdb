I watched the entire movie, waiting for something and waiting for something. Maybe I'm guilty of waiting for evil and horror instead of psychological? A stupid repetition of an oliveal myth: Would you like to kill my dad and mom, marry my uncle and create a musical theater with him? Why did not I find out that some of the plot elements were not even there: why it was a high level building, and if there were not anybody doing it, there were a great jewelry that had a perfect place for someone to fall, why are there scenes? why do you have to eat just what you need to eat, why the boy wants to be baptized, and the parents will be able to go against another one instead. I see very good reviews for this movie ... Did my taste break in with the 1970s and b-films and old philosophies?
