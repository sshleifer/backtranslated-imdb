Everyone who has become an admirer of the original series and even a hint about the story should be embarrassed with this series. Borg does not go until the Enterprise brings it to the Gamma sector, and Kingston can never be seen until Kirk meets them, the FIRST ship to carry the NCC-1701 Enterprise name ... Should I continue? Berman and Pilliar Gene Roddenberry made a venue. After his death, they just looked at $ and just went their own way. No miracle Majel Barrett was in the episode of each star track as far as this series. I do not blame him for not being involved in this confusion. Poor Bakula. He is a great actor like all the players. I love all of them, but this story is a tragedy and does not see all the specimens set out by the original series. Check prices. I think that more people followed the Deep Space 9 (untimely canceled).
