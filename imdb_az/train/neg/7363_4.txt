There was Erika Eleniak in one of the "Shakedown" I saw. She is sexually sexy, but she is the second weird of Wolf Larson's presidency. Unfortunately, he is more capable of performing than here. The film consists of infinite shots, which are mostly monotonous, especially armed with armed guns, with Larson's missing machine guns, and often armed with only one revolver (which will never run out of bullets) very easily. The effects of the earthquake are worthwhile, but there are many fuzzy movements and poor CGI explosions. As a psychotic "spiritual leader", Ron Perlman works, but artificial religious mumbo-jumbo is a leaky thing. If Eleniak, Perlman or Larson (after any speculation) complete this, they may want to look at each other, but for others, this is just a rental. (* 1/2)
