Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book. Wes Anderson leads and receives a short, same-named book on a large full-length film in a respectable full-length movie. The film was lost in its delicate spirit while respecting incredibly talented people in Indonesia. Anderson left the story behind without knowing that he was a talented person, and if it were a bad movie, that would be the first bad movie. As you go to school and your first bad day, it's Anderson's first bad day in the movie, so I'll leave it alone. I will admit that it has a clever and beautiful spirit, and animation is beautiful, but it is increasingly difficult for casual things to fall randomly, leaving behind the story. The characters are also good. Jason Schwartzman sounds like Mr Fox (George Clooney) clever son son, Ash and especially involved. The film does not reach a fairly high level, but it is, of course, getting closer and closer. I'm convinced that Wes Anderson will decide to take another movie wherever and where to shoot, but so far, I apologize, Wes Anderson was a big disappointment.
