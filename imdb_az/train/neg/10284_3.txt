After seeing the people behind the sun, I think I'm hoping for a great evolution of the film and a technique. I was very interested in giving a so-called fact-based reporting on the events that took place during the most massive earthquake in Japan, but that is not. It has been playing as a sub-middle European Nazi exploitation movie from the 70s, for example. SS Experience Camp and so on. (Perhaps more Special Section Deported Women). On the other hand, the "shock" sequence, which, despite the fact that many more and more people are abducted around the world, on the contrary, is the instinct of numerous non-actors that are not too bad and unusual, the ridiculous fakes of gunfire. Undoubtedly, terrifying documentary footage is almost combined with scenes that even these realistic images cooled most of their strengths. Channel 4 'The Holocaust' (recently published (still published), No. 1 in 2006), watch the documentary film (which is used in the perfect context of true imagery) that is concerned with the war obscure. Nanking's horror is not a type of treatment, it's not hackneyed exploitation (better use of the exploitative film will be good, but this is not a very good exploitation film). Rating: 3 (5 in abuse, 1 in treatment).
