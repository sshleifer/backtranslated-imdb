Irene Dunne finished his famous career with this so-so film. She is a film that is unmemorable, almost unknown, she should have come out with a bang of classic actresses. <br /> <br /> This light comedy is complete, but nothing special. The first half of the day is better than the fool in the second half. Maybe Irene saw the handwriting of the wall. Even its loud voices are a bit annoying here. Undoubtedly, this film is not happy. <br /> <br /> The government reminded the television station in the 1950s. In this regard, I thought it was David Nelson from the Ozzie & Harriet TV show, but it turned out to be very young Richard Crenna. She looked up and sounded like Nelson. <br /> <br /> Generally, a sub-pad for the best and best actress.
