<br /> <br /> I called this movie minus 10, but it was simply not offered. <br /> <br /> Why can not I say why did not I go out in the first five minutes of this movie? I had gone instinctally and had to leave immediately! <br /> <br /> Some people in nature did this and, unfortunately, I did not follow them. <br /> <br /> The story did not have all the criteria for a movie. NO area. Horrible action! Even Robin Williams was so disappointed that I did not see any other movie. I loved the fresh field. Too bad, some meat does not shock the subtlety of the plot. Nobody should surprise the writer and director of this movie!
