"ASTONISHING" comes out of the LA Times DVD box. They should refer to the fact that such a miserable mischief piece is not released. The film takes place around a group of girls who have a disease that boosts to become cannibals and killing innocent people just to stay alive. The film is filmed on their skin, and we also cut the legs, heads and so on as convincing as a Halloween Fuzzy Feel set. There is something sharp, a little human cuisine, and some strange zombie hunter who sticks to a skin wrapped in a cage and has stabbed and stabbed his head before there are many things you get. As you can see, there was no actual talent and, therefore, a ridiculous fact, what is the purpose of all this corpse? Again, while looking at the video box, the responsible person is the "underground cult director". Is the goal similar to strange religious cults, which, if it is true, turn you into thinking one way? This is a reason why anyone can enjoy the tax report. Then, in the same paragraph, he compared himself with Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HO-HOAH stop him. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Do you deal with the above-mentioned opinion? If so, it should be a member of the argument. Do you pocket your wages? Do you allow other family members to see you? Are you forced to watch Andrew Parkinson movies until you think that he is the best director after Hitchcock? For me, Panorama sounds like a special beer. And welcome to the LA era critics who have returned to your colony? 0/10
