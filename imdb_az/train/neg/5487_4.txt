This is one of the movies that the British Lottery Fund has pulled out of its waste. The main problem is a graphic script that does not fit anywhere. The heroes are not interested, the story is traditional and weird, something of interest: the city of Genoa (in Genova, Italy). When I had a superficial acquaintance with Genoa, I had no idea of ​​the complex alleys of her old city, and the city was very interesting. I thought Genoa was weak. I am happy to say that I am wrong. That is the point of interest for this movie from the travel point. The film contains a fine performance by Perla Haney-Jardine, a little girl. Although she has only 12 films, she already has 7 films, so her career has been determined by her career as an actress, and she has to do that because she has a lot of talent. Colin Firth, a trusted and professional player, was in a position to shoot and asked for courage and was seriously upset and hesitated when he wanted to hurry. But someone forgot to give him a valuable dialogue. The scenario is a common thing. Catherine Keener is pretty good in a supporting role, and generates sympathy in a natural way for everyone to be around (I feel cold every time) a soothing hot drink. So we have: Genoa's exciting narrow streets, an interesting little girl and a sympathetic woman. Forget about the rest. Willa Hollande's great sister is such a disgusting feature that I'm skeptical of the fact that a young actress is a good job and does not want to hear her. The idea that this family went to Geneva to forget the unlucky death of the mother is that if there is such a film, they have the right to appeal to all the dead mothers. If Michael Winterbottom wants to shoot a movie about how old Genoa is so interesting, why did not he just go to the BBC and tell him he wanted to make a travel movie with some flamboyant celebrity communicator? Why not make a movie to earn money?
