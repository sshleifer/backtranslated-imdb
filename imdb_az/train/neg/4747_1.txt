I thought this movie was terrible. I'm Chinese, so I think it's all wrong. The facts were wrong. When Wendy's mother told her about her statues of ShiHuangDi, she said something about China's history. I also thought that the fighting scenes were very cheesy and fake. Most actors and actresses were not very good. Some supposedly "joking" guys were really stupid. I think this movie should get the worst possible rating. If Disney really wants to create a treacherous movie, she should learn more about Chinese history. Mulan was pretty clear. If you want to spend a bit of time watch this movie.
