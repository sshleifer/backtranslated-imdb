I've heard this show for the first time, but I have to be honest, that Muslims use racist jokes, on the contrary, on the contrary. I realized that the consciousness that I saw could help people, that if a Muslim uses this word in a real life, that is not a terrorist thing. Also, people are calling Muslims a bad name, because they play with their stereotype, and by regularly watching demonstrations, we condemn that we are trying to live, even though all of them are bad Muslims. One day, Amair's appearance on an airplane and how he used the words "Divorce" or "Yaser" would lead to competition and how difficult it was for people to take this wrong. I know that I'm a Muslim, but it does not usually happen, but many people think badly about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, and it's not the right thing to do. people will see how bad we are following this demonstration and think of how this is going to happen. Such a show came with joy. The Piotr Muslim people have many indications like terrorists, and many people see me laughing at my opioid. Now it's good to do it, and after all, we can say who will not be entertained because everything is fun. unfair, but it is often done and really gives the Muslin people a bad name.
