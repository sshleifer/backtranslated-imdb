I was thrilled to see this movie, which includes the types of wisdom that Rivers and Tides love, a visual excursion related to artistic beauty and nature. But this is not what I received. Instead, I am making a fairly insurmountable film about how bad the human industry is for nature. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> > <br /> <p> And, frankly, the illustrations were generally not effective. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, a stupid movie. For those who want to feel better than the consciousness of the environment ... but not for those who want to think about the complexity of the surrounding issues.
