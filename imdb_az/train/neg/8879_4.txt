I think Cliff Robertson was certainly one of our best actors. There is a classic half-built loan. It's as beautiful here as it is heavier, but the direction is very bad and the tedious pacing is never dependent on the sign. The excitement starts well, although it can be said how my spouse is dependent on him. But he keeps the cups well and carries everything. The knell of death is twice. The first one would spend about one-third of the movie if it would take some time to go to one or the other part of the house. Additionally, Robertson's character may be looking for a mess in a blue light, and may add another stack. But in half an hour I agree with those who say that this film is a very decent, but worthless movie. The greatest weakness is an insidious structure that gives you incredible questions whenever and wherever you are. I'm not spoiler, but do not think too much when it's over. I can not hesitate to make ten hesitations. It would have been better if there was no ghost story.
