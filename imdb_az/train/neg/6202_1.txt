Despite the anguish I saw, I watched the film all the way from the negative to the end. I felt the shout of the Master, and the only way I could get it was as plausible as possible. I've come to love this country because I live in the UK, but this film is the worst way to imagine the British youth. There is nothing to be drowned, but it will escape, anger, and illness. Attracted people are ashamed.
