This move reminded Tales from Crypt Keeper. People agree with the things they deserve. I think they are always on a Crypt story. The same goes for bad behavior. It's a very bad move. I'm glad that most of the film has disapproved of people and that they do not expect much. When watching a movie I do not expect long ago because all of his films are terrifying compared to the novel's novel. I read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books. I love playing Carrie as a real story, and all the books are many reports and theories. It was very good. But I noticed that both novels were not like the movie. The last movie versions were very different. I think that this novel has changed all the novels and that the latter is always a cheese. The worst thing to end with a thinner. That's cheese. I want to read the book to find the true end. If I compare, I would recommend Stephen King to anyone who wants to read the movies you read. And you will be very pleased with this book. I am going to do this with all the novels put on the movie. I'm sure that when they were included in the movie, they were good books ... and the scenario was very bad.
