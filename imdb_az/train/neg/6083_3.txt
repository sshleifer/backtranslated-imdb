There are two types of films like us (1) western, and (2) 30-40 years ago. We liked the Personality Person; But ..... <br /> <br /> But ... this picture is not annoying and stupid after the beginning. Because there is no one to warm (good or bad) in the story, there is no one to strengthen the sustainability of the audience. There is no friendship between children who want to steal gold, but no marriage. Sledge has a pretty girlfriend, but she does not have any reason why she wants to be in the same room with a room without a room or a pig. <br /> <br /> The film is also written by Vic Morrow, very bad writing and direction. <br /> <br /> Over the last 30 movies from Netflix or Video Vault, this rock was the only one in the band.
