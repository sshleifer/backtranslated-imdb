This is a classic example of a growing problem with movies. How terrible is the noise and noise compared with the dialogue? What is this? This movie is not alone. Many movies are now similar to that. I wondered if there was anything wrong with my TV for 2 years, but I got a new television and was there again. <br /> <br /> In this film it was more remarkable, because in English, the woman is always amazed. Jean Reno's "I'll forgive, talk, or get rid of marbles." If you look at the DVD and even have high schooling French, I suggest the French version. <br /> <br /> I can see that Reno is pretty good in Leon, and people think about the decor, but I've seen on television and I've lived in Rockies for several years as Enh.
