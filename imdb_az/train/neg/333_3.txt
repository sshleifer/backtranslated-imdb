GOLDEN CHILD was banned by critics when it was released in 1986, and I remember that Eddie Murphy was about to end his brilliant career, so this movie has something to do with it. <br /> Buddhist monks kneeling in front of the child and begins a bad start. <br /> <br /> Children are entering the temple <br /> <br /> The child sits idle words <br /> <br /> The bad guys are chopping the monks <br /> <br /> The child sits idle <br / Bad guys pull a giant bird's cage and now sit inside the child's stick ... guess what? You get the impression that even if they take him to Michael Jackson's spectacular sculpture bed, he will still be called the "OLD CHILD" by giving the same blank statement. The title begins with a movie that is a pop movie since the 1980's. Obviously, it could have been cool and strange at the time, but in 2004 it seemed very dated. It's not just something, but it's full of a bloody opening. Actually, the main problem with this movie (and the guy is a serious one) - like watching the completely different movie scenes that are sometimes interconnected so that the whole mood seems to change to the scene. I personally blame the director, but the screenwriter and the producer should share the same offense. Everyone knew before the fire that this movie will be? Part of the party is fantasy, party martial arts, partly friendly film, party comedy, and all shit
