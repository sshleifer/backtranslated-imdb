Yes, this movie is bad. What is worse is that it does not take advantage of its title! In ALL movie, zombies and vampires are fighting one another at a time. Moreover, we will not be able to identify the main vampire in the film. One may argue that they are trying to "tune it" or "realist", but it's just boring. More than half of this film is held at A CAR. The scenes that occur elsewhere also praise. In addition, there is no clear antagonist and you do not know what actually happens for the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> Along with this, I will say that the movie is low in production, the soundtrack was amazingly amazing and instrumental (with any origonal score or other sample music). <br /> <br /> I am full of independent films, but not for any mass audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "It's worse than a scarecrower."
