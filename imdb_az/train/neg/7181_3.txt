Now I can not get it wrong, and I enjoy Christian movies. I love her beautiful life and really love Cruz and Mr Carol's versions. scott and alistair sim. but this particular movie is terrific. I think I love the song of life, but the groom's ghost is painful. Albert reads quite well at finney annie. I do not know if it is wrong with him in this movie, but it sounds like someone is trying to read from the mouth of dead men. the only thing that saved this movie for us was to extinguish the sounds and watch the dance numbers accompanied by a south park lamp cd.
