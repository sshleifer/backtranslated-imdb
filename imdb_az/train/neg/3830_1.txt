Why I do not know why I have taken the time to review the film. Do you really hope for a satisfactory conclusion? good, bad or surprising? there is no. Finally, a rigid, formulational, predictable dialogue and misses it after its operation. If the internal scenes get closer to such cameras one millimeter, you'll be burning decent if you see the cliche lights. Suit, hairstyle and sets are engaged, solid and clean. At the beginning of the 20th century, are we supposed to live in the same way as Americans? Other definitions' Compared to Sam Peckinpah is insulting Peckinpah: at least he has turned the film's director into a context of chaos and mayhem. HARD MEN's eyes are to get rid of wooden cheering men who are manicured nails. Huh?!? Heston, I believe, is eager to win this movie. (He will put his gun on his cold finger). But Coburn? I will never guess why I signed up for this travesty. As we know, we would like to see a film about the end of the West, the end of the West as you know it? Wait for SHOCKSTYST or BUT. LAST HARD MEN is a mockery of a Western-born brutal.
