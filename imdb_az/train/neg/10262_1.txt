<br /> <br /> I'm not that kind of thing, but it just went beyond interest and I continued to look at it. me god-terrible director, act of criticism and dialogue. Seriously it has become one of the poorest films I've ever seen - it's like the Cryptkeeper's Tales episode and even the poorest one ... <br /> Okay, a few criticisms (1) when a doctor has a heart attack before the monster (monster's (2) about 100 meters away from the army, and we are still alive (2) who attacked the army at about 100 meters and we were fluttering, we use the shooter - do not miss, these things are not more than 30 meters! (3) When the monster tried to get a professor, the soldiers entered the classroom and opened fire on their ceiling; monster child falls and soldier does not try to hit the monster ??? Come on! (4) Monster looks like something like Power Rangers! (5) There is a scene that shocks all the "good guys" (priest, girl, doctor, reporter and child), and reactions behind each other (along the line of mouth) - of course! (6) someone just runs away, after time (7) rejects and does not listen to general electrical test (8) player is terrible (9) rubber suit monster ???? (10) This is terrible music, non-stop!
