Go Nagai (DEVIL MAN, DEVIL LADY, VIOLENCE JACK, etc.) As a fan of manga and anime, I look forward to this one. I did not see any manga or anime, so I have no biased idea. There is a good thing. Here's a kind of silly softcore movie that's been used for late night-to-day cables on the cable channels. Although the normal schedule is largely dependent on what looks to the audience (the heroic bits of our heroine are tastefully adorned with a sticky lid or a ridiculous solar energy effect), there are long-term scenarios of torture and torture, lend enough to your charm. I do not like amateur movies (there are at least four in this series), though I do not have anything against the naked woman heroes. Moreover, in my four episodes I have at least one stunningly beautiful player in each. It's no surprise that Nagai TESTICLE BOY has never done so ...
