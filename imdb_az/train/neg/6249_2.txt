(r # 97) <br /> <br /> What a good thing about this poor person's pokemon (what do you do): opening theme. This should be the best quality theme music for any loppily Japanese-made-consumer-oops-I-mean-the-young-fans anime TV show. Unfortunately, after opening the theme you need to add a series of show. And nothing more interesting than the one who argued with a loud voice about whose cards were better than others' cards. <br /> <br /> <p> Freud would not be able to imagine that one day would be a day off, so that any kid would want to demonstrate that the dialogue with a thousand monkeys captured 98% of the working time within five minutes. <br /> <br /> "My Uber-Fantastic Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom" will take you directly to the striking Pyramid Diamond Animal! Do not you see that you do not have the chance to win this fight? "HAHAHAHHAHHAHAHA!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Destruction Force Delta Times Pie Card", which will destroy My Ultimate Doom Destroying and Destroying Every Power of My Power Muncher, "I do not see anyone bet you're in!" <br /> <br /> Seriously, all that they did on this show, discussions. Although I was watching in another malicious child show, the commercial phenomenon Pokemon (a chicken puppy of every football mother), at least monsters had a courtesy to beat him once, "Yu-Gi-Oh" only, Roger Ebert's A Clockwork with the words "simple talking and boring" in the orange look. <br /> <br /> I will not speak of the long-suffering (considering the verdict I have written, I understand that I am a hypocrite). <br /> <br /> This show is going on forever. I do not know if there are any areas and static monsters do not have one of the character of Pokemon. As a child I can not compare my mouse with a cartoon, but this show is silent. It's not funny enough to be worth seeing, but it's ridiculous. Bye bye, dense sleep, sleep dreams dream.
