When I was five years old, I tried to watch this nonsense of cinema; Since then, I have never been the same. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He begins with the common nudity on the average of photos about drug, this "movie" is not for people, despite the colorful appearance , children are not. <br /> <br /> Do your classmate's drum (wait for him) in a fairly innocent way with a poor child who puts his head over it; Yes, he put his head on it. But do not be afraid, my friends! <br /> <br /> Next: The Wizard of Wizard of the Walls and the Wild Things is a bit of a trifling flute, <br /> <br /> So Barney's This seven-legged yellow brother is in friendly relationship with this poor boy and is even more hopeless. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" And, in order to add terrifying themes to the unpleasant theme, a terrifying taste of the past and shoved "dragons" motley crew-friendly shipyard , the mix of mayhem is added. <br /> <br /> The most comfortable image in the middle of this chaos is a custom called Witchiepoo (?), which has its own problems: with a clear plastic mask that limits its facial expressions the gas level always has to deal with a vacuum cleaner with the lowest levels of the most unsatisfactory moments, and as a result, one of my favorite lovers was the nose in the body, which I poured out of the deserted, rotten areas (I do not know where I live) <br /> In summary, this movie is awesome ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch the movie with the same effect as the Exorcist for the audience, it's yours Enjoy.
