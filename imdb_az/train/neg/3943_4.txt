What's up to me, but this flick, unfortunately, is one of the worst films that is so bad to be good and bad, it's totally meaningless and causes total time loss. There is nothing more interesting than a mediocre movie and the humility is modest: whatever the subtitles, it falls to a new level. B-is full of actors, but it is not fun, because it takes seriously. It reveals itself as a tension, but a growing drama is transformed into a flashback style. Beautiful Alexandra Staden, drowned on the edge of recognition under makeup, more like Modesty Blaise is a cast member of Top Model. I'm not one of those immortally challenging comic book freaks who want every adaptation to be valuable pitch-perfect of "graphic novels" - in fact I never read Modesty Blaise - it was a decent movie to watch. But that's not it. The film feels a semi-final with a weak and very clear outcome on a weak field. <br /> <br /> Now, on the one hand, I'm warning you of the events that occurred three scenes, explaining every small detail for me. The B-movie is good - what's better than just releasing your brain and swallowing a Calzone kinematic equivalent? - and "humbleness" directed by Scott Spiegel to us, who drew us a beautiful beater from Dusk Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money! I loved Dawn 2 from Dusk, because you brought a bad B movie to the table for what you called - nudity, gore, weapon. "Trespass" is just elegant. Not interested in flashback related to Modesty's life. The player is not bad enough to make you laugh. <br /> <br /> So, in general, it's just a headache. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; weak, uninspired, call what you want, do not watch what Tarantino is offering it-it's just a very unforgivable, semi-arduous tension and more than that. I do not try to punish my interpretation with a very lying sentence (serious, even I beg): My name is modesty: wasting time of modesty - 4/10
