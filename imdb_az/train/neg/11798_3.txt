I watched Phat Beach for a while and liked it. Sweet boy is the most beautiful character because he looks like a beautiful person. The rest of the heroes are different stereotypes of young men and young black men. I want to watch these low-budget movies, which I spend a little time, because they are almost a documentary film of the year's relationships and fads. Phat Beach is also funny, because in this movie low-budgeted fathers are a serious home-girl. The low-budget movies have a "native babe" quality and you can tell the babies that there are local stripper and dress models for JC Penneys. Some had cellulite-dependent bikinis that would have been fun to watch how "young people" actually overcame what was really used, highly mileage skank. There were also some. This is the attraction of low-cost malware. You will see many doggies and some real cuties! I've looked at some of the IMDb and seven years later, Phat Beach was their loan. Very bad. Someone has prepared a book called "Now Runs" on all cuties that appear in film history and has never returned again. What's going on?? Perhaps there are one or two young people in each movie, so there's more to it, and when you see the movie again in a few years, "what's happening for X?" Anyway, this film is a blow, but there are some funny moments.
