This film is not only boring, it's really bad. Graphs are very bad, not even the second degree - they are terrible. The heroes do not show facial expressions, the moving voice is empty and there is no spirit and the line is absolutely limited ... well and everything. My 5 year old loves him - but he thinks he's a bit boring. I agree with her.
