This movie was terrible, just laid. <br /> <br /> I was worse than I registered in IMDb to warn you about the danger. I watched "Redneck Zombies", "House of Psychotic Women", "Slumber Party Massacre II" and many more. I know our chocolate. <br /> <br /> One-quarter of the film consists of screaming fugitives from one screen to another. Until they work, they deprive each other of their lines, emotions and motivation. Actors are guided when they are accepted. There were very tough downhill shots; I thought Leif Jonker was a 3-meter tripod. I used the "Leif Maneuver" for several million times - that is, avoiding an object of interest like an amateur. Undoubtedly, the film crew did not get enough early enough to shoot a sunny film, so they pulled out the solar battery ... and played it in the opposite style. With this laziness, indeed, the last hero is affected by the scene. <br /> <br /> If you have been in the last 5 minutes eight and five minutes ago, then if you want a good movie movie, "Riki-Oh" "Dead Life." <br /> <br /> Vampire: "Vampire: we will die until now!" He says.
