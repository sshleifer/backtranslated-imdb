Very poor Firestarter clone, which looks like a worse TV movie than a bad feature film. How disappointing is Hooper and Dourif? <br /> <br /> Government contractors are experimenting with a hydrogen bomb. A child born of an unborn child always experiences a fire of 100 degrees, and when an adult is present, people who are alive start to burn themselves. <br /> <br /> Along with her husband, all who fired are good, but if they do other good deeds, of course they change like dummies. When the fire jets come out of the weapons of the symbol, it is not necessarily an exciting, sinister look. And the ridiculous thing is that it's a fire that goes through the phone line and is inside a large jet of the receiver's headphones. <br /> <br /> There is something about some movies: <br /> <br /> Then, in home movies, we see exactly the same shots in these images.
