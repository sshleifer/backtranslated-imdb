A young man kills a woman for no reason. The man's brother was arrested for being guilty, but he runs away soon. After escaping, the seemingly innocent kidnapped three of his victims and soon succeeded his girlfriend into a plot. If this is not bad enough, the situation is a little spiral down. <br /> <br /> This movie has some good features and many bad things. His strong side was actress Emily Haack. It puts it as a worthy actress and a very strong character, leaving the fact that the film is fairly naked. I will not be able to get this experience and will not be able to translate it into a career. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers of this film were very brave and did not take any punches. Graphic nudity (both male and female), coprofagia and extreme anal violence do not go away. I love my horror movies to diminish the boundaries, and it did not completely miss them, jumping in the direction of Gomorrah. Perhaps it was a lot, but I thought they were getting what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now the disadvantages. First, and most notably, this film shows very little budget and film quality. I can justify it - unhealthy, well-functioning and in some scenes the low-quality movie really made the movie more exciting (more realistic). So, I have to have low-grade equipment. It's a poor choice when I throw them. I will not be able to identify for any reason (apart from the film's fluctuation), and there are many images of the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Why do I know why I started sleeping at this point because it was long and meaningless? <br /> <br /> I am also looking at a matter with the title. The idea was to cheat this movie into thinking that it was a classic "I spit in your grave". Now there is a line in which the main character is the daughter of another film. And the topics are very loose (women are revenge on men). But there is no firm connection, and the reason for this title was to think that the video store customer was getting back later. <br /> <br /> My last major complaint is that this plot is not real. Even a little. A woman is killed at first for no reason. Prison refugees find time for kidnapping people to torture people for no reason (because they oppressed her girlfriend). The same man goes too far from good to explain. Similarly, the woman (Haack) turns a normal person into a very cruel and sadistic cause for some reason, and for most, it is wrong to marginally oppose it (adjacent sexual intercourse), but it does not need to be tortured in any way. <br /> <br /> Do not cheat this title or claim that the film is pretty shocking. Yes, some scenes are shocked, but most of the film is boring and wants to take a nap. If you see it in the video store or Netflix, just look at it. Or rent, we can sit around and talk about it. You have been warned.
