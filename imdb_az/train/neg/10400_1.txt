It is sufficiently enough ... sometimes you just have to stop filming based on a long dead idea. The first Tremors movie was great. The second one was ridiculous. Third, he was heartbroken. Television series was terrible. <br /> <br /> This movie is only partly owned by the film. <br /> <br /> Cheap computer effects and puppies are basically another pretext. We now have a series in the Wild West in the 1800s and are fighting against graboids. First, as a rehash, they need to learn how to beat again. I think it's funny. Otherwise, the Tremors 2 and 3, straight-to-video release, goes far away. Oh, and I'm surprised that there is no record of these events ... They just did not forget the story of this unprecedented event? I believe that such an event will turn into a history, so the weight of our first film can not be unprepared. <br /> <br /> These films, which destroy works, make me mad. Avoid this waste.
