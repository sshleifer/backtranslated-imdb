I will continue this short; I would like to thank Greg for that I should spend so much money on this: Capture is a man who wants to drink a girl's drink, jails and torture, and then captures her for sexual intercourse with her. The film is a single curling and punchline. This slow motion has been tortured as a historical aggression. And that's not a good movie. This is not good, not bad; <br /> <br /> Critics have a "spoiler code" that some of them will not be silent, though they are not tested for being so bad. <br /> <br /> Why would a volunteer repeat and say that "this debris and this reason" is beyond me? <br /> <br /> Do not give your money to these cats sellers.
