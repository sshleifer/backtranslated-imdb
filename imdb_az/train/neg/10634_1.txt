Writer / Director Bart Sibrel's works are based here on a film that is misinterpreted by NASA. According to him, astronauts are using the camera thinking, and the moonlight is fraudulent. <br /> <br /> Sibel's research, unfortunately, is not so easy that he does not realize he does not understand. Backstage images are actually seen in millions of millions of live broadcasts (and also this reel) in large part, as it is meant by NASA vaults. <br /> <br /> It is surprising to see why Sibreel had heard his astronauts say his own comprehension narrative about astronauts' voices, because astronauts have only tested the camera and filmed it. <br /> Finally, everyone can see the raw images for themselves without buying Sibrel's hacked-up version. (He points more to the "smacking weapon" of the JFK assassination movie "Zapruder"). Sibrel is the only man who sees him. What's more clear is that Sibrell chose not to use, for example, showing the proper surface of the window frames and, therefore, violating the claim that matte and transparencies were placed in space windows. <br /> <br /> As in most of these types of films, Sibrel is based on the selected quotation to manipulate the invisible victory, the speculation of the appeal, the misleading interpretation and the results of the voters. is not part of the actual evidence.
