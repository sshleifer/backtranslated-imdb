This is probably the worst movie I'll ever see if I'm 100 years old. The first-year students could have been a more classroom project compared to a better classroom. <br /> <br /> I am indebted to spirits paid for this movie. <br /> <br /> When I finally quit her, I was really forced to vomit. /> <br /> There is no idea about photography when doing so. Nobody has any idea of ​​how to operate. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that FH / X would spend a lot of time on this occasion. I just saw that it was one of the Starz! Channels are not even basic. It was about 3 hours.
