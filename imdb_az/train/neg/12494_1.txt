There was nothing about this movie that loves me. It was clear that clarity and camera work and the budget budget were much larger (almost like the Blair Witch Project). There really was not much to do, and the film was just medication and ten. In fact, I have been frequently nominated for the last 1/3 of the films, but it did not help much. It could have been better than this box, but again it was necessary to say: nothing about this movie was good. No good actor, special effects were too fake, camera work was terrible and the dialogue was afraid of pain. In my personal dimension, I'll give this movie 0 to 10. Yikes!
