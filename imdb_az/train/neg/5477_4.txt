Take a SciFi Original movie and mix it with a little alternate / revisionist history and say "Aztec Rex". Apparently, Hernand Cortes had to conquer Tyrannosaurus Rex and his companion before conquering the Aztec Empire. This is the filming of this movie. Considering the field can really sucked; it's just as if something is a tip to the writers. There are a few problems. For beginners it is played by Cortes Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Cortes is not as convincing as playing Ziering Axl Rose Gandhi. Although the Cortes conquered Mexico's indigenous peoples, the Aztec is being performed by the whole Hawaiian ensemble. The transfer of T-Rex (s) seems pretty good, although each of them has just come out of the CGI. They die very easily; I suppose that if T-Rex was around real life, it would probably have been destroyed or at least injured by many weapons of the 16th century. But he takes something away from the movie. There are some T-Rex-yutan-human scenes, it's staggering, but in this context they have worked OK. There are many moves and all colonialist angles are spread, but do not reflect the dinosaur's angle, as opposed to the other SciFi Original dinosaur film, "Warbirds". Generally, the moderate (but worthy of the SciFi Original Standards) makes the movie modest 4 degrees.
