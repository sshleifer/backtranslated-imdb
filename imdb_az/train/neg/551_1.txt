I've had AFI's 100 best comedy lists and it's really the worst. Apart from the 90 films I've ever seen, from any movie I've seen. Dudley is sometimes funny, not Dudley. Liza has done something worthwhile, but, unfortunately, if you just want to see something good, look at the Detention Facility. Seriously, Dudley should laugh and drink laugh? I love almost any movie for more laughter than this movie in more than 100 AFI comedy comics. If you want to see a funnier "drunk", try The Thin Man. Generally, the Funnier movie will kill any Marx Brothers movie (especially if you're drunk like Arthur).
