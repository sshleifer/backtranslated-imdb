Coyote Ugly filmmakers could have been more effective when making R-rated guilty pleasure / exploitation (with plenty of nudity). However, PG-13 rating is what all studios want today. <br /> <br /> A "naked" flick that is not allowed to go anywhere, regardless of the filming of the "PG-13". <br /> <br /> In fact, it's easy to guess what will happen 15 minutes before you actually happen Acting is enough, but the characters are so sophisticated that they can do nothing with them. <br /> <br /> The only assets in the film are incredibly beautiful women. We're looking at some of them pretty tight and pretty apparent ..... but only because of the limitations of PG-13 can be shown. The bodies that work on some rough dance numbers are very fragmented and tangled, but there is no nudity or sex to talk. Tyra Banks (who continues to grow even more with older people) has little time in the film. <br /> <br /> Piper Perabo, the new head coach of Piper Perabo, is also very easy in his eyes (and his killer smile). <br /> <br /> The only people interested in this film are still not allowed to watch R-rated movies. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
