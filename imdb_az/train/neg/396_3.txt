When I was in the theater, I saw that in the 1980s, this was a brave film, and I started very strongly that the special effects were timely. Now it needs to be at least 30 or more in 1980, because this movie really needs to be understood. Because film learning has historically taken into account expectations and other related psychological factors. As I said now, the movie was suspenseful and very entertaining. It then builds a perfect peak .... IT ends, it's also a person who portrays it as a water balloon break before you throw it out, as well as many poetic images. My experience was not strong enough. My wife and I'm good ... How can I tell? We are sorry, I must say that we have made money, and we have spent a lot of time watching the movie. "Both of us felt that we were convinced that the manufacturer we needed to run out of money, and we were robbed of the end that could not get enough to finish properly." My wife was saying good, it did not end, she was completely stopped!
