<br /> <br /> What can you expect from this movie? <br /> <br /> It was a movie. According to the film, Slovenian reformed, became a good woman and did not want to fight. <br /> <br /> In life, Slovenian could be purely innocent, or he just wanted to manipulate <br /> <br /> Whether it was a voice or not, deciding on history, but what a country was a film dealing with dessert, and asked for a fight against the 1974 Vietnam military soldier (Willie Nelson tells the truth, it's not WWII, but the Vietnam War EOES <br /> <br /> According to this film, Slovenian expressed its position clearly and simply. He had a nervous problem. Heck, I have a clinical nervousness and I am trustworthy if I had served in the military, or would not have any problems with leaving my nerve and failing my duties and not achieving a reduction or putting her in a position of MP <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Up to the watcher. <br /> <br /> Serves your country in the 1940s and 1950s. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The whole film could have been predictable to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Such an emotional eruption could easily have operated its superiority in the announcement of its nervous status, but obviously, <br /> <br /> I'm a Catholic, but I thought about the concert of Merian, beaten by Ned Beatty, and she was laughable at the end of what I was reading at the Master's prayer, trying to see who could say faster. <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not see how this film can not explain how Tricky Dick was focusing on Nixon and the Viet Nam War. <br /> <br /> I hope this is worth it for everyone who imitates Slovenian and his example.
