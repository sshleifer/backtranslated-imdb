This should be one of the worst I have ever seen. Proximity can be a very powerful shot, but every scene loses all its effects when nothing else comes from convergence. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott sets out for a very nice scenery to work, Mexican backgrounds, cantons, beautiful property of Anthony Quinn, and Costner's revenge from dusty cities. Unfortunately, we only take pictures of these places so their camera does not cut off a huge, gigantic head. Despite the fact that Costner was driving alone in Mexico, the transition scenes quickly approached. <br /> <br /> The score is dramatic and interferes, and we feel every dictation of emotion. The story itself should be well-developed. Among other things, many people do not go out to help Costner - this is just a bad article. <br /> <br /> This is a typical line of tension, but many others have the same structure and have done something remarkable about it. Costner had a story similar to No Way Out, but it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> The latter was completely anti-climactic and was removed from the film's most melodramatic arm. This movie would never have been great, but if Mexico had seen more and it was less, there would have been a movie watching.
