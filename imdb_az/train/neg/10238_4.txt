It appeared to be good at the beginning of the film, but never got his expectations. The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of Asian directors), but it's a good story to go with or not to say. The story was fragmented and seemed faded in different directions throughout the film, but did not find any solid, unexplained, interesting angle. Basically, the film does not fit the press releases. But the player was very good. All actors made good speeches and Jude Law was outstanding as always. It's too bad to choose such a weak film.
