This film is a mess, but at least it's not ambitious. The box art for the video sells great mistakes in the 1950s as an "entertaining shot". In fact, this is a transparent bargain clerical of Aliens. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers want to take the form of "ALIEN" clearly, but they have not received much money. In fact, they really do not seem to have the money really. I hope everyone has done this job. <br /> <br /> The main plot is stored - a group of people isolated by murderous insectic creatures - and a ground surface for budgetary reasons. Instead of being filmed in space, the film has put everyone in a hospital where everyone can budget your barefoot because you will not hear anyone screaming. Something fun about "Blue Monkey" (and there is something entertaining on this subject) did not leave the aesthetic of "ALIEN". Although we are in a hospital, science fiction experiments are still underway, there is an incredible cavernous addition to the structure of the respected "growth hormone" device. In addition, it is divided into two boilers (or something), so we can give explanations for the heat of the monster. <br /> <br /> Caucasian is a rare imported flower that grows in an exotic place opens. He touches and says "Ow", so we know he is frustrated. Cutting his finger causes him to be unconscious for several minutes and cause a white worm in the hospital (called "mouthpiece" in the form of "ALIEN"). . The worm is isolated, but some naughty little children (leukemia) come out and "accidentally" give some experimental growth hormone. Everyone knows that when poisoned hospital workers attack a crane camera, everyone will face difficulty, and soon a caregiver finds several compulsory cocoa before taking a double-sided insecticide. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is dominated by a semi-screen monster with a half-hiding half-darkness. <br /> Which of us will return to ALIEN? How would you like to build a movie in a hospital, always combine all the bright lighting fixtures in ALIEN movies? No problem ... an electric shock (or something) causes the electrical system to flare up, which seems to cause the strobe lights to blossom in each room of the hospital and vibrate throughout the film. <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Okay, so "ALIEN "the bases do not cover ... OH, the water dripping down the walls! Check ... the big hospital will be divided into two parts, then send some of the moist, drippy basements to go to the other side. The problem is solved, and now there is a large number of "foreboding tunnels" shots. And do not forget the smoke ... well, really, in this movie do not need an excuse, or? Perhaps you're in a hospital, so many things will smoke and burn smoke. <br /> <br /> I will not give players any kind of script to watch. I thought the "Blue Monkey" should be light and entertaining, and that's why it's a nice attempt, but the numbers do not come together, and the film is drifting. If you would like to see this kind of film that has less money and more marginalized ability, see a film called "Return of Aliens: Deadly Spawn". It falls flat in ALIEN.
