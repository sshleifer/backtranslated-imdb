<br /> <br /> <strong> Despite Katie Wright, he is himself and himself. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> It was really like to play such a character or naturally irritating, but for Lexi I did not do a hard job for me. No matter how confused, desperate, and clueless he is, there is no measure and he is a good thing. I understand that the girl who is guilty of missing her husband and leaving the meal is going to be in the act of betrayal, fear and pain. However, Wright's performance is constantly crying and sealing, while the others cry. I could not help, but I felt the problem of the girl because she was not Bulimia's devil, not her backbone. I doubt that the film should be made.
