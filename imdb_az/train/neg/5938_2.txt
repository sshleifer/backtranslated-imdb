If you do not live in the 90s or have never heard of a rapper! this movie might be good for you, but I told any admirer or any other person who is listening to this movie is squeezed and is not interested in a movie or something I do not know. Something that seemed to be something in his life was easier, easily accessible to the prison, he sold medicines, and even had no discussion of repercussions. I think if the movie that has been published for about 15 years may be perhaps more impressive !!! good rap movies to go to the hustle and bustle, to die rich or to die without being unhappy
