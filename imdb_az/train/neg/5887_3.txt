Jane Russell, in a similar way, proved to be an unpleasant musical-comedy artist called "Gentlemen Preference Blondes"? but it simply blends these skills. There's a budget and beautiful Paris photography, but the movie just does not work. Ms. Russell Marilyn Monroe looks like it plays. No one is named Jane Russell. <br /> <br /> Some of the other players are WAY of their own elements. <br /> <br /> There are several embarrassing scenes; <br /> <br /> Alan Young's gorilla costume reads, boneheaded African cannibals have "brunettes" a musical "cook" in a pot. <br /> <br /> This interesting, sometimes embarrassing, spending resources. <br /> <br /> Mr Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (10/29/55) Richard Sale ~ Jane Russell, Jeanne Crain, Alan Young, Scott Brady
