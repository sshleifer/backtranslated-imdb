This TV soap opera script is so bad that even A. Hopkins played at one point as a student of a drama drama, so to bring a life in his excitement. I do not know if this director is, but Hopkins's Ciano has become nothing more than empty spell, fear and self-disrespect. Actually Ciano may have been, but then why did they shoot a movie about him? Mussolini was somewhat more convincing and a long way down to true truth. Edda Mussolini was a ridiculous person, even though he had to be the central character of the claimed familiy drama (not because of Sarandon, but because of his ruthless writing). Just enjoy Venezuela's soap opera.
