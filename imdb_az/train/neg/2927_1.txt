It should be a list of the worst gay movies ever made, anywhere. It surpasss the camera shooting of stars who sit in space and look at space or spaghetti eating cats on the floor unobtrusively. This motion is a story of a boy and a son of a sick child, and they live in their loved ones, swim and grottos, and one of them is a humble mother, and one of them has no mother, talk, walk, swim, sex drunk and then break and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then It turns out and has a long contrast shots that are very fast forward and back hugging and one of them looking out into space or just sitting and doing nothing. I do not know that some of the film's techniques or perhaps the film is so bad because they should be about 14 minutes away from the movie or if they need to rely on the story or story, they should fill in long, faded pictures. Do not get me wrong, this is the 30th gay movie I've watched in the last 6 months, and although some of them are very formulable, predictable, and boring, this really is the best thing ever to date, I watched and after the first boot, I thought it would be a creative sinny mah, but I gave him a chance and watched it and then dumped the DVD when it was over. I'm sorry I did not like it and sorry if you apologize.
