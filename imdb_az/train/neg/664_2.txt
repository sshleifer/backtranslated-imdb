I particularly love remakes, or steal modern jargon "retellings", but this movie really peeved off me. The original Prom Night, my humble assessment is not a witness but still understood what ... horror. There are a few simple things to remember when making a horror movie. It is important to keep the audience's interests. I'm sorry about the nations, but this is a wrapped film! The fear was cheap and very scared. (A good example of a scary story that has now been uncovered is the hidden cat, shortly after, but it's being watched by an unexpected appearance of the movie). This film failed to succeed, so how can we expect to fulfill one of the other conventions of the film? You need to be a hero or hero. There is no one in this movie. The most detected person was the chief detective. Its calm behavior, but the concept of leadership at the escape of the murderer should be the first of these initial films. A general approach to events. (Otherwise, if you run from a psychologist, you will reverse and slide, not to look at the murderer's progress anyway, just to walk on every branch of the road and a lifeless object). If you do not have a friend, you are looking for one by one. If you are in doubt as to the wrong game, do not try to investigate yourself. These clich√©s are tired and well overplayed. Generally in the genre of fear, and in particular in this film.
