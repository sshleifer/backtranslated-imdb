Disney execs she would crassly calculate because my 7 year old daughter loved it. There is a problem with "Air Buddies". It is a film of a large number of children who are full of fairly potty humor, with a well-calculated scratch, a few politically accurate morals and a terrifying G rating. As a parent, or as a 10-year-old, you've done before and done a lot better. Think "101 Dalmatians Only Meet at Home" and get a general idea. I believe that a good child story is a good story, a period. "Air Buddies", which is as original as recycled paper, does not meet this standard. Your child is not the worst video you can watch, but there are better megatonons.
