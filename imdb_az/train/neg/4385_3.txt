The Devil's Little Helper is one of the best B Horror movies ever seen. Better say, it's a story. The film is not such a clich√© in a new structure, the Horror genre - something new. However, there are some funny questions that come along with it. <br /> <br /> While watching the Hero section at HMV, my film drew attention first. I was tired of the "terrifying" Hollywood blockbusters and wanted something different. The lace art of the Devil's Little Helper came to my attention immediately. As you can see, the picture draws you - it's cold! I knew DVD freedom was straightforward - but I was lucky. I do not mean that I first saw "Boogey Man" - that's why it could not get worse! After watching the movie, I was really pleased. I liked the movie field. It was really creepy that the murderer behaved as a little boy's friend, so he could have killed him. If he did not cause some illness, he would have thought he and the little boy would be partners - a terrorist duo. It was a great idea to set up the movie on Halloween night. In this way, no one with a masked person next to a child will think of anything. They just thought he was his guardian. <br /> <br /> If your son came home with a "friend", he was faced with trickery or cure - that's good. If you do not think anything - if he was 9 or older, he would have been. However, when she comes up with a strange man with a mask you become confused and protective of your child. You would like to remove mask from man and identify himself. She asks why she is with your son. He does not know him. You asked him to leave. He is not family friendly. He's a stranger. Now we taught our child not to talk to strangers. In this case my mother is absolutely wonderful. Huh? It's no surprise that they never talk about the "man". <br /> <br /> They think her husband's daughters are, but after 10 minutes, she goes to the desk without asking why she does not say anything. The thing that can get me the most is that all your mothers "want a juice?" It was said. I can not count how many times you say this in the movie. It will die and die - there is water, it's all right! The film was launched in a perspective and was not delivered. This was more fear / comedy, and even as it had difficulty delivering. Maybe Dud, Flop, and so on. You can say. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the film is the lid art. Although something says that does not cost me $ 12!
