I read another comment about this movie, and I usually try not to be tough in my criticism, because I'm trying to be a good person. But this movie is one of the worst films I've ever seen (and this is topping up many of the worst US Network plus cinemax nights.) Think of this movie is a must-stop one more time to do. The fact that this movie is not a movie has hurt me. I really think these people are crazy. Just keep your time and watch this movie. Please - I would like. Acting horrible, plot (what plan) STUPID and insult and mad. I really do not think it's a movie. But that's my point of view, and I'm trying to avoid losing your time.
