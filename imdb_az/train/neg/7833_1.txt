Just saw Stephen Kings' Nightmares and the third week of the Dreamscapes mini series; I've seen 6 episodes so far. I must say that the stories are really weak. I read the skeleton of Stephen's King, a collection of short stories back. <br /> <br /> The majority of life was weak, but it was very nice, if it looked good. <br /> <br /> What I mean is just stories from this mini-series Stephen King, it does not mean that will be a good thing. In fact, if the collection of previous short stories is any indication, then most of these mini series will be average for the poor. <br /> <br /> I have not read these new stories in the defense of Stephen King. Perhaps in a book it is easy to fit stories and television, or it may be the writer's fault when trying to write an interesting article. Who knows. Also, these short stories can be prepared for this mini series and are not for printing purposes. Maybe it may be a problem. <br /> <br /> If Stephen King presents these stunning stories to an editor, I think the editor wanted to make it even more interesting because it is simply boring. <br /> <br /> When I saw this mini-series, it was the old Twilight Zone series, each series was only half an hour, but it was compelling and riveting. <br /> <br /> This mini series has earned a good deal to make a good mini-series but, unfortunately, there's something wrong with that. The first one was a fear story writer who bought a painting by a suicide boss, who began to see the picture changes while driving homeward, feeling comfortable, drawing, but approaching, the individual portrait of that person kills and goes out to kill . <br /> <br /> This premise is interesting and so the story should be good, but after seeing (so far better) this story is too empty as well as the fact that the story did not do anything to help the story, because I was a bit offended.The answers were given after the final scene. <br /> <br /> I worked for 3 weeks to access this mini series, but because of poor stories / scripts, it was getting worse. If the film was a movie, I would recommend people to wait for the film to come out of the cables. I do not even advise you to rent your video store. Nevertheless, since this TNT is a cable channel, try it in a week, if you already see it. If you do not love that week, you will not love what's going on in the past or in the future because everyone has the same dull character.
