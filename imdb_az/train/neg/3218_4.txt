I found this film interesting and exciting in terms of impact, but I found less. The main complex affects the lives of several people and their actions (deliberately and otherwise) on the lives of others. The structure of the film gives a great deal of promise, but I'm convinced that it did not succeed. It takes a lot of time to explain to the audience about the theory of chaos and very little time. As a result, I have never felt any truth for any characters, and I have never had emotional contact with them. Until the end of the film, I had a "what" attitude. A stronger aspect of the character's development would make this movie great, but it stands just so-so
