My 10-year-old daughter, Alexandra, writes: <br /> <br /> I thought it was very boring, and I thought it was just something from the 101 Dalmatians. I did not wait for the movie to end. The best part was initially loans - they were cute and good. The rest of the film is not worth watching. Thank you very much.
