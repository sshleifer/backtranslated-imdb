Hopefully, the audience was joking about Dream Machine as Corey Haim's best and "best films". Unquestionable sarcasm on my side? I sincerely hope. <br /> <br /> The "Rüma Makinası" is the rest of Corey Haim's career (excluding the surprise of Rollerboys Prayer). Here, Haim plays Berni, a non-school college player, thinking that a cool car will attract the attention of the dream girl. A happy woman for Bernie is determined to reward her loyal piano tuner, Bernie-Gift, which aims to return to her cheating husband: a small Porsche Turbo. But, unaware of the woman and failed for Bernie, her dead husband was killed and hid in his body. Now, in this film, Bernie is unaware of it, though the corpses do not rot or have a very bad fun. In fact, the forgetful boy does not know that something suspicious happens despite a few unusual circumstances. <br /> <br /> This is a low-level action, as is the case with many Haim films (see The Double O Kid). Although romantic comedy is part of the party, this movie is a cunning man who knows enough to spend the movie for at least the first forty-five minutes (that is Bernie knows a car and a dead body and Porsche hard to find) . After that, and thanks to the poor who worked by Haim (this boy liked me but was not completely confidential to accept when he was unable to act clearly), and Bernie and his aggression made the majority of the events incongruous and unsuccessful. To inflict insult, the soundtrack was incredibly laughable and more specific to the songs you have heard in Team America (see 'History' assemblage). <br /> <br /> Loyal Corey does not disappoint the abundance of abundance of Haim fans. However, other people who understand that Haim's career has not reached 14 or 15 years of age and has not recovered is likely to be mediocrity, as those who have been looking for b-comedy capabilities from the early 1990s.
