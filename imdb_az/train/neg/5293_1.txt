After reading the text in the box, I drew this video, the story looked good and Keanu Reeves was! But after watching for 5 minutes, I was terrified of his player, he goes and is not always foolish, fraudulent and convincing. It does not end there, almost all the characters behave badly, it's ridiculous, the only accepted game is Alan Boyce (David), but the boy has committed suicide early and did not see it again! Everything about this movie creates low quality, I do not believe how such a thing will be released! I was tempted several times to stop watching, in fact I decided to stop watching and stop working, I came to the IMDB to check other opinions, found zero comments (no surprise), so I decided to force myself to handle pain I came back to finish, and then I came here to come. <br /> <br /> In some films, it was the only good thing to do on the Rock Band. .
