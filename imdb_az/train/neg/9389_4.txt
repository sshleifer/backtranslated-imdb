According to IMDb, as well as on any web site that reviews; this "thing" has no director. Certainly, it will explain many things! Some gangs coming together to shoot some devious porn series and throwing an ultra-narrow story about devil worship and the victim of a lonely sanitary wall. "Hardgore" is actually a basic example of 70 smutin, totally demented as it is produced with at least production values ​​and scripting inspiration. Heroic movies about devil's cults were so popular in the early 70's and in pornography, so why not combine them? Here is a simple story about a young nymphomaniac girl who committed a mental shelter and on the first night, she is drawn to a network of drugs network, psychedelic bodies, aggression, torture and dildo-action. Indeed, many dildo-moves. A friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but she cut her throat the same night. Heroes are really poorly prepared, and ridiculously penetrate virulently cut penile attacks from the mask of the terrible Devil. Photography and speech shows are almost intolerant amateur, but what do you expect from a film about sperm-flaming dildos and talking reproductive organs of amputated men? Leader Ms. Justina Lynn is a very good-looking girl, but most of her (men and women) are bare and over-haired sleaz balls.
