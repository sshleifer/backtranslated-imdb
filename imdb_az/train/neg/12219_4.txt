It was a strange movie. It started pretty well. <br /> <br /> Then comes the "falling down". Here I can say that I'm in a real cheesy "B" movie. How difficult is it to act as a weak, handle a weapon and behave like a police officer? These guys could not be. After the mortality of our psychopathy, we will receive a landing loan and the film's start ... <br /> <br /> From this point on, big movements, sometimes blood transfusions and fatalities are errors. <br /> <br /> Well, he gave the movie four times, as I have to drag him a bit despite his flaws. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend it. I have to accept the film, but I've looked worse.
