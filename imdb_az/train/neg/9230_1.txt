Now I think about it, that name must be worth it. Payment is not entirely worthwhile. I had the opportunity to see it twice, and for the second time I had a great smile. so worth it. and it was worthwhile for the scary pain that caused me at first glance. As another researcher points out, this movie is hackneyed in every sense of the word. there was no original idea in this movie (I comment on the originality of the apartments that are completely negative about me). the film is not a long line stereotype that clings to each other and is paraded as a movie. not necessarily the next Clerks, this is not necessarily genuine, and this is not entirely "good, clean entertainment". The film is an absolute punishment for uninitiated (after seeing it for the first time, the second time can be pretty laughable, insulting). When I looked around the theater, perhaps everyone who banned the elderly found that this movie was completely boring or painful. in a particularly emotional scene, as the place where Nik's mother was born, the audience was overwhelmed by the fact that they were too weak. I have never heard of anyone crying in the theater; I have never been a witness. you do not have to worry about seeing this movie, whether it's a movie festival or an indie theater or where you are. Give yourself a blessing, skip this movie with revenge. you can not afford the opportunity to see what happens to me and what the worst movie really is.
