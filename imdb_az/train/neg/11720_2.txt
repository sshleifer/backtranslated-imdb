I have read about W.Snipes's undoubtedly not going to be involved in low-budget projects like Contractor. Only the 90's penniless action stars (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here is the leader in the cheapest movements in Bulgaria, which is stuck in Bulgaria (we have to think that the place is London, and that it will only be a complete moron). The story is one of the 1000 films: Retired Special Forces If the government wants to save it, the good guy goes away after killing bad guys (not a spoiler!) The star of the film: Eliza Bennett is out of sight! One star is 2 stars, for a star for candy Lena Headey for her eyes. Only for the hero Snipes fans! Everyone else: run away!
