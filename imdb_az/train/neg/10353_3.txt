I have never read the book's Book of Time. Would I really like the movie to be perfectly honest? Yes, I do not need to review this movie. Later, I will say that the television movie was forgotten. Do you know why I said? Because I forgot what it was. I said I forgot you. To be perfectly honest, no television movie will be better than Merlin. <br /> How can I describe a television movie? I'm not writing any reviews before. Yes, I just said that there are usually some celebrities. The wrinkles of time are just one of them. Alfre Woodard (Or Woodward, I'm not sure), Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The film has some cheeky special effects, a gentle comic structure, and scenes that bring you "WTF". The movie is incredibly bad and takes you to WTF. What are you waiting for? This is a TV movie. They are not usually good at all. Like it. Timely wrinkles are time hardening and a great sequence of time. For the sake of getting out, most likely you forget the second one. Yes, maybe not second. Only in a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Timely wrinkles: * / ****
