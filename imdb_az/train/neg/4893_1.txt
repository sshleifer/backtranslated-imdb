The film is actually very slow. There are some nice images, but the fact that the movie is really boring can not be aggravated. When you eat a melon and some more you see a relationship of watermelon and sex. It may even be of interest to someone, but watching it for 2 hours does not believe me, it is not fun. If you smile a few times, it's not really enough and can be more fun than cunning and desperation. Anxiety tries to put some video clips on the film to disturb the director. They are really colorful clips of perhaps absurd songs from 50 but precisely it is hard to say and they are trying to be so tricky that they are really sad. A few times the plot can turn into something that you feel is a strong scene, but it eventually evaporates and it is. Besides the clips, any dialogue does not allow music alone. The director seeks to be valuable and artistic. Personally, I can not recommend the movie. I believe that art is something that should not be enjoyed. During the projection there was a yawning around the movie that confirmed my short overview.
