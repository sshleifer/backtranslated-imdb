I am the greatest fan of the fear genre! I love all kinds of fears / slasher / gore flies. Some of my favorites are really "good" horrible horrors. But these movies are not something to make her look up! <br /> <br /> The scenario was scared. <br /> <br /> <strong> The player is strange. FX is not worth discussing even. "Set" is definitely JOKE! <br /> <br /> Just a couple of days later, I feel I'm robbed! When you watch it, it's better that your cat touches your tooth.
