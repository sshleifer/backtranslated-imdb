What is "Veli" Altman with Robert? Was it saving in the light? Everyone was so laughable that it was so dark in this boring movie. I do not mean that everyone saw a candle lawyer's office? <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. In fact, do not waste your time with anything Altman: The whole movie is an ambitious waste.
