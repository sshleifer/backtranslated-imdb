I just called "Dark Chamber" under "Guard" and I was very surprised. Some of the rave views I was looking at were not influenced by the film, but by watching me. This story is not as correct as it is categorically deceived and operated by many comedies. <br /> <br /> My wife was trembling in my head and could not resist this movie. <br /> <br /> Justin is separated to live with a mother who lives with a mother and a mother who lives with her mother. He warned my father was not good. When a young woman is killed, Justin doubts the tenants living in the neighborhood. With the help of a few pulses, he installs hidden cameras to keep icons on these folks. As truth begins to open, Justin opens an unexpected mystery. <br /> <br /> One positive thing is that Felissa Rose is hot! If I were a little crushed I suffered a bit, but it would not have been so bad. The film would have been a potential saving grace. Eric Conley thought too well, I thought and I'm not surprised to see her more in the future. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film is mainly Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H Rigg (father of Justin). Horror! <br /> <br /> There is nothing against some budget projects. Indeed, the independent film is our only hope to make a decent film in the future. When it comes to special effects, lighting, even music scores and overall picture quality, I'm a bit strenuous down-budgeted movies. However, I do not spare the stick figure and a swiss cheese lover script. There are numerous budgetary budget movies. Unfortunately, they are not. I can not help, but I suspect that at least some of those who praise the "Butterfly House" are related to its production.
