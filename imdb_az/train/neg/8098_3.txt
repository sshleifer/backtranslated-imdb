This is one of the most treacherous writers I've ever seen. If they want to make a movie with a bad story, they should refrain from calling a beautiful book. There is no connection between Wolfe's book and the title. If they help a story flow on the screen, I do not care about changes. At least the changes should not damage the final product. The final scene in the film is painful. Players are wrong. <br /> <br /> If you've seen this movie and you do not like it, try the book. Read the book when you see this movie and you love it.
