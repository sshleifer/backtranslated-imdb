This movie was terrible. The area was sucked, the player was bad, the editing was firm and this movie wanted to put me in the eyes. I wish I had time to watch this movie back. The balloon scene was foolish, the Mormon jokes are really old, the soundtrack sucked, I saw chemistry between two potentials, a stupid "Celeb" cameo full of stereotypes. Most notes Del "I will drive as fast as I want .." computer idiot. The worst thing is that these actors play on their spiritual side and even bend over them. This film helps many of Hollywood's LDS beliefs. Ä°.E. RM, church ball and so on. I would refuse to watch this movie and instead visit the brick wall. For a show, you will have more fun than watching this poor excuse.
