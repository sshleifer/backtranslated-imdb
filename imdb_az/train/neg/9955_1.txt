It's nice to look at everything ... The European layout was a good idea. Leading actors are attractive. <br /> <br /> EVERYTHING IN LIFE! And develop non-plot! And all there was poor down there. Pacino goes to sleep and Keller continues to talk about how boring he is. Darling, we're not alone. When you make a Mae West imitation, you have to hide your face, which is painful. </ P> <p> I can not imagine how an actor or director, Sidney Pollack, was doing this in a better way. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <strong> Maybe it's as empty as his death and had to feel cold. But I still can not recommend it.
