Think of a non-budget version of the Chinese Syndrome, a film that find John Woo will be run by a student and will be 'Power Play'. The idea was good, but the execution, motion and dialogue completely killed him to celebrate the ridiculous amount of violence and calmness of the violence and disaster used to develop the more interesting parts of the film. </ B> This is a story of a reporter who investigates the disappearance of three missing members of a guerrilla activist secretly missing after entering an office of an electric station suspected of hitting a quake. A more courageous reporter is being persecuted around the city (along with anyone speaking) to be "clean" of the evidence that the plant's defects may remain, while opposing something that is more sophisticated. Unfortunately, the characters are very hesitant in their mutual, terrible dialogue and many horrible actions. I do not want to mention that in order to belong to the genre of the film, the audience, who can be involved in the film, has to endure a number of bodybuilding organs and scenes of ridiculous violence plus earthquake disaster. The whole point is that the story should be put in the wrong place, which does not have directions and apologizes for the sequence of more interesting events. Filmmakers are more focused on the backdrop and have paid more attention to the development of the story's corrupt aspects. Those who want to warn the creepy villains, the naive reporter and the wrong reporter. Formal, but at least it would be fun.
