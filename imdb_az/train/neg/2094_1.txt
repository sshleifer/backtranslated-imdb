For almost all demonstrations, I had to endure the old, high school and family conflict. I really do not think about high school girl relationships. I have spent time in hell dealing with such issues and have no idea of ​​the fictional youths who have passed the lite version of horrors. I do not want science fiction. The only reason I'm here. The science fiction was only a few seconds until late in the show. Finally we see a proto-cylon. It was good, but it was a problem. His red eye was locked in a curiosity. We all know that Cylon eyedotts are always back and forth, giving cars a map of the world. The red-eye spot will never move back and forth. <br /> <br /> I hope writers will use this before the second episode.
