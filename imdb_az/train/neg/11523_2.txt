"Igor and Lunatics" is a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-locust horror film, totally inept and amateur's attempt. Apparently, about twenty years later, Charles Manson was surprised by the extreme, but unlucky garbage artists. In other words, there are many boring and completely irrelevant padding images to accompany this attractive area, a typical Troma production. Is it random and there is a bit of uneven nudity on the screen? not bad? but all this is so trivial and ugly, it's annoying to look at. "Igor and Lunatics" are so helpless that they even use multiple images twice, for example, as the apartment kills. The inconsistent plot tries to explain the hippie religious narrative medicated by Charlie Manson and wannabe Paul. One of Paul's pupils, named Igor, is a bit sad about the Bible stories and narcotics, and gradually leads to all religious convictions. To explain just how crazy Igor was, he was really trembling from the breast of a sexy swallow hawk girl! Like a compelling synthesizer player and some really embarrassing pseudo-artistic camera tricks, slow-moving imagery, and sleepless ghost sequences. Perhaps, there is a consistency when trash fanatics are more or less valuable and a poor girl cuts half with a machete. For no reason, the camera keeps the knife in bloody stomach for fifteen seconds.
