*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, really, and does everything possible with an incredible role. I can see that this is a movie that can look as good as a script, but it's hard, difficult and ultimately foolish. I saw fake deaths a mile away. Rene Z. works hard with only a part written and Patricia Arquette is as follows. The detective whose name is not remembered (not Chris Penn) is a great sweat on the actor. If you are not smart enough to be as clever as a film can not explain it, and if you're confused about it, you see it. Look, like the cheesy camera work that makes you seasick. See what you love Tim Roth doing with an unusual script. See night free at night. Otherwise, the hire of the defendants in the courthouse.
