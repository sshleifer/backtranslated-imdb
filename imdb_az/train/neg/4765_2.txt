In fact it touches the intellect, this cheap remake is completely designed to shock sensitivity. Instead of complicated characteristic folds, this so-called tension has a sudden and visible random story change that only serves to worsen with every strange development. The worst of all is the replacement of the original spicy dialogue. <br /> <br /> It was promised - there was an unfulfilled promise. The prospect of Michael Caine is definitely interesting, drawing Keller-to-Sullivan's vacation like Patty Duke. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor, in the first place, was admitted to this terrible repetitive nonsense and lost his reputation, becoming just an admirable performance compared to Jude Law's amateur overpower. <br /> <br /> If the classic original did not appear, review its dated visuals and gimmicks. Hunting him, watching and enjoying a story. Regarding the reconstruction, make these insults original.
