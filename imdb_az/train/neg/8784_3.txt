The idea was awesome, the actors were incredible, the story could have been very scary, but there was no writing and no depth. I really can not access this movie. I could not feel for the heroes, there were many cliffs, and the film ended up strangely. Is there a happy ending? I dont know. Was it a sad end? I do not know yet. You felt dissatisfaction with the theater. The film had a lot to give, but could not. Do not you have to be right, as you can adjust? I do not really recommend this movie because you can not say that it feels like the movie is finished. You will only be mistaken. <br /> <br /> If you do not watch this movie, trust me, thank you. <br /> <br /> 3/10
