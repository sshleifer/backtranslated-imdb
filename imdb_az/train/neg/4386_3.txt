you know that with such a theme, you will not expect a great fear movie. But it was really bad with bad expectations. Suicide is really a matter of injustice and stupidity: a runaway criminal carries a Halloween mask, and everybody around it thinks it's someone else. this joke can actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not all along the movie! The actors are not bad, but their characters are terrifying and the story is boring and terrible stupid. No tension, no excitement and less eye (very inexpensive). The Devil's Little Helper is trying to combine horror with comedy (...) and dramatically fails. To the very end they were so bored that I really did not wait for the last 10 minutes. I do not care what happened. Amanda Plummer was great at Pulp Fiction, but it came 13 years ago and he did not do a decent job later. So it is not surprising that he had to sink down like a crap .. Avoid or warn ..
