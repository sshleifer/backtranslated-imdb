I do not believe everyone likes this movie. I've seen many low-budget indie films, but it's all sucked up. Low budget does not mean that the film is embarrassed. The hero does not mean the movie is demented. There is no fear about this movie. It was just a dark fest, and it was particularly disturbing. The player was average, though the actor was awesome, but the story was enthusiastic, and the dialogue was painful. The film is "artistic" or trying to get something like that. This is not really one of the really great indie movies, which cost thousands of dollars, but incredibly good. It is a pretext for some people to make a mistake for the film. Here are some other thoughts that soundtrack sucked ... that most of them were written by the same person and some songs were written by one of the filmmakers. There was no indisputable quality for this film. My time and my money were completely wasted.
