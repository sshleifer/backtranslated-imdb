This story about three women is very sensitive: MuriÃ«l (Charlotte Van Den Eynde) is the youngest, 37-year-old Laura (Els Dottermans) and Martha (Frieda Pittors), the mother of Muriel. They live together in the same building. Life has different expectations. Highlighted Laura wants a child. Muriel comes from a village and wants to change his life in Brussels. Martha is dreaming about youth when she is a young girl. In fact, nothing happens in this movie because something is waiting for it - an accident - it can dramatize the story. Over time, the director Dorothee Van Den Berghe wants to develop a psychological portrait of just three women. This film creates disappointment because women do not expect to learn from their experiences, so they are left with a sense of emptiness.
