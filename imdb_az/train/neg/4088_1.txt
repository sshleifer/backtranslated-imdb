In my film watching our lives, this was the flow of water. After leaving the theater, I went to see it. I was surprised at how bad it was. Films like these are surprised at whom they are blessed and who owe their grace - a very great blessing. Special effects are at the first grade level because any first-class student could do them. Despite having a ridiculous storyline that does not try to hide the visible knees to appear in the film and appear in the form of an arrow in a street sign, toy rubber bats in the strings. Ed Wood made masterpieces in comparison with "Conquest". Each film student must do this because he / she knows many of the bad movies.
