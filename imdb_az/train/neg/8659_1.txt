There are some things I can not understand. It's like a movie. What really cheap and bad looking Dino and Timsox landfill model I created in Maya, and even cut and cut into an American video clip, cooking and eating the same thing? How can one even believe that a completely fraudulent CGI dinosaur, which is completely out of sight, affect the events in this movie? I know that B-grade, low budget, and all manufacturers can do better when talking about no-one or no sitting. It's not just logical. Do people really make such a fool that they would sit in this way? As can be seen. To Laugh? No, this is not worth the laugh.
