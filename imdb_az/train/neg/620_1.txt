I have seen it long ago and I must say this movie is terrible. Watching fun movies. Scarecreow is not fun. Do not panic is stupid. There is an incredible dark soul resembling a shout of terrible whispers when he kills his victims (which is worse than the sentence). There is a difficult story of chance that he used to justify his murder. "Everyone chooses me, the only girl who thinks I'm a trailer is a guy who loves me and everyone wants to kill me." Okay, I'm exhausted. But the premiere of this film is enough to put it under the list of malicious movies. <br /> <br /> In addition to what I have said, the child's mother is dissatisfied, she goes to her mother, insists that her current boyfriend does not want to leave her own home, refusing to give up her, saying that her husband is to leave her. Boyfriend takes children to the cornfield. She killed her mother in front of her mother, her mother was shouting terror, her lover, "OMG, I did not want to say!" Then she tells the mother not to tell the police about it. Kid was killed in a terrible state. Thus, like any other child who is killed in a terrible state, it comes as a fear of killer. His victims "did not stumble in such a way ..." (official label of Gorkhov) <br /> <br /> This film was shot in 8 days to further worsen issues. True, it's eight days. I'll give this movie 2 because it has one or two paid moments. (They're spoilers, so if you really want to see this crap I will not be able to spoil you). I forgave bad things, horrible special effects, terrible writings and bad camera work, <br /> <br /> This movie is not a good thing for me. If you want to see an example of not filming a movie, or watch the bad movies, watch it at your own risk. Everyone should always stay away from this movie.
