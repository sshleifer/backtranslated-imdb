Good Place is not a great movie in any way, it's a typical way. Maybe it was different in 1930, but those who want to see a farmer's life. Not very interesting to me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni have to act very well, but the movie has taken a long time. The last act of this movie would tell you the first act. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a small farmer who does not want to be like his father, turns out to be exactly like him. They both fall in love with death as their spouses. The film is a complete 360, which goes from one generation to the next. Also, this movie did not have any good character or funny moments, and surprised what was happening as a farmer during the crisis.
