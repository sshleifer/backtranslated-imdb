I have a nice collection of movies and this one has been added. The number should be 274 accurate. <br /> <br /> The title was just beginning to me. Splatter University. I thought it would be a great fear film. I've never been wrong. Do not get me wrong, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it would be much better. I love all movies, but it was a lot of laughs. <br /> <br /> Poor sound quality, poor performance, and poor shooting arrangements are some areas that can be improved. <br /> 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The film is perfect for a good laugh. If you are looking for some of these movies, then this is the one!
