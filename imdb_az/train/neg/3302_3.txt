Swedish action films have become something that has been imitating American tough-motion films, such as Heat, but have low budget over the last few years. This film follows the same prescription as Noll Tolerance and Livvakterna. <br /> <br /> The conversation has already been seen that the dialogue feels artificial and the player is very flawed, especially the main actress. The film tries to draw a picture of a female investigator who, with no conscience, has been overwhelmed by the heavy military boomers who have lost a picture and lost their past problems at the same time. <br /> <br /> The popular photography style does not seem fresh, and even this picture is not good. Only very few scenes seem really good. Also, the sound is incredibly strange and many realistic voices are sounded as it has been mentioned later. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this film is Stefan Sauk, despite the fact that he did not make a convincing portrait of a SWAT team, there is a really comic line of leader. And music is pretty good.
