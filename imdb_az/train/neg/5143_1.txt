Although 99.99% of those who are watching this movie are brazilian, I will continue with English as they are the language of this website. <br /> <br /> This movie is a piece of cr * p. The worst thing I have ever seen. Children are terrible. Special guy. For the first time, I saw a voice like a 5-year-old boy reading a lesson from Arnold Schwarzenegger and reading in front of the classroom. Can anyone be as bad as a major actor in a movie? This story may have been better for my daughter (she is 3 years old). <br /> <br /> There are only three possibilities to use this movie: 1) a pre-teen; 2) You know from Globo's frauds that you think that Globo's seal is awesome; 3) you have a serious brain injury. <br /> <br /> Do not waste anything! A shame on the Brazilian film scene.
