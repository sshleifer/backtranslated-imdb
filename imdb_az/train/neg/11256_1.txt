How much time is lost! I tried to sit for about 6 times through "Sky Captain" and every time, about 3 minutes, I started doing something else - something else! This is a horrible drill movie, the player is strange, and obviously a director for the first time, because it's tough and I like to love it. I love science fiction, old rocks, and I can try to scream Flash Gordon and the Metropolis, but God, I've been working for Paramount Pictures, and in 1993, I wrote to use the blue screen for Sherry Lansing's screenshots. Paramount was released in 1993 after talking about their interest or lack of interest, but she had forgotten her advice when it burned it. The blue screen effect has dropped, but it's completely a movie. Jewish or Jolie's genius actors Paltrow's performance reminds us of the high school effort, very bad - it works, but only under an experienced director's control. Probably, the Sky Captain director will continue to work after this horror. Art is trade, not trade!
