I took the Time Changer and it was a mood for something like this because I looked like a good budget scifi time travel movie. The description was something with some biblical things and time travel, but I said they did not expect a fundamentalist Christian movie! <br /> <br /> It was an interesting premise that could have gone through decent special effects and venues in the film. It was much more interesting than the end. After 1890, a hero with a Bible professor, eventually progressed toward the 2000s and finds that modern life is full of the effects of evil - Jesus will not be found. This beautiful technological achievement is made possible by the help of a sibling teacher who has been able to invent HG-Wells a functional time machine. The film begins to lose some credibility at this point, which fails because it is too early in the film. Previously, (or maybe later, we can not remember certain things), our professor's professor was taught as a scientific class, where scientific findings can only be accepted if the Bible is adaptable. It should be clear to everyone that it is not clear what the scientific method is, but the idea is that the subject of the film is beneficial and supports their claims, and that nothing else is useful. <br /> <br /> In any case, this belief is perfectly valid in the context of the character at that time. Thus, if we accept the fact that life is a reality for these Sacred Teachers, then it is clear that the professor who employs and invites the time machine is not a very powerful believer, since no physicist travels in Biblical evidence (and no one has been offered). So there's a problem with messy messages and reliability right now, but never mind ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Professor states that in the future, when he is satisfied with the leap, he solves the shock of modern technology. It was fun to download for a year, like reading a table for a year, it cares for a horn in a car and does not end its history: it's just two minutes. * * *). Some shocks took a while though. For example, he was one of the first things he encountered when he was in the car, and two days later a church was invited to a movie night and set off on a minibus. He can be head like a dog, afraid of the window with headlights and starter engines and so on. It seemed a little bit like it had been there for a few days with the point and the traffic of the city turned out to be quite intense. Anyway, it's easy to ignore. The rest of the technology shock was good - especially the first encounter with television was postponed because she did not know what was happening until a child watched and remotely used it. Unfortunately, our hero begins to preach to everyone who has been in the forefront, because he is the power over all life and religion because he is from the past and the elder. Finally, in the church where he came to explain himself to a long monologue that stimulates the concept of Christianity and is deeply thought-provoking, it is a momentous moment in the center of attention, but more generally the same. The church is beginning to get a funny feeling about this man (go figure) and examine his name. As a result, they decided to find out about the identity of a time traveler, or of the long-dead Bible Professor, and to find out what that was. The film draws people into believing wicked men because they do not doubt it. <br /> <br /> The professor comes out before those two men go back to their time. In order to avoid being arrested or abducted, they must finally hear how soon Jesus will come and be a prophet. <br /> <br /> According to some information, he was a long time ago, and probably a false prophet), that his sentence was close and that no other information he had sent by God, it was sent by God, without any information being pointed out. br> <br /> As I have understood, Revelation, at the end of the film, we only saw God and the end of the film that the inventor sees (and fails) to try to send his Holiness in the future to the future. First 2080, then 2070 and so on. Obviously, he is trying to determine the exact date of the latter - he will not know! In essence, the whole structure of the film is self-destined, because it is so persistent to know its religious beliefs and God's knowledge that it could not have been a car at first, because humanity finds something that only God must know! The premiere of the entire movie collapses and everything is basically worthless, as it eventually breaks its reliability.
