Yes, I think the pictures are bad for most ideas. . . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> There is a plot - <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> We are sorry, but I was less able to care for Farnsworth's "social illness"; if it always requires a kidnapping around the cornfields that want to steal the ammonia, or if any of these morons are, there will always be some of the people who want to do something to break their brains. So, as a movie you will not call me "Ayova" is "important." But the picture at the level of the scene is more interesting, and the choice of Farnsworth reflecting the position of a meth-head is wonderful, exciting, worrying and - yes, I will tell it - inspired. /> <br /> Acting is uneven, but this may be a deficiency of the style described earlier. Look, Rosanna Arquette is a wonderful actress - but here's not so good, so a discriminating audience said, "What happened?" He has to ask. Diane Foster is a strange thing that is simple and graceful that other players can almost approach one place. For example, I can seriously evaluate any statement that Farnsworth can provide as a trial director of Michael T. Weiss, but I doubt that I will buy it; It just does not work. <br /> <br /> Later, I was still alive and saw John Savage appearing for many years. <br /> <br /> <strong> Economy> </ strong> <br /> <br /> Farnsworth or anyone else is required to shoot movies. So, another movie of Farnsworth may be seen, but if he does, he will not be a unique pope. People are not disappointed with Farnsworth's legitimate and undoubtedly defective film at a time when they were planning their lives in the last part of American Idol. <br /> <br /> What, maybe we can be happy, do not violate his energetic and sometimes happy dreamer imagination.
