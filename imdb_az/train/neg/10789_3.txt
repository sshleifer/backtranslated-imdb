As you expect to see a lot in the Altiok bath, as you can see in the tag line, you will be very embarrassed and betrayed to see that the movie is nothing more than the populist style of the Altynoks in connection with the most popular topics like marriage, marriage. There is nothing invisible and nothing to do, and how much nudity to the scenario, the Altyns prove to fail "trying something new" as mentioned. Sex-related jokes show that the "Altynok" is falling under the famous word "selling sex". I have explained it through a very good story. But in the end I sat down for 90 minutes and realized that I was watching the Altioklar experiment, but I was still focused on the popularity.
