For the first time in a while, I was impatient to end the film so that I could communicate with my life. My uncle's war climb, the patriotic genocide, looking at heaven, was a very simple and pessimistic thing for me, and it was like a work of a movie that once had a magic wizard on the screen. What's going on? It's been a long time since I've been practicing, writing, writing, and interesting shooting opportunities. Hopefully, he finds the inspiration ... At the Toronto Film Festival I saw in the movie, Wenders was there to introduce him. In general, when he was deprived of humility, he offered us the following: "I hope ... No, wait ... I know you will enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid it can not be a mistake ...
