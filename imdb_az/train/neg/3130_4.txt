I really came to this movie wanting this line. I thought that premise had a lot of potential and grew up for an interesting movie. Do not get me wrong here, I did not wait for Citizen Kane, I bought it for B movie. That is, it is still unexpected. The history of the story is over the glass and the end has been so cold to me. There were many trees in the film. In general, I give this idea to the fourth, but the film bases could have been a lot higher, focusing on the film. Worth seeing? I did not come back for two hours, but did not know I would not advise others.
