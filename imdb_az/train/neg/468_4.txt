I just watched YouTube before commenting on this movie. The reason I approve it was to watch something that I had seen in television advertising for the first time in 1980: Barbara Bach's split. And because the movie gets R rating I'm expected to see her naked. There is no dance for the dear, or the other beautiful player he has seen here: Stacey Nelkin is thinking of becoming an adolescent, but it was actually 20 years old. Seeing a porcelain and ashtray and then in a belly dancer dress, Ms. Thrilled as Bach. They provide some of the scattered laughs of this movie. In fact, I do not blame Ron Leibman for losing his credit because I love his "outbreak" scene with Mrs. Nelkin, who is a tightly trapped Liceman, though he is quite embarrassed. This is the debut of fellow Ralph Macchio among the mistakes sent to an academy. Others, however, are afraid of hiding in the middle of the night at a girls' academy, while a boy who loves a son of a politician who loves her son and motor oil, Bach and his sweetheart Candy (Nelkin's character). Tom Poston, playing a role in the band, plays a curly character called Sisson, and I found partial fun. It is staged by Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses, and is offended by the Robert Downey Sr (his son Robert Downey Jr., an early cabbage on a soccer scene), unmatched by political upheaval humor, but actually scattered and sexually abusive, really a harmless comedy covering Mad Magazine and her brand-new boyfriend - Alfred E. Newman - once embarrassed by their name and character ... .PS Another "mistake" was Harry Teinowitz, born in my hometown of Chicago, Rodney Ververgaert . He also said one of my favorite lines: "I'm trying to come."
