W. Somerset Maugham's Human Bondage is supposed to be classic English. If so, here's a lot less than the movie version. Phillippin (Leslie Howard) The Mildre Attraction (Bette Davis) scenario is not so clear as to see human relationships look like post-breakup retelling. I've heard many accounts like family law; <span style = "color: red;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> movie maker, this is an uncomfortable movie to watch. Phillip even brought a baby with a genuine father in Mildre, but when Phillipp allowed Mildre to reach a real high point - angry and now suspicious foolishness - a free move from home, with expected results. Bette Davis was attracted by nearly five years of his life, but that did not happen at that time. In fact, until the end of the film, he looks at the character of Baby Jane, who plays for thirty years. <br /> <br /> I keep in mind that Howard's character is always cool and well-groomed. He tells me that Phillip respects the middle class. As someone who could not escape from a single woman, Cockney's accent is fast enough. Phillip is a student for most film; If such a person were smaller, it would have been more convincing, and it did not seem so difficult that low self-esteem and accompanying student status - English Raskolnikov. And balanced, allowing modality in Mildre.
