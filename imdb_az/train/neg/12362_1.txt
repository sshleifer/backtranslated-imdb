I saw this movie in New York City. The next morning I was expecting a bus, it was 2 or 3 in the morning. It was raining and did not want to wait at PORT AUTHORITY. I went to the street and saw the worst movie of my life. It was so bad that I did not see all the movies I had left, yet I never saw anything bad. Year was 69, so call me. I just stayed because I did not believe it .........
