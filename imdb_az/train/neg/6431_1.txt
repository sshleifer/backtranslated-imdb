This film is a terrible distortion of lies and superstitions set by the most shameless lunatics of working on any television movie. The story is incorrect and is completely false. There is nothing wrong with describing Senator McCarthy in this movie. This is just a terrible deception and I'm surprised that everyone involved with this product has another job in the industry. The Marxist-Leninists who wrote that trash did so to attack a person coming out of history and fear that everyone would have the courage to destroy communism. Unfortunately, this communist noodle took Ronald Reagan McCarthy's abandonment and they were the end of the Soviet Union and its cohorts. He could not stop him. <br /> Never in this movie you are looking for the truth against you. McCarthy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < www. afterewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
