I do not understand the good reviews in this hell for my life. It was meaningless. Matthew Modine has been badly wounded as a prolific ladies man. Gina Gershon, well, others have said it, but I'll repeat again, why stupid? Completely unnecessary. And his player was just bad. I do not know if he was thrown with an accent, or what. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> And the girl was in love with Modine, suddenly she had a half-haired head and a goofy way in her mouth? What's up? We know that when we saw her marrying her, we apologized for her, but the torture began to rise from the start, but frankly, I could not care less than anyone else.
