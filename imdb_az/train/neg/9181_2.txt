While criticizing movies I'm usually trying to be professional and constructive, but God! This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad fun, bad effects, bad scripts, bad things! <br /> <br /> His wife looks at a group of young clich√©s while traveling on a remote island a day (one day). However, when it comes to group, they have an empty dance floor and bloody coat. To find out what happened to the party's marchers, the clan group joins a mission through an army full of zombies. During the Christian era, a police chicken and sea captain who has the right weapon to help all kinds of children help. They also meet with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. Basically, the rest of the film is a collection of weakly focused activity segments, including a very long shot head outside the "dead home". This battle has been completed with joyful Hollywood violence, unnecessary clips from the HOTD video game, and an annoying matrix-esque camera rotation. One of the characters, even volunteers, is to save others from sacrificing themselves. Why? Not because he was noble and courageous, but after some of his face had been disqualified, he pushed him a zombie. <br /> <br /> I apologized to this person! <br /> <br /> Generally, you do not want to see how terrifying you are, regardless of whether you are watching this movie to finish it. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen and I think that the money I look at in this paragraph easily costs me. LIMITED: F.
