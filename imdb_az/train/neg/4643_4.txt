I rented this movie on DVD. I knew what the movie would do for me behind the scenes, but after seeing Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) in it, I leased it. Before the bread films are broadcast on the cable, this is pretty good. But the main character has nothing to do with the feeling that he does not feel sorry for him and is really dependent on the end of the film. There are many unanswered questions. In the end, I was completely surprised, but in general, it was a lot of sub-movies, but I think it deserves a $ 3.99 rents.
