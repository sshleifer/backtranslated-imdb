I saw this movie in the international cinema class and took it away. <br /> <br /> The 4th Adam Reve is a spirited writer, and he has a picture of the danger he expects. She meets with a woman named Kristin in a local book club, and she decides to stay with her only when she realizes how her lover is. Reve loves the Dutch sausage to be corrected. Thus, Reve is preparing a plan to deceive Kristin's spouse so she can have sex with her. But later he found out that Christie had killed three previous men. Now Reve and Christie's lover may be "4 MAN". The story stands for no sense in the field. Everything is fine-tuning and technical about this movie. The film was just rude and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. In general, this is not my cup of tea. <br /> <br /> With Film Reve, JUST comes out of the bed with a t-shirt. So, at the outset, when you are entertaining in your sweetheart, around her orange apartment, you see the beautiful pecker around Reve. Then there is a dream that has been cut by a pair of scissors in his bucket and they then show up with the coming blood fountain. Reve, the statue of Jesus is homosexual in the madrasa. Plus there is plenty of blood. <br /> <br /> <strong> More blood was added than the combination of "Freddy Krueger". <br /> <br /> I tell you that there is nothing against the shocking scenes, but this movie is so clear when it comes to shock. The whole film is shocking around the value of shock. <br /> <br /> So, if you've got any cups of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, keep away from it. My mind is still scared.
