I was very disappointed with this show. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> > <strong> The player was forced and exaggerated. The story had little sense. <br /> <br /> In some cases, why are there so many people that there are so many people? Negative comments about this show. The reason for this is not really good and in this show, knocking out the quality drums helps to draw attention to how bad it is.
