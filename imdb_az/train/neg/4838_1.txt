I decided to watch this because I was an Oscar nominee this year. Like many people, I would like to love this movie, but it is very boring and disappointing. <br /> <br /> The first scene was okay, but the rest of the film was shot as "shaky hands." <br /> <br /> The main cause of such a film is the Oscar nomination: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The US "military machine" (war veterans) faces some kind of patriotism, urging the war in Iraq reason or justification. <br /> <br /> What is the main character with the director's "heroic" efforts and "thought-like drug"? .. Please come! what a hole! <br /> <br /> To see how much the movie academy will fall, watch it ...
