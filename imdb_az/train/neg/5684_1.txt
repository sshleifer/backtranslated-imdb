bad management waste. a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest ... if you are a kind person that you love ... see a reduction. Even if this person is a good movie, the player is really a poor story, filled with plot holes, the director really should just give up and find a real job as there is no talent. People can see uwe boll why I do not like it .. we have some of his recent movies and it's the best that's really sad! The absence of any kind of humanity seems to fit some people, but here it is simply acknowledged. Horror films can be fraught with ruins, they can be miniature paintings of art, and when it's nothing else they can look just fine ... SEED is just really poor.
