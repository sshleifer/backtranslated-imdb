SPOILER ALERT! !! !! Personally, I do not understand why Pete Williams did not help to save his life, it would be a great deal to know why William was motivated or forcibly known. I think that Secret Service members are every day, and the author has a talk. A secret service member, now motivated, is well-known. However, this movie does not satisfy you, but it is an old but used cataclysm, causing an average movement - just SWAT director Clark Johnson has done a great deal of time in order to catch you, and still the producers (such as Michael Douglas) I'm wondering how he left the movie to theaters.
