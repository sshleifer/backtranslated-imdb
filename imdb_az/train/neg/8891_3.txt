Easily play the most famous of all the Shakespeare, where it has been released seriously. In the city of Verona Capulets and Montags have been facing for centuries, but the tragedy is in Rome (Patrick Ricard), Montague, Culet (Rebecca Saire), Capulet. Bloodshed erupts soon ... <br /> <br /> Studying work, especially daytime scenes, can seriously stop the energy of the game. It is a story worthy of being outdoors with its energy. These costumes look like each other, many tribes and ridiculous codices. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Patrick Ryecart looks horrendous, fighting the scene with a very light, very successful and running around, to become truly effective Romeo. The line controls the intensity of the character while walking, but its strange emphasis and limits the range of soft, often invisible eyes. It is very difficult for the audience to relate to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too young to be a good Juliet - she takes the character of the character, but it would be a little quieter. <br /> <br /> Supporting roles are not the best. Joseph O'Connor's Friar Laurence was fine, but most of the best lines were cut off. Anthony Andrews' Mercutio is not the scene, not the camera. He is angry and over-gesticulates and eventually looks ridiculous. Alan Rickman judges his role, and does not exist as Tybalt. In the years to come, he has developed an edge and intensity to show some nice screens, but this is not evidence here. The princess might have a great role with a short look, but actress Lawrence Naismith failed to give her authority over the camera. Only Micheal Hordern, the best roles in this series, come out with any pride. <br /> <br /> Therefore, look at one of the other versions of this story.
