This is undoubtedly Rajnikanth's worst movies. The first part is carried out with a solid comedy from Goundamani, but it gets worse, worse, and completely illogical. Our hero is dig through a lawn of Saints with the same name (Dad) and a totally lame liner. In the first half, Rajni speaks oneliners and stylistic, and in the second half, a beggar becomes a little holy, after taking him through an interdimensional portal to the Himalayas, known as the Babaji (not previously famous Saints). no obvious reason (except for karma) special powers. This is not really interesting, is it not now? <br /> <br /> The rest of the film is to fight politicians and related black magic, losing its magic gaps and forces. An ordinary predictable shit with entertaining application. Oh and the black magic did not work with our hero because he was just a Param Vir ... er .... Shakti Chakra with him. <br /> <br /> Bad guys and ordinary politicians are strangers, they have been worked out, and in the end they are totally unimportant to the area that has not gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> However, despite all the shortcomings, I call on the loners during the social events with the Father. Others have also enjoyed watching the curse of this movie. AR Rehman is said to have created traces of the film through a mobile phone. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan, and only two characters from Japanese origin (one Keiko ... Why is not Samsung called?). for him. However, it is completely miserable as described, dressed, and treated. After seeing it, the Japanese can watch Rajni films. This film was likely to be a promotion material for Rajni's politics, but the results of the film would have killed any of its political desires in any way. <br />
