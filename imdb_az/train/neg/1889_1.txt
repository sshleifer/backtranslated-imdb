This film is not fun in any way, but it is to look deeper into the depths of the darkest human behavior. The toughest bad habits, perverted sexuality, envy, violence and intolerance connect a half-story story. All movements take place in several warm and sticky days during a heat wave in Vienna, and may be responsible for some of the rage and hatred in the heat. For me, the treatment of a delayed girl for a safety device vendor was the worst episode, or scenes of drunkenness and disorder in the "slush" landscape. I'll hold you and I hope this movie is proud. I hated it, but I had to see it. Sometimes, as 'man' to show 8/10 'entertainment' 8/10.
