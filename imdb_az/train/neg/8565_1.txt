Sorry. Someone has to say that. This was really a boring movie. Perhaps it is valuable, but still elegant. When I watched, I immediately screamed. The player is pretty strange, the story is made and predictable, the score and camera work is completely standard and unexciting. This is one of the films that you can not hate (think about people with disabilities) but I hate it, almost everyone has a suspicion. Critics have been kind to this movie. I suppose they can not be objective. I was made to earn this award - I remembered that it did it properly. But what was interesting and entertaining. I have not seen the game can not compare.
