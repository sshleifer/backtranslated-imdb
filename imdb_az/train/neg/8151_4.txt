Leslie Sands's stilted game "Deadlock" becomes a poor choice after winning joint success in "All About Eve" for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill. After killing her husband, her husband's best friend is visiting a friend who goes astray when others start to stop at home. Irving Rapper, one of Brett's best managers, is unable to raise this ridiculous article, which, unfortunately, is so much fun to Davis as he has suffered a spectacular defeat and a strange finale (which stands out from the heart). Production and support have come into effect at a second degree; just completes for Bette Davis. * From 1/2
