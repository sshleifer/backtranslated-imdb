When I read the back of the Alley CAT VHS box, if you're a minute, please amaze me. It says: <br /> <br /> In this part of the city there is a dead thing in every corner of the street - there is another way to die in every street - the best to survive - just like Alley Pussy. Alley Cat - this night's owner. He even knows how to save himself on the streets where he will be a victim of predators - Avoid crushing him and failing. Alley Cat- This animal is excited. <br /> <br /> Now is not one of the most terrible curses you've heard in your life. Whoever thinks that such a terrifying idea can make us attractive to watch the video should be crazy. Unfortunately, however, a tragic person has done a great deal of work when he is responsible for the ingenuity of the British. The film, which is a small plastic case, is as bad as sounded, and then some. <br /> <br /> Karin Mani plays the title role, and scripts basically on each stage (a) kick the men (b) pout as a golden fish, or c) show her female "attributes." Complain about the other two, not the latter. Not just an actress and let's say less convincing as a martial artist. But Cynthia Rothrock's corpse, Meryl Streep (this terrible thought), was unable to save this movie. In a cunning courtroom shenanigans and an exciting way to accidentally gag-inducing love scenes with Robert Torti, enough after an ineptly directed struggle sequence, the opening of the plot trembles at the edge of belief. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> While our heroine is attacked by sexually assaulted and her lean kids aggressive box, finds himself in front of a corrupt judge. Despite numerous proofs against him, he is punished not only to lose himself, but also to be tempted to object to his verdict alone. Behind the bars, there is a group of showers, lesbian disassembly, a few cat fights and a beautiful, sweaty game of volleyball. This ten-minute section has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and its scenario stops focusing on it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> What questions does it answer? is this abusive film, or is it a serious drama? That's not my answer. It is not enough sleazy or camp to appeal to the Troma style fans, and this does not mean that a woman is fighting against the system. it's done in a terrible way. So what do those on earth want to see? Lunatics, I guess .. or IMDb reviewers watching any old debris in the box while trying to stay up until 3pm. Unfortunately, by the way I accidentally failed and the horrors will stay with me for a while. The same mistake did not work. There is hot milk or something .. 1/10
