I saw this movie in a pre-release demonstration at the Writers Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, the producers and directors of the film were likely to take part in the reaction. <br /> <br /> Many scenes were laughing at the audience that would have been a good comedy. it was supposed to be a scary movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience were not afraid, filmmakers appeared. They were released for more than a year. Have I seen anything else but my interest? Do not they cut it back? I can say that they did not happen. <br /> <br /> This is the same bad film for almost a year. <br /> <br /> This is almost "too bad, good" but it's slow and boring.
