At least in time, I will give this movie 3 to 3 ... When I first saw it, I would only expect from a film that was not based on the artistic skills of the filmmakers, but I would like to say the trivial habit of our idealist or more (Kazakhstan) government ... This is " She was shocked by the fact that she was shocked by the fact that she was filming beautiful films because she did not win the title of Shaken Aymanov. Movies such as "Konec Atamana", "Maiden Zibek" or "Aldar Kosa". But after the death of Mr Aimanov, the production of high-quality films has dramatically dwindled in 10 years, and few films have been filmed. In the late 1980s, Assa was shot, a film about first-ever organized crime groups in a large country, a year later Rashid Nugmanov was the same actor / singer V.Tsoyun, then a Soviet / Russian legendary legend - "Iqla" Needle or something) was completely refreshed, someone called it a resurrection or a new Kazakh movie wave. Unfortunately, we do not have quality films these days, and film directors and filmmakers are not filmmakers for French and Japanese financial support, and some are critically acclaimed for professional critics, some of them are priced at international film festivals, and again we return to our "homeland". Such films are often not popular due to their broad aspects. Nikita Mikhalkov had the same effect as the Siberian Cyrilnik and Russian remedies, which were drawn from parity with their foreign partners, either French or perhaps English. Nobdy liked it, even in the Russian public, the main theme of comedy shows such as comedians and "KVN". IMHO
