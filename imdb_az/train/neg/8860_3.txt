Okay, as everyone has mentioned, this movie is a complete dog. To some extent, this was a murder sexfloitation film with many materials (or hidden invisible) to escape the X-rating of the scenario; but there are many other defects in the film. <br /> <br /> Previously, writers seem to have blurred her heirs and vampires. The baddies in this movie are furry and do not like silver, but they act like vampires in every respect. Now you can not do it with only one flaming genre, you must adhere to the rules of the genre, or the fans stop all unbelief and make the whole mix and disturb. In fact, all (surprisingly and poorly presented) evidence is already made for vampires, but a worm does not make any sense in the film. <br /> Secondly, I have never seen werewolf suits. Anyone in the Wizard's Movie Should know that werewolf suits and transformations are something that fans criticize, but some of these worms just run away. <br /> <br /> There is a little bit better bit. Actually I liked the score very much. Others celebrated Sybil Danning's breasts. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if anything like that) <br /> <br /> I also liked the shadows attack plan. The cartoon has a lot of fears while acting foolishly, but in this case first of all, to win the highly sensitive and effective anti-werewolf arsenal and go to cut monsters. I want to say that you can kill the savvy bullets with silver bullets and we have very powerful firearms these days. It should not be too difficult to put two and two together, hmm? But in a typical style, this movie stretches from top to bottom and adds some other very rich and entertaining anti-lycanthrope weapons.
