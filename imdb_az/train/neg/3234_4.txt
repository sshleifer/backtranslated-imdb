Yes, how do you evaluate a movie like this? Do you really have kinematic value? It is a movie that tries to be close to becoming a snuff movie possible. Basically, the whole movie is a group that tortures a young girl. <br /> <br /> Film shootings are very interesting, and this is not true. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the film is trying to be as realistic and shocking as possible. But the movie is just too fake to work as intended. Slap and stumping all soft and fake looks, as well as sounds. They often sit on a clear, not a girl. And it is quite convincing that the girl meets all the suffering. I would like to say that if it were true, of course, it would shout at him. <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> After this movie, eight albums were released Despite the release of this movie, this film was very impressed. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> >
