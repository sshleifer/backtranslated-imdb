The next time the party asks and someone asks, "The other day, I heard the will of the writer, does he know what everyone is saying?" Sit with them "above the water head". Diaz was the only way to save this movie through a literary device spread by bad writers. There are some funny scenes and you'll have some smiles. However, the film does not stick to at least logical analysis. Why did Keitel put Diaz's hand behind her? Why, of course, can make a chain? For me the best part of this movie I've seen on a cable channel instead of drawing $ 4 at the video store.
