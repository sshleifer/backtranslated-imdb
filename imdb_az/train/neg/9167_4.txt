The Leap Years is a film adapted from an e-romance that has become the first Singapore novel to be sold online by Singapore writer Catherine Lim. <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> The film was shot early in 2005 and will be released by the end of 2005, but three years later, February 29, 2008 - I must admit that I am not a fan of the romantic genre, so I can be biased against this movie - I just watched it as a Singapore production and could be used for my debt in my neighborhood library. I have two sentiments in the film. <br /> <br /> Apart from Qi Yu-Wu KS and Wong Li-Ling, all of the things listed here look like Eurasia. Love is Eurasia (Ananda Everingham) and three of your friends, all Jewish, Eurasian. Does this movie continue to stereotype with love and fusion with Eurasia, which is "more" than the general Chinese (or any Asian race) I do not know? Also, everyone in the film speaks of some mystical "anglified" accent, not somewhere in Singapore, of course. The MTV channel says that the authorities want to talk to us, but there is nowhere in the "semi-perfect English" abroad. The film's dialogue is compelling and stylised, but the true blue is not helped by the lack of shooting in Singapore. <br /> <br /> The scenario writer is a liner that works very hard to shoot liners. Twenty minutes later, the film's "clever" part begins and the film starts serving up to the usual layer of clich√©s. <br /> <br /> I have not liked the film, because I have a love affair for more than 16 years. <br /> <br /> There are other unusual ideas in the film. I do not believe one KS (played by Qi Yu-wu) will fall into one of Wong's girlfriends. And the scene called in the room of the bride: "Go on, before my mind changes", is used in TV serials in East Asia (Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan etc.) ... <br /> <br /> So, 4 stars for the movie. The cost of production is fair and Wong Li-lin is the best, but it does not help the scenario. <br /> <br /> Joan Chen has a 15-minute film in the movie and is probably not the best actress like old Wong, but his role is the only one. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the "Years of Rental" or in the library, for an interesting interest in the DVD player, you may want to turn on popularity, but for people who do not fully enjoy the romantic genre.
