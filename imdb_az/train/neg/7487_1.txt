Unfortunately, this movie is too bad. Towners' original output was manic and very funny, of course, using the scenario written by Neil Simon. Neil Simons is not actually used in this film, so the recurring time and the time falls. Even the audience I ever laughed. The road is very slow and tiring, and when it's a joke, jokes die, that's sex couple in the park. They are announcing a lighting ceremony for New York, we all know that the lights will come and we'll see the shadow and shadow Goldie & Steve's rifle bar. All movies are like this ... a joke is set up and given. Why did Goldies hair do not do such a thing in the movie? And you will see every one of Goldie's kinships (they use a very soft lens). If you offer original rental with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, you want to laugh.
