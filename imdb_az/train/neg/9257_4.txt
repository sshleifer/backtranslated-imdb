If you hope for ANYTHING innovation, you choose the wrong movie. Those who think who is the subject may be good at thinking that it's a one-second movie. Perhaps the producer and maybe the director, but I hope they were not serious when doing so. All this movie is changing actors, not the biggest hit DVDs of the 1st 3rd. BHHAAAAD.
