Bernard Rapp died last year and was a multi-cultural journalist. The film was one of his greatest passions (he wrote in the world dictionary of large-scale films) and was forced to use a camera at least once in his life. Despite the sensational performance of Terence Stamp, he abandoned the films he left behind: "Tiré à Part" (1996), "Une Affaire De Goût" (2000) was a cartoon character, but Bernard Giraudeau showed incorrect performance, Pas Si Grave "(2003) has dropped down and is as little as the predecessor of" Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence ". His funny potential is exploited ugly. <br /> <br /> However, the idea of ​​the initial idea is to predict a boiling, moral comedy. A few people caught by Yvon Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain, who invite their comrades, are moving in a luxury lodge. Play with the guests, they claim to be part of a company with each other. And they do not go as planned, because the warning of their separation does not surprise them. <br /> <br /> Rapp's unforgettable director believes that it can not afford this game, unexpected results: The plot is a well-worn example with really well-known functions and masks that describe who they are. funny effect is often fading - a bad edit fades to cut off many films from Rapp with this bad habit, even if the actors have a sincere entry into the venture, they are bored and look better than reading them, especially Sandrine Kiberlain . "<br /> <br /> As a witness to Petit Jeu Sans Consensus, Bernard Rapp's films have never lived up to his intentions.
