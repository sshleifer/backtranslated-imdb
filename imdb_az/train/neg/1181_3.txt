this movie has been covered with scandal for a long time, it has become a very substance ... anger, mystery and so on. There was everything to be a big part of the film, but in the end it was all unsuccessful. This is a pretty bad comedy, a pitiful horror movie, shadow erotic movie. <br /> <br /> 2 DVD discs, interviews, correspondence, goodwill, and so on. more ambitious director. For those who have heard about it, but never see it, the film looks fantastic until you see the movie. disk 1 is a well-translated, well-designed, well-designed visual quality video in English. <br /> <br /> The director of the film has a terrible transfer in 2nd French. <br /> What can I say about the true animal? A hand-puppet of the Kermit frog would be more effective and shocking.
