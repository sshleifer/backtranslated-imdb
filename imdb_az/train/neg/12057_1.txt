Charles Bronson continued with things that could have been the worst movie in the 80s, at least for ten years. He has been kidnapped by an Asian girl and is currently playing a detective that is on a great road to watch a cookie selling it to the highest bidder. This is a shameful act in the action, and it is the most likely film. Many people consider Death Wish Roles as the worst films of Bronson. Death Wish sequels were not great movies, but in most cases mature and long-lasting. Kinjit is a totally boring tension, highlighted only by irrational racism and child abuse. This is really a secret film, and all these are trying to promote a very strong "law and justice" mentality in order to say something. Indeed, the film begins with raping pedophilia with a dildo after being cut off from the old breed by Bronson. The Chicago Theater is an unusual part of this scene, an unusual part of the calm that only raises the girl in this movie. There is no point in this exploitation, and the film is not written enough to convey something that can go up and down the good exploitation level. Bronson looks at things more, but it's amazing to save money. I think Charles Bronson is the most exciting player, but I think this is the worst of all. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * 4- (Terrible)
