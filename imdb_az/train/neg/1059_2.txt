Yesterday I watched this movie and am already struggling to remember this much. The story is about a group of criminals who flee from the penal colony. They fly to the Moon on cosmic garbage carriers; <br /> <br /> According to some statements, the reduction of budget expenditures leading to the reduction of budget expenditures; Why is not this my idea? But we can definitely say that such films are always violent. This is really no exception. It starts out well enough with a good credit sequence and a good dance music soundtrack on the half way. Then it becomes a dull fantasy thriller. So, there are very few results in this movie that I am fighting to write in a full-fledged post, so do not apologize for the clarity of the film's delicacies and nuances. For the record, I remember an awesome sad team, graceful goodness, some nuclear heads and a hologram of a naked woman. <br /> <br /> In some cases, there are a lot of problems for me. I also advise friends who want to send their wallet to sleep and steal.
