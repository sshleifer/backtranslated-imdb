DARK REMAINS is a little budget American fright film. He was able to win 2 awards in a movie. First, a woman committed suicide by breaking her wrists while bathing. Secondly, the technical writer cut off the young daughter with her throat. The angry couple decided to go to a isolated cabin in the mountains. <br /> <br /> As the film continues, the polarity of the story is closer to each other as expected. However, execution does not take place and may cause confusion that can be solved by more than one review. Unfortunately, the movie is not attractive enough to attract most audiences just to watch more than once. <br /> <br /> Everything that goes wrong with this movie goes wrong - it's fast! <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> /> </ strong> The characters shown by other reviewers of this site are uninterested. <br /> <br /> This post provides a large number of people, without giving the characteristic opportunity and without adding depth to any of them. <br /> <br /> It's inactive. J-Horror films like RINGU, GRUDGE and ONE MISSED CALL are mentioned. Unfortunately, the DARK REMAINS directors did not pay attention to the J-Horror style. J-Horror works so effectively because it plays with unknown fear. Tension creates constant changes with a strange situation (for example, a soul on a CCTV camcorder towards him) and a response from a central character facing without any warning. These movies have no humor or language-cheek. Everything is straightened and you will not be able to help with inferiority or restraint, but it must be convincing and engaging. DARK REMAINS directors have shown a brave initiative to escape Hollywood's clichés and have been psychologically affected by the "jump scares" used in Hollywood movies and caused horror. <br /> <br /> Using CGI also successfully prevented. J-Horror was well respected. Unfortunately, lack of inspiration has to laugh at the "fearful" audience on the screen. The makeup effects of "ghosts" were not as bad as taking into account the low budget, but their actions were just logical. <br /> <br /> In this movie I hit my head several times. <br /> <br /> I did not want to end if I wanted to. I did not understand it. <br /> <br /> <strong> The number of people living in the Caucasus is high. The answer given as a reviewer on a different web site is boredom. Film is a job to sit. Unfortunately, the pain ends in an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> There are only 2 positive things in this movie - avoiding scary clichés and the lack of "f-word". We will find a penalty as normal in every sentence. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; "> horror sub-genre. <br /> <br /> If you think you're seeing a lot of movies and want to see a dark ultra-low-budget R-rated horror film about ghosts, look at the HUNTER DEATH. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ strong>
