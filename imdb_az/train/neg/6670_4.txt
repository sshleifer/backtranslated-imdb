This movie was a really good start. He had the potential to transform into a romantic romantic love story with Harlem and Tobe, with his love for long, poetry and horror scenes. Certainly, there was no need to be more than that, and for a moment, I was excited that someone would eventually make a good movie, a timeless classic, perhaps a modern myth. Why, oh why not, then, lower your engagement character (Norton) to another psychological state? Maybe I lost the point, but do we really need a movie about psychos? Is there a need to describe the sick side of human nature, which is more general in the Hollywood movie industry? For a moment I would like to mention the director's name mentally; Now I feel indifferent. At least it was supposed that filmmakers could play the role of all actors. Also, Evan Rachel Wood is a very good actress with lots of potential and is very pleasant to look at.
