The film is quite mixed and ridiculous. The field is terrible ... but also the player with a few good screams and rants is pretty good. Sharon stone is good at this time ... not even as the original mind. Murders are, first of all, not a sad, a shame. Not his unexpected evil, but everyone says it. Sex is sometimes quite graphic, and others are fraudulent (full dress). Scenarios are often too weak, but scenarios of suspicion and suspicion arise between Dr.Glass and Washburn. The plot is curled several times, but the end is terrible. The tension is always "Oh, my God!" Durable with a great puppet named. The intelligence sequence is shining brightly, and shooting and camera angles are effective and bring slightly different degrees to the often-perceived movie. Sharon stone for this is a bit old. The first thing we saw in her chests was delight. This time around, they are very effective. The film itself is very medium, but it goes on a path. Due to the fact that the film deserves a good shaking ... the sequence of opening is being celebrated. If you love the first, despite the fact that I am critical, leave it. Do not break the leak. You will rejoice because you have not left this stone.
