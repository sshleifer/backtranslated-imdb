So was this HBO "prepared for a TV movie"? Is this a pitiful plot and a pretext to act horribly? It's such a shame to see Jim Belushi's recurring role (shot, robbery, lying, beaten, survivor, fired, lying, etc.) into eternity. According to the British, Timothy Dalton was miserable (or, when he just p ***, how much is it?) I tried in the South Sheriff. As for the other Britas, what is the shape of a blond blonde? Recently, there is a tendency to glorify the "English-speaking" (super-violent) violent heroes in paradise, possibly by Madonna's two films, Pulp Fiction, as well as fun and humor-capable to make fun and justify violence. However, this film reduces the genre's limit and value. definitely one to miss.
