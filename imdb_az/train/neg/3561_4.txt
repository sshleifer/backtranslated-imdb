Stephen King's adaptation (written by King himself) to find a home cemetery close to the house of a young family coming to the city of Maine. His father, Dale Midkiff, tells of the Micmac graveyard at the pet cemetery after his resurrection - there is, of course, nothing buried here. <br /> <br /> At a moderate level of "horror" begins in a reputable, insulting and unbiased manner and continues for a while, the absolute worst thing is the worthless performance of Midkiff. It is a bit better to the end with the finale that really bothered you. In fact, the whole movie is really anxious, so I can not completely release it - at least it's something to be memorable. <br /> <br /> <strong> King's ordinary income is as a minister. <BR> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Fred Gwynne, a wealthy supporter as a wise old neighbor and Brad Greenquist. <br /> <br /> There is also a continuation of Mary Lambert's leadership (<br /> <br />). <br /> <br /> 4/10
