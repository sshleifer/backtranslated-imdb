A group of people on earth went to eat a sediment on a planet of living animals before eating and moving on physical mushrooms. Planet of the dinosaurs are full of images and terrifying jokes that run. Acting is also embarrassing, and this is not as bad as the "Chickboxer" (what can be a movie?) It's still terribly surprising. It feels like eternity for a while working for 90 minutes, and you probably will receive great grace and you will simply jump to this bad movie, there is nothing here. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers have tried to sell the movie again for fun as they have done a decade ago as an MST3K style, and although Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs works pretty much, though it's pretty ugly . /> <br /> My Degree: D- DVD Extras: Commentary, 17 Behind scenes; 7 minutes black feature; Jessica Mills report; Styles gallery; and original trailer
