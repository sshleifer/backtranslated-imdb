A film about a small town with equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists. The new family took action, replacing the substitute dialogue, mediocre moving, the green jello salad with the carrots fragmented and everyone's 'Mormon joke' action. Everyone outside the Mormon culture can make this movie a challenge. Everyone in the culture of Mormon will have a little giggling here and there. You will be better off watching Hesse's other films (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.). Player is mediocre. Jared Hess found his hands in better quality films such as "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite." I recommend both films on this liar.
