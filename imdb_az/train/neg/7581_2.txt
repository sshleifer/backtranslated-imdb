I saw this movie one day in the movie class and did not see the movie Almodovar before, but I was expecting it to be good. Unfortunately, with a few laughs involved in two-hour weakness, a meaningless movie appeared. High Heels is a collection of random scenes that may only have worked in their classification films, but does not add any meaningful integrity. <br /> Or I thought. Then, the following day, my filmmaker spent the entire classroom describing all the hidden details of the movie, as it is a comment on the lack of identity in the form of a wall reflecting stereotypic flamenco dancers on the background of the dragged queen. Spain has developed under the Nazis as a nation. As you can see, the whole movie is packed with intelligent visual tricks and references. <br /> <br /> Great, but what are you doing? Still a bad movie. To capture a good film requires more depth and sophistication - yet it is important to draw attention to the audience that the audience is really interested in paying attention to all sophisticated tricks. High Heels gives us strange, off-beat characters, but keeps them repeatable in other movies, and Almodovar does not use it to give any point. What is the significance of the surprise character of Hitchcockian, which goes towards the end of the film? Why is this so? <br /> <br /> There's only one news story to surprise us. And it's just an entertaining moment. The rest of the film is just the apparent visuals and visuals that appear to show how cleverly Pedro Almodovar is. Regardless of what the filmmaker says, it takes more than a seductive fraud to make the film good.
