Chaplin made one of his best films: Dough & Dynamite made one of the worst: Gentlemen of Nerves. During the first year of the film, Chaplin drew one-third of all his films. Many are ad-libbing, editing, gags, layouts, and so on. He was experienced in terms of experience. It happens in a raceground where Chaplin and his comrades try to get paid. In addition to his friend Mabel Normand, Chaplin is also trying to save himself from Mabel's friends. He takes Mabel to the grandstand, has no effect on his behavior. There are many rifles here, but there is little else to wait for Chaplin to develop the film. The article I saw was likely to be adversely affected. Charley Chase can be reviewed. * 4 stars.
