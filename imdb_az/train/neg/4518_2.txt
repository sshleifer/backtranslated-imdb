Several films cut their expectations and criticized me as a fire. The film is ambitious garbage. It does not achieve anything at an artistic level. The only thing that has been able to do is forbidden in India. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> We can analyze the film : <br /> <br /> From the outset, movie heroes feel particularly unusual when they begin to speak English. The author, of course, did not film for a Indian audience; but this was assessed simplifying the international audience. It is unrealistic to see the character of native English speaking in the perfect English language. <br /> <br /> Then we give regular concessions to Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They come crushing and block the film stream. I'm still wondering how the philosophical dialogue on the story is. <br /> <br /> Peace scenes are voyeuristic and maybe not a strong statement, but intended for spectator tyranny. In any case, they can not achieve these two dualities. <br /> <br /> Names for women, Radha and Sita, are the names of Hindu gods and are thus chosen to shock the audience. However, after the film is not intended for Indian audiences, shock-by-name selection is not intended to achieve the goal, it is absurd. <br /> <br /> The quality of the director is very poor and some basic and subtle scenes are poor. A better filmmaker could have created a powerful emotional drama on this subject. <br /> <br /> Nandita Das, though some of her life, was a wooden move, others were wasted. I always thought Shabana Azmi was a good actress, but her talent did not appear in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are an admirer of the Earth and you want to see more of the director, stay away from it. Please.
