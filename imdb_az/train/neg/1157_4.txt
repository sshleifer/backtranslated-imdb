I began watching the movie tenants covering the movie with my close friends (like a passionate fetish), which I just hired on Snoop Dogg's look. Obviously, I did not expect much. I thought about the behavior and images of Snoop Dogg as often seen on the rap videos. However, most of my generalization was wrong. Unfortunately, this film did not work better. <br /> Most would describe most of the film as a dark drama, but I would describe it as a ghostly drum trick. The film tells a story from two struggling writers Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg, who are trying to create their own masterpieces. Their polar opposite forms difficult, but create a very intricate and neurotic friendship. This friendly single roller coaster moves throughout the entire film - most of which relate to Snoop's character - a reminder of someone with a severe personality disorder. Despite the fact that the film is a drama, Snoop is far better than anything else and has a serious tone. <br /> I'm not going to invite this movie because of the fact that there are many dialogues and more dialogues. There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are full of more dialogues. But finally suddenly jumped over to me. It was a great way to get a little wrapped up, somewhat unexpected, and a movie that needed to end. While watching the latest credits, I could not help but describe the director's thinking: "Oh, God, how can this hell finish this snoozer?" By the way, the director has carefully demonstrated the instructions and inclinations that the mosquitoes led - all of which seemed clearer than Waldo in a miraculous street, with nothing but a black sweater.
