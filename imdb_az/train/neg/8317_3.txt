<br /> <br /> It's surprisingly boring for a movie about a murder. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens and the events that are happening do not actually make any real excitement and interest. <br /> <br /> Cassetti provides a great performance, especially for Succo's unifying and stupidities, but the rest of the castle also needs the same. <br /> <br /> The point is that the direction and the truth is not as interesting as Succo is not a unique character, it is not interesting or interesting. These types of films are usually trying to create tension or empathy, or anger and it can not create anything, except for the feeling of regret that you have spent on your watch.
