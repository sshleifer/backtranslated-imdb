Your opinion will not be limited to the work of this budget on the doctrine; pray, who wants? <br /> <br /> A small hot-boom ride, the end of the world brio and style is inventive and lacking. It's just 50s of similar films. And it's not just, but EOTW plays like a hybrid, not just the Day of Judgment, but it also drags it unobtrusively. The murder of a film is a well-known actor. <br /> <br /> This totally shameless collision is part of the 70s genre of exhaustion that has so far been exhausted. In any case, the secret laboratory of the monastery is some bad part of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is proud of the end of the world; but the end of the world is its pride!
