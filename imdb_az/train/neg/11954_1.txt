This movie was terrible. Throughout the entire film I was surprised and did not see any point. I have to go to this site and read a review to understand what it is. It's not worth watching the movie. Not only sick and rebellious, but completely STUPID! Please do not watch if you are not one of those who love watching bad movies. This film is a country that does not want to worry about visiting or knowing Japanese society and their values ​​and roles. This is a completely sick movie !!!!!!!! I did not mean it because I did not like it. My husband and I waited to see whether there was a horror there. Overall was desperation.
