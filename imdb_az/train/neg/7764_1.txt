What is this ? Low budget sex comedy? In any case, it is perfectly described in Spain. They have created a better idea, that is, they make such films since the 1960s and so on! This is neither a teenage comedy nor a family (you will not let two boys kissing the 12-year-old, you never want to go to Spain). <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This should be at the "R" level, because only 35 + laughs as if watching men: S really disappointed, maybe I do not like gay (an important part of this film). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hide out horrible (except Kusturica), drama in foreign humor films! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
