Any movie that starts with a cowhand that embraces a female calf can not say much. As it was about 50 years ago, when it came to stereotyping of kibbutz, I was there, and it was only. OK looked at every little thing in the movie, such as young people in the kitchen at night, but we can not show all the kibbutzes full of them - we say - nonsensical features. Each kibbutz had its own problem, but not every kibbutz was not directly related to them all. Israel's thoughts were great. I still remember my youth called Emek (valley) in the Eden garden. Yes, and the player was good, so it's not all black - just misinterpreted - the goal is also.
