Filmography: Perfect, beautiful camera angles (I remember the movies I was late late, so far I do not remember). With a soft camera missed terrifying scenes. <br /> <br /> Music: Not Impressive. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify" The songs will not be in your mind after watching the movie, maybe I'm expecting the same quality as the "Anniyan", a disappointment. He must come out of the slow heavy duty line, his age and belly, and he must avoid the nearest romantic followers, too, to see a mature / old star trying to play as a hero for more than 20 years. <br /> <br /> As we mentioned above, over a period of time, in the film, I'm not sure why it was so. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, Gautham it is expected that he will prefer another. "Kakka Kakka" is a movie that has disappointed me. It's slips on a few scenes. <br /> <br /> Generally a good movie is a lot of graphics REQUIREMENTS are not for kids (and some adults waiting for "Entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
