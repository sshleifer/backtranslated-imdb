I just hope that classics / ancient historians will see "Cleopatra", or if they have accepted it as a laugh. The film is a heroic mistake, even more funny, even from the "Gladiator" (at least the historical errors are well-written scripts that are open and story compatible). <br /> <br /> Octavius, who is the heir to Caesar Senate before the Caesar's assassination of Caesar, ages 19 years old! <br /> <br /> Along with this, the actor is mediocre. Timothy Dalton, when he says "Caesar Julius Caesar," has a sign of James Bond. Billy Zane is a ridiculously tight Marc Antony. <br /> <br /> Thus, Leonor Varela is doing his best to become a charming pharaoh (not good in real life). <br /> <br /> This is a warning to all historians - this is not the story of a movie!
