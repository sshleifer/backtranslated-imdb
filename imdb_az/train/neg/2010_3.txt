Oh, this movie - I thought I waited too long to get the dog ... I do not believe I've followed all the stuff. I think that would be optimistic. Small dialogue, miserable action and absolutely impossible happenings. When Toby's mother hangs herself, she pulls her hands to retreat in a room with 24 'ceilings, and nothing can be done around a chair, counters or a suspended body, perhaps possessing the last family The little girl playing with her daughter was the best actor in the entire film, and the first pair was the closest to the pups. The main story has potential and a good script can be a serious creepy flick, but this version is not despicable. Every month, when I open my electricity bill, I'm scared.
