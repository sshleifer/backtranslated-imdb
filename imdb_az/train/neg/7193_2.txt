There was nothing I could do last weekend and tagged with my friends to watch a movie ... any movie. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <p> The only film we saw was the Inspector Gadget, to go for it we decided. A movie that can only appeal to children. Oh, and it's not like I'm really fond of movies targeting young audiences. But this movie had nothing to keep in my mind. If you do not have anything to do at home, go to sleep. It is better to earn money than earn it. Check if you are a child or a parent with a child :)
