My friends and I rented it with high hopes for Bad Movie Night, but Brain was auspicious. The brain itself is respectful, but largely sits on a small platform. Think Brain will be cool, just getting in the munch of three people within just minutes of the 94's? This film has a lot of things at first, including Estevez-Knockoff, a leading rebel genius (whose great intellect is to put a stick on the chair of each other). There are also some lines, there is a breathing apple who has a difficult form and everywhere, and yes, a chick is naked. However, the director is in need of some education in pacing art. The last half-stuff, at least 3 or 4, are starting to drag, making the trivial, boring chase scenes, the middle third of the field. The scenes in the PRI complex are particularly bad. At least 15 minutes of this movie are on the same ladder and below. I made the scenario half an hour - more cheese, more darkness, more nudity, and more for the brain movement. I'm going to make a bad movie movie, at least give me something cool to look at when I superego. Maybe the director tried to bring the movie to the audience - I felt like one of the zombies in the crapfest until the end.
