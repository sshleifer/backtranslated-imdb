The only reason I remembered this movie was the biggest donation of time and money (and still). When I was 17, my friend was 18 years old. The action films were the most happy we had (completely 2nd). <br /> <br /> My wife has just begun. <br /> <br /> With her husband, truck, and rocket launcher, the film is totally insulted by the dark evil guys in the shotgun missions on the 4x4 VW Bugs. Please ask, what are the missiles on a truck that is known to carry plutonium? What's worse is that VW 4 can take up to 15-18 shots from a rocket shooter. At VW, we opened two shots with a rocket fire, the last one was cut around the car, an additional fire with a second two missiles, then to the side, then to the front of the truck and now turn it back. <Br / <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> It is simply ridiculous.
