When I started seeing the posters and talking about this movie I was immediately excited. The Matrix looked incredible and can not wait to see the second, especially after seeing the trailers for other films. But when I saw it, I left the theater as much as I loved it, and it was a man who took a lot of movies with me in the theater. The motion scenes in the film were just as nice as it was, but it was simply too small. In the first film, it seemed that the ongoing battles were going on, but the latter took on more (and very unsuccessful) advocacy points. There was not much to be expected to sum up the area. The cars collided on Zion (not one of these spoiler, but everyone saw it on the ad). The film's dialogue was totally horrible. If you are not a psychologist, you will not understand most of what is said in the movie, and that's why it will not just be in trouble. He was transformed into a romantic film by showing the events taking place in the life and relationship of Neo and the Trinity. Agent Smith, like the first film, had received all his religious and propaganda, like bad luck. Personally I do not need to pay for it to hear it or listen to it. The film was a serious loss of my time, and I do not think I can follow the first one. Mainly dialogue and constant drill and dry monologues from every character often did not interest me in the film, and a small number of good fight scenes brought me closer and the film ended up being over. How does "Conclusion" end? How genuine this nation is! I'm surprised that Wachowski brothers should come out with the midnight oil. As a result, the film was bad and that was the end.
