Generally, I love dinosaur movies, but it's a clean shit. No script, no dialogue, no activity. And brave Colonel Rance is trying to show that she's tough, and the stupid Proctor from the Police Academy looks like a twin brother. So, it's full time (I'm happy that I do not spend money as I have seen in the movie). And I really do not understand seven people who appreciate this bottle. They must joke. My advice, if you see this title, escape from it!
