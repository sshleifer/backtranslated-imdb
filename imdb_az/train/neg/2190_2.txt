** Possible Spoiler Ahead <br /> <br /> <br /> Jason (a.k. Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon involved with a car crash on the most jerky screen, along with her husband, Virginia Leith. Late is suddenly cut and the doctor returns the lid and rejuvenates her head in her lab. The exterior of the mansion was taken to Tarrytown's Lyndhurst property; Laboratory scenes were shot in the basement of one of the visible. The taped head is stored on "lab equipment" that looks pretty cheap for Ed Wood. Some of the feelings of library music appeared in the BODY BENEAT of Andy Milligan after the high point of the film. Leithin's head has another metaphysical expression of a secret mutant following Ever's one another. At the same time, a good doc, prowls the ribbon joints looking for a wife deserving a closed noodle. The end of the unobtrusive baskets, the crust's monster, has a premature splash and disintegration feature when it comes out of the glass to bring it to a bad neighborhood. This thing went on for three years to be released, and then the audience admitted that it was richly worth it. Meanwhile, the 9th PHOTO PLAN 9 and a few others should be declared the Year of Turkey in 1959.
