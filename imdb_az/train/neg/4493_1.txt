I tried to solve everything that could be considered spoiler. <br /> <br /> I think you've seen the first movie or at least have general information. Therefore, not all these can be logical. <br /> <br /> Enjoyment: This film is happening again with tired philosophical ramblings in an attempt to win audiences. <br /> <br /> As he wakes up in a recent film, Neo is bombing again with one purpose, purpose and choice, and a long, now existing life cycle begins with its existence. <br /> <br /> There are many comments in this movie that will make me uncertain that they will not look like spoilers. <br /> <br /> If you still download indefinite references, you will spoil the movie, * Read the following paragraph. <br /> <br /> The power and weakness of faith emerge. Strong and weak sides of love and temporary nature also emerge. The mutual dependence of people and technology and our belief in technology are also evident. The importance of choice and practice emerges. The clarification of more things will turn into something very detailed, so I'm going to avoid it (like writing a commentary). BTW, "discovered" means that we were hit by our ears and eyes with nails. <br /> <br /> Storyline: How do the Neo and the gang come to the start of the post-war era? In short, they keep their faith and use stylized action and bullet-time out of style (and after the show, filmmakers and makers value each other slightly and delicately) more. More then. To avoid compassion, I will say more than the pre-made promo material: Neo is still trying to figure out Matrix and looking for answers while trying to rescue people, and Sion, the unhappy goes after him and his cohorts. <br /> <br /> Action: While fighting martial arts and shooting the predecessor in equal portions, this movie is relatively stronger than combat weapons, adds a sword, sais, and so on. Special effects are often used and wrapped around the face of the audience, making it really tiring. I have discussed this film in the same way with friends and colleagues, and nearly all of them have found part of the action series - "Smith's Fight", which we heard especially in the movie - to be very long and tedious. <br /> <br /> This is a huge red flag, because you have ended the motion action. Because it must be completely satisfied with awesomeness, which is a bit more than the end of a sequence of action. <br /> <br /> What scenes in these battles? They are highly stylized, top-end sequences that are wooden and thirsty. In the first film, some parts of the action had a sense of despair that fighting was not just about healing, but also a good thing in the black and the skin. Watch the Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this movie, to remind you what a good fight sequence is - you will not regret it. In addition, the "Matrix Abilities" is not appropriate for people to be in Reloaded and, in fact, is not consistent. The first film has led to contradictions here, but they did not seem like the Reloaded. <br /> <br /> Special effects are poured onto and over. Everyone is doing something, just hopping, shaking, spin and just in many cases, slow down with some sort of destruction , bullets or highlighted. It is clear that W Bros earned a ton to shoot this movie, and the boy did not throw it in any real limit. The sharp editors really could have helped, but the first film was such a hit that the free domination was clearly given, which brings us to us. . <br /> <br /> Character and dialogue: I have already said that the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical ideas. When the comedy and the leadership direct the viewer to the character of progress or are totally indifferent, actors can not really subtend to their character. <br /> <br /> <strong> Chenan's performance is at its best. Keanu is good at mixed action and everything he does in this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> <br /> </ span> <strong> / div> <div style = "text-align: justify;" <strong> Moss is not so incredible. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; <br /> <br /> Hugo once again brought her a strange feeling. <br /> <br /> Hugo is an Agent program, but he also suffered the script. I really find the most interesting character of this gang, but instead of the development, they give him an excuse for a huge, staged struggle scenario. <br /> <br /> In general, if you have good expectations in this movie's fantasy and accept yourself as a stand-alone movie, it is still terrible. I do not see Matrix deeply, but I see it as interesting scifi romp, with interesting ideas, good moves, a few comic lines, and quite limited symbolism and elusions to be attentive. Reloaded has failed in all these counts and I really hope W Bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment. Of course, I do not have much hope for this after the film.
