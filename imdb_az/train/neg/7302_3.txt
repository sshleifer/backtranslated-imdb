The first five minutes of this film showed potential. After that, he went straight to the illegal comedy directly. The best part is that, thanks to Joey Kern, Supertroopers can not stop thinking. I recommend watching this movie for the true truth of learning how to shoot a movie. There are many scenes in this movie that stops alone and surprises all the castles and crew are standing at just one point. The most amazing thing about this film is that it has earned $ 22 million at the box office and costs only $ 1.5 million. The lion's gate is the ability to congratulate and draw.
