I will not criticize the film. There is nothing to talk about here. Perhaps there are scenes of good animal movements, which are quite amazing at that time. Clyde Beatty is not a complete matin√©e idol. It is a little lightweight and is not particularly good. But that's okay. He's the guy in the lion cage. We know that when he does not incline his girlfriend to get away from his lions, he will end with an island and save the day. Previously, someone said it was a history lesson. The scenes in the circus, especially the children hanging around, are other days. I do not know that in the 1930s they even walked in three masted boats. It looked something like the 1860s. Undoubtedly, everything has collapsed. They always talk about stabilizing it. There is even a dirig. At that time, we talk a bit about the relationships with men, a kind of giggly silliness. But if you do not take it very seriously, you can watch it.
