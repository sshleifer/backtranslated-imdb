Ira Levin's Broadway Smash is coming to the screen with any meat in her bones, with only a few tips and a twisted mystery, but does not value anyone. The sad writer Michael Caine, stealing a bright young man's work and releasing himself as himself; his ineffective plan can be involved in killing Caine's talented boy who is a gunman in arms. The first action that everyone presents is doing everything to keep pacing up with a player with Caine, in an exciting way. Dian Cannon's wife looks a lot worried about the miscast and the role of good writer Christopher Reeve (in the middle part of the film) as his wife (she is a very stylish and clever ditch). These three characters and Irene Worth's worrying neighbors do not even imagine that what happens after the establishment is as good as the second movement is. Sidney Lumet's direction is almost fuzzy, the design is unconvincing and bad, and the final is a general disaster. Actors are struggling to give some substance to the script, but we see that such subtle materials are what they see. * From 1/2
