Now that I've watched this movie, I've lost valuable moments of my life and I will never come back. His film is simply poor. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia considers a race issue, but does not like the "white" people. because there is no white actor. Mate, that's why we'll be able to find out why anyone does not like it because watching dyeing is more entertaining and entertaining.
