After seeing MIDNIGHT OFFERS, I am still convinced that teenagers will make the first decent film about witches. I did not think much about it, and I'm not in CHARMED. A little movie (about crazy witches) liked me very much (LITTLE WITCHES) (1996) and was not even very good. However, if you like all the above-mentioned movies, you will enjoy MIDNIGHT OFFERS. <br /> <br /> In the early 80's, I'm looking forward to a generous and cheerful movie about teenage witches at the high school. But I was surprised that this movie played very seriously. The player is always worthy and serious. No joke by teens or anything. And first of all, I thought music was good, it was very good. Dangerous violin and anyone using some fears and "stylish" things. As the film progressed, I came to the conclusion that the account was very ambitious. <br /> <br /> Simply put, if someone sees a car and then moves at normal speed, it should not add dangerous violins. <br /> <br /> It's Melissa Sue Anderson, it's kinda. A few weeks ago, I saw her lover in the ONE DOÄžAN ME, and she was a very pleasant, strange, strange (and sometimes unlucky) slasher-movie, as she did the same night with MIDNIGHT OFFERS. And it should be said that he was very good, like Vivian, of the ice-cold evil witch. But the main problem with the film is that there is almost nothing! Vivian causes death and accidents, but that's it. Then there is Robin, the best witch who only learns about his powers. And we will use their two powers more than once, but once the tree and some other things use their power to fly from the air. Should there be a fight between two powerful witches? And even worse, I hope to see a spectacular show-down between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects, eyes or anything ... but nothing. <br /> <br /> So, the two walks were good. Music account was worthy (despite being too ambitious). And cinematography was sometimes dark and moody. But is not it a good movie yet?
