This show is incredible. . . what he represents and what he has done. . . can not describe how crazy ET's words are. They will tell everything. A communication will even tell if it is remotely related to the reminder. If Tom has a dog cats in the yard of the cruise, they will tell it. If a celebrity dies. . . talk about it weekend, talk to the public about envy. If you have a famous trial. . . ET will report AIDS at the end of the month. There is no time frame for explaining what this show is and how much time it will give to a story. Do you even think that reports are legitimate? Reports are very unbearable, sound with noisy noise, and end with an unnecessary break to deliver a sensation. I can not watch this show without questioning the existence of mankind. ET is a great reason for getting up early tonight shows. I'm sorry that IMDb can only give a slight star rating and zero or even weaker. This show is worth the -10 stars.
