This film really had the potential to be good. Some subject sciences scientists have been taken by HADDEN. And Dolph is always appealing to some of his roles cheesy. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a hero monk (!) who goes out to New York and sets out to open a door under a monastery that monitors the rest. 2000 years. It is necessary to fight the body with a spirit similar to the body, HIDDEN and JASON. The goal is, of course, the key to allow the antichrist to come out. <br /> <br /> If you think that noise is fun, do not forget it. Unprincipled women are followed by archaeologists and co-owners of Dolph and Minion. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Pacing is pretty dull and slow, the best-acting subpar and combat scenes deteriorated. Dolph sits in his role and turns into one of his worst dialogue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> >
