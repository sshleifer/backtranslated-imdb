Designed for another piece of television! It's an insult to a war movie (I'm using it in the most loosest form of the movie!) When Telly Savalas's career began to sound, I thought that the Birmingham videos on Tarrant were regularly on the race, but then I forgot to take part in it! I would try to push her into a subconscious memory, but the cable TV repeated my memory and shouted it! <br /> <br /> I love the little 40-year-old Fenerbahan in the movie, a little (laughing laugh!), but at the end of the Skaid there is an unshakable weight of the Zagreb Cathedral. Also, the coaches of this team are looking at the coaching staff, the logos of JZ (Jugoslavia Zeleznice or Yugoslavia State Railways) on the Logom side. Is not it just a movie in the UK, though it's in the majority of the film? <br /> <br /> Cheap waste and a waste of cellulose!
