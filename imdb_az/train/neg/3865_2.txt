This is pretty bad. Poor actors. You can say that they are really working hard to polish one round, but we all know. The writing is very clear and simple, and it is sad that they are trying to sell them. <br /> <br /> It was a disappointment that we live a hard day away from the screen. We only have to know where this train fugitive is. But that's just because we're on TV. If we were really PAID for that, we would hate it. <br /> <br /> Thus, at least 2 stars get to be at least fun / charming. And casual music (tested-against the tough indie soundtrack) is a funny way to Scooby-Doo episode ... but it's not good.
