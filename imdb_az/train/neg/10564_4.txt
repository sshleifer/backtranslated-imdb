The true gossip of The Gathering is not a bad move, nor is it too shallow. The real shame was worse than this one, though there was a major temptation: Takashima. In just five minutes, I would like to see Laurel Takashima in a room with Susan Ivanova. He also has a fierce sarcasm that has a virtuous and loving double-faceted personality. Unfortunately, the Babylon 5 pilot movie has a very tough story about conspiracy. Patricia Tallman - better than Lyta Alexander, who never returned to the series until a very long time. Here Lyta Iskender, here is a very clever, tiring telepath. I'll leave you with a last thought - why Delenn looks like an outer space frog (even if she is a woman)? Thank you for the skies because they look at the show later on.
