Well, I watched this movie a couple of years ago and now I drew it from the dusty trash to watch it again and I say that this movie is good. As you know, this movie was Scream 4 as Final Stab last summer, but this movie is not a good movie. Probably, there were some defects and of course, it would be fun to leave these theaters, but half of this movie is still bad for a half-hour rally. Some fear and some really hot women can add. Of course, Joey shows the new look of Lawrence, though he has not been able to give him great Hollywood roles ...... I feel bad for a man, he had such a career with his blossom in the early 90s and his 90s , show some Disney movies and eternal Lawrence siblings ..... Joey Lawrence was a little player on the sitcom scene but then went to the south with low-budget movies just like this, as it turns 360 degrees. <br /> <br /> When you protect the movie, there is a secret secret to know that you are among the squad, really hidden, just disappointing at the end to find the secret. He also threw the killer on, I had an idea, but I still thought he was lethal, but his motives were a great rage. Now, there was a missed secret? This film could have been one of the better films. <br /> <br /> I was also a sucker for college subjects, but I was going to go to a spring house in a similar hostel here, so I just felt sincere about this movie. <br /> <br /> So slasher flicker. It's good for a midnight movie.
