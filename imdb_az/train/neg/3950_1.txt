In the early 1990's, at the Devri University (or ITT Tex?), He added a great repertoire of technical degrees in the film. Well, this movie should be class valedictorian product. With my friend, I leased the original 1980 Boogeymani in Netflix and this movie was on the flip side of the DVD. Do not waste your time with this movie. Terrible terrible terrible. <br /> <br /> The film's owner adds 2 main characters, one woman and her therapist. The woman draws her first movie about Boogeyman and her victim. More than 50% of the film is made from original film. The rest of the film is the main character with dreams, and his therapist dubs a singer. These scenes are drawn through a dense filigree as the gloss of the molds. Angela was looking at Lansbury at age 25. So it's awful to write. Do not watch this movie.
