While watching small people, we are trying to understand the many holes in the field. And that was not a good sign, because this movie should have been a comedy! It should have been funny! But you? Probably not. <br /> <br /> The main problem of a small man is his concept - a very cartoon comedy, so high, used and most important jokes when <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> can be. True, but there is no excuse for this unique excuse. When you see a baby with MANS FACE you think about it, is not it least suspicious? And if calvin wanted to hide the diamond badly, why did not the random hand of the hand leave her in the nearby shelf instead of hand? And how does a skilled physician know that Kalvin is a growing person? I mean seriously ... what? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What is good heres is that little man has a tremendous laugh, and it only distinguishes the mood of the mute. <br /> <br /> If you really want to watch a road fraud that proves brotherhood, stay at least a few decent laughing white naked.
