I guess Eddie Murphy is, of course, the reason why this movie works so well in the safe. I think he was his first film since Beverly Hills Cop. Given that there are more than two hundred million R's, and that it's about 80 million, it's not all the popular ones. I have never been a great admirer of Eddie Murphy, so there is no reason for that. Eddie found an assortment of missing children. He must find a golden child or the world is in a very dangerous situation. The area is very bad, but it does not compare the special effects, as it is bad. In the 1970s, I had done a lot better, some of these offers, Ray Harryhausen, did better things. However, the main reason you see a movie is unfortunately not so funny because of Eddie, and it's just stupid to put it in the scenes of "Lost Ark's Raiders". I think the fish is hoping for water, but it just did not work for me.
