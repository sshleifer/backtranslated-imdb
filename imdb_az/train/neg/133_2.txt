The reason I saw good movies was a hidden preview, and I never saw this terrible teenage slasher movie. Almost yet not enough? Scream and Scary Movie at least did not take it seriously! The field is silent and the player is the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story has a lot of trickery, which can be compared to many cinematography. The girls are like each other, and now they are not killed, and who did not. It was only Denise that I had known before, and he was a film. The less hero I saw was a bad excuse for little actress. <br /> <br /> As far as possible from this movie. (2/10)
