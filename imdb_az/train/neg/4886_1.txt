According to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again performed by Priscilla Alden) was released from a psychiatric organization (six people) and was delivered to Hope Bartholomew's half house. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> This movie suck! As you know, when you start out with open credits, you're experiencing a problem, and as you can see from the first movie, it's a television screen. After ten years, Nick Millard (under his nickname under Nick Phillips) decided to return to Crazy Fat Ethel's world and decided to spend a weekend with a budget that included an empty bandwidth and video camera rental costs. Let's just say Millard's unique style is not translated well into the video. Seriously, I've made home movies with more production costs. And Millard strives to take a midnight night, which falls half the time it takes to film a movie (which seems to be removed from the old VHS copy). Alden is as good as Ethel, but the film is so poor that you do not feel sorry for playing it in the trash. I want to say that at least the first film tried. There are no music here, weak effects (if possible), vibrating camera work, terrific audio and editing, as if it were connected to two VCRs. Avoid all of these!
