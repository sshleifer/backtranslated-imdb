The world may have come to an end. Unfortunately, this film still remains a testament to Canada's inability to shoot inevitable films. Perhaps, all our truly good people (Norman Jewison, Martin Short and El) go to Hollywood.) In fact, it's too bad This suddenly ambitious and banal film is not short. He could have given some reliability. The Canadian government should implement --- and this is a great example of a movie - earning money is not a good cause. When they had to compete with the public funds and compete with the people, they were forced to have something worthwhile. They are still ashamed of a whim.
