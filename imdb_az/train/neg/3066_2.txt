It's a terrific rebuilding of a marginal but popular movie since the 70's. In fact I've seen at least 6 times. The 1997 version is a 20-minute movie, '2 hours' or 'crammed'. By the way, the cheese story is completely different from the original. The government's largest presence was a great deal. There is no post-scene stream. Get an original beer or reach the bathroom and you can still get it. <br /> <br /> It took only a few hours to change the oil pad on the car. It is several times more than real life. Car children see these things. The fools or fools who have chosen to abuse the 1968 Charger and the 1970 Challenger should be thrown to the ball with a bullet. The fact that they are not "car men" is painful and their passage is not heartwarming. <br /> <br /> Actors did not have any emotions, everything was cut off and dried up. One step above monotony. A barmitzva is more exciting and energetic. Last but not least, Radio DJ has announced that Challenger has shot 180 or 185 (?) bulldozers. That is the common trash. Do you say aerodynamics or lack of them? Hahahaha !! This movie is a joke. Do not waste time following this.
