When I was 10, I saw this movie for the first time. My mother bought it at the local Kmart because it sold for $ 5 in the VHS. She would think that I and my brothers would be a nice Christmas movie to watch. However, this movie came out of me and scared me to hell. Can you ask yourself, how can a film about Santa Claus be afraid of anyone? The structure of the film sends a window around the Devil to try to kill Santana and destroy Christmas. True, Satan sends a devil from hell to kill Santa Claus. When Santa rises on Christmas Day, Santa throws out Santa on the eve of the Christmas holidays to trap him on the earth. Because Santa does not return to earth, he turns into a clean one. The film does not mislead me, the movie is entertaining and entertaining, but the dancers who dance in the depths of hell (at the top of the film) are terribly creepy.
