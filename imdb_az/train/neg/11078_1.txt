Honestly, where can I start? It was a low budget, HORRIBLE film, and it was so strange that it left us with laughter absolutely flawed! Swords did not have fierce battlefields, they played with some plastic swords they had wal-mart, and all they had to do was just try and fight! One day, I was in a mood for my family and really a good action movie, so we decided to go to the store and look at each other and had a Sawtooth Island movie. </ strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> "> </ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; I'm incomplete that the director and the manufacturer did not even know how much time they spent! But you're going to go with this movie ... do not buy it !!!!!
