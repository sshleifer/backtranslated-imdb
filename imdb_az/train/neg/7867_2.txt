Okay, I tried and tried, but I can not get this Guy Maddin thing. It was cold from the Tales Gimli Hospital, a movie about the Austrian peasants and the Ice Nymph was pretty good, but the story was missing ... and this nudie movie about abortion and hockey is very boring. I love the silence for Melinda, but I do not like his films because I do not love Quentin Tarantino's films: they are better homosexuals for more creative films - the art form or the new place - and style and no substance. Despite Tarantino's superiority, it is not possible to hide that David is an unusual David Lynch wannabe: he does not usually write a shameful dialogue because most of his films are based on interlations. The Golden Line, Maddin's State, is a clever smart film structure for post-graduate films.
