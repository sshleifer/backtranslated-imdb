THHE remake made a great movie in every way. Most remakes have become one of the best in terms of rehearsals in the very talented direction of Alexandre Aja, as well as the end of being a common trash, and there are also mutants belonging to the human sub-genre of horror. Another man, led by Martin Weisz and wrote by Jonathan and Wes's father and sons, "I can not make a good movie movie to rescue my life now" Craven and this is the Weisz leadership skills and the young Craven's /> THHE 2 is not only good at first, but also by writing fun for a painful future without losing fun at any level. <br /> <br /> Although we have a pretty graphic mutant baby born, it's pretty cool, but you will not be prepared for the future garbage by pointing out what might be happening in this movie. Then we will see a scientist who will be briefly presented and distributed by our districts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First of all, from today, in the United States, the real massacres for most of the THHE 2's working duration are actually in fact nothing wrong with what is wrongly misinterpreted It is a job to be watched. Imagine only the opposite of the seas in foreigners and think of how these soldiers are taught. The true shame of this film is that many of the geometric invaders would like to see that as in the first film, they will not kill, in fact, if this does not have THHE 2 description at the beginning and <br /> <br /> are quite low levels. pre-made and uninteresting as before the previous party. The Mutant, who was also a sediment, was like a Jumbrum who helped them in the 3rd movement. She was waiting for a baby to ask for Ruth or start going on Rocky Road Ice Cream. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it is disappointing and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Gore is in the movie, but in fact, not as visual, in fact, most of the mutant baby had nothing but the first birthday. Another great strike against this movie. So what's the job here, the answer is nothing. <br /> <br /> This was not about making a profit from the success of the first one and actually making a "good" movie, especially after the intended sequel. <br /> <br /> I can talk about the fraudulent Drill SGT. There is a shortage of speech (right, he is a man who does not want radioisch to help a real crisis) or a pacifist fighter similar to the same character pattern as the "hero" in our first movie, but I believe. This movie is not even in the same league and even on the same planet. Another topic should be added and added to the Saturday Night Line on the Sci-Fi Channel. It could have been a real shame as to continue firmly, but unfortunately it looks like another fright film at every level and gets one of my lowest prices, as I have given the same account as THHE 2: 2/10 Horrible: Words, it can not describe how badly it is in the unnecessary form of any armor, weakness, or lower right from its predecessor. Next time, guys will continue to do this ... even worry. Please do not support these garbage in theaters, protect your money, and then thank !!!!
