Never watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It is able to create a parody of the 1950s and 1960s, but it's as if you're watching one of them <br /> <br /> This is very naked. It should have some aspects that favor the oral paragraph. <br /> <br /> There is no such thing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Save yourself. It's too late for me, but ... just not watching.
