<br /> <br /> I think I can comment on this issue. <br /> <br /> I love the number of those who want to make this movie "compulsory" or "binding". <br /> <br /> I think that because of this film, we are giving a little thought to it, and it is polarizing. <br /> <br /> The issue of global warming is to force others to "do it right". <br /> <br /> This is particularly appealing to more "liberal" people because they have nothing to do with the morality of the bedroom, because they usually become conservatives who want to "be good". <br /> <br /> Problem with the film: Al Gore is a politician. And very successful one. He can not help himself apply to those who want to force others to do what they want. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> <strong> <br /> /> Another interesting question is how the Ecological Movement was abducted by such people?
