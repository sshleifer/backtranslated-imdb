This documentary is based on the incomplete considerations of Brian Fleming's evidence, which, unfortunately, does not speak in contrast to significant evidence. Perhaps its most important mistake is first of all: Paul's allegations of the invalidity of Jesus Christ's testimony do not take into consideration the basic facts as in Paul's epistles: These arguments show that most of Jesus' central claims are already based on the words of faith that existed over several years of Christ's death and resurrection has become. The expressions of early Christians are not simply a fantasy. There were many who claimed to be Christ, but only one of them remained: Jesus. Why? It would be unfortunate for anyone who believed in Christ to be Christ, and if they had known that he would not be resurrected, they would die for these beliefs. Though the Scriptures are more effective, we are still talking about Jesus, who was throughout the life of the other witnesses who point to inconsistencies in these Gospels. The Gospels have a pre-written argument. <br /> <br /> What I'm saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-motivating piece of work that hits various arguments and arguments to serve anti-Christian thinking. Do not be fooled by a poor investigation.
