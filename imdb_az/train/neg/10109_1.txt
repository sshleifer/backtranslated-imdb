BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; <br /> <br /> I have never seen Ulli Lommel, but as everyone thinks, I thought it was terrible. As with the films I started, it is not even more than six when added together! After reading the comments, I was forced to see how bad this man was. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>. Correction is easily the worst. This film did not mean anything, and it did not stop so long that it was just over 45 minutes. He could not get it anymore. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
