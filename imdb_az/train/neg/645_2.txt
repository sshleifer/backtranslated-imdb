When I saw the front view of this movie for the first time, I really did not expect to see it. The plot looked good and the setting was good. I want to say that the small night slasher movie is a great idea! And Ammunition: A Lisey teacher who is sexually explicit in connection with one of his students is crazy, imprisoned, and runs out of little nights in three years! The night of the party, a happy and memorable night, turns into hell! But I saw it and it was very disappointing. It's not the worst "horror movie I've ever seen, but I've seen it was one of the worst films ever! Above all, it was not even scary. There was not a moment in the film I jumped from my seat. The crime scenes were so cheerful and boring. All slashers killed their victims several times in the stomach or killed their throats. There was also no strange (his PG-13 rating). The scene, which was the bloodstream, was probably the place where the murderer killed his black girl. <br /> <br /> Then, if you see the killings first presented in the movie, she throws her throat and blood leaks on the sheets hanging around (they will not actually cut her throat). <br /> <br /> He is not mysterious, creepy, or scary. <br /> <br /> <strong> Despite the events in the Caucasus, one sample is about to kill the main characters at the end of the murder, and at the last moment, the detective shoots and kills him. Also, everything in this movie is foreseen. <br /> <br /> As a result, after the victim appears with a knife, he works for his life, conceals it, thinks it is coming out, and then kills and kills only. <br /> <br /> Finally, the sequence of the film is very bad. The boy goes to the hotel, kills a few people, finds bodies, shoots a fire alarm and everyone evacuates. The main character loses something in his room, kills, runs, and escapes. This is so! He and his wife go home, slasher kills home patrol supervisors, finds the girl, and then kills her by the detective. <br /> <strong> <font color = red> PHOTO </ font> </ span> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; The movie was not shown at the movie theater's smallest theater, and my wife and I were the only ones in the theater with these two girls sitting behind, and the movie did not tell me anything in advance.
