This film could be the biggest disappearance I've ever had in renting movies based on IMDb views. Generally, I just found a second-grade movie. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheung is passable, of course, as it works with antihero and Ma Wu as hilarious powers of character. On the other hand, Ma Wu's make-up (facial hair) was so obviously fake that I could not take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The Caucasian Tree of the Language, the 1950s, it was like a bad monster fever since the beginning of the 1990s, although POV shooting in terms of language looked like Sam Raimi's trademark in the new "Evil Dead" trilogy. Pyrotechnics were awesome and the last battle is as boring as you can. (In fact, when I reminded Robinsons of the "Space Lost" episode where the sandstorm was captured) <br /> <br /> The land is not particularly original and has not been a large number of European stories. There was no tension and no place to go. <br /> <br /> I just returned this movie to Netflix, and then I write this review. The first thing I did was check production history. Yep, 1987 says ... I can be since 1967. And it sums up pretty much: the production values ​​and the FX are typical of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> As Hollywood produces some exciting and challenging films in the 1960s, the plot and the move appear older. <br /> <br /> *****
