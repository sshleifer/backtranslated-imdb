I saw the 7.5 IMDb rating in this movie and decided to watch this movie, which my guestroom rented. He said he saw before. "It was funny and sad! I cried for the first time I saw it," he cried. Perhaps it is worth 10 to 7.5 compared to other Bollywood movies, but it's worth more than three in comparison with all other films I've ever seen. Any movie can not guess what will happen in my future is not good for me. Heroes are incredible that this action is completely groundless and their motives are inevitable. It's dramatic and songs are all great. The biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of tension. All feelings are too late and therefore no realist. Among the least sophisticated characters, it is necessary to magnify any emotion or link with an unnecessary song. I understood that the relationship between father and son was much more like a parent and a friend than one of the children without being singled out for five minutes long. The foolish comic relief completed with a funny piece is not funny or necessary (we take it, it's not the sharpest tool in Laxman's casting). <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> If a movie tries to tear the most invisible means, it does not mean that just one thing not embarrassing. <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> In general, if someone has terminal-stage lung cancer, the son who lives with them knows that something is wrong. Counting a large number of field holes. Initially, the film was entertaining and sweet for people who did not see Bollywood movies, but it was just tiring. In the first half and at the end of the film does not have all the fun stuff in all the heart-shaped parts, so it's great to have a fun and heart-wrenching movie. SPOILER FOR ***** ***** Probably, there was more depth than other Bollywood movies I saw, but not many. I spent more time in the movies than the laughs. I did not shed a single tear and did not look like it, but on the contrary, she drowned in an attempt to end dramatically. If you want to watch something good, I do not recommend this movie; I want to watch a sad Bollywood movie.
