When someone sees this bad movie, it is definitely not, "How was this a bad film taken?" or even "Why did I first see this horrible thing?" However, "What did I learn from this experience?" Here's what I learned: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Horror movies' "rules" are cataloged and satirized in the last 10 years so one will not go ahead and take a movie. <br /> <br /> If you are not casually ** depicted by the movie's video game, there are script problems. Black character will not always die for the first time, but Asian character always recognizes kung-fu. <br /> <br /> How proud you can be that "Matrix" <br /> <br /> Being a Ron Howard's brother does not provide a qualifying role. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" - If the scene is not created correctly, simply use some images from the video game, and nobody will see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - <br /> <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> Anything that you can draw two lines after you've asked someone "What was it?" <br /> <br /> For a few years, a big studio for Sega's student film is free. Try it out! <br /> <br /> You can only release three Dead Dead movies, so it's not George Romero. Or even Paul W. Anderson. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse movies, but I've seen 'Mortal Kombat: Destroy'.
