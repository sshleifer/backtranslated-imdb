People, who created this film? And more importantly, where can I get a little bit? The opening scene sets the sound of a movie: a woman turns into a bare worm instead of a naked shadow in the wind. And it's not the nation of Rick Baker's 'American Werewolf' transformation. Here's the worst make-up in the movie. I can only imagine a naked Annik Borel (movie Daniela, the protagonist of the movie (not a word?)) And a sticky carrier in Italy about asking for a walk with his fur. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Values ​​of male male actor Daniela and his condition or something about waffles as minutes (I can not remember, but if you do not laugh, the dialogue is not so bad ) <br /> <<This funny thing is that Daniela is not even a werewolf, she is a man around (apparently, as she was raped by a child), she thought she was a wolf's arm like her father. He can not help but breaks the throat of every human being and wants only to be loved! Daniela is in love with a curious stuntman who is looking for things she has encountered and does not trigger 'episodes'. <br /> <br /> <strong> Daniela's chances do not keep him from being a brutal return to the film. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" "I spit on your grave," Daniela remembers, assaulting the attackers <br /> <br /> This is 100 minutes of my life I will never go back, but hey, this is the game you play when you are a movie geek.
