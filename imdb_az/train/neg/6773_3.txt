One of the most commonly used entries in the 'Goofs' category is anachronism. Although I begin to believe that the anachronism and other goofs are better taken, even in very good films, but the rotten films are found in the front and center. <br /> <br /> For me, it's a decayed movie and a rehearsal of anachronism, but it's almost anarchical when watching it closely. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the airplane, which ordered the film, certainly goes out of place. Four Honda Motor Vehicles After Honolulu 1944, C-97 Stratofreighter (MATS Colors) looks like a post war. In the end, the warplanes, who fled from the carrier, were Douglas Skyraiders, who came in after WW2 and became popular in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> However, apart from these two films, of course, hairstyle, everything else is probably very original. Only 'feels wrong'. I am Stanley Donen's admirer, share the same birthday. In 1949, along with a police officer in Ford, there was a car followed by a car. However, this does not mean that the movie is not in the WW2 era. In fact, as I have shown later, there is nothing that says it should be a WW2 cycle film. Only in this way think. A great movie about sailors in 24 hours a night in New York, based on the Broadway music of a war era, based on the work of the artist Paul Cadmus (The Fleet's In 1934). <br /> <br /> In the first period, said that he did not do anything to prevent it from happening during the war, and that it still has to be written in modern cars. <br /> <br /> The first problem is the old Cary Grant. While a Navy SBD is too old to represent a diving bomber pilot, Grant is Hollywood's tradition for young stars like Gary Cooper (Lou Gehrig), Jimmy Stewart (Charles Lindbergh). It was not his age, but his role. She is an operator she uses to call them. While doing things, he gets something and breaks all rules, so he is amazed and loved. Hustler. A whore dealer. It's a tough character in a service comedy. <br /> <br /> It's a comic center that is likely to be a service comedy that's contrary to the grant's comedy style. <br /> <br /> Greater Daddy (1938) or Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) and he is a great reactor reducing down to a befuddled pond in an inert jelly of comedy. At KISS, he is expected to be not just a comic spark plug. People were primarily exposed to the type, and recently the comedian Phil Silvers were in contact with Sgt. Bilko on TV. This role will then be improved by James Garner, but here Grant appears not just funny and excitedly cajoling and finessing, a bully gained by pushing his Cary Grant. <br /> <br /> However, the place where the anachronism begins is the leading women. There are more women than Suzy Parker and Jayne Mansfield. They are unique in decades. Marilyn Monroe Carole Lombard and Marie Wilson can be placed in a sustained manner, and Grace Kelly was another high class dame (Mary Astor thinks), but never had an anatomical inflated woman in films like Mansfield. Of course, there were WW2's "Cossack Girls" (for example, Lana Turner), but Mansfield extended that point. Suzy Parker was a model running model. Manken was the first natural girl to change and captured her identity with the camera (FUNNY FACE (see 1957 Stanley Donen)). Of course, in the style of the 50s, there are many sexual harassment in the 'wild' parties, but there is no sexual sign (in the 50s, television shows the Grandfather of Baku and Bob Cummings Show ) just returned from 'history'). The original book I did not read was published during the war and played at Broadway at the end of the war, and the nuances of the situation were inevitable to the modern readers and audiences, but split and spread <br /> <br /> Therefore, after a few years of reorganization and fatal violations, Until the invention of VCR and cable television, this remains a forgotten stain in exemplary careers. <br /> <br /> Thus, CITIZEN CAN (see Charles Foster Kane really says "Rosebud") and Westworld (why robots are first of all a lively warrior? a rotten film is disrespectful, even goofs are really unavailable.
