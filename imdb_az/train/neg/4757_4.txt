Some time ago I saw Sleuth (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but now Jude Law, his wife and wife. The story is still alike and a fantastic game. <br /> <br /> In the film, I always had a sense of watching a game. This is one of the reasons I do not like the remake of a classic. When watching a movie I adapt to a game, I still need to feel a movie, not a game. Kenneth Brannigan made some wonderful films in the past, but this time he missed. There was another reason for the film. The design was modern, stylish, clean, uncomfortable and cold. I never felt that nobody lived in that house. The picture is not bad, but the lighting was terrible. <br /> <br /> Sometimes there was blue light, darkness, and green light. Michael Caine and Jude Law are the best performers. I really would like to see these two people playing on the stage. But I have to admit that I have never been an admirer of Jude Law. The weak part is the middle part. I remember that in fact this part is still mysterious and simply stunning. I tried to watch it twice, and it was always in the middle of my dream. The latter part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not horrific, but for critics it looks like a movie rather than the audience. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece of Shaft (2007).
