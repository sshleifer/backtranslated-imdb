<br /> <br /> <strong> Anyone who loves Van Damne can not see how he likes this movie. <br /> <br /> The film really begins with a word. At the beginning of the film, I can say that the action scenes are very good. Moving scenes with family closed to save the twin is a great start and the main story is well settled. But the film is down the hill. <br /> <br /> It would be better for Basbug to remain with its original structure. These brothers are born in different parts of the world and learn different skills. A brother had to be capable of martial arts, but his other brother should be experienced in firearms. How comfortable it is to be a great sign of a brother without a gun before a gun and to deal with breakthrough and high leaps in the art of untrained brotherhood. br /> <br /> Field, movement, and so on. it's just ridiculous. My favorite scenes? Van Damne is facing an armed soldier AK-47. The soldier is about 100 meters away. Instead of targeting and flaring Van Damne, he fights a warlike warfare and flies to him. Van Damne continues to pick up a pistol from a missing soldier and still shoots him ... yet he is 75-80 meters away. <br /> <br /> This film has one of the most frustrating moments. Bolo Yeung is an experienced warrior. But a good fight instead of choreography. Bolo throws barrels in Van Damne like Donkey Kong. Extremely aggravating film that promises too much. Become a Van Damne fan, get your time out and watch Hard Object or one of the previous movies.
