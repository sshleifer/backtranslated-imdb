Does not a single piece of musicist describe one piece by himself? Unlike countless other films related to "Ray" or music artists, half of the fun (or on the couch) makes them enjoy great songs. Here, all the tracks are covered by unwanted symbols, and Cohen's slow, jazz style does not suit. The popular version that sounds more often sounds bad. Yuck. <br /> <br /> Interviews are more or less than other musicians and figures, not Kohen himself. In the film, Cohen does not read his works (never read) - letters, poems, and so on. It is rarely what some read. The film really does not know much about the artist's life story or about its development throughout the year. A great disappointment for a great Cohen fan.
