WARNING: COMPLAINT SUSTAINABLE ALLEGATIONS <br /> <br /> There is a parallel universe where there is a dark, biased, controversial independent film that Gone in 60 seconds. Unfortunately, Gone to Size ... is a moronfest filled with testosterone, which plays Nicolas Cage's lead role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < This squad consists of a man with comic shaped ears known to be the new Superman; A person who energizes the X-Files; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> Something since Frasier's Daphne. There is Angelina Jolie, who has no character; do not have a place suitable for men's sexual desires. <br/> <br /> <br /> In fact, it is very bad to characterize that at any time, everyone has a "moment", playing a violin in the background to emphasize "emotion". Vinnie Jones is a spoiler that reveals that he takes only one line (his famous Paul Gasgoine "hand ball" maneuver again and silent is quite dangerous); it is not an integral part of the ground because it can not speak, but the ending of the suspicious morality of the film is funny when it seems like the whole path is silent. Allegedly. After he was "inactive enough" but after the "dog-do-do" was shot in London, Cage says, "I always think you're Long Island." <br /> <br /> Indeed, humor is the most unexpected aspect of two miraculous black characters from the baseless comedy police. Sees the largest part of Hollywood; why a black man will not be able to appear in the form of a big movie without constantly causing the tone of his skin, and it is infinitely the same? Like the old man, the young man who diligently talks for the whole term, "the black people do not like the cold ... we are tropical people," he says. He continues to work together and willing to follow the Roots. It is, of course, parody of the appearance of black people, but how funny? His elderly colleague can not speak without mentioning himself, and for this he is the third person. "My black donkey" is "my black donkey". Does anyone really know such a person who speaks? <br /> <br /> The film's soundtrack is almost non-stop and the volume is growing, especially with the Apollo 440's "Do not Stop Rock" - some music, they really are more than sound effects and dialogue. The environmental system sounds like two different films that join each other, dividing it into two degrees. There is no background music here, the class teacher pointing out that the film is trying to watch, the stereo of someone behind the movie turned into a full explosion. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie in the world and, in many cases, makes me happy. The only thing that is predictable, lazy and unreasonable is its minimal effort in its construction. As you can see, the cashier's expectations for this film are considerably lower. After a few years of strong nutrition, the public begins to wake up.
