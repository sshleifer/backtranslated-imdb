I thought Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was a pretty good horror movie. After the corpse of a terrorist infected with a stolen chemical substance was restored by a US soldier, the body emitted the atmosphere on a small island and the corpse was formed. Soon, infected local people are becoming victims of hunger and an abandoned group of soldiers must unite with the tourist group and place themselves in an abandoned hotel to fight the dead dead. This film was not as good as the original film, Zombie Flesh eaters. But still OK was a good movie. I did not think it was one of the best in the series. 4/10
