I think Croc Hunter is a pretty person! <br /> <br /> But in this movie, everything is bad. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, film sketches, sketches of people's dishes and others is one of the worst of all time. <br /> <br /> This is really a bad movie. All the "jokes" are so young that they laugh at you because they are very stupid. The scenario is so bad that you are surprised when you're 4 years old. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Croc Hunter was surprised when he saw this and did not crocodile to eat it.
