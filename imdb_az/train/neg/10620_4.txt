Despite some exciting (and charming) sequences, the NBTN never goes. There are explosive ships, shattered pins, mass suicides, pathologist parts of the body and all kinds of classic mystery / horror scenes, but they are intensified with long-term pure exposure. Everyone in the movie seems bored. <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> Holmes movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, cinematography is very ordinary. <br /> <br /> There are many possibilities for the great shooting of the war, or there are complex pictures, one of which will be great darkness, but all this is unusual and boring. <br /> <br /> Absolutely just for Lee and Cushing supporters.
