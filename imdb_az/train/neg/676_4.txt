I wanted to see it for two reasons. The first was the rebuilding of Bogart and the High Sierra, and, secondly, Bogart was played by Jack Palance, who played dramatically with some subtility, as in the Great Speech. <br /> <br /> But now why decided to take this arrangement? The film suits the same structure as Hig Sierra; Only the actors here are interested, the director has lost his thoughts, and the manufacturer knows what he thinks. Jack Palance is bored with Shelley Winters, and Shelley Winters asks what he's doing in this movie. I do not even want to compare it with Ida Lupino in the same role. And, of course, they were forced to use the dog again! They could actually have different ideas. Perhaps the color looks good on the same spot where they hit Sierra, but will not add any quality to the film. <br /> <br /> If you are high in Sierra earlier. Otherwise, why look at pseudo-cinema. As for me, I die more than once more ...
