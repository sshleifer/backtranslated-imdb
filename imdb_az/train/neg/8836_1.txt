It's not art, it's the inner city, politically correct propaganda! <br /> <br /> Jindabyne's political intolerance is not forgiven ... these people belong to the category of more categories, rather than individuals. <br /> This is the most terrible Australian movie I can ever remember. against some pretty tough competition!). In a message movie, each tired topic loved from the fashion left: Aborigines suffered; White men are violent or alcoholic drinks; <br /> <br /> In some cases, four fishermen find the corpse of a murdered woman (Aboriginal, Naturally) and for a few days leave her in the river to catch trout. Here's a mixed decision taken with no argument, like the pets of men. Shortly there is a man who lives with a bisexual woman because he lives with a woman like him - he likes to catch a baby, and eventually a more luxurious coastal place (away from all those monstrous beaches). <br /> <br /> This is a film shot by those fashion campuses who live in fear of the Australian landscape and the evil rednecks living inside. The ignorance of the country's life is almost as shocking as it hates. The film is filmed forboding with long-range images of the bush supported by mysterious music. The people of Aborigines are the only ones in this landscape that are very clear when it comes to the end. <br /> <br /> <strong> Black-and-white talks result in an extremely complicated scene. <br /> <br /> In Jindabyne, the country's life is slightly reduced to a story that declares the superiority of the left-wing city values. <br /> <br /> This film is not just a movie by the real people but by the Government's Film Finance Corporation funded. This is a product of the well-known film group, a wonderful space set by these hands-on people, who are funded by the real government, providing these powerful attack projects (as far as possible from real life) that truly want to see popular movies. <br /> <br /> Whether or not the film is stinker is not important, they are still paid. <br /> <br /> Get rid of the time to waste yourself, pull as you die. More attractive public comment than realistic entertainment is worthy of this movie!
