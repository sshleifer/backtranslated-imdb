This movie had a great form: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - all solid film actors. Motivation of foreigners in this movie varies in the hat of the hat. First, they only want to restore and abandon their ships, but they will not release the key characters after killing the majority of their friends and receiving the essential part they need for their spouse. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Then, nowhere, this "peace" race because the planet decided to destroy too many "diseases" cause (although they are the main character and spouse offers a place in their society) <br /> <br /> Most of the film is spent on pulling down on the tables without pulling a man or spouse, or walking or standing or doing nothing . <br /> <br /> If you do not really think that you really do not like Chris Lee or seventeen extra-budgetary explorer, with the rest of the planet, I would give this one for myself. It falls in the narrow range of discharged cellulose between the Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
