This is a few episodes (one only), which is a definite mistake in storing stories. Looking at the state of Ralphi, Christopher announced that he heard the death of Pie-O-My in a fire accident. This is an important detail, because in this context Christopher knows that Tony should have killed Ralphi for a long time. But Chris has an unheard of road accident. Who told him and when? When Tony's call came out of his delirium, no one was informed. Tony knows it - it's getting worse! Hearing that Christopher would talk about the death of Pie-O-My could only have led to Trisin's determination of Chrisin's fire. As the writers themselves say on the DVD, given the effectiveness of the writing process, none of them surprised that there was no problem. The story just does not work in this way. It is not necessary to add that I am a great admirer of Soprano. Otherwise, of course, he will not care for me.
