<br /> <br /> Feeding the masses was primarily a film that tried to make money less than the zombie nakedness around the popularity of films such as the Dead Souls and the Resident Evil series. <br /> <br /> It starts at a soldier-protected television station and says that the Lazarus Virus (zombies) is close to protection and that the city will soon release their jobs further. The point is that this is completely wrong. Zombies work in desperate ways and only be aware of a small minority. Among them are Torch (William Garberina), camera man, Sherry (Rachael Morris), leading anchor women (hence Shelly plays directly on this site) and Roger (Patrick Cohen) accompanying the military. Torch and Sherry are liable to lie to the public, but the station is managed by a secret service (or other government agency) and they are heavily censored. <br /> <br /> This movie, "We did NOT combine Interviews, we're having a higher level than the movie" Three Dead "by George A. Romber. The source of this offer has lost all of my conviction. <br /> <br /> Just tell me that this movie is BAD. I was not as bad as I expected (though obviously), but I could not find any indisputable quality in the film that I say badly. There are many boards in all sections. Did anyone ever remember their lines or read their replica cards? I do not think the best part or the best actor / actress. Not really one. First, if I had to twist one, I would say Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting thing, but this is not really a word. <br /> <br /> Although this movie, despite the fact that it looks so beautiful, has made me film this for the first time. 3/10
