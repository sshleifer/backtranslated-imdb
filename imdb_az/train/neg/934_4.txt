Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as usual as ever. Ritter was not there. His name was as beautiful as ordinary. It could have been a good movie. It was bad that the area was bad. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the film was painted as a dye with children's color. Heroes consisted of cut pieces of cardboard. <br /> <br /> Finally, the writer's writer has not suffered much. Especially with the child's absolutely incredible "advanced" line. <br /> <br /> Again, a player with a lower score prevents.
