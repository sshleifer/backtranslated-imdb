It has been a while since the first time it was seen, so I watched it again with the second movie of the series. I have not yet seen that when I realize that it is the 3rd movie, I will review it under its original name ... <br /> <br /> Although this film is at a very high level in terms of production value, screenshots and filmmaking, fails. What can you expect from the low budget, "B"? Not very, and works in terms of production. But, of course, writing is very different from the development of the character ... I think exactly what he expects when it's on the agenda of a movie. I did not have a problem with the player ... the shot was strong; However, in both films, scenarios give players little opportunity to really extend themselves. Since the film is "Christian", it can be predicted. Because you can not imagine the "chaos" of the "last time" without breaking some ethics that are related to Christianity in "considerable time". In other words, the bug is made up of a G-rated movie, even though the content is even more conservative in Bible translations, but R-rated in any size. If the film's purpose is to incite people to Christianity, the movie should be somewhat scared, right? However, you can not adapt a movie from a book without commenting on the book or comment on a number of books in this situation. There are fairly good stuff to be involved in films ... but it's not a "Left Back" series ... and these films are not successful because they are bad writers, even though they're the best sellers <br /> <br /> Like the South Baptist minister, I acknowledge that the books are a guilty pleasure for me, even though I have not finished the last two books. I have described them as a logical art, and if the books seem to suggest that the theme of biblical eschatology is a "probability" or commentary (the "last time" study), then I live with it. it divides the series into Christian circles as it elevates the "literalist" interpretation of the entire book to a more accurate hermeneutics. "Undoubtedly, as I say in" the partnership of God, in the past millennium, "in other words, we do not need our helicopters and bombs to do God's last work, but many, especially dismissed Christians, can not think beyond themselves <br /> <br /> All of our ideas are based on a conservative, fundamentalist position on the Bible translation and try to push it as a "single" comment. <br /> Thus, the books are dozens of "Agenda," "lost" to understand, but not their need for Christ, it is the only way to understand the Bible from a fundamentalist viewpoint, and I remember that I was reading on a scene where the characters in the second episode were adhering to a "behind-the-clock" human being, as I was truly worthy of "true" Christian "eternity", to another eschatologist do not hold <br /> <br /> For some reasons, it is disturbing that at least one "splendor" is briefly mentioned in the Book, and is linked to real, recent prophecy. <br /> <br /> But the real issue is that these books come from the distribution of Christian society and how they describe the "true" Christian behavior. As a result, I do not spend more people against any other legal faith, so they make people win against it. In the Christian mindset and practice, it turns all Christians into cartoons in terms of being a religious figure to believe in a wide variety, as well as despising and laughing. As a Christian body, we have suffered so much damage to the society in general in 2000 ... and, of course, it is not necessary to bring thousands, perhaps millions, to the film. br /> <br /> Thus, "Left Back" films are unsuccessful, because "Back-to-Do" books are not worthy of praise.
