I have to be a guy who does not like this movie in America. That's not my style or anything, I just do not see much interesting things about it, it has become one of the greatest achievements in film history. <br /> <br /> This is going to be a boy and a drug lord who does nothing worthwhile. It's a pretty straightforward way to describe a whole movie, and it's exactly my feelings about the whole film. Unlike many people, think of a good story because a movie does not feature an automatic movie about mafia / drug trafficking / criminal groups.
