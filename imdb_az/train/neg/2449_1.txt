One of the great works of the English design was to be congratulated for the initiative to turn into a film and then it was unintentional collision for this initiative. The animation was weak, the characters appeared ridiculous, the music was strange, and it was a blitz, with the film's first book and half of Tolkien's masterpiece. In the movie I've seen for the first time, I can remember my disappointment and hatred. Now, I understand that any attempt to turn a book into a film is due to the many failures of the media, but it is simply sad, regardless of the source of the story. Bashy can do more.
