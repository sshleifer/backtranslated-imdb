I grew up in Scooby Doo and you still love it. Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and Pirates, and Tom and Jerry are one of my favorite cartoons. While this is good for kids, sounds are good (Don Messick and Casey Casem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), theme tune tolerable and has some nice animation. But it is very disappointing. I'm normally not against Scrappy, but it's often annoying when it looks like the main character. Complete with Catchphrase Puppy Power, Scrappy is a little more annoying than usual. After the first year, half the band disappeared, somehow not as Scooby Doo. And the jokes and story lines were generally bare and unusual, very few followers of monsters or baddies were spotless. All this is not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Take a Silk, but this show is not heartwarming. Beautiful for animation, sounds, theme melody and kids. Bethany Cox
