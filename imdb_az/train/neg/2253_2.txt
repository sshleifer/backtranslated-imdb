For a review of A STAR IS BORN's 1976 version here, to understand it: The last issue is by Barbra Streisand seven minutes and after another forty-second, another two-and-a half minute freezing frame of Ms creates Streisand as the Christ - the final loans behind. During a ten minute break in Barbra's different visual dead center, the big screen fills with uncompromising ego. Think about it: The structure of this music revolves around a love affair between the two music superstars, yet Stryshand's songs are played entirely - including the sequel to her singer, Kris Christofferson, is not allowed to sing a song. <br /> <br /> We note that Stri≈üend's name, including at least six times, at least six times, including a "credit concept" and a loan to obtain his wardrobe (from his closet) , but also did not receive a joint venture. One of his credits was producer producer, his producer's credit would give him his wife and former hairdresser John Peters. Thus, Streisand checked the final part of the film, causing the film to bend in its direction. Whenever the Great Diva gives them every opportunity to look good, their efforts can only look bad in Strixen. Although this is just one of Strickland's biggest cashier hits, it's the worst movie and its worst performance. <br /> Nevertheless, Hollywood's melodrama is transferred to sex and rock, n'roll, Streisand, a hard-liner source for Kastofferson's Has-Beenvil ramp, with John Norman Howard, a pop singer on the stardom track for some time He plays Esther Hoffman. In the previous incarnation of the story, "Norman Maine" sacrifices a leading human career to help achieve the success of Vicky Lester. In the feminist seventies, Streimand & Co. wants to clarify that their heroes are not indebted to a human being because the trajectory is curved; he or she will succeed without him or she is close to the bottom of the scene; he has a burden on the name of love. <br /> <br /> Kristofferson will not be content with film shootings, with an incredible approach to filming. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify" material, with little effort to deliver a performance, and strangely serve its unusual, unwanted character, while Streisand demonstrates integrity on the screen all the time. it is at least under control if it is not as stunning as it seems, and even its striking images are also unusual, and the hysteria moments are cold mechanics.There are no chemistry, the center of love is completely incredible. Even though he seems young or irrepressible, his symbol sees his pale youth and innocence, the only temptation he can offer to him, that he can exploit himself as a faster route to stardom, and, in fact, slander his character openly There is a brute to play, and it's probably a spark for the movie, and maybe it's a reason to have the courage to play that outfit. <br /> <br /> But film artists really see Esther as a sympathetic victim; they are not aware of cold-blooded and self-destructive. But sensitivity is not one of the strongest points of the film: Pay attention to a small shock to give Barbra two Afro-American singing artists, because the movie trio is in the bare racism of calling The Oreos. And Esther keeps her ethnic identity on her own using Hoffman's name, but the filmmakers have changed the name of the previous movies from Esther Blodgett, because it's a very Jewish or very charming name that will not be loaded with Streisand. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a decisive country in the Caucasus. Nominal director Frank Pierson has delivered a raw material for a good film with the help of ace cinematographer Robert Surtees. And the purpose of the film was to create a soundtrack album for faithful pop music songs (including Oscar-winning "Evergreen" by Paul Williams and Streisand). But in general, the film is something that Styesand claims to have failed.
