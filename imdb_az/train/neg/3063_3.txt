Generally there are pictures that honor a hero. For example, Bonnie and Clyde glorified dynamic bank robbers, and despite their bad deeds, they had a sense of sympathy for them. Why? <br /> <br /> There is no substance in this movie. The character of Viggo Mortensen soon emerged as a folk hero. Why? While on the way to Idaho, her husband's speed is on the way to the hospital. Why is no one trying to escape from anyone? <br /> <br /> Jason Priestley, at the same time, realizes that he is not a "red-headed terrorist", he wants to help the government try to get rid of its goal behind it. <br /> <br /> Emcee radio on the story to support our hero. <br /> <br /> The latter is totally unbelievable.
