After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and after going to bed, I can have fun when I suffer from sleep deprivation. This movie was HBO and I decided to watch it. <br /> <br /> Behold, it's wrong (potential spoiler, even care): a neurotic man with candy addiction (Josh Kornbluth) works like a temp for some funny company. Suddenly, she is given the opportunity to "go" as it appears to be the favorite favorite of this movie. But with a safe job and a safe income inside it, Josh decides to do so for a foolish reason. He unwittingly illuminates a few small tasks, and his laziness and longing honors me with respect. It should have been cheerful not to send some "very important" letters within a certain period of time, but it was simply stupid. Josh meets and fraudulently talks to a lawyer, and joins in the bedroom (Josh's fantasy in a real life, something like that never happens). <br /> <br /> Although this movie was billed as a comedy, he only laughed twice; was the first shot of Josh Kornbluth (my first reaction was choking) and secondly, when lying with an attractive woman (yeah, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrible person I've ever seen in my life. She is an ugly, overweight, flattering Jewish man who believes she will have sex with beautiful women. I'm not sincere to Josh's character. He is lazy and irrevocable and I do not appreciate only the unsuccessful attempts at humor. Skip even if your life depends on it.
