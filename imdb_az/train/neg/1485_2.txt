It would be good to ignore any positive feedback you have for this movie. This flick stinks. Now I love low budget horror movies (at least in theory), but it can create the worst mistake of low budgeting: it takes itself very seriously. And, unfortunately, this is not just a problem. <br /> <br /> This is a story of the murderous Bean tribe of British Ilse, who was transferred to modern times. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> She is looking for an average woman who can not move, and has a small role. ANSWER: She is, of course, a well-known porn star (undoubtedly like reading in other analyzes), and therefore a "community" view for her. It seems that the film is very much needed for "name recognition". <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> <br /> <strong> Like Ireland? It's not even as far away as Ireland. The house where the guests / victims are, this great big North American tree frame is Edwardian. They have thrown the entire Bean theme and have prepared a story that has happened in NA. Also, if you take a film that takes you to Ireland, it's better to have more than one character with the Irish emphasis, but it would not look so bad anymore if the director did not try to do the next "Dead Night". Very bad. He could have a little fun with him. In fact, some scenes were not far away because they were not like comedy. <br /> <br /> Women who resembled a scene of sadness were chained to the table, peeled naked and then open and marry. This is funny, you ask? Yes, in the deleted version of the scene, the mutant killer takes a mile from the spindle of the intestine. A little later, it's really funny. And why does the self-respecting creature eats the intestines? Do we eat cows and chicken intestines? No, we eat oaks, ribs, and drums. Oh good. <br /> <br /> Someone sneezing out of the other: foolish, creepy Howard Rosenstein. I'm not sure, but it should be thrown like a STUD. In fact, he's a great missing and as a ball to the ball. <br /> <br /> When I contacted Gillian Leigh on the IMDb, I seem to have finished secondary schooling with honors. A few years after the graduation, the glorious pupil Howard Rosenstein is a naked soft patchy porn scenes in a shower with a boy. Did the old classmates ever see this movie? If so, hopefully they will receive the message: THIS FATE! GET TO THE COLLEGE !!! I went away, but why. If you want, you can find something in this flick, but much more.
