This movie is really bad, a script with "memorable" lines and incredibly bad speeches. Special effects are also bad (not the worst I've ever seen) and music is too bad, so you have to listen to it to believe it. <br /> <br /> Generally, two short stories, one of the worst films I've ever seen (30 seconds long or more), are repeated throughout the entire movie.
