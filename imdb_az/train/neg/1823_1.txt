When Jack Black's character, Tim Dingman, "Dreamer" in Envy, is sprayed on a grinding ball, Poou finds wealth and success in the idea of ​​an aerosol spray "Vapoorize" that thin air. <br /> <br /> For a moment, I hope Vapoorize is a true product, so I can spray it on this stinker of a movie, and let it down to the gentle air. <br /> <br /> Envy is not the worst movie I've ever seen in the last 12 months (this honor goes to Cat in Hatka), earning her second honor. <br /> <br /> Funny is not sad, not something. A real "Stinkeroo" !!!!! <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10!
