My husband and I were very disappointed with this movie. The area is something that interests you and is interested only in what's happening, but when leaving the theater, there are many spaces that do not make sense in any sense. Christopher Plummer, a wealthy head of a NY bank, has a terrible secret secret. WW II's earnings and dealing with the Nazis keeps robbing robbery of Jews from robberies, proof-of-fact (diamonds and documents including Nazi swastika) in a security box at the bank. Why? If this had never been explained, why did not burn documents before? And the diamonds? Certainly, there is no need for them - why not keep them away instead of destroying them? How did bank robbers find its secret? How did they report zero in the deposit box No 232? Ace detective Denzel Washington also showed bank notes in SD Boxes No. 231 and 233, but obtained 232 numbers. Curious He found some time to make an inexhaustible search of bank records for this magnificent fact. At all times, they are dealing with the threat of a red hot colony and bank robbers who are starting to execute them at once. Amazing! Wow! Talk about super powers for the detective. <br /> <br /> The bank robbers leave millions of dollars in free cash in the cash they open. They only take the contents of the SD-Box 232 as it is intended to blackmail the Bank's president. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster gets access to her political relationship with NYC Mayor. <P style = "text-align: justify; the bank maintains a large number of hostages to enter the bank, which is under the control of pirates, and the bank is offering a contract to recover documents that are robbery, but he is not interested. Christopher Plummer (Bank President), Denzel Washington (ace detective) and Jodie Foster <br /> <br /> I saw the latest Jodie Foster movie, "Flight Plan" <br /> <br /> Now, my problem is that I can rarely have my wife go to the movie, but I'm not sure if it's going to happen. We can not agree with it ... "FELLOW WARNING IN THE MONEY TIME." Be a good sign, a well-prepared movie, good player, bad script.
