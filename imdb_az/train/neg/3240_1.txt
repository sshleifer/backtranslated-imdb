This is the first Guinea pig film from Japan and I think this is heavy. A group of guys had been tortured for several days before killing her daughter. And at this point, I'll say that these films are not real! <br /> <br /> The Prophet (may Allah bless him and grant him peace), for example, when we sit on the floor, can see how he is hitting the girl and fled to the ground! And how foolish it is! Sound effects are also unrealistic and unreasonable. The scenes shook the animal intestines, the girl who had been exposed to many hours of loud noise, the girl from the nails, the worms on the wounds in the girl's body, her eyes crazy and terrifying details, etc. Many sick and collaborative inspirational films and a valuable or kinematic there is nothing. <br /> <br /> Guinea pigs: Satan's swine flu, flu, flu, flu, flu, flu, Experience is probably the thing I'm seeing, and there's the closest thing to it - it's still (of course) (n / t) uff, the only difference for the original "snuff film" is that no one will ever die or split it in this movie. I can not recommend it, so it's so great that those who think about it are a great fear film, nothing about cinema and its true meaning. I watched it with some interest (like other parts of the array) and now I know how insignificant they are. They work only at the shock level and this is not a very valuable cinematic achievement. The Devil's Experience is probably a sick movie I've seen and Mermaid on a Plaque (Guinea Pig 4) is probably the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. That is, my book is quite extensive, but that's all.
