Wow, this movie was just a bloody anxiety. <br /> <br /> Although I have not paid for this movie, I do not want my money to be returned. A rumor of a fantastic clich√© that was developed by more talented filmmakers. Performance, in particular, according to the results, was more pleasing than Ed Wood. Talking about Ed Wood, he is proud of the nature of the character. It is only very tolerant with the sense of humor or humor. <br /> <br /> Visual effects are good, but "oh wow, it's cool" is not enough to go and they just look. <br /> <br /> Saundtrek was a bit of a rumor than anything that really did not set any mood. Again, the director likened it to the directors in the "cool" effort. <br /> <br /> What brings me to the last point? Perhaps instead of trying to be "cool" with the director, he would not have to worry about a short film, even if he was worried about plot, story and dialogue. <br /> <br />
