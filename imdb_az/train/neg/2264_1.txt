<br /> <br /> To write this review before, I must say that I was a bit interested in this movie. However, I did not see if I had not dropped my hand. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie shows how a bad person will be. In my view, the worst thing about the whole Springer phenomenon is that it's the same behavior as the Jerry Springer Show (it's self-justifying), but many people have the excitement of interest and concern about them and hear about their lives (yes, I suppose) that includes me). <br /> <br /> Let's also note that if you do not praise such behavior (as some say), such behavior can be a violation of our weakness and / or desenstizing ourselves. <br /> <br /> But enough soap box. Here's a bad thing: The movie has a R rating and I'm not completely sure if it's worth it (I'm totally uncertain about looking in some areas), and I feel that the NC-17 (hat hate the other reviewer) may be a little bit more suited for great sexual content (kinik, can only comment on that as a great excuse to show. The solution is very strange, unifying the stories of a completely inadequate family and worries about some stereotypical brothers who appear on various Springer shows. In the end, the film creates the Springer rhetoric (which appears through its show), which we need to see in the real world, which is a direct reality. I agree with it - it is important to know how the world really is, so that we can have a positive change. By saying this, let me tell you that it is a bad idea in a new newspaper or news in the world, but not to make good money for the support of Springer's scenario and possibly a formal titration.
