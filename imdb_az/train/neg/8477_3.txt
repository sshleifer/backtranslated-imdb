I personally hated this movie because it could not be predicted, the characters were stereotypic, and the whole idea came out of the movie "Acute Edge" and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> The main character is the bony girl who is being delivered somewhere where she is not. The whole place hates her, and there is a humble guy who does not seem so bad to make things worse (you can not stop the whole curse school). She finds a way to surprise and to please everyone, she begins to fall in love with her. It is then a choice between figure skating and hockey. He chooses hockey, he goes to figure skating homeland and enters the Olympic team. There is no real surprise. <br /> <br /> All this film could have been predicted so curse. You knew what was going to happen before you saw it. It was so terrible and I had a headache that nearly came to me when I followed him and tried to hit myself to watch it. Whether you're less than or full of ghastly movies, watching it.
