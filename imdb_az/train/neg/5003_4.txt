I'm ashamed to write this review. I say that the people you read will know that I'm sitting on all things and are even ashamed of getting to know foreigners. But it was only to warn those who read the comments on the IMDb before watching a movie to watch. At least I can do it. This is a bad movie! Trust me. The area is permanent. Acting is amateur. Directorate, camera work, kits, suits and so on. Let's go.
