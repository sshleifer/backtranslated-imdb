Misty Ayers was a smoker body and was all about this movie. Flick clean exploits. By calculating the number of performances of the orchestra music, we started a game with myself. Of course, music is completely incompatible with scenes. In a point: accidentally entering a room and saying "Hello" he was hit by a novel epic trail. Why would I want to know why this movie was released 11 years ago? What I learned from this film: There was a very small number of women in 1954. I'm Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie pantie. At least 20 Misty slowly pulls your clothes out of the first 30 minutes (except for bra and panties). And the terrible dubbing, "Look at Gozzirra!" effect.
