This is the kind of movie I'm most annoyed. Destroy all with big cast, great director, great storytelling, and then with a scenario that goes anywhere ... he does not say anything while walking there! There is no depth here. No heroism, depth of depth, no depth of surprise, decline and solid thought. We know what's going on, we're talking about how to fix the problem, correcting the problem, and they are surprised to see that if there are any flaws, then they finish the movie sharply. <br /> <br /> Moreover, Glenn Ford manages all the fantastic UK (and a French) actor and makes an incredibly impressive job with a single-dimensional writing they give. One of the absolute favorite, Herbert Walton, is "The Old Charlie", which "offers some nice humor and warmth to the dark and serious film." I also thought that the film has such a beautiful appearance ... all shades and fog ... are partly part of it. <br /> <br /> Although the players do their best, it still does not give me enough time to spend the movie. There are very good Glenn Ford films: Big Heat, Gilda, Trinidad Affair, and so on.
