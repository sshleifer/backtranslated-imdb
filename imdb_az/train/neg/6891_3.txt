<br /> <br /> After 5 minutes, charm is lost. <br /> <br /> The cartoon is the same as the main hero of American Pie and Loser. <br /> <br /> We support fairy-tale films that have earned more money than commercial success or an innovative story. <br /> <br /> Honestly, Heder's player was pretty poor. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best, but there is no significant plot or script to pull their teeth. The film is erased from an explicitly illogical story that justifies the speed or length. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My advice is that if you really do not do anything else, Avoid it. you will feel that manufacturers are cheating on you for an hour and a half.
