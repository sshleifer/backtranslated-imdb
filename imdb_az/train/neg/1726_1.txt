Yes, what? A few redneck amateur American scientists at the precise time that several dinosaur monsters found cave images stating that thousands of years ago they settled in the area, a burning meteorite collapsed into the lake and tied the eggs of a monster there. For more than a thousand years, I suppose. "The Crater Lake Monster" is just a movie to be seen with faith, but you make it a lot more friends and a ganja meeting to make it a bit more efficient.

The monster is, of course, the best part of the film, especially because it is made with good old fashioned and adorable beatings. This cute critter is a Plesiosaur; Denver looks like the dinosaur and the crocodile, the dinosaur. Crater Lake Monster is a recurring, memorable movie experience that I can only encourage to watch!
