I thought critics and some audiences would say that this is a satire, there are many political and social messages, names refer to other names, and so on. Can be. I do not understand such things (I do not want to do it anyway) because I'm not interested, I'm interested in "kinoya". As for the film itself, it is said that the film is smart and sharp. In the second half, except for the incident in the office, I did not see anything we did not see in monster films. Yes, this scene tells something about humanity, but the film is not brilliant. The film is entertaining (mild) and exciting at some moments or scenes, but not more than that. As for the film's biggest defect, it's visual effects. It was just a shock, and I could not bring myself together for a while because I was waiting for a real monster because it was not one of the old Gojira films, but it was in 2006. If you do not believe that you are a monster, you will not pay attention to it. If you agree with me, I advise you to be extremely realistic Cloverfield. The design of the beast is not interesting, but there is at least a planned effort. Dramatic strong criticism. Some critics speak of Kurosawa as a movie. Yes, it should not be more dramatic than a tension or movement, but it should not necessarily indicate that it is dramatically stronger. I do not want to compare Host to other monster movies, but I do not do anything else that monster does not do movies. By the way, some people call the film's work because of its sincerity for the Asian cinema. Yes, I love Asian cinema, but this is true.
