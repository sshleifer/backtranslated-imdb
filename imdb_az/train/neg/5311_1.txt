This is almost the worst movie you've ever seen! The 2012 Doomsday is the one that lacks for me. On the contrary, Frank Zappa is a magnificent example of once called a "candy". The scenes of the Earth appear to have been in the 1950s before the power plant was dismantled. Music really suffers. Acting is wooden and bath. The characters they describe are superficial and not convincing. The area can be estimated. When you transfer techniques and ideas from other films, it becomes clear and clear. <br /> <br /> But it's just a must-have to see what's going to be just what's going to be one of the biggest waste of a small budget. This is a valuable example of a stupid movie!
