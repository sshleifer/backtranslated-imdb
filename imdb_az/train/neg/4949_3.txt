Okay, it can be difficult to put all of a person's life in a movie. Therefore, traditionally, biopics focuses on one or two important aspects of the subject. Byron was a friend who "eats you in my weekly", which makes it even harder to represent the parts. In addition, Byron's poetry is inextricably linked with the life of man. <br /> <br /> Now, I like my point of view: Byron really "eats my weekly weeks" "Prototype, really a lifelong person, really has more than 15 lifetime or active chapters He did it, he was a failure, and he was a victim of his time and social space, but eventually, he should have a prototype that he did not want us to bring to life for, or did not want to live the life described in this movie at any time. So it takes 3. Because of not doing so badly (versatile, more or less), but more importantly, to bring the point to a completely flat area. <br /> <br / Byron Bio should have two things different in a single episode: 1. Europe after the journey: England and her communication + marriages / 2. Living abroad, now the second, Not only that, but the most important change took place in Byron, and he also created his best works (Don Juan, Court Vision, etc.). - All things that are really unique in English literature). Instead, the life of Byron does not even come away in a funny way; b) it only worsens after leaving England. * They did two good things: first, when returning to Europe's journey (which was regarded as a more prologue directly from the actual visit), secondly, they chose an angle and chose their excessive love for Augusta (incredibly perfect). The problem of this last problem is never to leave it. True, Byron joined the Augusta for the rest of his life, but he was such a moody person that he would never have liked life when we reflect his letters. In any case, the first part of the television movie should be left out of England. There is no doubt about it. Undoubtedly, he once started abroad with a life (Geneva), but in Italy Byron found a new life in Venice and Venice (inspired by Italian comedy) and discovered Contessa Teresa Guiccioli for himself and Ravenna ' either (later, at the request of Shelly, with Teresa, Pisa). In other words, he was released. * His thoughts and his life were opened to the gravitational ability of the Wikipedia era, even though England was even closer (and not just a decadent sense). True, freedom was less than Augusta, but this bitter freedom was touched in this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bahrain, In addition to poetic and romantic developments, relationships with Shelly (and downscale) should be further documented. He is also involved in politics and revolutionary ideas in Ravenna. It is important that the Calling romantic and finally Childe Harold's language and man show that Don Juan's language and personality are more realistic and more realistic. Life and work are one. True, a bit naive, but they gave it to Greece! And the whole thing came to the full circle in the city of Pisa, where the revolutionary spirit of Shayel further sparked my spark. Missolonghi was not a boring snob looking for a move suddenly. It could protect Italy from gambas. Although the rest of Europe is stabilized in the modern cause and conservatism clay, it may be a symbol for a man looking for an exciting battle in an ancient way. But it was not alone, there was a real inspiration behind it. Meanwhile, Byron wrote a large number of Don Juan. True, the latter is a bit sad, but it's not outdated. The essence of the BIRD'S LIFE is that he could have some powerful emotional attachments (2 Augusta and Teresa), but he has really rebuilt himself. When it came to the fact that at the end of his life there was no "little" - he made a physical and psychological JOURNEY, then, little man was prepared to prepare. <br /> <br /> Why is the second period in Byron's life often considered? Could there be less open conflicts as the person finally had? Although we are focusing our attention on the troublesome England years facing England's defeat, Byron is far from the English aristocracy we are so despised and has fled in 1816, although he has no choice but to be the poet of the first romantic plain language, fled to find a modern, liberal world in order to find a moving voice from snob to a ghost man.
