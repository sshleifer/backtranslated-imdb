This movie has a lot of mistakes, but to sum it up: Terrible action - it should have a very bad purpose. poor scripts - they could have good ideas, but this is the best way to present the story. Ridiculously ends badly - in some cases ends the movie to keep it in that case. If you sit and manage the whole movie, the end is not worth the wait, because you want to shoot yourself at the end. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It was full of torture in the movie, I would appreciate someone who pre-warned me. Give yourself a blessing. See if this movie is best for you. Even then, you will be regretted by the wordless torture.
