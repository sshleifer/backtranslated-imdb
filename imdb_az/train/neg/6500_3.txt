Look, if the world is halfway this situation, I'm sorry, but life is mixed up. It does not need to be followed in this way. Anthony Hopkins, I've got a great deal of time. I even watched the fractures and I knew Quentin was collecting steam. But this thing is not well shot and it's not tempting - it's even cunning. In well-trained films, this is "oh, but it's not a true interpretation", but there are reasons for breaks and rapid changes. This will harm your head. Do not take anywhere the fastest moving picture. I still love AH and will always give him another chance, but if you do not have time to watch the bad things on the screen, skip it.
