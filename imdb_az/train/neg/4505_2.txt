Geisha's memories are a good movie, and there is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> However, very small and large details are just a matter of concern to me. full pleasure. A small detail scene that describes the lack of sensitive sensitivity (which does not hurt anything), Mameha calls on a snowy winter day, hanging on the door of Sayuri's house. The call you call is a furor or a windbreak - just outside the houses in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes did not have door shocks - just opened the door and declared themselves. (You might think that this is a very important detail, but this is a film prepared for America, the Christmas wreath hangs on the door in July and nobody thinks about it). maiko and geisha are totally wrong about hairstyles, uncertain about Asia / China / kung-fu-business and something like real thing. I think that this courageous attitude toward the culture they are trying to reflect reflects the people's attitudes and situations. <br /> <br /> So, I guess you know little about Japanese culture and Kyoto (what is this "Miyako") geisha and geo world, so you will benefit from it more. Honestly I think this movie will be better ... as it is another Hollywood version of "exotic Japan".
