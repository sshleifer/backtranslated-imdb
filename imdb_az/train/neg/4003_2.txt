A great disappointment. It was one of the best English crime drama / detective shows in the 90s, which developed an exciting hood character by Scottish director Robbie Coltrane. However, this individually suffers from an added and possibly inevitable lower chance of expected expectations when an additional show returns after a long break. Coltrane does not really give much, and more attention is drawn to the killer who is not interested, and the things that should go into action seem almost boring. The story of an old soldier was written by the books and Coltrane's attempt to renew us in the family life seems light. Perhaps, if the writers had a series of series instead of the two-hour show, they wrote it in more depth. As you go, look and see which old Cracker is over 90 far away.
