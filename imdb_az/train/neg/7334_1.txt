<br /> <br /> I think Stuart Bliss is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The player was terrified and scary. <br /> <br /> My spouse's abandonment led to a psychological accident, but it was so clever and boring, and after some time I could be less careful about any characters. <br /> <br /> The film is about adding the same idea to the plot without being surprising or surprising. <br /> <br /> After opening Stewart's wall, the whole thing with the Geiger counter came a long time later. <br /> <br /> Then, after something has been shown, to see what is behind it. <br /> <br /> Then, recurring scenes as well as the confused situation they are facing. <br /> <br /> When I did not recognize any of the actors, I did not anticipate this movie was a flop. Give yourself a blessing when it comes out, read a book! You will be better.
