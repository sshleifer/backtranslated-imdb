The main theme of this film is a political cartoon. I suppose that for those who do not know anything about the realities of the soldiers, this is a "good feeling" about gender equality. Indeed, a recent commentator: "Let women know that they can do everything they want." What a lid! No one, man or woman can do anything they want, and unfortunately, Demi Moore will not do the SEAL Hell Week for a 27-week BUD / S program at a local gym in a few sessions and at the sole request, SEAL simply will not do it. There is an undeniably the most difficult military training program with an 80% refusal rate - those who voluntarily quit, compete physically, frequently suffer physical damage or psychological aggression. I would never go beyond the drunkenness of this movie's written message. In the real world Demi will not be the first 24 hours of this tough and persistent physical education. Only those who want will do it. I skipped this movie as an undesirable idea and read the Warrior Elite book by Dick Couch (Crown, New York, 2001) for the best illustration of what really went on in that training. <br /> <br /> Demi, call! <br />
