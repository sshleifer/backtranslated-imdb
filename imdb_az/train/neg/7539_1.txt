Where will Neil LaBute begin to explain the overall misery of his latest attempt on filmmaking? <br /> <br /> There are many movie fans there, but the most annoying and shallow Mr. Interesting. You know that Mr. Attractive, but? <br /> <br /> He is so stupid, bare, and unknowable that a movie is garbled, but he says, "Gee, I do not know why everyone hates it, I found it interesting." He is a man who discovered that his dog is interested. Especially in the form of a Hitler mustache in the upper lip, while walking around the house, he is full of science fiction slogans, giving sensitive references to Greek mythology. He is also the man who prepared this version of The Wicker Man. No one could withstand him.
