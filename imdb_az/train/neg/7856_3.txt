This movie is pretty sucked up. I've been to the army and the soldiers shown in this movie are horrible. If you see your military unit and this movie, you're upset to film and laugh as a team. It was ridiculous. When they did not know what to do, they treated some ordinary people with the uniform of the army. At least I wanted to say it was a very nice movie. There were several scenes you would try to jump. I advise you to see when you are looking for a boring and strenuous movie. Although not in the military, there will be a better movie. I would like to say that I'm better than the first one.
