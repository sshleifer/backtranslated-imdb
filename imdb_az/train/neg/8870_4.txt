Stefan was an x-con married five years ago with Marie. Their marriage was stable until Stefan held them until the past and offered them a dry job. Stephen's job is to deliver a heroin that is easily accessible from Germany to Sweden. <br /> <br /> In Germany, Stefan met Elli, a girl from Bosnia. Stephen did not like what he had seen and decided to help Elli. Elli's father fled to Sweden during the war, and Ellie will now go to Sweden with Stefan. He promises to help Elli to find out what his father has to do with the former Stefan agreement. Finally, the whole situation in Sweden seems more difficult than Stefan's thought ... <br /> <br /> Since this film is American, it does not seem to fit in the usual class of Swedish films. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist make it average, though the effects are a little bit of the film. <br /> <br /> See her and escape for yourself. <br /> <br />
