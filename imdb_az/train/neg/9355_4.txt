I have been closely acquainted with Marilyn Miller's films. Because they have not been shown in the UK TCM. Perhaps this was one of the 20's superstars because I was very interested in many years. Like Jolson, some stars of this era still work with some of the magicians, but not surprisingly not for Miller. Every dance seems to be wrong and bad choreography, it looks a bit limited and looks like an actress who looks like Hepburn as Ruby Keeler. this movie was publicly torn off by musicals, and all the musical numbers growing up were removed. So we left with a comedy in a short period of time. He paid $ 500,000 for this! So there are only two results. Or he was poorly served by the movie or had no ability. I think the truth is closer than ever.
