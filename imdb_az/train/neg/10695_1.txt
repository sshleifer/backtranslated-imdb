... Ok I have read about this movie somewhere on the internet and many have criticized how this movie is getting worse and worse. I could not agree more. After that, I saw this movie on DVD, I thought twice about it and then it was a commercial on TV. Fortunately, I paid my money for this money. For this film, I sacrificed my dreams and soon revealed that this movie would not please me. That is, I can not judge how the movie was made, but still ... still silent. As for those who love this movie, I'm sorry to excuse this movie and tell you how this movie is happening. What do you think of this movie?
