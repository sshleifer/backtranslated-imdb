- Several newborns go to their old friend's home. It is not long before the new husband feels that he does not want to go home. She sees the skull around the house. But when a husband searches, he can not find anything. Is someone trying to seek asylum soon after leaving the hospital? Or is it a dream that your spouse is trying to get his wife out of his home? <br /> <br /> This was the first time I saw Screaming Skull without the help of the MST3K crew. And, finally, this is what I will follow. Are you weak? I'm not so boring - I'm talking about grassy drippings. There are big extensions of the movie that has nothing to do with it. The screen could have been left blank and more fun. Shadow over symbols with the most monotonous conversations that can be imagined. <br /> <br /> It is said that actors do not help much. Most of them provide a normal level classroom classroom game. I did not like it, but it would be shocking to find that everyone involved with this movie appeared in something of kinematic value. I will not even go to the scenario for the actors. <br /> <br /> It is simply given to some of the most ironic lines written on the film. <br /> <br /> You've warned! Avoid any costs, or at least seek the MST3K version.
