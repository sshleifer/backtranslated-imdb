Killer Tomato movies have a special humor type - you either love it or hate it. Personally I resemble it, but it's a feeling in the fourth film. Tomatoes are not the same, jokes are painful, and even the actors are not funny. <br /> <br /> So now, after the plot to make a laugh, it's frustrating. They really did not take the fourth part to the Killer Pomidor trilogy.
