We must agree with another reviewer. It should be a WORST movie, maybe I've never seen it from the west. A terrifying player is completely incompatible with the irrational and miserable dialogue (assumed in the 1800s), and oh, did I remind you of the battery pack displayed on the back of one of the characters? I was expecting Boom Mike to fall in the middle of a scene. And the end? At least we can say that the rest of the film was terrible. Yes, he put a laughable place, "When we remember when a main character came out of the empty stream on a dusty path in every clich√© in the book." Fortunately I saw it on free television. Do not waste your time.
