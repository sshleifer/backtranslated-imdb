I really did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a camp and did not narrate it, and we laughed. Of course, some parts are touching, but the player is strange, the effects are awful, and all the movie ideas are horrible (now I know that I have a book I did not read, but I hope the book was better than this, because undoubtedly this film is very bad and boring I thought). As I said, I went to a camp with a group and was thrilled to be there, and I also had a caffeine drink but still struggled to get up. The only thing that kept me (apart from the fear of embarrassment when I was woken up) was the weapon of the gun, which was incredibly meaningless. I really did not like it.
