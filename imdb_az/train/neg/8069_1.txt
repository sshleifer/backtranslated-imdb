Soul Survivors, a strange noisy voice, is the latest in the genre of "who's dead and who's alive" in the genre of horror films. Two young couples, Sean and Cassie, Matt and Annabel are preparing to go to different colleges, but before they join each other, Thanksgiving Annabel (Eliza Dushku, aka Faith, and other vampire slayer). Motiveless creepy kids Cassie (general Melissa Sagemiller) starts paying too little attention to unexplained reasons and after a long time the quartet leaves the party. If they leave the SUV, they are followed up and then swiftly accepted by the creepy children, promptly and unknowingly thrown in the middle of the 180th trunk, puts on the assassin, tea. Sean is killed (or is he?) And Cassie spends the rest of the film fighting alone and guilty when Sean's ghost is not haunted, or persecuted by those creepy creepy guys. As Cassie's mental state is diminishing, it is not disclosed until the unexpected conclusion is reached. So who's dead and who you are? After this delayed ninety minute, who really cares?
