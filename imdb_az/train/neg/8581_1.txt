It's absolutely nothing to apologize for a movie! Rachel Griffiths needed money. The film should be made for very little budget because lighting is not available. I promised Pete Postlesumthingor the other when I saw suicide. 1) I would be happy to know if there is a plot or 2) a script. My biggest regrets my time spent watching this trash.
