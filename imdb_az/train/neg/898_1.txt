Eddie Murphy's "Delirious" is completely and completely rough, crude, crushed and dried. This is really the only way to touch this horrible, desperate stand. Eddie Murphy is more shocked than laughter. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it may be laughable, but loses the plot with mostly legendary language and cheerful jokes. <br /> <br /> Forget it! You do not enjoy Eddie's bad style. I do not think I'll worry about Eddie Murphy Raw. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I love Eddie on the border of a movie script
