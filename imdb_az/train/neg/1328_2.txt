It's a really stupid movie of the typical 80s: action comedy. The concept looks like Rush Hour, but the main characters of the movie do not move, laugh, or chemistry. I know Jay Lenon is a stand-up and a talk show host, but he can not move. He is terrific when trying to act harshly - he is on the one hand, saying that it is not funny that this brand has difficulty shutting his face. And it's not a pleasant sight to see her (and then) run away. Moreover, Pat Morita - at least according to today's standards - does not give a political impression of Japan. I have not even started telling the story. I'll give it to 10 to 2.
