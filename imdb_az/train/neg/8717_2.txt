<br /> <br /> This was a DVD watch on a Thursday afternoon, and we could not stop laughing before we started. <br /> <br /> This story is simple: terrorists carry a dinosaur, which they miss a convoy that they think is carrying a weapon of uranium, but actually a group of people eating it. Easy to make mistakes. An inadequate team of special forces to combat historical monsters. They are led by Colonel Rance playing by Scott Valentine; <br /> <br /> Rice's team, unfortunately, seems to targets the problem. Their weapons, lumbering monsters, in the direction of a gigantic army. Also, the lights are always trembling and appear when they are attacked by a Velociraptor (from the very beginning, we can not see the badness of life). <br /> <br /> After all this, we all had a great deal. <br /> <br /> Like a Jusassic Park / Aliens style adventure, this movie is worse than a dinosaur gland, but laughing, language-in-cheek Entertainment is a successful success.
