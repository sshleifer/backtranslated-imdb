In the afternoon I see and see the funny Nintendo Power comic of the same art as this show ... and then this show came up for a television in my neighborhood! I was not estatic, but I'm curious ... I wondered how badly this show was going to be. <br /> <br /> All of my friends say that this show is not a negative one, and it's just so meaningless for me as straightforward as me (I'm gay, of course). So I decided to watch the show with low expectations. <br /> <br /> HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First, I hate new characters. Tiff and Tuff are terrific, and I hate how many fans on Tiff have been squeezed, sad. I also hate doing a good man who owns a restaurant at Chef Kalasaki (or what his unusual name was). Bad move, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is an adviser to King Deden (who spent a great deal of time on this show) and I hate the face of a company that provides these terrible weapons to destroy Dededen Kirby. So, fool, I hate this show. <br /> <br /> I later began to hate Kirby more than just because Nintendo was just painful to get some of Kirby's popularity. Kirby will never beat Mario in the fight against coolness, and Kirby will never be anything. NUF SAID !!!
