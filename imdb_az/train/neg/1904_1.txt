<br /> <br /> Like me, I'm a great Jerry Bruckheimer admirer. So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging in front of me and the trailers coming from the MI two expectations rose. Jerry Bruckheimer's production. Great car. Nic Cage and Oscar-Angelina Jolie fresh. Maybe you can go wrong? Many. <br /> <br /> The scenario is neither fun nor funny (it's really difficult) or not. Always put a black man who made himself and racist jokes about Wooh-haa! Is there a comedy? I do not think so. Excitement is entirely outside the picture. First of all (and this is probably several times called) there are no symbolic characters, so who is paying attention to the killing? If you can force a psixon to kill a psixon until he stole 50 cars within 4 days, you know that Kip (brother) is walking along the streets again. Is this an excitement? Do not think. The best result is romantic between Nic and Angelina. He actually says Nic, all these stupid lines. 'Do you have a girlfriend?' 'Do you see anyone?' 'What's wrong?' <br /> <br /> Therefore, there is only one glimmer of hope: the car is following. Too least they are disappointed to say, because the trailer looks like they are full and there is only one. It was a very long, irritatingly hectic camera caught. <br /> <br /> Is there an almost action movie? a tension? a romantic comedy? - There is no need to decide, and avoid this terrible mistake. I'll give 3 out of 10 stars and feel as if I'm generous.
