<br /> <br /> In the commercial film shot by good guys, TBN is a poor, unclear, bad scene, poor photography and direction ... all this was a clear mistake. <br /> <br /> Nora has succeeded in bringing Lam's story to the big screen on the Chinese Cry. But the "Omega Code" is a failed disaster. As a Christian who supports TBN and loves many programming and Chinese Cry, I still can not recommend this movie to anyone. They do very well with their service, but this is an example. Do not waste your money ... instead of entering "China Cry".
