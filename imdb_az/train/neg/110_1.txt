I'm taking this movie out of the library and I have not watched it. I'm very dirty. Audrey Hepburn has lost all his abilities since then, though he's pretty much in Robin and Mari√°n. This is the worst thing about a horrible stupid movie. <br /> <br /> There is nothing but loyalty between Gaza and its cronies. <br /> <br /> Of course, who believed that Hipberger was part of the same Manhattan environs that were so magical and even myths? 20 years ago at Tiffany's "Breakfast"? Older Sinatra songs and Gershwin's songs are so loud and clear - you do not have to wait for something to learn that something has something to do with the class-music of the picture <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "In this case, you will see Audrey Hepburn's chic European lady, once an actress and always a star, here she has lost her talent as a star. <br /> < Even if an individual who has been growing talent for the time being like Ann-Margret has played a role, even if it is incredibly bad material and sophisticated levels, it would be a life <br /> <br /> Hepburn is a great man, of course, from most movie stars he was one of the most charming and handsome movie actors ever before, after Robert Wolfgang's heroism He was filming a violent television film called "Love Among the Thieves." Like all others, he still played a game in the '50s. More intelligent and obviously less intelligent actresses that continued to do like Lana Turner were more effective than Hepburn. Turner was in a bad situation, though he was seriously engaged. Hepburn does not take seriously, and can not be disturbed; even the hair and the clothes are smoother. <br /> <br /> The girl who performs the country singer is just sick, because her last really good job was 'Two Paths', perhaps the best. John Ritter is terrific, there is simply nothing more to offer than just seeing this movie Dorothy Stratten. Otherwise, the expression "losing talent" by critique David Thomson is never more meaningful. <br /> <br /> After losing all the sexual appeal of Gazarra, we have two movies with Gazarra and Hepburn - can they want more? Sandra Dee's latest, pitiful movie 'Lost', after 2 years there was nothing beyond budget. At least Mrs. Dee spoke with her voice; By 1981 Audrey Hipbern's remarks were silly; She was going to make World Gardens 'PBS' Gardens with Audrey Hepburn, and there's a bit of annoying emphasis that when flowering back to nature, it works like "aristocrats or candles with English gardens" about what I love most! <br /> <br /> "Breakfast at Tiffany" was one of the most beautiful poetic things to Audrey Hepburn, so it was wonderful to think that he thought. Women in the world - of course, one of the most beautiful screens on my "Fair Lady", Garbo's a few things and "Delfin Seyrg" in Marienbad last year. And then this! <br /> <br /> In the Spielberg film, the shorter role of the angel, "Hap", was much more than a lady - intelligent, intelligent, and choking. <br /> <br /> The Avenue Presbyterian Church is a great service covering the boys' chorus of the Song of the Shaker, "Simple Gift". The only thing not shown in the program was the sudden performance of the fireman, Moon River, at Hipber's "Tiffany's Breakfast", and it brought a lot of senses and some real tears. <br /> <br /> Once a beautiful actress (like The Nun's story) and one of the biggest and most beautiful movie stars in many films in the 50's and 60's, is a really bad thing This is a lady who is a general. And perhaps it's just a great man who does something unusual, such as film showings, but nevertheless it's ridiculous to want the flaws to be manifested - it's all about late movie work. Most of the talk about Hepburn's misinformation is about "Fair Lady". But in this film, one of the original actresses, was 'Dark Up Waiting', playing the role of Lee Remick in Broadway. As Hepburn was not mentioned, Hepburn was at least in this part, though he was a good actress in many ways (Hepburn could not really play anything). After that, all the players fell down.
