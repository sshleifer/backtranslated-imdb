I had to suspend this movie, waiting for twenty minutes (a psychological-intellectual product for ambitious movie viewers), because I'm telling you that I'm approaching tears at about $ 3.99. . The Slavic accents, which Joanna Pacula is moving and magnificent, are scary enough to cut teeth. I knew his two hours were more than two hours. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are stunningly played by few talented non-branded actors. Though we were talented, Breuer's great assistant pulled out of a local troupe. He did not learn the obvious artistry. In fact, he is really terrible. All public scenes were staged, with the best of their mechanical day trips on Sunday. This film was more than happy to turn it around. Do not rent this horrible movie. You'll be sorry to spend your money.
