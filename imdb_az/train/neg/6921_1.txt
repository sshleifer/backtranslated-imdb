I went to the film's filming and it was a shock to me. It was a combination of every horror / thriller clich√©, pedophilia, devil worship, secret police, things, religion, and many other things ... and it was a mess. The actor was quite acne; child and Jesus my friend was good, but apart from them .... Anyway. I was amazed at the efforts of others (even though they failed) in a different way ... Nevertheless, when they presented the Gospel, they sneered a little and sang. But still, after he talked to a small child ... no. In fact, I just decided that everything around was bad. music ... oh my gosh ... terrible ... veryoo dramatic. Okay I felt bad for the first time this film was shot; It seemed like a weak student project. Now I'm going to see this movie if you want to stop on an appointment and tell the bottom line, go about an hour and fifty minutes shit on the go. go there.
