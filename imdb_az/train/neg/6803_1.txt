As for the IMDb boards, I always feed when I write the worst movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Ice T is a cool rapper, even a nice player (sometimes arbitrary "sometimes"), but Steven plays as a seagal's cops. <br /> <br /> For my invitation, it would be a very good player for me! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I told myself it was good! At least it will be a wonderful pyrotechnics ... The rest of the film is packed with low-cost checks taken from the air forces ... <br /> <br /> Dialogue is cheerful, the music is clean and the end is happy <br /> <br /> his son was delighted (I'm 22, he is 42 ... good). to shoot the film and burn it. It is possible that I will follow him next time ... (Who said?)
