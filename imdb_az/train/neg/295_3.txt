I bought a movie for free because I was working in a movie shop. It came in and the cover was visible. <br /> <br /> The same person, the bad move. It was so horrible that I saw half of the film looking forward to the film's nakedness. <br /> <br /> MAYBE, I think partly three scenes of nudity. <br /> <br /> Cheeseless dialogue, malevolent violence, poor pretexts of characters. <br /> <br /> I dropped this movie down. Because I know that it was a cheap budget, but the "Clerks" was a classic and franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
