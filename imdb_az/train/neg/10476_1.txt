I'm not a Christian. But I'm not always sure about the Christian movies. As a rule, when it comes to movie production, they become "knowledge-nothings". I was thrilled with TBN and tried to present God and Jesus in a positive and honest fashion on the screen. But it was a business. The player was terrific and if somebody did not know the Bible, they did not realize what the movie was trying to be. The film is not too scary, and some have even made some mistakes. However, these truths in this "critical" are deeply ingrained and deeper. In short, the Omega Code is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen, and I will not advise everyone, except for a funny relief without losing it every day.
