I'm sorry, but Kim Basinger did not do a good job that was scared, this was one of the worst alarms I've ever seen. 4 young children pulled this woman out of a massive center and shot a security guard. But nobody is waiting. Instead of screaming or helping to return to the shopping center, she is driving and ending in the middle of the forests with children in hot pursuit. I can not say how this woman is carrying a red tool box, fleeing from the 4-year-old killing, shouting and screaming for God's help, and then brutally murdering others. Trust me, it is bad and a little tasteless.
