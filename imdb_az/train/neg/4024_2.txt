This movie is simply terrible. The poor John Savage was so low to be in another movie. She is used as a rare vampire, and helps a homosexual dumpster in the streets of a local strip club. He has a blood donor from another dancer who is one of the rare vampires, as they are on the floor of the locker room. Savage is appointed by a short leader of this rare vampire breed that appears to be a cross between 80's punk rock and one of the purple-haired Olsen twins. This film is just crazy with one of the rare ones, with a ladder and dance with a tattoo spider that begins with Savage. She says Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante, and I just had to laugh. It only takes the rediculas. And then the most common special effects that might emerge are to throw Corri's organs out of their mouths. And you can tell everyone is fake. What happens when the son's mothers and their new personalities are not related, and the purpose of calm becomes more and more harmful. I'm talking about a good vampire movie, I believe it, but that's just something. Even photography is darkened by the camera that passes this way with the camera and makes it look like vampires, gets worse, moves quickly to accelerate the speed of the camera, and then the camera returns to the Savage scene, which protects the whole guy. Korri screwed himself around. Avoid this!
