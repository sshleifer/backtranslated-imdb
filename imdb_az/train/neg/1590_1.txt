HAH! Thus, the film included with the Next Action Stars. <br /> <br /> Is not it fun to see how it can look at the first 10 seconds (!) and how to make a person's mind? about a movie? So come! Just look at these names! I watched this movie (or part of this telepart because it was produced for television), and the audience was hodge-podge with me when working one evening tonight. For a while, like Las Vegas, watching for hours only for girls. so the bar was not really loud, the most watched movie in my band was Girl Next Door (and not because of the big script, D) However, this film is originality, acting, scripting, and just about everything else. Las Vegas (or CSI, I do not remember ...) without having to complain about the rest of the stream made it easier to channel. This is rare! Since Joel Silver has actually produced the best action movies out there (Die Hard, Matrix 1), watch it, not on this TV, but on the TV. I can say that producers do not give the film quality, they give money to directors, and this is a hopeless attempt to hide only deficiencies in order to sell the movie as it is only Joel Silver. the crew who really does.
