Have you watched a movie when it's 20 or 30 minutes and suddenly you see that you've seen it before? I met with "Young Alumni". The cover of the video box is very deceptive if you find the video. <br /> <br /> Well, in any case, I've been too late for ten years to evaluate the beautiful points of this movie, or ... just a meaningless junk. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> A plot. Let's have a place around ... somewhere around. No, I can not find her. Some high school elderly people with doppler and narcotics, and dozens of years ago, speak a lot of obsolete language. One of the female students is like a teacher. <br /> <br /> The teacher has a surprise spouse (she really is like an icebergs), so she accepts the girl's progress. <br /> <br /> There is a sliding around and a neat dialogue and a lot of spastic dance. Our cat BooBoo was dumped by secondary school children dancing. The dancers looked at the intensity as if they were screaming at the dance floor. It is nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic. 1/10
