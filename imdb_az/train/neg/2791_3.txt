Like most of the appraisers I've seen in Starz! OnDemand. After watching the preview with my girlfriend, she decided to follow the trauma of the trauma. On the other hand, I seemed strangely enough to provide a look. That is almost Dr. Mesoun's design proved to be at least brief in this topic. After watching it, I can say that there are stakeholders (that is, to look at notebooks and to understand the story that is unclear), it's good to go through it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After completing the first video for their unfinished CD, the lead singer, Cassidy, kills her, attempting to see her companion Neil. After 3 months, the group tries to decide whether or not to finish the album. To try and see what Cassidy wants, they are an old psychologist friend. They get acquainted with Meso and try to get in touch with him. When he reads a card, Dr. Meso pulled out four straight Death Cards for the rest of the band members. Old times ahead. (I just wanted to create a point in the movie, and I'm just explaining the change of Death card, at least for them Kudos.) The album ends without the consent of the dead friend. In the bathroom, Cassidy's best friend, Dora, takes up a part of his dead friend. If another group of friends goes to examine her, Dora requires sunglasses in the dark. <br /> <br /> The events that took place after the events in prison are mentioned. Not found in this movie in a plethora of many solvent effects, unnecessary zooms and other inexpensive effects. An inconsistent story also does not help. Although it is hanging somewhere for the first part of the prophet, after Cassidy's resurrection, everything is separated. We are Dr. Cassidy It shows that they are connected to each other or to each other as we enter a locked building between Meso. However, in just a few minutes of this revelation, Cassidy is truly independent of Meso. He then turns to the man who helps his revenge and extends Jack Nicholson in a call called The Joker. But not in a good way. <br /> <br /> At this point, Cassidy is shown where he is, but there are strange laps moving from place to place in an ordinary place. Cassidy sees a scene standing at a table that one character can not be found anywhere else. When we move behind the desk, we see it at the end of the corridor. Then, holding the keys in another room (which is longer than Neil), then again. Until the next moment, Cassidy's mood seems exactly 180 without a full catalyst. For a moment, he wants everyone to be killed (though he only 90% of the characters are wounded) - he apologizes to everyone and goes out to die again. Voting sound? That's the reason. <br /> <br /> I can say that the author can not even understand. <br /> <br /> When it comes to performances, it's especially wooden. While some are fascinated, in general, this is not a part of his work. The story is the moving force behind this piece.
