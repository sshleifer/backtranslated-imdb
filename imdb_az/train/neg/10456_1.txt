I would give it a negative rating if I could do it. I do not expect much of this movie, but I have a clear idea. Everything is foolish! Snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a fungus and a guy johnson. Oh how original; Although I'm a 12 year old boy, I smile. I have no idea how much this movie will be. Seriously, the worst thing I've ever seen. I did not have fun, I was not funny, I did not even enjoy it! I was nothing. It was good, even worse, just bad. Actually ridiculous. Please do not lose money in this movie. Do not even rent this movie. There is no clue how to get such a high rating.
