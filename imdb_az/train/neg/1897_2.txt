This was a terrible movie! I gave her 2 points for Angelina Jolie and gave her the first for the beautiful Porsche at the beginning ... In addition, the story was just sucked straight and the car racing through cities was not new in 1970. The Happyend was very uncomfortable with what I did, rarely seen something built!
