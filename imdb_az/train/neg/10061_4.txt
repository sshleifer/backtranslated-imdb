By adhering to the Frankenstein Curse, Mary Shelly's story remains loyal to a single word and it would not be so bad if there were good changes. The tragedy of the life that destroyed Frankenstein's family was completely cut and replaced ... nothing. The heart and spiritual center of the story went on. This does not mean that Frankenstein is a foolish, fraudulent killer; He deserves everything. The site is basically a shallow list of Frankenstein's clich√©s. Even in their own conditions, this is garbage: a soft, curly pudding bowl with a shaggy-haired look. Terror is a safe place in the history of horror as it was for the first time ever taken by Peter Hammer's horror films under the direction of Fisher and Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. But that's it.
