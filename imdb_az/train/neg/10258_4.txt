The Earth, Perga Ata, and a bunch of Nuns tend to be ignored. Christopher Lee (who has been beaten to be seen by producers who said he was moved to most of the major actors since then), is in the Perga and his ordinary and frightening attitude. Even though most of them are retired, the shot is not bad. The film has terrific sound effects, usually caused by the burning of buttons on an old computer that appears on an old computer, and sometimes it is fun to think - showing a scene from the sky, for example, feels like a clock at a time. Nevertheless, the story is quite joking in a limited way on a world and production is sufficient. An exciting scene is Albert Band and his wife Jackie; Meda Band; Writer Frank Ray Peill and Bennett Burton, Assistant of Charles Bend. Despite his plodding nature, I really wanted to see how all this works and so I loved it.
