Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful player. The director of "La Pianiste" understands it and provides the viewer with Huppert's face for a long time and it is pleasant to see them. Huppert is not an animated actor - he notes his feelings with a small eyebrow or a shaking smile. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more than an experienced actor's profession. this film that wants to recommend this to me. <br /> <br /> <strong> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p style = "text- <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> People who compete at the highest level - /> <br /> It realizes the life lesson. <br /> <br />
