A missed call based on a mobile phone, another Asian horror. I recently rented a Korean movie based on a mobile phone named "Pon". A Missed Call was so dull. Maybe the phones are not just scary or anything, but this move was boring and boring. There is no tension and no excitement for me, and the last monster was like a frustration and unshakable. The film dropped slightly in different parts and felt very long. You did not hold my attention. As you can see, the phones are hard to frighten, and the pop-vending machine works to make them happy. It's ridiculous to compare with The Ring, and it's comparable to every Asian horror film and I have never seen anything so far. Terrifying directors - Take the phone as a hero to fears.
