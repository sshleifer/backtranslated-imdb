We left George Clooney's character at the point where his finger nails were removed. We're not indestructible - we felt like we knew this driver was sitting in an hour. To say that this film is incomprehensible, a dull, ambitious stroke would praise her! How did people manage to live in a corner of this embarrassed, surprising psychologist, so why not nominate a candidate for the Oscars? Clooney looked worse as we looked at her. What did he think? Oh .. and what happened to these subtitles? - Is there only a dud DVD or the original movie of such a movie - the subtitling sentences? The film was hard enough to watch without it. I'm sorry to say that we have done our best with the material available.
