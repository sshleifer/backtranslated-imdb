Manoj Agrawal returned with this movie after the failure of PARDESI BABU (1998). <br /> <br /> In the film there are 8-9 roles Govinda, her father, mother, father, sister, and then she is masked. <br /> <br /> In short, she and her spouse, while photographed with Rani, he sends his wife a job to get her evidence against her husband. <br /> <br /> Then she is masked as a French singer and enters a television to get the evidence and then the rest of the movie has the same identical personalities and ends with a predictable note. There are some comic scenes buried by African and many other countries such as Govinda. parties <br /> <br /> Manoj Agrawal's management is complete Musical is <br /> <br /> Govinda among the players is still one of the most viewed actors Although he is likely to play 6-7 roles really not the movie Although he has played such roles before he plays very well all the ups and roles, he does not have that great good in Govinda and continues to play such roles. Nirmal Pandey as usual As always, Johny Lever plays a combination of time and team and annoying as the old Tinnu Anand is good Satish Kaushik is cheerful, Paresh is okay Tanaaz is good
