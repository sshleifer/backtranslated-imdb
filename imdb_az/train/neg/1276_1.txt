This is the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> THIS IS A DANGEROUS HEART I am doing. bad music. Horror films had a few points. First, you need to be stable enough to scare you. This movie is in category F. The second point is that when a character dies or when there is nothing wrong, we must care. This movie also gets F in this regard. <br /> <br /> The first event is that a woman is drowned by the monster after she is afraid of going to him. The next story, an OCD boy dies from being cautious and speaks to a dead friend. Oh, and then there is a bad roommate, a terrible, nail-biting story. Come on, you can choose a little more interesting about a subject and less than just a single home, anal retentive, and less than a guest room? These stories reveal that the hallucinations, in turn, have virtual reality that they believe by a physician who uses it. Wow, stupid. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something, laugh at watching bad movies and how bad it is. I could not do that. It was very painful to sit and watch. In any case, do not watch this movie. You will regret it.
