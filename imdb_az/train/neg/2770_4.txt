Hollywood Hotel was the latest film directed by Busby Berkeley for Warner Bros. His directorial style has changed or has come to the point where he does not consist of large production numbers with signature shots or thousands of additions. In the last few years of the twenties, swing-style big bands have celebrated the year's biggest celebrity hit. The Swing Era also called the Great Band Era, from 1935 to 1944, or from 1939 to 1949. While it was not possible to clarify the start of the Swing era, Benny Goodman's participation in the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles was one of the earliest indications that summer was beginning to enter the minds of most American youths by the end of 1935. Goodman was not a dance music in his band's band, but when he showed his swing repertoire, the audience's youth was wild. It was a beginning, but the radio, live concerts, and oral words were one of the main methods used to spread phenomena, and took some time without enough time to create great hits in pop-graphics. The appearance of Benny Goodman and the Orchestra and Raymond Paige and the Orchestra in the Hollywood Hotel shows that the film industry is ready to invest in the change of music taste (after only a year or a half of the movie Goodman Palomar Ballroom). There are a few interesting tracks in here and at Hollywood, but there is nothing else to do, except for Benny Goodman and the Orchestra's "Sing, Sing, Sing" gifts. Otherwise, the most exciting music followers are the production line "Holorvay Form", which opens in the driver's restaurant and the "It is your lesson" product number. It is most interesting to hear and hear the movie, Benny Goodman and his Orchestra and Dick Powell and Frances Langford.
