In my opinion, this film promotes a new idea. It looks like a spear with a spear without looking at it! the director appears to have an agenda! Duh! In his view, the lack of rationality does not seem like a place for alternative care. I usually have a naysayer side, but this movie does not have the reliability as the male / female on the street is based on fantastic observations. Now, if you really want to educate a credible alternative to a belief that has taken place in the 2000+ years, you have to make an effort to make the other party believe in their beliefs. I'm not sure, but at the beginning of the film I felt like an attack on Cristian faith, but I'm not a believer, but I allow other people's beliefs and I do not want to smile at them, understand and persevere.
