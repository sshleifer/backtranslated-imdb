Unfortunately, it was shown in Thailand's Star Movies last week. This is completely a garbage player. According to another member, this movie is a good example of 'do not move'. I have not seen a bad movie for a long time. Actors (they call 'actors') are completely straightforward and present their lines with passion for a dead dog. <br /> <br /> I love my wife. <br /> <br /> My wife loves me. and with the rest of the kick (false or defective) is equally terrible. Another actress with a fake English accent quite yes, yes, but the good lord was afraid of his emphasis. There is an act of disobedience and a disaster. He should not just say something and accept it as a beautiful girl. Oh, I just came to the scene, who just said the lady's lover "Really tells me". After a violent cry. It's funny. No, laugh really loud. <br /> <br /> Canvas and art directors provide some gratitude for the movie. <br /> <br /> An ancient magic potion lady? Yes?! Another member mentioned the "modern" song of love in the film. <br /> <br /> Some 500 years ago a piece of a certain period was not entirely compatible. <br /> <br /> At the time the film was produced, Thailand was considered a 'Big Budget'. I was seriously sorry if I was the producer of this movie. <br /> <br /> King Maker will give 1 to 10 but suits and kits can be saved from this movie. a rating. 10 out of 2.
