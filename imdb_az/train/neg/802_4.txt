As with many media experiences, this amateur effort contains the seeds of a very interesting social commentary. During the 5+ years after the release, the program was less ugly in real world events, and I found it less boring than the previous commentator. Imagine ... Hitchcock and the movie are not too bad, the film has never been executed better, but in fact, this pulp is a parody of science fiction. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I find this for all these reasons and more fun. Sometimes slick has less to offer us and I advise anyone who wants to deconstruct it for educational purposes. Yes, maybe stitches and many injuries, my heart has increased, and I did not want to stop and take a break.
