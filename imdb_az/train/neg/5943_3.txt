This movie reminded me of the Soprano and it's not a good way. <br /> <br /> David Chase's seminal mob operated twice only two times in the footsteps of his legs, one of the most shocking and undiscovered examples, when he was judged in the fourth season, in the life of Junior Soprano. Instead of fulfilling this pivotal (and pivotal) plotline, Bobby Baccalieri's recent dead spouse chose not to see him completely, focusing on the frozen pasta dish. <br /> <br /> When it comes to a reputable truth, for example, the mysterious assassination attempt of Tupac Shakur, who first coincided with all the East Coast / West Coast, resulted in death, as well as the film of Tupac and Christopher Wallas - as a means to mix it with one another. Why did Tupac make sure that he was sold by his own people? Has he just increased his relationship with Suge Knight alone? <br /> <br /> Who was Lil 'Kim, a primary office plane, sexually disadvantaged, to a vampy diva, as it turned out to be something like that? None of these questions have even been solved by the screenwriters of the film, and Wallace's interest to describe the ugly love life in a dramatic, zero-dimensional way. <br /> <br /> The spouses are like each other. <br /> <br /> In some cases, the structure and content are simple and odd. But mostly biopic; as something that has been taught without mentioning the subject and touching the subtleties of their lives and works; The film is completely worthless. Combining the ethic potato genre and the lifeless musical performers (such as a movie that needs to be increased), it is only a movie designed to satisfy the desires and demands of those films. She easily satisfied Wallace's suspicious status, has left it in a giant position in its field. <br /> <br /> And the last twenty minutes of Wallace's death after the death of his cultural identity, painted just like the last day of his holiness, made me feel as though he was throwing me. <br /> <br /> In this account, compared to the others, it's something tickled, calculated, and dangerous.
