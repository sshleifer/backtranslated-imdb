Mark Lester, a producer who did not read or read the lead role, made a big mistake. Despite the very bad "action", it was supposed to be dubbed by a girl she read all about. I do not know why I did not know why, because there would be many guys who would have played this part forever and could read their songs. Sani Wallis, who was supposed to be only 16, was too old to play. The current West End version is better than any movie. Ross McCormack, the best-experienced Dodger of all time, and he, Jack Wild, is never looking better than ever. After the tragic events of 1968, this old music was an open policy to reward many Oscars.
