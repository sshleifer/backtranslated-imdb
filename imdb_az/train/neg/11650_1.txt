After the first break, the comrades can encounter some new jokes. Although I can not say. If the first was not bad enough, it was as bad as it was to watch. Any actor in this movie may be somewhat more intelligent. Despite the fact that they did not know, they were laughing again and again, not primarily with no funny joke. Although it did not smile for the first time. Although they failed at every level, they tried to turn these films into parodies. Often, it only puts jokes at random, and it is surprising that it is difficult to watch and enjoy it. Then, when they try to make scenes with movie parody, they're completely off the stage with a joke on the 20 minute rest of the scene. Not only the elderly and the real young audience, but for one person, that is, it is appropriate for me to be funny for the age range. If people tell different people that they do not have fun or different ideas, then if you find something funny, you probably are not one of the more mature and clever people around. It does not take much skill to write such a thing, though watch a movie with a more intelligent and entertaining movie, Spaceballs. It's really not good to use the disgusting and luxurious jokes to make a good movie parody or funny.
