The long list of "great" names (including John Mills, anywhere) in this trick is that I can not judge the true essence. Unfortunately, from the heroes of a modest air-hero, stereotypes, cartoons and standard, stage lines are full of loud-voiced tricks. At one point in the music piece, I figured it was over, that the movie was over: high, rising crescendo, magnificent blooming and then erasing, but then the movie continued! No real story, no furious writing, but smart-pressed form and favorite Jan Simmons (pre-nose work), with a little ditty. I can not say that this picture has one of the most attractive films. I saw this maudlin, the infidel and the little one.
