I really like this movie. There are some good actors, but it eventually falls flat. In some places it is very difficult to be funny (it is a scene that clears someone's yard, it is a team that joins the team), and there are some scenes that are really filler (all work areas). And I did not see the "villians" scary or hateful. <br /> <br /> When I was playing a church ball, I met some people like the movie. And the judge says, but still in the end, really did not care too much to look for fame in the heroes or the church. Perhaps all of this was somewhat dimmer, because the film was logical or somewhat smoother. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale and Halestorm have made some good movies on entertainment, but this is not one of them.
