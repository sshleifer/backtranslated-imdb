The film is dedicated to TLC films, which is a stage for the first time and is the second best-selling Disney movie, along with the arrival of this movie ... Now I do not argue with animation, sound, or music, but this is the story of the Timon / Pumbaa screw more. It's not bad, but it does not add anything. Basically this movie is a great joke ... and it saves all of them. Make a real TLK3, Disney! There is potential. <br /> <br /> 4/10
