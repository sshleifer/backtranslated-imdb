This movie was an attempt to go to most places and maybe not. Despite this deep and well-illustrated description, it was a strange, awe-inspiring experiment in Cell. The area is simply built with a sense of startup camp. Later, as in the "dramatic" turn of the film, the area has to stand first in a few feet. <br /> <br /> Generally, the idea is to have a child who needs money (Chris McKenna). He takes the role of a cunning man who kills a city accountant. Then he does not earn money for his work, but instead has been subjected to torture for a few days because he has dreamed of a "brighter" idea that he seeks to use a backup file, such as leverage. They were afraid and tried to force them to return because they had used them forever. He begins to emerge very confused scenes. Then, imagining that he could pay for his sins and begin his life, his wife, Kari Wuhrer, and his love for the murderer. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Previously, after he understood who, after the tragedy strikes and revenge airway poured. <br /> <br /> What are the movies of Kari Wuhrer and horror / gore? <br /> <br /> Everything that has been produced lately has been in this genre. Of course, I liked him in the "Octagon Freaks" and he was good at Anaconda. But despite all the obvious sharpness and charm (wow, it's hot!), You can move better and choose better roles. Or I'm wrong, maybe it's a wrong idea. For all the people there, it's incredibly strange and short-lived, though to see its "full monty" in this movie. After watching this movie, I felt that she was doing a little soft porn (Kari's career is not something outside). Sexual simulation has to be amazed at what really happens in the filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there's almost a good move. Do not just wait for Daniel Balwin, his career forever comes to his brother Alex for the second time. The film, although George Wendt (Norm from Cheers) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Strange Science) created some great miracles. Above all, Chris McKenna is the main character, Sean Crawley's best work. His small acting experience and still convincing nature as a naive youth brings some of the movies to the film. <br /> <br /> I will not go out of my way for this. <br /> <br /> And, Kari, please start moving to better movies!
