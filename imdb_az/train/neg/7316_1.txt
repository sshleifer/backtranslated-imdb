When I saw previews for this movie, I did not expect too much to start - the second degree teen horror movie around. But this movie was terrible. This is generous. <br /> <br /> First of all, filming was terrible. You will not feel any sympathy for the heroes (or any feeling of illness in this case). The player was terrified that I just waited for my expectation and the fear of God to end. <br /> Secondly, there are films that have nothing to do with the movie. Someone can explain to me, why a nice-looking boy begins to scream "PANCAKES !!!" When I went to Jackie Chan's motion, I never saw a lung on the lungs and sipped a boy with more virus? Why is the father angry with the man who infects the virus and will not go to the red hunting nudity to find it? <br /> <br /> I just do not believe what I've seen, just do not believe it. I really thought I was seeing some bad movies, but I have to say that the Cabin Fever favored them all. This film wanted to spit me and then poke me. <br /> <br /> Take yourself an hour and a half and do something more productive. The pinch is probably an appropriate alternative.
