The film has been in the grave for a long time. As the film progresses, very little is explained, and in the end, it can not be understood only in a strange sequence that seems to have a deeper meaning, but only because of the storyline and the story. There are some forces to watch the movie again, but I will not do it in a way. In the morning I watched this movie, but I am sure that in the evening I watch this movie, I was asleep. The movie was like a Blade Runner, a poor man. <br /> <br /> The film creates many questions and disadvantages. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a reasonable and lasting impression. <br /> <br /> The strange appearance of the film does not help much. The film cuts CGI by half, shrinks the real life, but it's not as good as it is, like impressive, magnificent and creative, like in movies like Sin City and 300. They have even created half the characters of the movie, which is also a very trivial and strange choice, as well as character animation is not very impressive. <br /> <br /> The futuristic environment still does not look good, and the film is not really cheap, but its style is on the item, and there is nothing positive to say really. <br /> <br /> It is also absolutely terrible and uninteresting. The main God of the movie always says such lines; "I will do it, but it's not one of the worries I want to do." Just do not say anything from Mr. Horus! Despite telling you something about the excitement, filming is very uncomfortable and really easy. The deeper questions and origins of the film are complicated by the filming and scenario of the film. <br /> <br /> The actors are still doing their best. They seemed to believe the project and they were convinced that what they were doing would be something special. So I can not say anything negative to them. <br /> <br /> The story and the movie are not genuine. Many classic and semi-classic, mostly sophisticated, science-fiction films. <br /> <br /> The reason is that some movies have made me a very rich impression. <br /> <br /> An unfortunate and uninteresting film experience. <br /> <br /> 3/10
