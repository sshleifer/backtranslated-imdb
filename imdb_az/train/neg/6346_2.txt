This movie is wrong! You may want to refund your two-hour timeframe. Drive Doors, W / Gwynenth Paltrow and Peter Howit, made what Melinda and Melinda are trying to do much better. This film was clever, witty and well-behaved. <br /> <br /> If I had a dialogue where Melinda and Melinda were tedious, I knew. they care less about any of these people - at least Melinda. A Melinda is very tolerant - her first wine glass is at 10 o'clock - not so comic, but melodramatic. 2nd Melinda is beautiful, but memorable. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's previous ensemble films worked because I suspect it would take time for the scenario and the actors were talented. A trivia piece for this movie consists of writing this scenario in two months: you can say. And although Chloe Sevigny is talented - it's not enough to have all of those around it. <br /> <br /> <p> Kloe Sevigny and other groups you know about in other films, but we will not be able to remember them. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sad.
