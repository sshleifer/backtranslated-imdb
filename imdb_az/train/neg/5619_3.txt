The main purpose of the film is to agree that historically, Jesus and Christianity are nothing. However, this film is a very weak job to prove this thesis. These are good arguments - the gap between Jesus' theoretical life and the writing of the Holy Scriptures is filled with the writings of Paul, who did not show the history of Jesus, and then vindicates them completely convincingly. Making extensive statements without submitting statements based on statements, he decisively ignores the counter-arguments presented by Christian apologies. Intellectual immorality, emotional manipulation, and lack of serious arguments are clear and confusing. The only Christian we hear in the film is the head of the filmmaker's old school - trying to deal with a twit with a chip on his shoulder comes as a reasonable, efficient person - and a car park accidentally encountered by various Christians. We are sorry, but revealing that Middle Christianity does not know much about the religions is evidence of Christian fraud. You can claim that Jay Lenon denied the existence of Michael Dukakis in the Jay Walking segment. Negotiations with experts may be interesting, but the film is full of lots of things, let's be honest, that the filmmaker is just gorgeous. In the first five minutes, the film has agreed with the Davidians department of Jerry Falwell's Charles Manson and Sol Behind series writers. Finally, the film is so self-centered that there is no rational argument that is drifting into an angry old Christian and responsible for his sinful childhood. Perhaps this film might have been interesting, but I was wrong in a documentary on Jesus' historiography and congratulated himself for canceling any kind of sympathy. This is Michael Moore's film, humor, or Richard Dawkins's book, which combines a mental or intellectual unwanted movie. Jump.
