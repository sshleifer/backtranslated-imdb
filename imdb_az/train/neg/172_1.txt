The return of the lake to the Lake is not genuine in any way. With just one main character (Stanley) returning to the sequel, the movie is not even about 2 hours of your time. I'm a great fan of the first movie, I really love the story line and my play, but it's a movie that I do not want to watch once. It basically resembles Urban Legends and Blair Witch syndicates, but with a worse player. Personally I have seen better soap operas, it's sad that you just have to laugh. I do not recommend this movie to anyone in any way, though this will be reduced in the first place.
