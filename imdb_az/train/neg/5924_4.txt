Diana Muldaur appears on the Star Trek for the second time, but this time is a different character. No one in the boat - maybe hair. But this time he is not a nest for a god (see in the preceding episode), but he is a very famous lady with magical powers that can see a Medusa who does not have a standard human reaction. Unfortunately, his favorite man is not a short card full of deck and he tries to kill the Medusan ambassador (lives in a weird, small crate - a bad way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldayr is not a good self-injury. What happens next is as if it were loyalty and when I first saw the episode I was so relieved. Muldaur, who watched all the men in Heyda, went to Ye Ga, and was very strange, and Spock was pretty crazy in a short time. Give yourself a blessing - if you have not seen the show before, choose a different episode.
