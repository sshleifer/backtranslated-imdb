Joe Bob Briggs watched this movie while hosting Monstervision at TNT. He even did not like this movie. As I taught video production, the only reason I was reading was to make sure that I did not do anything bad to my students ... but all my intestines needed to fit in. <br /> <br /> If you shoot a true movie and watch it fill it with fine paint, it would be more entertaining. Seriously. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie at the bar at the S-Mart, it would shatter away from it.
