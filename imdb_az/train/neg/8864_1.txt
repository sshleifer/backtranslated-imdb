After watching this, I lost some respect for Christopher Lee (it was time). This movie was completely trash. First, they tried to put an end to the first "Pillow" with a very bad make-up. Then they try to apologize for a slavery porn movie! The land is sucks and the whole movie is just awful !!!! The first film, a victim of a victim (presented as Dee Wallace Stone), is a group to destroy the band of kurds created by Sybil Danning, who appears to be naked with Lee and another woman. <br /> <br /> This is not even worth the rent (if you do not want to spend your time and money to track nakedness). Instead, try to hold the cables. It would be cut off, it could be really meaningful.
