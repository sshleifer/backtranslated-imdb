I love Jane Austin novels. I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense sensitivity books and movies and I am half by Mansfield Park. But Emma could not stand. After 2 chapters, I gave up the book and did not even think about Emma at the end of the movie. He seemed to have never changed. Perhaps, Paltrows (which is excellent at Se7en) or my interest to the movie. Dunno. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dresses are beautiful, but dancing was unusual compared to Pride and Prejudice dancing by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. <br /> <br /> Although bloody spectacular and a very light performance for Evan McGregor, I liked his reading.
