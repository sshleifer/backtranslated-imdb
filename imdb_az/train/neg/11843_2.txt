An event will make a good movie / movie because it really happened. Peter Bogdanovich's Cat Meow argues that William Randolph Hurst is hosting a series of events. The writer took more time to create a story that strange characters could live, and he paid more attention to creating more strange characters. The main points of the story are invisible; For example, when Hurst accidentally hit the manufacturer, believing he was a Captain. The wrong hats are strange, one of the key elements of a story. This story tries to be a dark comedy, but Cat Meow misses an important part of this equation, the comedy. There is no empathy for each character. Those who are shot, killed, guilty, and innocent are very difficult. There is no strong attribute of happiness. As a result, it is difficult to take care of the conflicts and the outcome is not accidental.
