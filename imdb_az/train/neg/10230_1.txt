One copy of it has occurred. If I'm not mine and spend my money on it, I find those responsible and ask for it back! Almost this will be a terrifying student film. It is not possible to understand the film's environment. It is said that the action is a terrible thing, the story would be rejected as an unoriginal and lame from the original Twilight Zone series, and the change in the tone of the "ghost" reaction of the leading character. <br /> <br /> Only admits that the film's "bright" views are friends and family. <br /> <br /> Dear amateur! <br /> Avoid it! Avoid! Avoid!
