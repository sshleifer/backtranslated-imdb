I just want to start by saying the first look at a movie I've done on this network. I felt I needed to warn people about this movie because it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. After reading the interview with the filmmaker, he respects constructive criticisms, so I try not to mention the beginning of the film and found it to be so terribly terrible. /> 1. Players. I know that the budget could not have allowed for the great Holiness, but for more than a decade, some actors knew at least on average with Nicholson, working in the industry. <br /> <br /> 2. Incredibly removes heart and special effects. <br /> <br /> Once again, the budget clearly interferes with what is intended, but after many years of preparation, there is really no excuse. <br /> <br /> Similarities to the Hostel. Indeed, despite the destruction, he tries to earn money for the success of old films. The only problem was knowing what Roth was running away and how exactly it would be ... <br /> 4. Music. <br /> <br /> 5. General script. All dialogue was compelled and terrible! <br /> <br /> Officers in nature and the man who came to rescue them were weak and almost as if they were the next. <br /> 6. Editing. WTF. Not in a good way, it's shaken. nuf said. <br /> <br /> I seriously want the director's idea of ​​my job (surely his visit to his IMDb frequently) leads to friendship ... what do you think? You undoubtedly understood the way in which Turkey was on the one hand when shooting or rebuilding ... I do not want to be sad but you have more abilities, so I hope next feature is gutterballs movie or wahtever <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> I would like 81 minutes for curiosity. (At least I did not pay to watch it.)
