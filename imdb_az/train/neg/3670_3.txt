A science fears movie should be really original or very good retelling to work well. What's this movie. Of course, the guy is killing people because of toxicity rather than disease, but it is a very small twitch. <br /> <br /> The real drawback of this film is that the dirty man does not have any patches. Although it is written to be a miserable person, it is not. The film is meaningless without the obvious. Other symbols are very funny strawberry cutters. Subplots are fragile and boring. And the most unfortunate thing is that the film is too straightforward to even enjoy such an error. Shorten the movie for 45 minutes and you may need to watch it.
