There was much talk about this movie. I am very excited about this movie. As a result, the best, the worst, the most painful. Acting styles really missed the straight (angels, spouse and daughter) gamut of Casper's character (Casper's character). I felt that dialogue was an attempt to convey information to the audience rather than real people who wanted to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the incident related to "mistake". We're pretty offensive to the audience's ability to respond. To defend this scene, the movie had the biggest smile. I read that they spent most of the money traveling to many foreign countries. It did not use too bad. I did not feel I moved to exotic places. Everyone can put the look of the Coliseum in Rome. However, I thought the teams were good enough to end a positive note. I liked the graphics shown on the encryption computer. This is my idea (and all of these) that if the SCHMALTZ factors were very low, and the ACTION factor increased too much, this movie would be good.
