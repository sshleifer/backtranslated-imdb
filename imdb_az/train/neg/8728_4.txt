This is bad. There's nothing out there that's really bad and boring movie. A series of murders, killer, classic investigations you've seen throughout the film. A classic fairy tale about a police officer who imagines what's happening and who does not trust anyone, so he has to fight himself to reveal the truth. This is not so much. Sound: From 10 to 4.
