This film is classic with sensitivity but not kinematographic quality. <br /> <br /> This incredible plot takes place around an attempt by two British soldiers and an Indian rebels to rescue a third soldier captured by the rebels. The Hindus. In the next scene, we see a complete world with a drum and a slippery bag. In the British army, a sergeant does not initiate a rescue attempt and, if you are past, do not try with only one soldier or one Indian worker when he is in a trance. The Indian rebels are so incredibly confident that they are ridiculous ... They have hundreds, but they can not keep the prisoners or can not kill two fireflies. At one point, British soldiers are throwing blocks of flamethrowing flies in the rubble around the mountain ... one needs to have a pepper spray to think that it will suffer. After the current Grant is over, he lays the edge around a boy living in the water after hitting the survivor ... the actions of a trapped person are not difficult. The water runs a bold blow to the guy (not coming from anywhere) for an alarm signal ... standing on this wall, being seen and shot by bad guys, and he tries to make more notes than he has hit repeatedly, and the weak call goes into weak sparks ... half brained not to replace losers when hiding in the cover like everyone else. This scene was met with a parody of comedy sketches. If they wanted to make a Buster Keaton comedy, they had to take Keaton and do it in a better way.
