The film is weak, except for some famous Hollywood titles. Other statements by other candidates (Jennifer Gabrielle) are thirsty. I saw other films of this director, unfortunately, this is one of the worst. Perhaps this is a reflection of the scenario? <br /> <br /> In a positive note, Kim Bassinger and Pat Morita's performance saved the film from oblivion. I like Patate very much at Karate Kid. There are many good movies to see, and in short, it is not one of them. Save your money and celluloid. <br /> <br /> Jason Vanness
