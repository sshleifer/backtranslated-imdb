I do not believe that I was really watching it, but I would like to know that this movie will be staggering and entertaining to the end. and did it. the uprising was the poorest performance given by the defense lawyer. That was so strange for a so-called story from real life. No one on the planet could ever move in front of the court. and probably the worst prosecutor in the world. Why was he in court at all times? he did nothing to prove his sin, and did nothing. a simple search engine rings that led to his house. but do not go. 2 or 3 times in the entire trial process to "object". The blonde lunat was innocent, but a truth medication was given to prove Brett. his foolishness was an altar in Brett's house that could accuse his illness. but it does not go any further. on the court scene, I felt that I had been pushing the needle and stabbing her head several times. Even the true charges he does not seem to be fake "I'm innocent." and what does this movie tell us? Do not marry a woman without any life insurance: her husband is thrown into prison, guilty or not until the ladder goes down. bad, bad guys.
