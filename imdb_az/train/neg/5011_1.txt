... And I did not think it was worthy of a movie! But this is a horrible film. My husband chose because of casting, but the reminder since the DVD box was quite predictable. It's not a mystery, it's a little movie. It does not include any sensuality, if it can lead to any of you. This is a general rule. When watching a group of young Gothic grown-ups, do not waste your time or money unless you think that a killer will go after them. Nothing new, something interesting, worth watching. Max Makowski makes Nick Stahl the worst.
