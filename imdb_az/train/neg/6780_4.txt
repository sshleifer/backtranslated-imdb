This film was a critical and box office fiasco in 1957. It was based on a novel that has become a flopped-up game on Broadway. The story is about unauthorized naval officers in San Francisco during the Second World War. They have a four-day vacation at Mark Hopkins Hotel. There is a lot in the film, and none of the characters seem real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant with comedy and drama - but here he plays some kind of luggage merchant and does not really care about it. Tony Curtis or James Garner would be a better choice. Audrey Hepburn could play against Grant from the beginning, but had other commitments - Suzy Parker also went on. He had never acted, but he's America's best photography model. I think he had done a good job, taking into account all the pressures he was under. Grant's love with Jayne Mansfield in a short time - really did not work. The studio, working with Grant, tried to give her a class, but she had no substance.
