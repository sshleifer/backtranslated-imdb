There are a number of problems with this movie, but the bottom line has tried to work very little. The key talks are very good, but the money was not just about the story justice. The non-existent budget actually killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (writer / director) wrote a box office called "Let's close my children". However, this film made a great deal of money from Disney. I'm honest, that's a good example for filmmaking. Although it did not wait for a few years, technology would have made it much cheaper. (he did not say that he could earn a company with money).
