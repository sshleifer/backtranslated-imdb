What to start? This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen. Correction is the worst, sound effects are terrible and sound is correct. Most of the film can have an unhealthy kickback effect, which is a direct sequence of conversation. I had to turn my volume into an explosion that just happened to her ... and what exactly should I not hear? Probably one of the worst scripts. I do not believe that people actually put some green on this movie. <br /> <br /> Dolph was a usual dolph. Dolph is to think, buy a crap in a box, send it to the producers and then fund a movie for me. There is nothing else to say. Slavery was bad, heroes were bad and the film was a stinker. If you really want to know what to do when editing, directing, or editing a movie, you can watch it!
