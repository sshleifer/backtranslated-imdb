It seems to me that films banned in the film history are really very important and very good films. I suspect that, instead of forbidding challenging, controversial films, censors must ban bad movies that can endanger my IQ and your mind. If they were one of the first films to hide it quickly, undoubtedly, it could have been Stroker Ace. This movie is horrific with a capital "A". Burt Reynolds is the worst movie in the film. It's very strange for a man named "Cannonball Run II", "Cop A Half" and "Rent-A-Cop" in the CV! <br /> <br /> The tense story of tension introduces us to the successful car racers Stroker Ace (Reynolds), a fast-moving car and a woman who loves speedily. He has a contract with Clyde Torkle (Ned Beatty), a crooked initiator. The treaty requires a little bit of insult to a new fast food restaurant chain, as it prepares her as a giant chicken. <br /> <br /> Lugs (Jim Nabors), Ace's angry boyfriend and Pembrook Feeney (Loni Anderson), a bimbo with a smaller brain than a chickpea beaten by Ace thrown in the mixture. <br /> <br /> This low grade garbage director Needham was previously a stuntman and he made numerous films that based on his experience in creating spectacular stunts and car chases / races. Some of these films were like Hooper and Stunts Unlimited but have reached a rare career with Stroker Ace. The heroes are very stupid, they really regret the actors who played them. Anderson has especially slammed with such a terrific role that teeth your teammates. Humor is weak and childhood, and stunts and race are not preferred. Even during final loans (all Reynolds-Needham co-operatives) are generally unreasonable, maybe the impression that the film is very entertaining. "Stroker Ace" is a significant stinker.
