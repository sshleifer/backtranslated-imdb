Prepare your mind. Personally, I found him very entertaining because he received a spinal tape from Stevie Wonder. No offense, Mr. Wonder. Perhaps it was a comedy, but I saw him stupid. Your babies are not the first choice for babies; Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), two vendor salesmen, have ordered two children from a development center headed by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch) to prevent the detention. One of the mistakes is Ronnie (J. Thompson), a foul-mouthed fifth grader, and another one Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), an unreasonable young man who plays in a fantastic medieval world. Wheeler and Danny desperately tried to give their lives, love, and heavy metals a valuable look. Lynch is not happy with its dry rich analogues. Elizabeth Banks, Ken Jeongg, Kerri Kenney-Silver, Amanda Rigetti and David Wain.
