The words "Sweden" and "Action movie" are not mixed. It is clearer with every attempt made in this genre. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lazse works with many secret computer systems in the military air base, Brunell (Shanti Roney). One day foreign offenders threaten to hurt their family. <br /> <br /> This movie has a volume and a fall. And usually there are no "ups" in Swedish action movies, just "down". Here's something in this movie. I can say that the film is technically well-prepared to start with positive comments. Flying images of planes and helicopters are well-drawn and look very nice. Acting is a very different quality. Although Maria Bonnevie is in a strange and unusual way, Shanti Roney shows a good performance (the Swedish filmmakers are surprised how the wooden planter will be using it despite the toys). <br /> <br /> Stefan Sauk is as laugh as the men of "cool" special forces coming to the base for research. <br /> What are the same motion scenes? The flying scenes of planes and helicopters are as beautiful as I have said. However, there is nothing to talk about. And this is a common problem with Swedish action movies. Not just enough moves. Perhaps there may be a budget problem, maybe filmmaking culture. I do not know, but the experience is adversely affected. <br /> <br /> I'm not good enough to be loyal to this movie. <br /> <br /> I rate this at 4/10.
