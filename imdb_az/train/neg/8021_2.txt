The visionary and the director chose to look for the wrong depth to expand the 5-minute field to a 81-minute holiday-festival. <br /> <br /> The moments in this movie are very limited and characters will not even feel. How can you invest in the main hero who is very interested? <br /> <br /> CULTURE AND stylistically, feels like an astonishing dream sequence. Unusual camera work, unusual noises and gaps on the move, and what is a sparse small spider view on the screen? Whoever thinks, should return to the movie school. The film did not have any meaning, only the cheese and the stylist did not work with the rest of the movie (there was such a style in the film that it was a close call). What's the flop?
