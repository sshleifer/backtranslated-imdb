I read some of the comments on the internet about this movie: "The Hardest Hostel then ...", "When the camera is truly cruel, never see the screen ...". But none of them is true. The camera screen never hides because there is no part of the screen. The same scene is repeated one hundred times. Women are lying on a table, killing women several times, killing killing women (you do not see it all during the movie!). The police came and arrested him. The Killer is deceiving the jury. The movie is over. In Germany we say: "Viel LÃ¤rm um Nichts". All this is one of the most boring films I've ever seen. Completely unacceptable.
