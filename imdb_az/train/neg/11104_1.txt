After seeing a movie, I'm not the only one to go online after I decide to call the best movie. If you doubt me, consider my other points of view. But for the first time I saw such a film that I saw something so horrible that I would even say how bad it was before the end. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies. A genius at Ed Wood, I thought Bloody Crime, Jeepers Creepers and the most terrifying horror films were good. But there is nothing I can say about this movie. <br /> <br /> The solution is basically non-existent. <br /> <br /> If a person who reads a review reads his money, they may feel that the evidence is true, but I strongly recommend that nickel be worth more than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br / > <strong> spoil a movie for everyone, but ask everyone to email me for this movie at foxbarking@yahoo.com. <br /> <br /> I can say something. <br /> <br /> I love bad movies and love fears, I love new creative films. I love my porn movies (some of the reviewers were similar to these claims, but obviously they were only Roger Bartin and Hostel 2). <br /> <br /> This is a worthless, stupid and terrifying movie. <br /> <br /> Before looking at this, it's not just the whole House of the Dead, but actually one copy.
