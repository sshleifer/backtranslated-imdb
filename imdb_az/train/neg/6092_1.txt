<br /> <br /> After filming, someone was seriously shocked. <br /> <br /> First of all, this film is completely impossible in 1993. Fashion and music claim it is serious in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> My guess is that it's been a long time before a few terrific distributors took it away and put it before the sudden release. <br /> <br /> There is a plot. Whom. A strange comrade meets a casual boy with a beard, telling her that if he meditates on singing his favorite songs, he can turn into anyone he chooses. At this point, I have to say that the loner's favorite song fell down the London Bridge. Why is this your favorite song? Because it is a righteousness. We're just a minute away from the movie, and the movie has already reached a level of stupidity. <br /> <br /> My wife, I can only accept it, that there are two parts of the film that chooses her nose. Cleared the head. She decides to turn into a girl to approach other girls. And kill it. <br /> <br /> This is a world-wide horror. Every performance in this movie is silent. Actually, I would go so far to say that the player is a pornographic film standard. This is really terrible. The nose-swing selector appears to the audience as a nose-swing selector. Heroes of the film see her as a girlfriend of the London Bridge. People, I feel like a stupid writing by typing it. In any case, this is a strange appearance of a middle-aged, hanging school girl. Not a good way. There is even a wide assemblage of scenes where the nose voter is in school with a girl and plays a song over and over. This is the worst song ever written. I will not even describe it. You will know when you hear it. <br /> <br /> You will agree with me. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes of violence. There is a Benny Hill style follow-up sequence involving a Transsexual. Even the dialogue has an endless effect, which can or may not be taken from Shockey or John Milton, where the rotating voter tells the prostitute, "I have cash." Lovely, I'm sure you will agree. <br /> <br /> Realistic ridiculous.
