Yep .. this is definitely one of the worst MSTeded movies ever, but I have definately seen worse. I think the heroes think R. Probably, I was introduced to some of Rick Sloane's scientific conferences and he was in a strange way! <br /> <br /> He was one of the budget conventions where everything went, everything he had brought. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> It was very cool about my questions and comments about the Habgoblinler and even told me not to come seriously and loved the version of MST3K! <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. I think it was supposed to be as bad as Mars attacks. So I stand up for this movie and I betray all my friends' MSTs by giving them 5. Sorry.
