For beginners, I would like to say that I am an admirer of the American Pie series. <br /> <br /> The best part of the film is, first of all, <br /> <br /> But there are tons of bad things to say about this movie. Above all, the story has a very "arc" structure. First, the introduction of symbols, then the introduction of the beta and finally the Greek Olympics. Each length is 25 minutes. In addition to the general wave of the site, there is little improvement in a feature that leads to a double shout of a bad area. <br /> <br /> Along with this, I did not like stereotyping in this movie. That is, to show the jokes as extremely cool, just like thinking-sex guys and to show them as geeks. Women also show that only sex objects and women want to treat women with sexually transmitted diseases. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the actor was also poor. Perhaps except for Steve Talley. <br /> <br /> So it was a terrible movie if it were to be seen from a terrible perspective. From a teenage perspective, I think it is better, but this film has a degree of 18+ in most countries, so young age groups really do not.
