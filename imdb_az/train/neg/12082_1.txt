Gossip, poor Hamlet. I knew him, dear reader, I tell you, he wants this VERSION! I do not know for whom these people have gathered, but I hope they are proud of themselves. They drew the classic game and turned it into the most boring melodrama that can be imagined. This version is quite bad, because the existence of a great theater like Maximilian Schell can not save it. The only payment quality of this film has created a great feed for "MST3K"; Mike, Servo and Crow were a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> But I'm sure Shakespeare was right to do so, if he had nothing to do with his name. It's good that "Hamlet" is not so bad; it's just bad. Totally terrible.
