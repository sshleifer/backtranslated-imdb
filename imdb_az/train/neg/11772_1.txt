I'll be short ... This film is embarrassed to anyone except the filmmaker. Sexual tourism industry criticism is, in fact, valid until a long-term dance area is cured. The most beloved fan of artistic horror will get nothing from outside. And do not be afraid to say that this movie is a blame for God's love, or that even the strengthening of women is a fairy tale. Because it is not quite clear (lesbianism with childhood, what is hell?). It was the worst film of the Edinburgh Festival (I've seen it all), some of them fell half the film, and probably did not get more. it may seem like a very critical film, but in fact I can not find the indispensable feature of this movie, or you will regard it as a pure comedy. In short, this movie is watched by the best A class cocktail.
