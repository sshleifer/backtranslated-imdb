When I watched this movie after seeing other comments about IMDb, she was convinced that it was a "unique fear film". <br /> <br /> I did not want to love this movie, but I could not. <br /> <br /> "Love story" was good, but the sign of horror was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> If the arrest was about a young man who was in love with a girl who suffered from parasomy, she would have been a better movie. <br /> <br /> The cleanliness center has also increased its reliance on restrictions, in fact it was pretty laughable. The doctor does not see privacy laws and professionalism. A nurse drops out of a room to feed a dangerous patient (without escort safety escort) and leaves the room suddenly and goes out of the trash for no reason. The psychiatrist (and the murderer of the film) is fully dressed - probably for many years? <br /> <br /> I liked some of the detectives in this movie, but I still can not recommend this movie.
