Some funny bits, but Bill came! A movie? Zeitgeist offer? TV Show and interviews, but save a movie? Perhaps I was over-reacted, but an unnecessary provocation film ... I do not know. <br /> <br /> I do not know, I disagree, I agree ... This movie is very mixed and contradictory. <br /> Bill Billy looks like a comedy similar to Hicks. . But, like many comedians, the border between comedy and propaganda can be annoying. I think the main problem in this film is its lack of sensitivity. This can only be a personal taste, but a person who continually breaks the command is unacceptable. Bill is a very emotional reactive against religious fundamentalism. I agree with Bill that religious fanaticism is not logical, it can not answer. This creates unnecessary confusion. We can do something better than just reacting to fundamentalism. It is his summary that we do not know, and he nervously tries to convince that nobody can do anything, which is due to the lack of serious investigations in the comparative religion of the agnostic society. <br /> <br /> In general, he was trying to say that all religious thoughts were unreasonable because he opposed the freedom of religion. <br /> <br /> I'm Zeitgeist, movie. All the astrotological effects that make the impact of all religions simple are hopeless. Zeitgeist has caused many controversy and has violated the validity of most valuable religious scholarship scholarships. It is a pity that no reliable source has been drawn up without reliable sources of information. Astro-mystical sources say everything is said to be "stars" seems to be seen from the Middle Ages. This film is a mixture of mixed "agnostics". <br /> <br /> This film is a clear evidence that postmodernism allows generalization and generalization of key issues in people. history. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie (there are cheerful interviews and bits), but do not act as Bill. If you make any comment on any line, you should not expect anyone to have an adult conversation. His controversial methods are fidelity and insult, more emotional than rational and logical arguments. There must be a better way to deal with these issues.
