As you can see, the most common of Europe, Germany, Hungary and all of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Hitler and Stalin era. Nuremberg (and many trials all over Europe) was the revenge and injustice of the winners. What do you think, why the US, Britain, France and the Soviet Union were tried? USA, UK and so on. There were no war crimes. No Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, Dresden, Hamburg, not Berlin, Katyn? The Germans were war crimes, but justice in Nuremberg was not really taken into account. Main point: Vae victis! Germany must be destroyed! <br /> <br /> This film is a washout of a terrible, complicated American brain full of lies, lies, propaganda, bias and injustice in America. And first of all: double filled. But not surprising ... Why is the Nuremberg process not enough? This movie is a nightmare. 60 years after total darkness! It's darkness (and hatred, narcism and self-criticism) in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so on. The real cause of such massacres. And there's no American war criminals ... Bravo, America! Very clever. Even Stalin would envy it ...
