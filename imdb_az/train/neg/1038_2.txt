Victor Vargas's removal is just a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Maybe Peter Sollett saw that he did not have the money to make the film he wanted, and decided to make it easy. drawing a bad film that betrays the principles of "charming cinematography". Maybe he just knows better. <br /> <br /> What's hard is not it. <br /> <br /> In addition to a few viewpoints that can make a bad film shoot, which can turn into an act of so-called realism. <br /> <br /> I did not know. <br /> Do yourself a favor and go to this movie.
