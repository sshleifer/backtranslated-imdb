Maybe one day the TV will be a pitiful one day. Perhaps the Greatest Stephen's only step, Richard Bachmann, described King's last point. But enough. If I spend a lot of time talking about the serious theme of this film, I'm speculating that the producers hope for this outfit. Day 6. No matter how primitive the film is, it causes discussions on the subject that serves as a promoter of the producers. That's why we should not be accepted. Underwater scandal, the public criticism, is not just a movie, but a video that allows you to produce a speculative, violent film for video sales. <br /> <br /> I did not read books. I do not dare to criticize Stephen King's criticism before reading it, but when I saw the film, I was thinking that he could not shoot such a horrible film from a good book: in the 1980s, typical music and some small actors, Arnold Schwarzenegger finds himself as a police fugitive in a cruel television show. <br /> Together with Predator, this is definitely Schwarzenegger's most stupid movie. 10 to 2 stars.
