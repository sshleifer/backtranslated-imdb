Why was this movie taken? Although there are generous tax concessions from Australian filmmakers, there is no explanation for the progress of this film. For the sake of goodness, the actors starring in this film are Aussie b-grade celebs (actors, such as John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, Hey Hey, the band's original drummer on Saturday and the voice man in Countdown). However, they say that is still very long in the time you give your brain a good deal: the scenario is bad (even for self-admiring horror), and the quality of players and movies is worse. often appear to be a home movie, even if there is a home movie 'realism'. Everyone who is interested in Australian cinema, for God's love, has never been dubbed this movie.
