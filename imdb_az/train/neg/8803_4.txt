I loved "Anchorman, the legend of Ron Burgundy," and he hoped to be laughable, but I had no heart. Some bits are good though. I thought Chomp Kind, the sport guy, who expressed his love for Ron Burgundy in a car full of other members of the newsgroup. Everyone protects him from ignorance and he just sounds higher and louder, and finally Burgundy kisses that are not accepted. But the whole story does not come. But the first film is a noble attempt to rescue unused bits, including the "all excitement" about some of the best betrayers called the "The Alarm Clock." Saturday Night Live is one of the members of Maya Rudolph and there are a few comic lines, but basically this unused landline has a good reason not to use it in the first movie. The disks on this disc are pretty good, the two are best shot with the best comedy, and wrong interpretations with Ferrell and Ferrell revealing the "exec producer" are not part of the movie in any form, form and shape. It reveals that the recording studio is a "single guy" who runs the side door and acts as a manufacturer. It's about 10 or 15 minutes though some pretty funny things
