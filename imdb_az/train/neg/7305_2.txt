The cabin begins as Fever's premises have something like offering. <br /> <br /> Firstly, a group of college graduates in the autumn go to a resort cabin and attack each other with an unprecedented meal. Unfortunately, the first paragraph is any remote element of the film's qualitative suspension. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Cabin Fever college kids are looking for sex, talk about something, talking about nothing and talking about a few F-bombs they can get 1:40 minutes, Children are acting foolishly around everything and react. For example, one sees that the skin is infected with the legs, so what does he do? Shaving his legs off his wounds without taking the necessary medical treatment. The scene is less than general. At another stage, the Rider is shaking hands with a Powerful, "Boy Matching World," a child who just says "Pancakes" and does not want to karate those who sit next to her. I would like to know if you can understand the reason why the "Pancakes" child came in. In any case, the Rider gives a wild dog and goes to the most likely contaminated stream to wash his crushed hand. Another child loves to F-bombs to react to everything around him and shoot the squirrels. Why? <br /> <br /> Rider Strong is ONLY child who has any recognition in this movie. She tries to calm down the shouting and screaming and F *** Y **! bomb thrown around people. When the kids do not scream, they talk about sex or talk, more than any other adult characters that are more strange than children! The drunken police with the best 60 IQs can be one of the worst jobs I've ever seen in a movie. People do not play with a deck, they will not be able to find the dork cards! LOL! I did not say, "Do you want to hang up anymore?" He looks like the geniuses of child players! It seems to me that Rider's story of fear (despite bloody) about a boy who is drowning. Rider, in interviews, said the director had a great deal of respect for Eli Roth. But the problem is, Mr. Roth is shocked and so goes less. There are very bad things about this movie to get any credit for Mr. Roth. I can agree with Rider and wish to find something pleasing about this movie. Perhaps the falling decoration at the beginning? In fact, Rider Strong, this is a MODEL ONLY 1! Hopefully, it was compensated for this meeting!
