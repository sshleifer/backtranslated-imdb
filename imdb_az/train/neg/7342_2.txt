"The At The Attic" is a film created in 1910. Inspired by a true story. Unfortunately, this is an event in which there is no need for truth. <br /> <br /> When looking at the box, people who are responsible for packing the film did their best to make this movie look steamy and erotic. They use terms such as "illegal passion", "prohibited work," and "unrestricted tastes." They even show a picture of Neil Patrick Harris (small Doogie Howser, M.D.) who holds the weapon! <br /> <br /> The story includes Krista, played by Anne Archer. He does not like a gentleman who owns his work. Edward (Harris) is an employee of her husband's company. Krista and Edvard fall in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The film's so-called "shocking" part is that: Christ's husband finds something about this issue and forbids one another to see it again. So what did they decide to do? Krista ended up in the garage of Edwards. Amazing! Wow! Krista begins to see another, and Edwards is extremely jealous. <br /> <br /> The "man in the attic" does not cover a new area. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br />
