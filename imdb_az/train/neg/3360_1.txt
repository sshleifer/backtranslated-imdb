In a non-philosophical book called DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King is a secret to storing scary stories, not to indicate what terrible thing awaits behind your door to get your readers. Finally, the reader was somewhat afraid of opening the door and ten meters in height, but he also thought, "If I do that, I can fix it." <br /> <br /> The director says that the truth is wrong in such a way Jan De Bont has been there for a while or less, so there is nothing hidden or hidden from the other side of the little closed door. "It's a tall legfoot on the leg!" As the film ends, the director cries out CGI bottles, barking, and shouting: "Look, everyone, look, come here! on HUNDRED-foot-long anger! ... And now, here comes a hundred thousand - tall mistakes! <br /> <br /> As film shooters see, special effects could only compensate for all the other shortcomings (and many others) in this attempt, and they do not know and do, and in fact, the effects that are so effective are so striking and modest it's a funny viewer looking at them at a glance - not a story, admiration or anxiety. <br /> <br /> For me, this film's unhappiness is that a statue with a blood flowing out of its mouth, Liam Neeson ( Such as Dr. Marrow) The filmmakers did not know exactly how they looked at this claim, so only Neeson was drowning in a little water, shouting and shaking hands.In the next stage, a good doctor, of course, drowned himself and forget about sensitive events, without losing consciousness. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jackson's novel is a comedy Finding this ridiculous scenario seems to be at a higher and higher level than any of the lower IQ young stoners thinking of scaring people: "Okay, then, come, create the ceiling, you know, look like a creepy face and uh <br /> /> The only saving grace of the LIFE is finally so terrifying that it is actually not funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Owen Wilson <br /> <br /> It is an example of how to make a fear film, which is incorrect, foolishly overly heavyweight, totally unbelievable and full of fancy dialogue and meaningless scenes.
