One of the worst movies I've really seen! Actor, dialogue, manuscript, sound, lighting, plot line. I really can not say anything positive about it, though I love Swedish films. The battle scenes are so ridiculous that it is impossible to accept it seriously. And when a beginner character is dodging bullets in just one strip bar, when I lose his shirt, I'm not sure that I should be a joke or someone who really is a good movie item? Regina Lund is not only a half-century player, but he's laughable to listen and incredible reactions disappear in a flood. Someone is really terrified of something that spends time and money on.
