Wow, a film about NYC policy is written by someone who has never left NYC as it seems. As you know, there is a problem that you expect loans to take at a time and that the movie will last for half an hour. The heroes are very boring, John Cusack's accents are funny, strange and laughing arguments. Horrible film.
