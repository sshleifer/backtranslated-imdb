This is the first time I wrote an article about the IMDb. but for that I have to write. Torture torture for 3 hours. Get the idea that the film will be bad from the start. the actor is miserable. I'm a great admirer of Ajay Devgan (I liked him in bhagat singh), but he's in the worst of this movie. amitabh has worked hard for this, but there is no fear. prashant raj is non-actor. The most disturbing part of the film is the niche cothari. I have no idea what the director has taken in this film. the sequence account is repeated. Anyway, I felt that I was trying to repeat a slack, color theme, backdrop, camera angles, but it did not work. Please DO NOT FOLLOW
