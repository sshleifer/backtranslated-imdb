I just looked to see what this hire and what all the fuss about this movie. Here are my reactions. As it turned out, this is a low budget movie with poor actors. The main area of ​​this film is a woman who wants to take revenge on her aggressors. This concept can easily be a really provocative movie when it's drawn correctly. But the film does not shock or disturb me. It just made me happy. This movie is easily shortened to 45 minutes easily. All scenes are often to fill up time, such as field areas and some scenes described below. <br /> ************ Spoyler ***** ******* I find rape scenes pretty discreet. If you really have such a version, I do not know if I'm watching a cut or unpacked version. I've found many field holes inside the bad writing area. <br /> <br /> We would like to bring you a few days so far. <br /> <br /> I want to convey to you that they do not hate the attackers several times and delay Zenif's difficulty for a long time. Perhaps this is more shocking and worrying. <br /> <br /> I saw that the attackers left her in the woods and returned home. <br /> <br /> At least those aggressors should know that if you want to do a dirty job, they should not be afraid to do the job. Finally, Jennifer did not call the police when merchants were finally released. Especially for a person who is a writer, what should be the first thing that most people do. <br /> <br /> Why did these rapists not discover danger when they saw Jennifer's alive? <br /> <br /> I really like a beautiful lady Camille tree on a man and hang it. ************************ Spoiler finishes ************ <br /> But hey, this movie without its substance not Camille Keaton is spectacular and I have recently returned home and killed Jennifer, "Why am I, why not?
