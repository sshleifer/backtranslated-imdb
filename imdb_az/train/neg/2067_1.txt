Correction Point: The Groove Tube is one of the most flawless, clear and obviously terrifying movies. This "comedy" is remotely even something that remembers the trace of the mind, but it is even something that is inevitable. <br /> <br /> This movie is not even "good" bad or "good". Putting this movie on the same level of entertainment as "Plan 9" or "Robot Monster" is a crime for these films. In fact, films can really be watched and shot. <br /> <br /> But this movie is very bad, very bad, moving and scripted and so incredibly old, there is not just a "camp" or "chocolate" trail. <br /> While this Saturday night was broadcast live, the comparison was probably inevitable. I'm not a big fan of SNL, but this movie is worse than the worst SNL skit you can find. And human beings, it's BAD. Shapiro often shoots in the heart of both of them, just to avoid watching the audience, but weaker tits since 1974 will not excite anyone today. Indeed, this film is very weak and it is a dream that causes sleep. I doubt if anyone would be thrilled in 1974. <br /> <br /> A man named Ken Shapiro drew this movie. By God, with every ten-year-old camcorder, something could have done something more entertaining and more intelligent. It's just unreal - it's a really amazing movie. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie something - the last one, I will not give anything at once. <br /> <br /> Dancing for a fairy tale "I'm jokes" and "gags", "dancing", a guy on the streets of NYC (Shapiro) is the best thing in this horrible movie. Not that the "dance man" was not so big, but there were moments when Shapiro was definitely not smart as he tried to fill his songs for the whole song - but it was really a long wait. Part of this sequence that the police began to dance with the man is the only trace of intelligence in the whole film. Not surprisingly, Shapiro has ended this sequence - though it's not that big, it's just another hit in the movie. Otherwise, this movie is a complete purple, as it is so unforgivable that a real person can be so foolish. The name of this film should be "Ken Shapiro's Craparama". But it is really nice that most talented filmmakers will not be able to get it. But I'll tell the geniuses in NYU that they like this movie. General debris.
