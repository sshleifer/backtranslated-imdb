I was jamming around 10pm, so I watched this movie. And he could not stop laughing. Everything was ridiculous. The kids acted as if they were older than 11 and denied me. One of the children was a ring that was killed three years later. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for younger children (except for the fact that Billy (the main character) is a 5-year-old 'penis'), but not for young people and adults who do not want to spend time.
