Battlestar Gallactica was so great that it had writing, beautiful appearance, perfect actors and exciting stories ... And yes, hot men and women fled inside and outside the form. <br /> <br /> Caprica is just lazy. Lazy writing. Actors take a storm to give them a "character". Open Sequences Disrupting the Sense Of Being Elsewhere (yes, behind the Ford Focus). Lots and very young angst. There are many naked women to confuse (but behind me, I'm sure they will be cut off) and some men's iron figure is a token view. Except for Polly Walker, none of the actors had taken care of me. <br /> <br /> After an hour and a half, I was curious about it. <br /> <br /> So, what do you need to bring me back? Science Fiction? There is a great light on it. Players? There is nothing more interesting here than Polly Walker's. <br /> <br /> <strong> I like BSG. <br /> <br /> <strong> I like BSG. When I heard about Caprica, I doubt and, unfortunately, I think I'm right. In SciFi, I really predict a very short period of time as long as I do not really sharpen their pens and work more on OC than any other planet.
