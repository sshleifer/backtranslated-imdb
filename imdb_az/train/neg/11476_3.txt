I watched this movie on Hallmark Channel recently. <br /> <br /> A US soldier in Afghanistan accepts one of the Christmas cards that a woman is back in the United States. for the new year. He is inspired by the Christmas card and continues to feel that he is happy and happy in his life. When he is allowed, she goes to the city where she lives in the city, misses it, and sees a fun young woman and finally a person who sends a Christmas card. She welcomes her family and decides to take her for a while after her father (a veteran of Vietnam wars) crosses the street when she leaves the car. We learn that a family does not have a back home. The Soldier agrees to help with his family during their Christmas season by working on their entry company. The family likes it and vice versa. The soldier also falls in love with the family of the woman, the Christmas card - the daughter of the family. There is only one problem. He has a serious relationship with a loved one already. This is also a long-distance relationship. My husband is very different from the soldier. He wines wine and great outdoor winters and travels to France. Women prefer the latter. In the rest of the film there is a "love triangle" in which the lover is in the city where her lover visits her for the season. Each family wants their daughter to be with the soldier and her mother wants her best for her daughter. ** (SPOILER ALERT) ** The women are coming closer to each other, and more comes to the soldier. They spend a lot of time together. He gradually gets involved in his personality. Then one day kisses her and kisses her. Now it's so mixed! She loves her lover and wants to marry a day, but she becomes a soldier's love. Soon, her lover (who does not know about a kiss, but she is very protective and thinks she is trying to move on to the soldier) decides and accepts the woman's offer. But the plans of marriage are not her plans. She wants to be at home, to have children, and to be close to her family. She wants to travel the world, go to exotic places, and if she has children, she wants to take them. This is not an exciting woman. However, the soldier does not think bad about what he is doing and does not want to worsen everything. Thus, he decides to leave the city, even though he wants his father to stay with his daughter and to be with her. We know that the Church has not been abandoned by the Christmas Eve service. The companion and the woman speak to each other and decide to go with him and get caught in it, as long as they are broken. The film is about to end with women and soldiers coming together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < She is basically nice and polite, with a strong sense of well-being for others; There are moments that go to the family church and participate in charity reasons; the family takes hand in hand and prays at the table's dinner; the taste and the mother have a long and lasting marriage; <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Soldier slowly and sensitively move on to the woman, and then one man is burning like a kiss; The majority of the family is practically welcoming this behavior - it goes with the Family Church and attends the ministry, but it does. there are some bad languages! Conclusion: I'm disappointed as the movie runs out and it's getting worse. Because I'm fair, I've put the last one in the movie fast. Thus, the film started with a few gimmicks in a worthy way, but it was self-destructive. So I do not recommend this movie to anybody.
