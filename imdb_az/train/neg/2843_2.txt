Oh yes, do not make a goofy, horrible ninja movie, Sakura Killers. But it's also incredibly nice. This is basically due to the awesome presence of a Chuck Connors who bumps in the movie, but is actually just a few scenes. I think Obi Wan should be a type Kenobi type ("hard ninja-buster", a copy of the box), but its "laugh" laughs. "Do not Think" ??? <br /> <br /> But indeed, his two assistants, Sonny and Dennis, call Colonel "Terrible Dialogue" like "Brooklyn", shining in comparison. In particular, they relate Dennis's logic to "genetic association" with Sakura. If you know anything about cloning, you laugh. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a great plot point, nation. <br /> <br /> A strange fun movie, Sakura Killers, is a tough find. Except for a perfect fit for the Saqqura Killers 2, you will not end it for "trickery." Very bad Chuck Connors is dead. :-( Because he has the most effective ways to get away from the ninjas.
