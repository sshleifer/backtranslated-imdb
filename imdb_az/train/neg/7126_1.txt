I would like to say that I heard this dialogue in the movie, but I really do not believe it was very bad. <br /> <br /> In some cases, I was laughing at the best writing and the most difficult thing in human history, a heart attack, and a serious concern over death in the theater. <br /> I'm talking about the scene, the "hero" just looked at his brother's accident, and his brother was driving away from him (hero). <br /> <br /> "Hero" throws a "whistle" that is expected to see something so tragic and people are trying to get out of the burning car. <br /> <br /> In the midst of his whistle, "emotional anguish" - was not it right? Am I crazy?
