This movie was prepared for television, so taking into account that I'm going to be in trouble as I'm going to be a feature film. The scenario is sub-packed, but it does not mean that the spots are soft and humorous. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this movie really hates, its 90-95% of it is that if the movie is shot, it will take 5-10 seconds to shoot at random in random places. There is less contrast because the colors are less lively and the film is 30 frames per second in 24 frames per second. Perhaps, I'm not sure if these scenes are later shot or filmed (so I think), but it's disorienting and really makes the film look clear. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I saw it, but I'm very pleased with this movie and I do not advise anyone to see it.
