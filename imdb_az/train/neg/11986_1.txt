What a horrible post and move. No personality. What can not make a good movie of a character? Hmm, this was done in Castaway with a dialogue. <br /> <br /> This kid is going to see his father. Child, Jason, takes a plane and pilot carries out a heart attack and dies in the middle flight. So the child fell from a lake and survived. <br /> <br /> During that period, the moon fights twice. He fights for the first time in the lake. For the second time, a spear comes from a spike and the bear spears. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Gag.
