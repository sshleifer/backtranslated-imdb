I am a great fan of Randolph Scott, but this is a movie. All this has really canned, fake, noise feelings, with a really scary back-screen forecast. There is a good plot that captivates the screenwriter successfully in a nitwit script, causing the audience to move and to really care about any characters. The director is not on foot and only emphasizes how bad the script is, instead of helping to improve it. I've seen very well-known "noisy production" before, but it's not one of them. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott shines with gum, trim and all the millions of dollars smiling. He is always unpleasant ... even worse than his films. In addition to Scott, the main reason I want to see this movie was because of Ermond Flynn's "Rocky Mountian", Ms. Wymore. The guy behind the gun is so beautiful and you can say that you are a good actress, but he has to say a little loud lines, and the director's obstacle to him was really terrible. I saw Phil Carey in Operation Pacific, and he's playing exactly the same character here ... you want to win unconsciousness in an arrogant pain-in-the-butt. In my opinion, he is a good actor ... he hated me. In my opinion, there are some slavery attempts in the comic relief deprived of the film. Although there are many elements to beat, I must say I really enjoyed the two Spanish songs on my own music ... but do not go seeing Randolph Scott movies? <br /> <br /> Of course, there are Scott films there, and this is undoubtedly unbearable, but it can not be considered as inadequate.
