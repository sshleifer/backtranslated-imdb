I saw this movie in Sundance 2005 and was amazed at how bad it was. It is likely that the two high school students who had documented their high school life were "abusive", that they were badly driven, directed to the poor, and that the writers were not entirely incomplete and generally a bust. I love good movies about high school and this is not one of them. Heroes are one-dimensional and conscious themselves as "cool," although they should be excluded. You get a general impression of a bunch sitting around creating a hanging bad movie to show your friends, but somehow include Sundance. Mystifying.
