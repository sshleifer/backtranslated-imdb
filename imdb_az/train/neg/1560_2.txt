This film, unfortunately, can not be called bad because it is simply mediocre. The absence of any real reason or imagination has definitely reached an absolute limit, and "jokes" (predictable and touched) are wrapped in the length of this nonsense that boredom and yawns are driven to the audience. Another notch reminiscent of John Waters's sad sadness and shocking or amusing us 30 years ago is no longer working the same way. We have seen it before and it does not break any taboos because it's already evaporated. Great miss.
