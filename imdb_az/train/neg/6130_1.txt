In the early 1980's, Kurt Thomas was a hero in the United States. Inevitably, men's position suggests the roles of the film that only exist to benefit others. I had no idea why Thomas did not pay for this movie, but I had to make a great deal of money in the movie to agree to become a national cheating. As is the case with most martial arts films, the film comes out clearly in the "Enter Dragon". Instead of just a real martial art, they create an absurd new martial art, exactly described by a critic as "a cross between Kung Fu and breaking dances." A gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to get rid of a lady's impenetrable castle, but every room has an assistant, Thomas needs to hit auxiliary baddies. Of course, someone else's life goes on and, of course, is a disappointment that ends up in surprise to those who have not seen a treacherous movie. There are touches on the existence of nostalgic species, especially Thomas's mullet hair, and the presence of many male co-stars. But the only reason for watching this movie is that if there is something strange about Kurt Tom, he now asks you not to put any foot on the film.
