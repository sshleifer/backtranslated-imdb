I'm just "if?" I remember the advertisement of the movie since 1968, so it was finally interesting to see it. It might have been an American perspective that did not go to an English public school and miss some social referrals, but I thought the movie was awful. First, as others have mentioned, ballyhooed-takes-almost-all-movie-to-go charges. Otherwise, the final scene is not a rebellion, but a shooting, whatever happens, whether real or imagined. <br /> <br /> I know that filing a film about future events may be a bad form, but here's no reason to avoid it. One person wrote a post board asking him not to compare the end of the film to the events at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But on the one hand there is a difference between Klebold, Harris and Cho and Travis (Malcom McDowell), and I can not see it simply. <br /> <br /> <br /> Even in a school they despise so much? They are either adults or close to them. They are not in military custody, but also a better British movie, as is the song "The Hill". No one has to force them to go to college and beat the whip, except for ambitious parents who need to wake up in relation to their son's nature. I had the opportunity to join a brother in college, with the exception of foolish, brutal decisions made by criminals who claim to be my "brothers". <br /> <br /> If Travis imitates Lenin's second visit (if she's hanging out of the picture) she will have the unity of voters and her job for Michael Foot in the next election. If he wants to be Jack Kerouac, set off and start typing. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the reviewers should be like the person who responded to the scene in "Last Tango Paris", and Brando Mopes had to go on a date with a cow in the mopeds. In a real world, a man says that a listener says, "Why do not you disassemble? Change your shoes?" - Do not allow unusual characters to feel self-esteem, since they do not have an overall alternative course of action. So here it is.
