Ever since you've met a movie-loving universe named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" automatically comes with blood-filled horror pictures and non-stop actors. Now, as we know, it is safe to say that the Night of Living Dead is a zombie film. However, at the earliest age, the film used only the slow, almost immobile-psychological excitement in the foundation of the corporeal corpses. Jacques Turneurun is a perfect example of "I've traveled with a Zombie" and Bela Lugosi is "White Zombie". This "zombie rebellion" could have been another example, but unfortunately, it is one of the most grueling films I have ever seen and failed on the entire line. A scenario that operates up to very bad, and a lack of atmosphere and tension! The film lasts just 65 minutes and is still spent for the first half hour to unexciting the intrigues and monologues of a totally stupid love story. The situation in the legendary Cambodian Angkora, undoubtedly, led to a more seductive story, but all the weights we see. The main actress (Dorothy Stone, curly hair scalps and ugly nose skin) made me very angry and did not go anywhere to burn her from a predatory song. Again, unlucky. If you are struggling to control yourself with a 60-minute minute, you will be rewarded with a decent finish. Still, this film is too small to give a positive assessment. Avoid! This is just what you need to see when you see everything.
