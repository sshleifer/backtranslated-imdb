Watching this alleged Reality show shows how bad the Professional Police officers are on Television. I only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that led to a probable cause leads to conditions for "stopping" and then "down" at the edge of the "clothes", then why the official went to his pocket and left the scene illegally, , in most cases, imprisonment, even when a teacher admits. An order from a radio receiver does not constitute the actual availability of the order unless the sender has the original authority. If the dispatcher is written on a computer, it is good enough to arrest, but this command is still valid. I have not seen a single contender from CBS (CBS), CBS may be in trouble.
