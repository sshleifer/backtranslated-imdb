without romanticism, dramatic drama (or drama) without feeling it .... All of this movie should be this one, and it does not seem to work. Otherwise, the director / editor / script writer really works. Players need the better they need - better support. <br /> <br /> An indispensable element is George Delarue's account. Beautiful and moving. How embarrassing was this movie. Synchronize and enhance players' words and actions and music effects in a good movie. This editor has been tricked into music in terms of dialogue and action. The scene of love is particularly dear to this: it is an insult to the talents of leading actors. <br /> <br /> There is another element in the film: space photography. Especially for a moment at the Grand Central Station. I knew in advance what would happen; <br /> <br /> Some commentators in this body have pointed out that American criminals have alleged US assimilation in MacCarthy's horrifying years. The film begins to seriously look at the American society, but the habit becomes romantic; <br /> <br /> As the film insulted the talents of actors, it insults (and fails) the problems they face. <br /> <br /> You are warning.
