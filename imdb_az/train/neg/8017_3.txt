Actually, I did not finish the movie. You can say that in this case, I have the right to consider it particularly negatively. But I'm doing it, because I could not watch it because I stopped it ... I bought more than half and I was there just to make sure I was a good thing around the corner. This movie is very tedious, as I was actually insulted. I have not read many other analyzes, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexuals in this genus, but homosexuals and "similar" verses, daytime dreams, issues, and so on. Maybe I felt that this movie might go somewhere, perhaps it was two minutes, I felt that it could be a complexity or a sense of relativity, but these hopes were twisted when it came to the next cliché. I want to say that the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you are unable to hear buzzing games, or if you can only read it echoes-f falls, because they are foolish to make you very painful / ridiculous. I gave the star three stars, and all of these stars will go to the movie theater, which has a fantastic job wanting to turn Archer's tired "concepts" into something that can be traced. If you take into account that, TV has decided to include all the long shootings of loved ones ... One now unnecessary cliché in films like Korine's Gummo ... I think this movie is extremely premyashed in Sundance (only Archer joins the festival because it was in this way ...), because Sundance seems to be a festival that is still considered as an "arthouse". No, this is not a craft house, I'm afraid it's just a flat house. Tracking.
