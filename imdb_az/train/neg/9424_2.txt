It was nice to watch. Frank puts all his dreams on the back hinges and takes his normal job (digging!) Because he can only go to the movie school, but his son decides to take a humiliating documentary about him. The documentary filmmaker must show the camera and just have to shoot, manipulate, and comment on the snap headlines. The kinematograph is painful and lazy towards his stepfather. And sad. According to Frank, Frank is nicknamed and miserable, but he is the most people in the three. <br /> <br /> In fact, a smear campaign is much more intelligent than reality. She did not like me for filmmakers.
