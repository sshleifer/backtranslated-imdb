The main flaws in the film are its scenario. Bettie's story is back and forth between vignettes and re-creation of Klaw's short films. Although Klaw is a good reconstruction, it does not need to be fully rebuilt. Page Richards, though not an incredible actress, makes a decent job. And sometimes, it looks like a beautiful one for Bettie. It is also important to pay attention to the separate information. Clothing and clothing are well-built, as in a certain direction. Sets are generally rare and stage-by-feel, but they feel their cycle. Sometimes it is strikingly well-lit and the color palette has been clearly thought out to give you a lively, retro feeling.
