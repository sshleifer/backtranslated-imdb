This is a dream story. This is a story of cannibalism. This is a story of revenge. It's a very dirty film too. I guess it comes cheap along the lines of every slasher you see. It goes straight to the isolated place, to bare camps, to the desert. Of course, there is a very intense scene. It is very boring. Bad editing and all works. There are children who are talking like a chatter on a trash can. I'm not really sure what kind of spirits and psychos play with the seed tissue. It is also a phenomenon that a person may have left a piece of meat, perhaps by his wife. At one time, a friend asked me why it was necessary to show such unequal, patient severity. I'm afraid this is another step in our desensitized evolution. There is no foolishness here, no loss of language on the cheek, just a waste of time. Many Bloods; small area.
