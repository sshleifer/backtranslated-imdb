This movie is really terrible. 84 minutes of terrible life as it is. Special effects are terrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Blood Surfing , while walking around the shark, 31 feet of crocodile cut off the holiday there is a terrible mistake. Sharks do not look real. Crocodiles are worse and worse when they escape from the creature, but the crocodile stuck and the two women flash it. Deaths are counterfeit and bandits will just fill their time. <br /> <br /> It is not worth seeing a terrible movie!
