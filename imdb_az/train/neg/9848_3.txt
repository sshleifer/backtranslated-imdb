There are some great nigrim / neorealist visuals in this movie and explain a story released from Hollywood's sugarcoverings. It was actually possible because it was an independent foreign film. However, some scenes continue for a long time (especially at the wedding) and I've found an exaggerated actor and an inexplicable dialogue so you're more appropriate to the stage than the silver screen. <br /> <br /> Dialogue was especially noticeable and deteriorating as the film continued. The majority of cartoonists were Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the 1920s, but their dialogue did not use lines in a Shakespeare game when mixing cement and pouring bricks. In the end, filmmakers were laughing, not because they wanted me. I think that stylted poetry can be defended by saying that the heroes are in Italian and that it is a definite translation of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Another dialogue of news made me laugh for a different reason: the son of a native of New York born in the 1920s, the son of the main character is suddenly a beautiful lilting English accent. <br /> <br /> I'm giving this movie "A" for effort and intentions, but it's pretty low for performance.
