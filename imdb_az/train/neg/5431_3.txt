This is your typical Priyadarshan movie - a bunch of weak characters on a malicious mission. His signature shoots all the cast of the film and fights against each other against hidden money. Malamaal Weekly earned a lottery tickets, black money at Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri and so on. It is expected that the director will be able to report ridiculously in advance. Do not take me wrong; Clich√© can be like a sad movie, I usually end the pleasure of comedy. But in most of the previous films, there was a really good humor (Hungama and Hera Pheri are noteworthy). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Tanushree Datta looks awesome. Rajpal Yadav is annoying and Tusshar is not very good. Kunal Khemu is good and Sharman Joshi is good.
