This yesterday IFC was caught and I do not believe in positive comments! Am I the only one who thinks these "ladies" are something? Kate said he could be fired by the society because he had to be a column, but he put it for him! Then they decided that they were all in love? And he is far above his death, can not go to his funeral, and say to his lesser "good news"! By the way, how did you become to become the head of a very fitting English school in America? Janine was powerless to abuse power, but nothing happened! And wind it with a twist he brought in for questioning! And less on Molly, he said better! <br /> <br /> When it comes to Janine and Molly's fault, please feel over Jed! The mistake of the punk's crap, it turned into a pocketbook! Where do the guilty ones on the weak Gerald escape? I could have been just like the bazaars behind this "movie"!
