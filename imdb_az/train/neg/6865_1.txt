This movie was very funny. However, he could not. The field is a standard, it's a terrific move (the player who supported the defective neighbor and his friend was a better player). <br /> <br /> Kathy's other actor was just charming because I could not decide whether she was killed or not. it was the result of a bad operation or just a bad action (both I decided). This prevents you from commenting on the script, which was terribly scary. Each character in the movie is Pat's words, deceptive decisions, and flawless foolishness. Perhaps this is such a jolly thing; I dont know. I could only see how bad it was. <br /> <br /> In general, it was a very bad, cheap movie. The imaginations did not move with the same scenes (a house, a building), no artwork, or a true garden; as in the worst case scenes of casual action. A scene of discovery could be drawn by any young boy in a warehouse or an old school: weakly shot, cheap props, minimal movement .... and I still wanted to see the end. Go to the number.
