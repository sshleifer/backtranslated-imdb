This film was a mess. It was the worst thing I ever saw. <br /> <br /> The writer was not at the end of a scene he wanted to go for commercial purposes and the writer added a second black screen to the writer's dreams. <br /> <br /> Under the ugly direction and edited, a good glimmer of something. Good idea, attractive spark. But somewhere in the wrong place. <br /> <br /> The story is about a psychic priest who wants to solve a murder murder. The first thing that is difficult to enter is Richard Grieco as a priest. The good part does not require him to be a good priest, and he succeeds well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper, like a naked bad guy. He always plays naked bad guy. Very ho hum. Oh, an idea happened to me that all the charming, terrible editorials and the dismantled area felt confusion (Grieco). And they simply reiterated their credit repayment to prove that they were sentenced. Not a good sign for any movie. <br /> <br />
