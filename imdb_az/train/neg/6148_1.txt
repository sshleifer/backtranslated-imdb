First, the film did not fit the truth. A few days ago I saw a documentary and the movie was not like that. First of all, Gary was a genius in mathematics, and this is not a story about a person who treats the film and eventually finds love. There are also many scenes that are straightforward - the scene on a camping bicycle did not take place during the early years of the university. In my opinion, Russell Crowe did not fit into this section because it did not look smart / personalized, so it could not really play a game. It would be more to pay attention to figures (like Pi) and not a very dramatized lovelife. At this level, ABM was very handsome and very nice to be Hollywood-ish. Personally, he is not crazy and paranoid and has something to do, because he has to know more than the quality of the "less deadly" people. 5/10
