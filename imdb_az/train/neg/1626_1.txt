This movie has recently appeared on a local TV in South Africa, and I thought I would warn those watching bad movies of B grade (which I did) not even that funny. The section is linked to a few who visit a home in the country. Some foreigners emerge and ... The problem is that most of the film was shot in the early 70's, with extreme extensive pictures of people who are browsing from A to B in real-time and very slowly. Excessive and anticipated blood and gore payouts never happen. I'm really excited - how many people really watched it from beginning to end?
