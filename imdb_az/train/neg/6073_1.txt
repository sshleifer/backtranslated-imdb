* THIS CONTENTS MANY CONTENTS * This movie was terrible. I'm a great baseball fan, I thought I was looking at it and I was very disappointed. He could not help. He was hoping to be a better father in the film or something when he saw the bad effect of DeNiro's younger son. In any case, he had to be the hero of DeNiro at first. He was the only one who believed in Bobby and his favorite son was that he had a reason to feel bad for me. He talked to Primo and wanted to help Bobbi talk. When he did not get out of the deadly way to kill Primo ... "I do not want to!" <br /> <br /> Then, DeNiro said he hoped the film would end up when Bobby rescued her son from drowning. He could have forgiven himself for killing his son, Bobby, if he saved his son. Of course, it is far from the depth of the movie because he earns CREDIT for all the crimes he is interested in, and Bobby stealing his son, his car and his dog - Bobby is forced to flee to just one house. <br /> <br /> Now we are completely unrealistic We are beaten like hell and we invite you. It is expected that the game will not be called. DeNiro appears in a magistrable field in a jury's suit and calls Bobby out of the house and stabs her knife and stabs everyone on the pitch. There is no officer in the field (but the police continues on the road), so DeNiro throws it to the mound and prepares to take Bobby a knife and he is killed. <br /> <br /> This film is being shot in one of the few films. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; It's not about a fan, as we know, fans are not the psychopaths who threaten, robbing, and escape from those who love knives ... This is the most difficult movie I've ever seen in my life, The film has no purpose, and I'm telling you not to waste your time with these abusive excuses for a movie.
