Jason Lee does his best to entertain a fool, but the film does not have a single connection. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the character of Julia Stiles seems strange as soon as the brother and caring. <br /> <br /> Maybe he and Selma Blair's characters were raised in the opposite direction. (She is more attractive than Selma Blair Julia). <br /> <br /> In either case, this is not really another important role of Hollywood in a real world <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <strong>. So instead of getting a successful festival (ie Animal House or American Pie), we're staying with the middle part of the party's humor and mid-section (ala Meatballs 2 or something).
