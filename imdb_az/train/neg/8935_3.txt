Rarely since 1970, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has become a word for cinematic errors in legendary proportions. Finally, it's not hard to win a large audience when it comes out on the DVD for an unexpectedly prepared first time. <br /> <br /> Gore Vidal's best seller of 1968 was a dark satiric statement. Most filmmakers thought that they would not translate the story, structure, and overall tone of the novel and the industrialists were surprised when they launched the Vidal to fit the novel in addition to earning the Fox rights of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Adaptation of the screw was repeatedly rejected and the original writer director Mike Sar was brought to the screen. The headmaster hopes Sarni will enter the youth market. we have seen it as a target for the film, but it has proven that they have heard much more material than the Sarne heads. Re-typed for rewriting. Casting, the perception of disaster has become increasingly widespread. In his DVD discourse, Raquel Welch says that Myra's motives were rarely absorbed from the stage or even on the stage, and everyone seemed to have a completely different film. In addition to the "Back to the Story" documentary, Rex Reed, MYRA BRECKINRIDGE, said he was a film prepared by a group of people hiding in the locker room while waiting for his lawyers to recall their call. <br /> <br /> The truth of these comments was shown by the film itself. The story of Vidal's story has some basics, but the story is not something that is more widespread, but itself. Everything runs in many directions, nothing is closed, and many scenes can cause logic to the previous scenes. Director Sarna has repeatedly commented on the film's desire to make a pure speculation, but only laughter comes about by accident. <br /> <br /> The head of these accidents is Mae West. True, the West has been unexpectedly well-preserved and has not lost its way in one way - but when it comes to its seventy-year-olds and it still concludes that the shoe leather is the most intimidating, at least to say the least. But the worse is indeed the West's era. <br /> <br /> The film, which seeks to transform itself into a hip and a person, is one of the most embarrassing cartoons in the film. <br /> <br /> The remainder of the remaining stones are largely spent. Raquel Welch plays a major role in the role of Myra and is a Barbie puppet in steroids; Non-actor Rex Reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of Myron, but the whole role is insignificant. Only John Huston and community actor John Carradine, Jim Backus, William Hopper, and Andy Devine appear to be wound up relatively unwanted. Yes, everyone involved in the movie is truth: fear of scare: fast, slower, fast, fast-moving, unfounded. Director Sarne has an accidental inspiration - this is not the way Shirley Temple uses Judge Garland as heroes 'use of movie clips, but Sarne's choice. <br /> <br /> Sara' and how was it clear? Sarne did not like the novel, or it was a topic in general. He did not want to write a script, but he needed money; he did not want to go to the film, but he needed money. Author Gore Vidal and Rex Reed (at one point he says Reed "is not a beautiful man") and today Vidal and Reed think that he is trying to sabotage the film did not invite himself to the 'homosexual agenda'. When it came to the right, Sarne had a desire to draw Vidal's novel rather than a strange fantasy shot on her. <br /> Although Sarne, a filmmaker for a gay viewer, has been mistakenly exposed by homosexuals, despite the fact that the movie spends a fair comment, expressing admiration for the film's gay community. When filmed with the film itself, Sarne appears to be a bit homophobia and is clearly the worst choice of writers and directors for this project. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The difference between the two is that the last scene in the "restore" version is black and white. The corrections made in the film were not released in general, but what was the documentary. The widescreen transmission of both is pretty good and the sound is pretty good. But the film is most interested in filmmakers, movie enthusiasts and cult movie fans, to finish the place I've just started. <br /> <strong> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
