Given the filmmaker's history, it's hard to believe that it's a painful movie to sit on. Last night I became a European premiere and one of the executives was there. The film has not yet been seen, the boy was a surprise. I have read the essence of this book, or know how much it is appreciated or appreciated, but I have read Captain Correlli's Mandolini and how fit he is on the screen and how bad it is. I think it's just something like that. Farrell had several pairs of eyebrows. Honestly, I do not think the film is so small for any character. Events are played on the screen in no space sequence. One part of Donald Sutherland is a place where he opens a door, tells something and closes it again. He looked at me when I was not inclined to dialogue on the screen. I did not go to a movie, but I tried to start this process. I gave this movie a '2' because of the seemingly grave reasons for me, but this is the best thing I can say about this movie. Firstly, I love the whole scene very short, and second, Salma Hayek looked bare and beautiful. I can say a little about this movie. Do not ask for anything from dust, it can not speak!
