Now I've seen this movie twice and I'm glad to see it twice. It's fast paced and entertaining, but ultimately daft. Samir said he had the right to be thrown out of the original because he managed to be a good pursuit. Massive deficiencies in films are open to those who have a terrible "Zombie Creeping Flesh", which can be owed to Bruno Mattei and may be owed to the insignificant little Fulchy on this subject. <br /> <br /> The film's shooting continues for several days. <br /> <br /> The film's shooting continues for several days. "secretly" by a scientist, is a secret that is more hidden than the potential apocalyptic effect of humanity in some places in south-eastern Asia. Virus, like the behavior of those affected, causes zombies and the virus spreads to a richly-populated area. Our heroes are in an exciting danger zone and are forced to fight against the infected Asians. <br /> <br /> The film was shot in half by a zombie whistle, the adventure of action and this confusion was most clearly captured by the zombies themselves. They do not seem to have some features for everyone. Some are genuine and likely to be regular mood disorders in the creation of Fulci. The other major group consists of those who have lost all their senses in infected with the virus, but who wish to have a wild aggression and a black belt in ninjitsu: They seem to be a massive tickle festival with their outstanding circular technique or their brothers. Martial arts skills are not their only potential; they are well-educated in guerrilla tactics, hiding under the grass and pony bullets, and sometimes they fall into the skies themselves, not from anywhere. <br /> <br /> There are also some allies. This type of appearance also keeps a sense of irony 'I'm really thirsty ... FOR BLOOD.' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The ridiculous twisting of milling zombie, which continues to advertise the fate of mankind, and to eliminate any hopes of a serious resolution. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <strong> It is dimmed as you expect. But his difficult comic dialogue and dubbing really do not let us get into trouble. By saying that death is the first soldier, he has given a strikingly powerful image of an unbearable zombie threat. Indeed, this is one of the only effective scenes in the film that we shot in a real zombie aggression and perhaps only a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The head scientist is in the heart, but uses no interruption. Scientists are totally unsatisfactory on the screen trying to find an antidote - they now put together these two molecules! <br /> <br /> But only a few minutes are really effective. At an early stage, a woman hero examines an abandoned garage. After entering a room, we encounter an impressive appearance on the corner and a flawless appearance on the ground that an acne mass is fired at atmospheric light. Silence, thrilling handicapping that cut into zapping with a machete that quickly touches everything. Her aggression is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. Before and after the episode took place at the earliest stage of the episode, and then moved to the hotel as a shelter for our heroes, filled with damp air. One of the soldiers has a scene in which they approach a room carefully, and this is undoubtedly a horde of violence, and this is quite intense. Things are more dramatic when driving in the hotel without knowing what's happening overlapping. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify; "> is more than just a movie and a bad movie. If nothing else, there are a lot of unexpected laughter expected from Italy and Qoryan in the eighties.
