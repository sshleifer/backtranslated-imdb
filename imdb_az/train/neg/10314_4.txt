As someone who loves exploration scenes and is interested in this exciting life story, I was optimistic about this movie, but it was a great obstacle to having a very good story. <br /> <br /> I am not a fan of Robert Duvall and many characters he plays, but his role here is a boring, as an insurance investigator. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is insipid and quite a Kathryn Harrold real trash mouth. As I read, there are a few directors who replace each other in this movie, and that's too bad. You can tell the story is not true. Also, I did not get involved in the description of Treat Williams' Cooper. She was interested, but not in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a sad statement that a person committing a crime is some kind of "national hero". <br /> <br /> Nothing was disappointing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would like to see that this movie is being re-created and well-developed because it's a beautiful story.
