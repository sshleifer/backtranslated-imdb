This was the worst horror film I ever had to see. I remember watching the video before watching and thinking that I loved it for some strange reasons. Well, like a righteous man, I ran to get a DVD after being released ... what a tragic mistake! It's too transparent, and I'm not going to be bothered to get in. I'm an admirer of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm accustomed to cheating and bad behavior, but these people bring it to a different level. Almost deliberately trying to make the worst movie humanly possible ... if it were their purpose, they were lucky. They have failed to scare you or to shoot a movie you have to believe in any form, shape, or shape ... COOPERATION! Take this movie ... read the plot summary and see it!
