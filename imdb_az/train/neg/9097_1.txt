Indeed, who created this jacket, this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life - the loss of money and time. I hate D-Lister actors and low-budget sequences that give a story similar to the first one. <br /> <br /> I film this movie next to Wild Things 2 and will <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> -to-video production was actually a half-decent film, I have to be, because I thought that most of the people you see in this movie think of a RED BUT!
