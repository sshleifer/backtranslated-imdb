This movie contains no humor for anyone living with a family member with a mental illness. Some scenes remind me of the timeline of my life experiences. It was the version of a film called "Daddy's Daughter". Graphically and accurately describes the lives of many children of a bad-minded family. This shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to be disrupted and behave as if they were God. <br /> <br /> Someone said that I was funny. I tell you in no way! The best is the patient. <br /> <br /> My son and I have to leave the room, which is extremely intense and exciting. We do not believe that this film really does not understand the best use of mental illness or that the family really did.
