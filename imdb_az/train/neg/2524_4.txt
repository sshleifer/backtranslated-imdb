Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stewart Gordon <br /> <br /> Round: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo. Review: Stuart Gordon has a little way out here, combining with extremely horror horror films like Re-Animator, Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak, and made a little fantastic flick. <br /> <br /> Because this is a very low budget scandal, it emphasizes the word "small" and its basic weakness lies. <br /> <br /> The story is going to happen in the future. It is a world that is battling gladiator style battles with military robots, not by a different world war, due to the great super powers (according to the US and Russia according to this film). Our hero must oppose the evil Russian robot, called Axilles Alexander. <br /> Yes, the idea is not surprising to me. Great nations who have resolved territorial disputes with huge giant robots? The initial budget could be one of the most interesting and advanced. Unfortunately, it would be embarrassing for another great filmmaker to have a fun movie. <br /> <br /> As a child I love this movie and if I want this movie to be a pleasure, we have to go back to the small child mode to have some fun with her. I brought this movie to some of my friends and asked my friends like "hell what is this crap frank?" As developed. This movie is also a movie by my favorite filmmaker Stuart Gordon. "But since the film has grown in the cornice area, I've almost felt like a stopping stroke and have never been tortured. <br /> <br /> Because I love this movie as a child, there is still some nostalgia, <br /> <br /> I myself also knew that this is really good. First of all, the film touches the hell on giant robots and has some damn good special effects to work on it to get it safe. Unfortunately, from a small-scale company (Empire Pictures has gone bankrupt after it has gone out), the effects just help them giggle and laugh, and kits and ornaments are not finished or half a century now. and that he was watching a mix of an extraordinary stop animation and miniature that could give the movie a shot Even robots have great robots that come from hell, and there are certain scenes when robots are very cool, and I've been told, "Why did they like me for a movie that loves me?" But everyone knows and some of them know that some of the bad effects are from the protective little cats you're trying to hide will correct it. And the realization of this film is not only in line with its principle. <br /> <br /> Some things have made me worry about the movie. This movie is mainly a movie for children. You know, giant robots pour it out? Stop motion animation? Hi But the dialogue between these films was a lot of sexual identity and violence was a bit bloody. I asked myself if it was not a child's movie, was it? After a while, I decided that I was basically a kid's movie with adult sensitivity. <br /> <br /> So, if you do not feel loyal, there is a childhood charm that follows two robots that fight each other, and if the movie does not have a nostalgic connection, the good Id offers to stay away from this one. Gordones were a great director, but this movie did not do it for me. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
