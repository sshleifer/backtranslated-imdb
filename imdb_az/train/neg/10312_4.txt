Like the approximately 10 years old, I liked the philosophy of "love of all conquest" of the 70s Sitcom "Bridget Loves Bernie". David Doyle, a Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and Catholic School Teacher (Meredith Baxter) and both parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents), David Doyle, Parents of Audra Lindley and Bridgetin) have problems with it. <br /> <br /> Now, while looking at the show with personal experience, I'm surprised that the show has succeeded even if it's a high season. A few years after the show was canceled, it was a very lightweight, superficial comedy, smashed by a veteran television writer, Bernard Slade, a few years after writing "The Clock, Next Year," "Bridget Loves Bernie". <br /> <br /> He did not deny the real life chemistry between Birney and Baxter. However, in the following years, both actors have shown that they play a more positive role in other projects (Birni, short in the role of Baxter in "St elvin elsewhere" and "Family" and "Family ties"). <br /> <br /> The show has officially featured on Saturday nights between two power plants in CBS. : "All of the Family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both of these shows were clever, funny, and quite a disadvantageous (last, last) show of interest to the situation and characters. <br /> <br /> "Bridget Berni Loves" is not very clever and there are only a few settlers. <br /> <br /> This is another example of a show that I really do not remember.
