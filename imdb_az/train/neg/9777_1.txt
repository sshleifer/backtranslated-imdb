It is interesting to see how Hubert coined Shelby's brutal novel. I thought that with such a rich character, strange situations and social criticism, such a deeply literal piece could not be turned into a bad movie. <br /> <br /> This is a terrific movie experience, not for flicker content. Director Ulrich Edel, with my sincere impressions, realizes a terrible directorship that is not fair to the original book. No Edel TV director; this movie looks and feels like a bad "made for TV" flick. Some of my ideas about this bomb (spoiler before): <br /> <br /> - The lack of directive creativity. The scenes are slow, slow, look weak, and only move from an anchored position. Only in the field of freedom of the cinematography, with a beautiful dark tone. In addition, the film has the same technical creativity as the same TV soap. <br /> <br /> - All actors are doing very well to reflect these painful characters. The issue is that adaptation does not solve the key element in the field development: MOTIVATION. All these characters behave like robots, without a clear motivation for their actions. They work in blue as robots, without any reason. <br /> <br /> Edel avoids every opportunity to explore the character's motive and enrich its characteristic development, avoiding the full development of each character's personality. <br /> <br /> This is the lack of character development in Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight is doing a great job of playing this naked whore, but his decision to sailors violated him due to alcohol. It seems very stupid to see this character doing it in the blue. This is a clear example of weak character development. <br /> <br /> There are also many mid-range characters in the movie that do nothing, nothing that does not feel anything and adds nothing to the plot. For example, I would like to learn more about Harry's wife and wish to have a relationship between the two. <br /> <br /> Edil treats Harry only with character development and his gay lover, not just to clarify, but merely to end her - she is loyal to her motivation. <br /> <br /> The clock soundtrack is one of the worst I've ever had. A terrible job by Mark Knopfler. I expected more than the oldest leader of Straits, but this film does not seriously consider her job. At one time, the music was completely cut off, just as in the battle between the union workers and the police. It also feels totally weak and anachronistic; All the soundtrack can be sworn in with a Casio toy keyboard. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have not seen this. <br /> <br /> That's why it's very important for me. this film can not even invite a Shelby fan, because it can destroy its original book. It shows a very unwanted effort and little creativity to adapt the novel.
