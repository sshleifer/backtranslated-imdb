Dear Mr. Jerry, it might be the secret king of the debate, but the movies are a totally different ball game and it goes out of the league. The form of this film was very sad and it was incredible that Michael Dudikoff (80th B'movie King), Michael Jai White ("Spawn" on the Sci Fi Flop), and William MacNamara only half of it is funny!) Stoop down so much for employment. If you are an admirer of Jerry, this is to stay loyal to the TV show because it's an hour and a half. After finishing this job, I was able to watch the last half-hour Rocky 5 on the TV, as it seems to be kinematics, I think it's too much! <br /> <br />
