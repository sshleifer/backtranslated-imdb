I felt like watching this movie for thousands of times. This could not be predicted totally. The story was a little wobbled every time, and when I waited for something that had happened every time, I did not see anything but awaited. "As the bakery did not have enough bread, it opened another object." In two words: a flat story that turned out to be a clich√©, a bad act, a bad impression ... Only the bad guy, Russian police, Vlad was a little laugh when punishing bad guys. The stack of muscles was incredibly STUPID, laughed at me for a moment. Why am I ashamed of this movie that I am surprised that I will spend my time ... This will not deteriorate (because it is impossible): D
