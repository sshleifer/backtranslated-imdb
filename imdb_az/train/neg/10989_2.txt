* Caution - Although there is no terrain spoiler ahead, but movie spoilers ... * My other important others would be a terrific romantic with all the strange stars, this is for me. Wow - very, very wrong. This film is an unfounded, unfounded and very sensitive excuse to post a movie 15 years after the film is shot! The copyright history in the box has been pointed out that the first time since 2005, when I look at the clothes and hairstyle of the early 1960s, girls have dresses and hair shirts in the early sixties especially in the early '80s. The rest of the film appeared as if it were shot 15 to 20 years ago! I tried to give myself comfort, and therefore I should look old, but 80's from the 1960's, and even the 80's trying to be in the 60s of the 20th century ... and then a mature startling comrade came out and he , may seem like a guy shown in the flashback sequence (a different, more elderly character that has yet to be shown by youth on flashbacks). It was completely mixed up until I saw the special features of the short film - in 1990, it was all flashback sequences taken as a full-featured student film of the same title! He also commented on the growing young boy (and the one who works on the stage in 2005). So this is a story that touches an old, re-painted student film that has been set as an excuse to go up to only one theater season. The 2005 marble story promises a deceased person who has lost his spouse and dancing in the dance class and who will take part in her dance floor at the beginning of the sixties to give her daughter "the fifth day of the fifth year of the new millennium - in 2005 an excuse to draw segments around the old film "). It could have been new scenes and plot. The new movie is OK, except for a terrific, over-sentimental repetition of every new scene and clich√© movement that penetrates. Do not worry. The reason why you have not heard anything about this movie is the famous player - it's terrible.
