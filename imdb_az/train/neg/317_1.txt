It was the worst movie you ever tried to follow. In the first 15 minutes, there was nothing to keep my interest in this movie. At that time I was on vacation and had only a lot of time devoted to a fun movie. <br /> <br /> If you were like Adam Sandler, it's not like any other movie. It started with a bad start and became even worse. <br /> <br /> I was watching some movies, some of them were not interested in me. But if you decide to spend time in this movie, I have not warned you.
