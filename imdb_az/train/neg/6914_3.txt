I dropped this movie a bit (while working on a trailer for the movie production company) and that was terrible. Hewitt's best mediocre, Hopkins phones appear to be bored (and still stretch Hewitt on their scenes) and Alec is bored. In this regard, I trust you should avoid this disease if this film is never released. The blanket continues as long as it reaches a snail speed. Sadly unfinny, wrapped in cinematography and on a pedestrian walk. Alec Baldwin should go to the movie school if he is planning to go back. In terms of its functioning, its character is not entirely difficult, so it is impossible to break its roots. Dan Ackroyd is very comical and the striking appearance of the jury near the end of the movie is cute, but this movie is simply terrible.
