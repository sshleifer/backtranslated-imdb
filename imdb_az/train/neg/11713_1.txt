Only a warning ... This is the worst movie I have ever seen ... I could not watch it until the end ... It was a good time loss ... in such a film. There is not much to say about that. Horrible action, incredible bad lines, story, everything. The only reason I recommend to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie is. To tell a scene: the police are looking for Snipes and they are surrounded by helicopters and cars, they are firing in the building, but Snipes still whisper to avoid being questioned.
