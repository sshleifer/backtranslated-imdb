This movie is a pure failure. I'm a fan of Steve Martin, but he can not even keep his fatigued ideas and swiss cheese scripts. Think of "Police Academy 7" and apply it to military parody. Yuck. <br /> <br /> I do not feel that other user comments do not reflect this poor (and rightly deserved) rating. It is very deceptive. I often celebrated this movie at $ 3.00 at a grocery store and now I know why. <br /> <br /> If I can just get back in 90 minutes ...
