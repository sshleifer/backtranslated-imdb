Undoubtedly, at least, the most upsurge I've ever seen for many years is the "chicken pussies". The writing and the character are drowned by the stereotypes of the film on parody. One hour and five minutes before the disaster, we were exposed to the following issues: If a baby solves all of your problems, the types of performers are bad things, and musicians are not good mothers. they shake their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What is a talented cast and some great looking kits and loss of suits. When Natasha Richardson speaks to Tony Collette, she will end up - she tires - "alone!", And I feel myself as long as she does not have a more basic life. I do not believe that this movie has left the theater free. This is one of the "women" cable channels, always asking for one of the points that go along the channel surfing. I am a woman and over 35 years old, so the film should be part of the target audience, but the boy does not miss the goal in "Evening".
