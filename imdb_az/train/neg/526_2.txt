It is awesome to watch as read, almost at night, Meryl Streep is a nice defect until he shows his other players how to handle such things quietly. Vanessa Redgrave is dying, Ann and Claire Danes are shocked to be in the role of a password. Perhaps, when we played roles in Vanessa and Claire, we could have seen the vibrancy in the young ann, which gave the entr√©e to the story of a rare world and we could imagine that great Ann would really die. <br /> <br /> I hope Michael Cunningham's adds to the credits I write, he will make up for a charming story, but regrettably. He gave me headache.
