I took this movie as a gift and knew from a DVD movie that this movie would be bad. After watching for over a year, I was finally watching. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" Trust me when I say "This movie sucks." I really, it's financed by some poor film makers to shoot this bad film, but I'm shocked, but it could not cost more than $ 20,000 to produce this movie. <br /> <br /> In the first part of an evil move, there is a cheap camera or mobile phone camera that is supposed to be a drunken man on the road to report a hunted city, a place where he should leave home. but, fortunately, it is almost completely covered and there is a bottle of wine at the door. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red; <span style = "color: red;"> Ben Draper soldiers (I think it is one thing) that one of the poor soldiers would have allowed Wilson to win a tomb and then let his soldier crash <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <strong> SQT. For Draper's great surprise. his wife / girl fiend knows about it and he and his lover Sgt kill. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Ben Draper will take revenge from special Wilson (next to the tomb of the killed soldier). The soldier awoke from his grave in the form of zombie and killed them to kill them. <br /> <br /> Although you love B HORROR movies, do not see this movie
