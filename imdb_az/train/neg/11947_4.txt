The first is an interesting change. This film was once again a mystery. Even when you ask yourself, what happened to the murderer. The film has several parts, the first half starts slowly and remains in the pace in the last half. The whole movie is good. The story, beyond 22 years after the first movie, Norman Bates is out of the shelter and returns to Bates's motel, but things go wrong when a woman claims to be her true mother. Perkins plays an old Norma better and at the end the scene was excellent, he scored a very difficult period.
