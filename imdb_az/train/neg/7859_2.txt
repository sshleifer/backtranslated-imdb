My God This movie was terrible. I can not complain about this much. I went to see it just to make it work. That was enough. <br /> <br /> The most disgusting part of the film is that the woman would have to make a terrible baby. <br /> I also think that a prominent actor in the film was an Spanish soldier who was supporting him on Thursday. Everyone in the film made a terrible move. It was some of the worst things I did not pay. <br /> <br /> I thought it would be much worse than the first one. It was not. I was expecting to be more intimidating, because the sequel of the next and horrific film was less successful than its predecessors. Gore and the violence are usually another frustration that is not as terrifying as this is, but this is expected to be even more intimidating, as it usually sells a scary movie today (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence). <br /> <br /> The first one was worrying about the mutants, but the filmmakers worked so hard to cheer them up. <br /> <br /> I hated it too. "I love you, my mother" is the whole concept to show the clip of the female soldier's son on the camera phone, saying TIME. First of all, it was foolish to do so, because they just wanted to get even worse for the more sensitive mom than the rest of the soldiers, and they tried to create a sense of sensitivity by showing us. three times more than for any reason. This movie was a joke.
