IMMORTALIZER was interesting. Of course he did not kill me in an hour or a half, but I was not surprised. A group of children are killed on the street by cashmere mutants (at a scene that reflects the sound effect of the cinema's most convincing head) and into a suburban fancy home. Dr. Divine and his team carry brain transplantation for the elderly, so they can still have young bodies. Hey, this is a few years later, with a great budget such as FREEJACK! Who knew who was transmitting an old person's brain to a different body and voicing the old voices of new voices? With all the conversations of pineal glands and the use of a glossy green serum, you can begin to see dance at the manufacturers of BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR. But there is no courage to say the word of production. Someone did not understand that by pulling down a budget horror film, I did not see him on the edge of the frame. Player assistant Dr. Price is just as terrifying as Clarke Lindsley's good performance. There is a nice bad laugh. Another thing that we have mentioned about IMMORTALIZER is that many of the people who live in their stunts have the same. Seriously, most castles take a serious blow to older people.
