After the original story of the Baroque artist, Artemisia Gentileschi, you will be disappointed, but you are filming after making a puppet made of art. <br /> <br /> This film is actually an inaccurate description of the life of Artemisia Gentileschi, which almost made me cry. (Write inaccuracies in Artemis on Google and see some of the fantastic facts). Regardless of the technical point of view, the movie was good: sets, costumes and especially chiaroscuro lighting, a century experience; <br /> <br /> Although the GLARING FACTUAL INACCURACIES mentioned above have dropped a little. <br /> <br /> How surprised I am film director / writer Agn√®s Merletin? Perhaps he refused to describe Artemisia as a victim, which would have failed.
