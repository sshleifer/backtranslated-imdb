I hated this movie. It was absolutely terrible, real, real, real, foolish, criminals, poor, poor, very mobile, at least ICT was not funny (unlike the first two home single films). all boobie traps are weak, misleading ideas for ideas. Copying only two films was just the laziness for those who wrote this movie because their salary did not exceed $ 20 per week. This movie is completely bad, and is not worth the rent. Actually, do not watch it at TV! Use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two of them! I also give this one star (from 10). Just when you trust me, you will not love this movie and do not follow this movie if you are the first two lovers and a foolish man!
