Hopefully this hearty story comes. Again, I hope you will not tolerate this terrible thing. * Cough * Razzie Award * Cough <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie because it was unfunny, predictable and believable. While watching, I felt like I was in a psychological experiment to determine how to get low movie standards before I complained. At the end of the movie I asked for money, I was informed that I was not entitled to a refund because I looked at everything. <br /> <br /> I was told by some assistant manager that some people had complained and that they had already been returned. <br /> <br /> The film's summary is quite basic. The Midget thief stole a diamond and creates a baby to destroy the cops. But there is a repertoire of original, fresh, and hilarious sketches that underlies this clever concept. Or if not. <br /> <br /> Ask yourself: Do you like to see people fishing? Do you like fart jokes? Would you like to see babies born as infants threatened by a thermometer inside the anus? Do you like tired jokes? Does your baby say 'goo goo goo goo gaa gaa'? <br /> <br /> If you answer yes to one of the above, this movie is for you. In some places, though, there is a movie or 2 worse place, although it has been billed as the 'worst movie of the decade'. I can not say I'm sure. I gave this movie 2 stars, because we knew that all of us would look at the wrong side of a star-looking reviewer and would not be seriously considered to be reviewed later. <br /> <br /> This terrible comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience, and I do not advise anyone on my conscience. <br /> <br /> Respect
