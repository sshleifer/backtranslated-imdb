It's a strange hacked movie, I get the feeling that the bond company has come to this one, and I'm not surprised that there is no credit who wants to be associated with this movie. The attraction of all involved is quite stilted and throws around the area, but it does not make much sense. As I said before, the gardener did not seem to have to come because it did not seem that there was an unplanned image and all the music was very bad library music (I say cheap). Very, very strange. Although I could actually get a DVD, what happened to me in hell, and see what happened to this movie.
