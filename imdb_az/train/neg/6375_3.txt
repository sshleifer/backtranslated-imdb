Jennifer's Shadow is set up in Argentina and Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips) starts to arrive there after his sister Johanna dies. Jennifer left Johanna's big home, and Jennifer decided to sell her home and her head to Los Angeles, though her grandmother, Mary Ellen (Faye Dunaway), was selling. But strange things start to happen, Jennifer begins with the nightmare of Ravenna's pecking and begins to feel very bad. After checking in at the hospital, one of her kidneys disappeared mysteriously, what happened to Jennifer? An ancient family curse? <br /> <br /> This Argentinean American joint venture was written and co-written by Daniel de la Vega and Pablo Parés, and is a truly dull loss of nineteen, a challenging and predictable modern fantasy story, and I think will put more people in bed rather than scare them. Vega, Parés & P.J. The script prepared by Pettiette is not that of anyone who is quite slow and difficult, and I'm sure most people do not want to sit and do not want to get caught in their skulls. The characters are all uninterested and sufficiently facial and do not make any motivation. For example, who is in the cemetery? How did he know the demons? What is the curiosity and motivation to engage? I could not see it. Jennifer himself is a pretty challenging and gentle leading lady, like clichéd as her grandmother Mary Allen arrives and she is not surprisingly so obviously a villain. I can be surprisingly predictable and regular for this mystery-based horror / dream story. <br /> <br /> The Directors Vega & Parés are very low. The logic and story did not want a joke with Jennifer's Shadow ending with a terrible twist that was not too twisted too. often use almost all the bleach routine of color, which is black and white, and I suspect that they want to feel the Gothic feeling for a while, but that was often done before and often even better for me, and Allows the whole film to look elegant and lifeless. From the cottages to a large house, we looked at some 40 eras, but still looking semi-cheaper and cheaper. Jennifer's shadow is good, but it is very unforgettable, not scary or creepy, and it is very much anticipated. <br /> <br /> Ravens has several scenes that are not enough for people and there is a beating heart for humans, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> With the budget of about $ 1,000,000, The Chronicles of Raven is good for its US and international DVD version, but one million will not get much today, and Jennifer's Shadow proves many theories. There are many scenes in the Argentinean emphasis on the actor's speeches, though it can be realistic to really understand what people are saying. <br /> <br /> <strong> It's good to make money with Dannyre's help. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jennifer's shadow is a dirty ghost movie, (1964). Spend all the time.
