<br /> <br /> I was planning to review it for a web site, and I optimistically followed it, maybe at least cheesy, it would be fun and even not enough. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The last "Omen" is very similar to the end. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the operation, the writing, and the story are simply hackneyed. If these films are earning money, I'm sorry to see where the shelter is. It's embarrassing.
