<br /> <br /> It's not just a matter of trying to justify any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> It was a good trash. From the very beginning you think you are part of a visionary cinema ... and then you hit it with a big sack! War is a challenging battle, the player slams at the edge and is not worth the music. There is only one story to create an excuse for this movie. The way the characters deal with their decisions and situations is weak and has done nothing, but it makes me angry. In my opinion, the only reason for this film was to act as a fan of science using Yumiko Shaku.
