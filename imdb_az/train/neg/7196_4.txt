" özü. Bu səs-küylü, parçalanmış, enerjili və bir-birinə atılan bir çox yarımsevər ziddiyyətdən ibarətdir, bu, başqa bir şey ilə bir yerdə çox olmayan bir şey etməkdir. Film, əsasən, 6-9 yaş arasındakı uşaqları sevəcəkləri simvollarla və qeyri -bərabər bir hekayə ilə birbaşa yapışdırılmış bir sıra zəngin hərəkət seriallarıdır. </ Strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> "Müfəttiş Gadget" ə qədər "Seçim" kimi filmlərlə uğurlu bir çempionata qədər olan Matthew Broderick 's played "The character of the movie becomes the Inspector Gadget after a fight called Claw, the seventy-fifth. <br /> <br /> This film has a romantic subplot, as well as a large number of scenes. <br /> <br /> <strong> William Shakespearenin disaster this year with dreams of a summer night, Rupert Everett, Inspector Gadget wacky body parts and machine elements. Gadget and Claw, initially attractive character played by Joely Fisher Brenda fell on her looks and her father was killed by the claw in advance for a special knowledge of the invention. The competition causes many battle scenes and many other events in the film. Also a great character Gadget Mobile is a life-like car for the Inspector Gadget itself. D.L. sounds. <br /> <br /> The Inspector Gadget is a movie I've seen so badly. I know that I'm not exactly a target audience for filmmakers, but my ten year old brother did not like the movie. The film is a problem with some defects. I have never cared for the characters. Unlike the 1997 movie, using the original film, there is no mood development outside pure franchise loans, unlike the "Mr. Magoo". In this comedy there is a lot to do with the same thing - it is ridiculously ridiculous and challenging. In general, design is a blend of rarity and a joke: The inspector's gadget is not bumpy. <br /> In such films, viewers overcome the boundaries - what can and can not do. There is no such limit on the "Inspector Gadget". This is just the party's time for many fun players. A few years ago, another comedy named "Blankman" reminded that actresses with more props and energy, of course, had a fun experience with all the gizmos and details, but there was nothing needed for each movie: <br /> < br /> It has become one of the few films. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it's just used as a plotter, and I'm asking how he uses it to improve the area. His presence does not bring about a movie that is productive and productive. We never know that his reactions to his father's work or accidents. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I want to tell you how dangerous and sufficient excuse the "Inspector Gadget" is. for children's comedy. And I believe or do not believe it, I compare myself with the Blade, a violent and very anti-aggressive motion picture in the past. I would like to say once more that there is a movie that is more than anything. <br /> <br /> The "Inspector Gadget" simultaneously resembled a lot of things for the same purpose. <br /> <br />
