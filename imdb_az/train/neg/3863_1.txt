Amazing! Wow. It is almost as virtually impossible. Who writes these products? Who produces these products? Which self-respecting actor agrees with 'action' in these works? Oh, my God! I do not know how to build it through this movie, but I admit that we live like 8 cents of coffee that day, the main element of my awakening. Good Wrecker! <br /> <br /> This is one of the most drawn and predictable parts of my cinematography ... and I still do not plan to "witness" again for the record. Movie when I took the movie (MISTAKE # 1). I mean ... I thought, hey! Julia Stiles. I love her. It's cool. When I return home, I will follow it (MISTAKE # 2). When I wondered about how this group of mustaches would end up every five minutes, I tried to watch it and actually did it. But it failed. This was one of the worst things I ever saw. I would like to say that it will return to its real life after thinking what will happen. The father was quite annoying when he did so "parenting" as it was ten years ago. "Sugars" - and I believe that it takes a lot to call me - it's stupid, the characters are strange and unforgettable, the story line can be predicted completely ... ORDERED HISTORICAL NOTES from this movie in general! When I realized that I never heard of this movie, I thought something was wrong. <br /> <br /> From this point of view, I have an advice to everyone who wants to think. Do not do it! For God's grace ... DO NOT !!! Being in my DVD collection is ashamed of me and I can not save it ... No one and I do not want to buy it from me! And talk to your second-handed and third-hand savings stores that get your shoes mud and stay in the store window. Let's know how the CRAP is.
