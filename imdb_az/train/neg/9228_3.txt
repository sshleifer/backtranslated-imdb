CQ is incredibly slow and I'm a fan of David Mamet. The film follows a young director who has made many Barbarella-esque movies. Then the movie started losing me. Deep and deep? Not really. There is a problem of ending the "Dragonfire" in CQ. <br /> <br /> I'm lucky to catch this movie at the SxSW film festival. I've had quite high expectations just watching Y Tu Mama Tambien and some other great movies. I was waiting for the performance of Jason Schwartzman. But it was not an easy movie. <br /> <br /> CQ feels like a student film. <br /> <br /> <strong> We're not in the nearly 60 science-fiction or slower movies. If you want the rental of the latest fantasy movie Donnie Darko, do not let it go.
