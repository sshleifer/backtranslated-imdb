CHOKE (aka AX in the UK) is a slasher that is produced as a flat-to-DVD movie. I said that the film's name was "DVD" (despite the appearance of one). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> Plain-to-DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (very low IMDb rating) have many abilities, and sometimes they are "very bad," they say. good ", but CHOKE is far from being a serious slasher (like Halloween) or" so much better "(like Nail Gun Massacre). <br /> <br /> The film uses a drill that does not start <br /> <br /> <strong> All roads have been dropped since the past. </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> There are many sins in the world. <br /> <br /> The group has about 50 members, but after the music stops, it looks like it's part of the band. <br /> <br /> Most of the members of the group are aggressive adulterers or just strangely ill. No one really depends on them, and even when they are sent, their prospective friends forgot them. The purpose of the film is that a meat-eating plant is a homeless man who looks like a church (seriously!). It's really a funny line for no apparent reason. But, unfortunately, even his presence can not save the film. <br /> <br /> There are many scenes of people who are inactive and chatting. About 65 minutes of the movie are spent watching the characters around the conversation. Characters disappear without explanation for a long time. As with other flat-DVD movies such as CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time trying to give each other an aggressive look. Moreover, there are the most explosive (mostly male characters) and one has a complete explosion. In fact, the format can be explained in such a way as to walk around characters - killing occurs - walking around characters - killing occurs. <br /> <br /> This dialogue is very scary and, as you can see, several lines are spoken without using f-word. Perhaps it was funny, but it's simply sad. And when it comes to more points, we've all done it a thousand times before (usually it's a bigger impact). <br /> <br /> The film is completely deprived of any defect. Dead bodies serve to show that characters are in danger. A maniac runs around empty and still acts as general morons of characters. They try little to find a weapon to get out of the factory or to protect themselves. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He does not know whether the murderer will be killed at the time of the murder. except for the last murder when the murderer's identity was revealed). A random weapon does not appear anywhere to kill the victim. Nobody has anybody looking at stalking at any time. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> That is, Punk is very bad for those who love rock Extras look at dances that disturb him. <br /> <br /> As we know, there is no music afterwards. This sugarbabe wannabes group, which plays a very bad song, is completely incompatible with this film. <br /> <br /> It's been reviewed. This reviewer likes bad movies (like NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) like Classics (HALLOWEEN and Friday 13th). However, it seems that CHOKE has also done a very difficult job to avoid one of these categories. <br /> <br /> As a proper DVD movie, this is a poor effort. <br /> <br /> In a positive note, there are some good killings scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> Traditional 1980s should take steps to prevent fans of the unique films. this movie. And HALLOWEEN and Friday's 13th classic fans have to do their best to prevent it!
