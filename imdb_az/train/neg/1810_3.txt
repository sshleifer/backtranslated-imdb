Think of this movie as a live action program on a Saturday morning. Even small tykes work like molasses because you can find it difficult to find difficult! Particularly, I do not understand how awful God is in the costume department to do something very surprising and uninteresting! There are many many warrior-magician films that have used the same old plotline many times, but this is very small, considering the appeal to the little darlings. Who would permit the release of a headless mermaid in the world first? I thought it was a "family" movie! Another nice gem for the MST3K, 1999 TV season!
