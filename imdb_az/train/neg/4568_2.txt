It's not a bad start to the program - there's a slap in front of real law enforcement agencies. The worst part of the series is to try and present itself as a real price. Men and women who devoted their lives to the implementation of laws are better off. What is a one-minute medical school? Charo lipo implements? Charles Grodin helped to replace a hip? C'mon ... a little respect. Even Muncie citizens go out from the scene. Police Academy = High School Gym? Poor correction (how many times can they use the Taco Bell car shooting in the background?), Cheese siren effects (same loop, whether rollover code is added to each 'call') and end /> If you would like to see produced police work and intelligent donkey counterfeiters, I would follow Reno 911.
