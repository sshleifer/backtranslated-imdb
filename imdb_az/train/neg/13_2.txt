Weakness, predictable violence, only semi-interesting characters. Like a writer (also one of the stars?), He prided himself on his habit and added incredible fantasies to drugs and murder to "make" a hot one. Predictable rap and home soundtrack, family conflicts, this is a bad activity, stereotypic and ultimately not quite boring. Even the title has been made earlier - IMDb lists the same FIVE movies released in 2007-2008! <br /> <br /> Note: I've seen on Showtime, shown for one of the other movies. It was more than half that I realized that no one was a secret police yet. It would be interesting if another stereotype happened, even if it happened.
