The only reason I saw 101 Dalmatian is the Oscar nominations for the original song and costume design. I must admit that this film is less affected. Crueller DeVil (Glen Close, who plays this role very well) is subsequently released from the hospital due to good behavior. He loves all kinds of animals and removes all their furrows. At this point, we only wait until the crisis. Soon, quite enough, of course, she is trying to make her the best outfit of the fashion world with her beautiful Dalmatian treasure. Apart from Glen Close, I found it very funny, but I found it funny in a child's eyes. The target market is fair enough to have children under the age of 12. It was a great fun for kids and families, but it did not do much for me. * exit *****
