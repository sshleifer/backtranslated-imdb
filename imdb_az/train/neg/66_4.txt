I was attracted to this movie because of the story's sound, as well as the leading actor, so I gave a chance to the director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically by Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) police, especially by Supervisor Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), it is compelled to create and confront a gang to clear himself and your family names. Indeed, as I have not paid much attention to honesty, there are almost all the stories about this story. Also included are Orlando Bloom's Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore like Constable Fitzpatrick, Kate Kelly, Kerry Kondon, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly, Rachel Griffiths like Susan Scott. Ledger is a very good performer, and there are moments with a gun battle towards the end of the film, but I can not say that I did not like it. Okay!
