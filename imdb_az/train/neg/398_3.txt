C'mon children have written a novel about some of the previous reviewers commenting this episode. Only an old 60's TV show! This episode of Star Trek is remarkable due to the use of Star Trek and the most serious baby (Yeoman Barrow) that has really been laid out in the open. <br /> <br /> This outdoor space (and baby) is limited to the soundtracks of the TNG and the Voyager series, which gives the usual episode of a movie that is now almost a movie such as the depth and almost the quality of use. and a very familiar show. <br /> <br /> Except for a few exceptional exceptions, the "eternal city", "assignments" and "tomorrow is yesterday". The old series of Star Trek is seriously -wave and quench its dulling torment. <br /> <br /> This is half of a very good episode of 79, a pretty weak batting average. <br /> <br /> This is another Roddenberry, in fact, when some people went to the place where he went, he really made a lot of trash! <br /> <br /> For example, Irvin Allen is not worthy to speak in the same breath. <br /> <br /> See just the business bridge from the modern perspective. On floor floor plywood, plastic rear cafeteria seats and tool panels were using cheap carton. You can clearly see the layers on the paper! Every single expense is left or not!
