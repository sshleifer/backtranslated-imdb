<br /> <br /> In some cases, do you hate this meal, despite the use of cooked food? <br /> <br /> Behold, I was watching Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> You've waited many years to bring back your favorite New York Strip steak. When it comes to eating, you'll see the name "New York Strip" applied to a chicken platter. You're complaining, but the waiter simply says, "but it's really good, really good!" Do you really care if the chicken is good? New York Strip - Wanted STEAK! The waitress then said, "You want to make a new zoezing, just as you want the chef, and we felt that we would be more popular, so we gave the name of our previous delicious dees." You will be able to find the original New York Strip in the menu in the future, but because the restaurant now finds a dish called New York Strip, the original New York Strip is to create something NEW and slap the name "Battlestar Galactica" such a situation. <br /> <br /> This mini-series, original show to all fans! <br /> <br /> The production team responsible for this new version is clearly a shame to the original. The team responsible for the resurrection of BG should love the original series - the fans who want to improve their loved ones, exploiting the Battlestar Galactica name, does not sell this new series without shame. <br /> <br /> If you would like the SciFi Channel to give us a NEW show, then do so! Give me a new name! Do not use the name that we kindly mention in an effort to attract viewers. In the future, we are exposed to the chance to see any of the original looks. <br /> <br /> We have to wait 25 years to see what we know as BG because we like something original! We just did not want NAME and the rest of the key concept. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best of the original elements have never been deleted. Of course, the original BG was unusual and could use some updates. However, this mini series did not improve in any respect, but special effects (good, but not unusual by today's standards). <br /> <br /> Many viewers are of this quality <br /> <br /> We show the show, but we will not forgive SciFi and Ron Moore to destroy our dreams. <br /> It's said ... I'll give you my thoughts on this new mini-maker (original): <br /> <br /> The best part of the war sequence. The difficulty was to make the effects appear more "real" and less "wow - look at this effect". These sequences, although independent of today's standards, were originally designed with cables for cables. What has happened with this "pseudo-live-cam"? Some images have tried to keep the "real" camera affected by delay tracking and shaky zooms. However, taking into consideration that these cameras have no source, they have long been used. <br /> <br /> If you are witnessing action from security cameras, an infinite number of intelligent Babylon 5 is the only example I've seen so effectively on this kind of "live cams." The scenario feels like being written by a teenager for other teens. Heroes felt cardboard and stereotypic. Indeed, the whole story was merged with other well-known stereotypes. The only features of the whole story were several elements protected from the original series. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <STRONG> text-align: justify; Instead of dramatic drama, drama, and dramatic drama, every moment of human tension has been exaggerated at a sensitive point, and they have lost their ability to act as a spectator.It is open to any person between man and his son, <br /> <br /> It's been a few days now that a few days, something big, is never protected by genuine SciFi fans or craftspeople, but I've been watching it to see how the true spirit of the truth really is. "<br /> <br /> This mini series is always better remembered than the storytelling quality. To apply for the axis of the numbers thrown aside as a character. SciFi Channel, a true niche market to the masses of fans of science fiction productions "beat". <br /> <br /> In some cases, we will talk about not cooked. <br /> <br /> I leave you with a thought. <br /> <br />
