<br /> <br /> Clark Griswold's journey to Europe for the whole family is the least unpleasant thing in the Vacation series. <br /> <br /> It's not the first time there's a good job that works well under the belly humor. <br /> <br /> This error is undoubtedly the director's Hackerling, and it is clear that Harold Ramis is not a very good writer and a very simple post, with only a few respected lines scattered around. Chevy Chase connects some lifestyle to the process, but it's just not enough and very funny Eric Idle is spending a small role as an extremely unsuccessful Englishman. Some potential exciting moments do not have full potential and will make the audience more aggravated. All European descriptions are of one dimension and almost universally not funny (how polite the English SOOO is). <br /> <br /> In addition to a few scenes, there is a little laughter in her eyes, and she has turned into a complete collision. But a Chevy Chase fan (like myself) can be viewed on the film, but more.
