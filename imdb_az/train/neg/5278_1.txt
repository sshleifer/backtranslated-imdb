When a comedy movie has noise on the back cover, you know you're not interested in the top notch movie. I've hired this movie with some comrades, but in general, to encourage some of our laughs to shoot each other. <br /> <br /> It could have been good with a few changes in the movie. First, the comedy was painful. Physical players were poorly played and placed. The fat boy in the movie wanted to kill us, we wanted to bless him on the stage and stage, but he was like a slave begging for love. If he had been filmed, he could endure everything. There were some funny jokes. I believe that the boy group stole one of the parents' pornographic movies and becomes gay porn. But in order to finish the comedy in the best way, I will just tell you the boot lid for the fat guy. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "color: red;"> <br / > <br /> <strong> OH, BTW, has two good elements that the movie owns. Kadeem Hardison plays his role perfectly and makes jokes for anyone not to be missed or missed. Another piece of the movie is beautiful lady Ali Landri. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Did not appeal to me and I was a part of my target audience (18 people).
