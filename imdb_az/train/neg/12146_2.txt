This apocalyptic zombie movie is trying to be bad and shocking; but MASSAN'S OFFICIALS are nude as some of the solid legged zombies behind the streets. A zombie epidemic, known as Lazarus Virus on Rhode Island, is played by government-controlled newspapers and television stations. Channel 5 In TV News, a few courageous but silent people feel that their viewers are hoping to lie and that there is no real danger. Racheal Morris and his cameraman (William Garberina) have a risk of presenting "live" broadcasts to endanger their lives and signals with the help of military escort (Patrick Cohen). Give yourself a blessing and no trace. This is obviously a very low budget and a dishonest game. The operation is miserable and the pestering zombies are almost funny. Also appearing: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. MASS ASSEMBLING must be starved from hunger.
