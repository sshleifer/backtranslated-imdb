The same old old Che. It really did not really see the really interesting facts of Che's true character. Sodeberg rebuilds the same drilling story. A poor Argentine rich boy who was so shocked by poorness became a flaming tale, and later became a Robin Hood battle with the poor until he was killed by the CIA. Yes, yes, I've heard it all before, BORING AND UNTRUE !. Che Guevara's truth is very different and more explosive! Facts show that he was totalitarian by a Christian line that wanted to expose the persecution of the Maoist in the world. At the hottest moment of the political turmoil, he begged the Soviet Union to burn New York, Washington or Los Angeles, and to end the world. Chris Hruschevai called for a nuclear strike against US cities. For the remainder of his life, if he had been on his fingerprint, he would have pushed him down. Hruššev supported the world and was angry with Che's "betrayal" when he rescued the world. If Che's recommendations are followed, you can not read this review right now. Homicidal mania pop would make a film much more interesting to a symphony. It was incredible that no filmmaker was brave enough to show China's true side and its post-Death media transformation. Oscar to win the movie! I had to take an independent film, accept REAL RISK and think about it! They are just "safe counterculture themes", "che cool", "Wall Street bad", "Republican Nazi", "Bush ex Hitler", "NRA KGB worse", "Christians fanatic and stupid", etc. ad nauseum . Oooh, how brave and how clever he is! Tres anti-mainstream and edgy. I want them to have some real space and solve the Independent Film Oligarchy! It would be really brave!
