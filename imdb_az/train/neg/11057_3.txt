What do you say to Dahmer's childhood? - Two pairs of hernia surgery that believe that the body's internal functioning is diminished? What does "the land of eternity" belong to? - The game he invented as if it were a boy who was close to each other, was thought to be a threat. What are the emotional problems of his parents and his relationship with his mother and his relationship with his father? Does he have a sense of indifference when his brother is born? What is involved with insects and animals? How can we break the roadway in the woods behind her house and pay more attention to its decoration? And what about the parent's divorce? These are everything that should be included in the movie. Instead, the filmmaker chose to give a "snapshot" of a night or two in his life and combined it with direct confusion and sometimes unnecessary flashbacks, Dahmer <br /> <br /> Why the filmmaker Dahmer is not as objective as human beings did not show interest in people? From this point of view, he may have been on the scene many times, especially when he was a victim of sexual intercourse (indeed, not a health club, a nightclub). <br /> <br /> According to some reports, she can give as much information as possible for up to 90 minutes (or perhaps a long time), but why is a film that explores relationships with Luis Pinet so much? (known as Rodney in this film). My only guess is that the director tries to create Pinet's character and wants to scare or trust us, but this movie should have been about Jeffrey Dahmer, so he was another forty-five minutes? When the scene and connections were fairly important, it could have been fair enough during this process, but it was not. Steven Hicks, the first victim to be killed, is a vital part of the story of Jeffrey Dahmer because it was the first killing and the killing of the rest of his life. Unfortunately, the film does not reveal whether it was his first killing, or that he was not killed again for nine years. Because her hair style is different, it is a striking thing, but when did it come? And why? <br /> <br /> What is the worship that I am making in the end of his career? - One of the most important tips to understanding the genius and motivation. <br /> <br /> Although some people find that I need accurate and accurate analysis, when Jeffrey Dahmer thinks deeply, we find that this movie is a very small person with what he is and what he is doing. <br /> <br /> Finally, why is it a film that is a subject of the universe, like Mr Jeffrey Dahmer, to worry about his true problems, to make a movie that is more comfortable than frustrating and slaughtering the massacres? 18 certificates, but 18 certificates. We need to see more depth, so that he understands how he left the rest of us. This does not mean that, for example, the Konerak Sinthasomphone head does not show the drill, but at least shows what the number of people killed and what actually killed Modus Operandi. Anyone watching this movie, who does not know the story of Dahmer, can move away thinking that few people have died. He really killed seventeen men. <br /> <br /> Along with facts and lack of depth, the film is not all bad. There are some good cinematography and two good performances. I would like to see more and more knowledge, more energy, and a filmmaker who has a better cause to film first.
