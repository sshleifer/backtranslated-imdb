Oh, to laugh out loud, this was to be the LAMEST movie I've seen all year round, and I was usually busy with this stupid, twitty Stupidity piece of John Cusack. Serendipity provides him with a sledgehammer, even though the inconvenience in Seattle has the same message as the size of the same message, and even after the next tiring hour or half (and half a year back in my life) I will not go back, thank you very much!). The main characters of this movie have enough emotional adolescence for Jeremy Piven, the fourteen-year-old (in fact, I know fourteen). I was the best companion of a game about the first 15 minutes of the movie starring Kate Beckinsale or throwing all the sensitivity of the universe (in its full sense), and I was irritated by the faith. It's not as half as unemployed as my husband has given more intelligence to Rockstar and at least the characters in Rockstar, as in the Serendipitous confusion. I feel watching heroes who have no clue about their choices in life, and that they have nothing but fate and sad sparks. How completely tired. I am sure that this movie will be more popular with those who choose a more complicated life and then do not attract more people to chaotic warnings of responsibilities. Finally, there is a hero and hero who lives happily in the life of only two people (ie his fianc√©) after giving slanderous and intentional information about other relatives and friends. <br /> <br />
