I've read and interested in a magazine about this movie. One day she saw her passing through her car. Yes, I thought it could be interesting ... <br /> <br /> But this is not it. First, the title. Broken? Broken ... what is it? What is fracture? This ... oh, wait ... I get it, the name itself has been "broken"! Wow, smart! Unfortunately, this is almost the only thing that goes for it. <br /> <br /> The goal is not so bad, but I think Kiefer Suderland is better at Mirrors. A Cross between Body Snatchers and Mirrors Invasion and one of the many mediocre. A more favorable topic would be 'to win,' because it bleeds everywhere. Or maybe it 'turns' to others, because nothing is disclosed, not in the narrative and the story itself, but dotted with some uncertain ideas, cheap fears and scenes that are somewhat miserable, and nothing but material. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, actors and special effects are pretty good, but then it's not a tough role to move. <br /> <br /> The movie feels happy twice, I still feel a little confused, not EA Poe or Stephen King's way. Give yourself a blessing and do not follow it. Simply there are better thrills.
