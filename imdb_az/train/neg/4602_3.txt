A dishonest movie. Drifter agrees to kill a man full of money. Then they took him twice. Meanwhile, he fell in love with the dead man's wife and acted with him, knowing that he was deadly. Then he kills "accidentally" when he finds it. Then, in one of the heroic forms, he takes revenge on the bullets they are pairing. The first problem, when it comes to agreeing to commit murder through hire, drifter loses all the sympathy, valuables and heroism. We can not accept any kindness in him, and as a result, there is no spiritual center for the rest. We will not just care for such a person. A high-level lady (who did not marry Kari Wuhrer - Sheriff's eight LEGGED FREAKS), performing a mission for the homeless, but also weakened the state after her husband's death (despite her being), which protects the homeless. And when she discovered she was a boy? what does she do? He is locked inside his home (you can not open INSIDE in ALL homes, as does the locks) he continues to forgive him. Stoo-pid. However, George Wendt plays a role as a satirical thief. Director Stuart Gordon has done a better job with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
