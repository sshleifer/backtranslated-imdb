I read most of the comments here, surprisingly surprisingly, that in the 1960s, Vera Miles perceived as a long-term restoration of the Twilight Zone episode "Mirror Image". Rod Serling Sean Ellis made a better job in 88 minutes to create an effective spooky tale for 24 minutes with this grueling snooze. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending, but in a feature film there must be some more items, and the story should be meaningful. Unfortunately, the item and meaning "The Broken" are two missing things. Yes, there are some moments, but it's not enough to justify your time. Some observations: Although this is a modern story, there is not a single cell phone in the movie! Although there is an accident, though there are stories, there is no appeal to an insurance company, another car's driver, or a police officer who should report. My advice: go through this pit and watch the original!
