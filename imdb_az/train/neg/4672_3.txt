This movie has some nice sets and Albert Finney does a great job like a merciless father. The film failed because Jennifer jumped as much as Jason Leigh's daughter and was no match for Olivia De Havilland's more nuanced, mature performance at The Heiress (1949). The feminist substantiated summary of the film is opposed by a clear conclusion from the Washington Square, which has drawn the novel of fiction on some feminisms in other novel by Henry James, a writer. As an admirer of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this film very disappointing.
