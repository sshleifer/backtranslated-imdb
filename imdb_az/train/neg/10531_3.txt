It's like music of the 1950s or not, or some sort of genre. If you do, you will love it. Personally, the music of the 1930s and 40s was played by Astaire and Rogers' dance and Eleanor Powell, Bill Robinson, Ruby Keeler, James Cagney, Shirley Temple, and others. I prefer to chose it, but the songs of the 50s were slower than dance numbers, and soap melodramas left me all for ten years. <br /> <br /> This film is in a good condition. The first song was good, but the next three did nothing for me. Since then, the story has not been punished much. Deborah Kerr's participation is not a negative one. He does not think that he has seen a movie I have seen in my favorite movie, and he also showed that the two-legged English teacher holds half of the film that threatens to leave Siam. (I was there!). <br /> <br /> Therefore, she loves me and is divorced because she does not like it, a denial of the production of Rogers and Hammerstein for many people, especially ten years after "Voice of Music." There are similarities to R & H music. So, if you like Julie Andrews to whistle, you should love it as well. <br /> <br /> Behold, "L." This is the great production music you rarely see after the next generation. Also, unlike today, the actress does not really believe Marnie Nixon believes Kerrin will survive, like the West Side Story and Natalie Wood in My Fair Lady, as in Audrey Hepburn. "" <br /> <br /> Yul Brynner is a stereotypical traditionist, King Mongkut, and movies are always adventurously portrayed. The word is not "irresistible" like the wings of the left, but it will correct it as a teacher of education (Kerr, "Anna Leonowens"). Today's secular-progressives are always higher than those who are trying to cure their teachers! But Yul is good at this role, and in addition to many comedies, he works with more harsh character than his bark. Actually, it's the star of this movie. Brynner's magnificence. <br /> <br /> Yul was a cowboy who would be amazed by the audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> I'll let her go.
