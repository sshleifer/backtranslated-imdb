"Running Jumping & Standing Still Film" is a short series of clips, not a movie, but a fun slapstick theme. Richard Lester recognized this movie and led the first Beatles to manage Hard Day's Night. <br /> <br /> Richard Lester wrote the first film in 1959 and wrote music. The film has started a film titled "Running, Jumping & Standing Still Film" and has been reviewed only by those who helped to make it. Because the film is intended solely by Lester and its partners, the only purpose of this film is to have fun, but the main reason for its existence is that it serves as a trial for the camera, so the film's price is Â£ 70, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > A comedy about the little hobbies we have yet to film, English markets, and teams. All the events in the film are held in one area. Some of these funny events are a woman washing a grass, a man with a needle to record a tree, a photographer who develops a film in a pond, an artist who draws figures on a model, a tent maker, a duel between an athlete, a knife and an armed man. It is not fun in the hobbies of the film to extend the time, but it's fun in English culture compared to American culture. One of the events in this film is a group of men from England and a kite. While others try to fly it, men shoot in the kite and kite split. According to Neil Sinyard, author of Richard Lester's films, this event is less representative of United Kingdom in the field of energy and technology compared to the United States, compared to the space age. According to this scenario, the British class is primitive kites, but Americans flying over the world after the Second World War, have developed highly-developed missiles and spacecraft.
