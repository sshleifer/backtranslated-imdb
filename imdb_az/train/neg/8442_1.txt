GUERNSEY (Maria Kraakman - Belgium / Netherlands, 2005). <br /> <br /> Mousy Maria Kraakman, a 30-year-old woman, plays Anna, finds her husband (Fedja van Huet), courage to meet her. It prevents any confrontation with people, parents and sisters, and therefore is a key feature in a feature film that does not do much. However, we know something in his background or motivation. Not a single episode of his life, but a woman in a street. <br /> <br /> "I have not clarified this issue, but why should we also suffer in the audience?" These were 90 minutes more dull and painful. Normally, I'm trying to avoid the waste of energy to get a bad film. I'm beaten and beaten, but in this case there is a fair warning. Has Nanuk Leopold acquired financial resources for this land (most partially publicly financed)? Obviously there is no script to talk about. It can be compensated by a strange filmmaker with ideas for cinematography or a little more charm. Yes, there is no indefinite concept, "I want to do something from a woman's perspective." I do not think a cast that can give you so much pleasure, but if Johanna ter Steege is able to do it with this difficult financial deficiency, it's in the dark ( small) light. I guess Leopold works for Maria Kraakman's leadership: "Maria, look at the horizon, shoot a three-minute movie, just express her grief." Perfect treatment for insomnia. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 1/10
