There are many people who say that this film is one of the most brutal of all time. We can only say that it will not follow these claims after reviewing it. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the film is really demented. But in general, execution was not worth it. Even the final scene (the ghost thing) is not really bad. <br /> <br /> Everyone who wants to see a real movie will be disappointed because I am awaiting a lot of things there, instead of a very low budget Violent Sh! is not a story (though most people know it). Gore fans will be disappointed because, unlike belief, blood and guts are few and far away. <br /> Of course, this does not depend on the events in the film. Avoid this.
