But a film about a group of very smart individuals on a road trip to watch their own original travel routes for a short time, or to visit a down strike in this case. As expected, the results are not good, because this particular side show is home to some of the refugees detained several years ago. As you can see, the father, a professional photographer, simply had to find out where he still lived, to stop and shoot the pictures of the earth. Different members of the family set off to see different attractions, just in fear. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> It's a safe way to expose the van (surprise!), Looking for asylum seekers and asylum seekers in a small town, just freaks (surprise!) This movie is played as expected, her family runs away from heroes and is killed. Some of the family is back, but this is one of the worst scenes in the film because they work badly. There is nothing remote here if it is not entirely inaccurate noise played in specific areas that completely undermine the atmosphere and mood of the movie. My wife is as bad as I've ever seen as part of everyone (it's pretty bad when you're dropping Cast Blood). Special effects are very bad and last made me want to <br /> <br /> Despite all the adverse moments I enjoyed this movie, so it's a "very bad" like it. Ridiculously enjoyed the clich√©d structure, the terrifying effects and the unpleasant special effects. In the end, despite the fact that I have been deceived and angry, it shows that the film's start is not great and that the film at the end is meaningless. <br /> <br /> The following line, as if I can show the movies, you see it if you see them. This is the best of the film. Although it's not a full wasting, this movie is pretty bad and <br /> <br /> My point is: D
