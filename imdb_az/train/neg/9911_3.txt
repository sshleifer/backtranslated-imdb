There is no need for anything else, such as Billy Burke, Coolio, or any other dear actor, if there are such actors as Peter Falk, Rip Torn, George Segal, and Bill Cobbs. The massive talent is completely wasted in "Three Days Vegas", and the fault falls on the violin. My neighbor's vacation movies are as exciting as this buggy movie. If you want to use a veteran game with a good scenario, see "Crew". There are really no substitute factors here, and these beautiful actors who struggle with such weak materials are a crime. I would like to love it, but the silent writer does not give anything to the work of actors, especially to the actors. - MERK
