The American Pie has gone a long way from the first one. First of all, I believe that the actors do not have a clue what to do, and instead of cleaning a college party from the nuts. The story involves just two nights of college night parties (with young stiffs), who have the desire to go to the college for night night parties, sex, and, of course, boiling. The field is stupid and away from the original pie. In fact, the film has not been found anywhere in the world. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, I'm working at a video store and can rent it for free. But be aware that there is a waste of time if you're not really enjoying sexually explicit sex videos in naked and terrible liquor. I'm a young man myself and even believe that Evan would be a better choice anyway.
