Really bad. If everyone thinks it's a good movie, funny thing is never secret. I love comedies as the next man and I love "A Christmas Story." Having the same filmmaker and the same writer's memories made me wonder that this film was such a failure at every level. Charles Grodin gets worse as a father for the beginner. There seems to be the same pacing for another - it's just not running well. Everything seems tired and compelled. The first film is full of life-pleasing life - you just want the movie to end. I also do not recommend this film for those who are curious about the name "A Christmas Story". This is bad. 1/10.
