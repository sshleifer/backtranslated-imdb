My main comment about this film was how did Zwick get reliable actors to work on this movie? Impressive casting? Even for the faces that support none of these movies. Naturally, Tom Hank's pipeline was appreciated by him. What happened to Tom? Have you lost a bet? The best part of the film was Joe Isuzu - a very classic! Mercy is good. Basinger's character struggles with the existence of a pink lady, finds a way to the Vegas motel by the motel laying the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. Corbett's character, a while ago, went on his way to Vegas to deliver his Elvis suit and did not intimidate his companion before. Since they both have their own way, Elvis has a great deal of work with the Elvisian emperors who go somewhere similar to a convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI was involved and began to think what Elvis's imperial serial killer was. <br /> <br /> Do you think that you are in the first class while watching this movie? story lines and sustainability are not really important. Not only does Basinger look nice with Pink Lady outfit, but she does not even wonder why she does it. The film works hard, but it eventually diminishes the path. <br /> <br /> Taking into account that it is full of ideas that can be theoretically funny, but in practice it is not funny. <br /> <br /> It's not the worst, but you're feeling off leaving the building while watching it. a ???? Do not say I did not warn you!
