Only sent a friendly email on this classroom movie school. Something to avoid when filming a movie - blabbering characters that are extremely surprising and unbelievably illogical, numerous, rough monologues. If the film is an attempt on social reality, wordless dams are so high that they actually attract the attention of the movie, which is filmed, and neutralize it inefficiently. <br /> <br /> Is life spouse, or is it bad, or both? <br /> <br /> The heroine is also incredibly incredible for the social reality - the glorious English literature, while the deep sophomoric soliloquies are drunk? And how is it a charming, unwashed, and poisonous character that can spoil the majority of women you meet in a matter of minutes? (When a chicken finally got out on the street and was tempted to be appalled, she was forced to applaud it). <br /> <br /> Watching the ancient Greek literature, Nostradamus and the Bible book, are facing ambitious references. . The unhappy biblical point of view is that the revolt, approaching humanity in the form of barcodes printed on its right hand and hands, is presented as a cleverly exposed character, such as the guardians of the vacuum. <br /> <br /> This flick is overlapped and from the top - humanity, life, etc., which is unhappy, numerous and exhausting. a cautious melodrama with the pedestrian "philosophy" about it. <br /> There are many nice English films that are similar to this movie. A nice, exciting excursion to the lives of individuals in a similar social environment, "Nil by Mouth". Ditto for "Warzone". Even though it is not guaranteed, Peter Greenaway, see more dialogue, intelligence, and absurd symbols and things that solve them.
