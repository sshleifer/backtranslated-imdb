What happens when a free man is trapped in the race for leap and gives enough money to irritate him? Homeless people do not meet anyone. They do not have any mortgage, rent or immoral bosses. Homeless people are not forced to worry about IRS or performance or credit card payments. However, you have to rent a flat and get enough money to buy a car, and suddenly they have to worry about getting into a rickety race, buying gas for transportation, paying insurance for their car, and worrying about working for someone else. They get the chance to become "productive citizens". This film was like a movie. Rich and middle-level sheep are "one way of seeing what happens when trying to help the poor." <br /> <br /> Why is there a film asking for a movie: What happens if you take everything from a rich person?
