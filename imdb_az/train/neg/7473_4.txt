My husband and I were interested in the audience - a stronger willful Mrs. South Lady LAPD, an individual spouse. The first season was a TV show for us. Unfortunately, in the second season, stories of personal life are so tedious and do not deserve the strongest character of jealousy. <br /> <br /> My husband and I were concerned about the episode we were trying to hide. your mother is so strict. However, a person who violated the contract hides his beloved pregnancy, but it is an episode that tells his supervisor. Why does a strong, middle-aged woman do this? The answer is not it. Additionally, my husband and I choose the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy. A white man or woman who is present in the community or an idealized family is almost always. Are scenarios writers sometimes unable to do something original? As I said, we are no longer watchers. We supersede those who do not betray symbols and insult our intelligence.
