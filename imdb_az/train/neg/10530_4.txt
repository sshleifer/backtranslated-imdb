In 1946, the music version of Margaret Landon, "The King of Anna and King of Siam", with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison disappointed. Deborah Kerr was beaten by a widow and mother who traveled to Siam from Britain in 1862. Most of the king teaches children - and perhaps one or two of the Royal One! Stagy starts out well in the picture, but loses energy and attention quickly. Yul Brynner is a team participant who repeats the stage triumph of the King, but a story used as an angel. Although Marni nikson's vocals are not heard on lips, Kerr keeps her beautiful dignity and tariffs better. Perhaps this part of the episode seems to have nothing to do with the translation of the screen, except Brynner, who has already played the death. The second half, Anna and the moppets preparing the musical version of "Amc Tom's Cabin" are very ridiculous, and Rodgers and Hammerstein's songs are largely lumbering. Brynner won the best actor Oscars, but it's a sad KERR that keeps this water on the water. Terim's worst sense is too heavy and "outdated." ** from ****
