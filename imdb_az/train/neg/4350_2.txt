Where can I start? I heard this movie coming out and was crazy. I'm a great admirer of the original Carlito Road, and when I heard about it, I thought it would be like all other albums in Hollywood. I thought it would be bad. Boy wrong, this movie was worse than me. Not all sequels are bad, but with the problem with Hollywood today, they make many sequels and remakes and hurry to them. This is not a theater show, but a DVD broadcast. Yet, in my opinion, there is no reason for that. After talking about this movie, I heard that Pacino was not in this place. Any chance for this film to be good has been killed. Why did I check this movie and ask some of them? Well, I saw that. I just do not watch films that have high expectations, and I have little expectations about it. I just want to see if it's related to something. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Carlito's Way" was filmed. <br /> <br /> You do not really want to spend 2 hours watching this trash, because "very few spoilers" are something. All I will say is that we do not see Carlito Road 2 go to Carlito's prison. Now I do not know about any of you, but I was thinking about a prequel to show how Carlitos Way was staying in prison. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not a problem with the movie. The actor who played Carlito had not done a very bad job, but he could not save this movie. There are not even the smallest things that Carlito's Way fans want to do. First of all, if you do not see any of Kleinfeld's or other main characters, I would like to see something similar. Even worse, Luis Guzman plays in this movie, but does not play the same character he is playing in the first movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm a fan of Carlito's Way, this is a new rectangular DVD. it is a disgrace. If you're an admirer, you can watch this movie with high expectations. This movie did not do anything for me, and it's a movie that I'm going to watch or follow one of the DVDs.
