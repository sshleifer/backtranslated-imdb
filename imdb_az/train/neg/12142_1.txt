Please do not follow him for the love of God. Now I say, I know what you think, that can not be bad. If everyone says badly as they say, I have to watch it! Do not do this! It resembles a terrible accident involving a small baby and a gasoline tanker! You'll be scared for life ... the image will never leave you! I could only wait half an hour before I was ill. Imagine the worst thing I've ever seen and I've seen Barbwire! If you have the risk of breaking your eyes and hiring this movie, do not say I did not warn you! Cover and storyline are a trap! Zombies? Satire? Shaun was great from the dead! This movie should be the same .... right? NO !! Spelling = crap management = trash moving = did not work. Not sure yet? Then your soul will hurry up forever!
