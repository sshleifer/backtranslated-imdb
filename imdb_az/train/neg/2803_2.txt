Taking into account the limitations of this movie (in a movie the whole movie - a music studio - only 5 or 6 actors total) should be done in a much better fashion. How bad is lighting if you have these restrictions on filming? And the actors were terrifying, they talked to hairdoers in the shades, except for a nice movie, which was not a substance. <br /> <br /> This is attempting to refer to a number of sections, but the lines are simply transmitted badly by actors. And the main character Neal boy, what a miserable relaxant. Of course, 10 people did this "movie" and they all knew each other, and they were probably a real rock band, but they were inadequate because they did not really know how awful they were. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this was made in 2005, but all this is just like a strange period. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, I have not seen it (Starz on Demand is back again!) is not a studio 666, but the title "Possessed" is unimportant to what you do with your title, which can not help. It could have been a better movie - when filmmakers do this, you have no excuse to film this bad movie when you have a limited set of options, and you can do the best work you can do to products and products that you can control and control over these restrictions. Instead they figured it would be good enough for mediocrity. <br /> <br /> So, it's fair to 2/10 if you're into all your b-movies, I suppose.
