I read a few positive reviews of this film, and I was surprised at how scary this was. A story related to AIDS and a few crosses between the song "Ghost" and "Blithe Spirit", this film can not do as much as it always wants. <br /> Simon and Mark are gay couples with "open" relationships - Simon can make anonymous (though safe) on the side whenever he wants. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon are no longer in sexual life. Prior to Mark's death, Simon, who had been accustomed to his emotions after his father's earlier rejection, tries to wipe out his memory and simply refuses to be a bachelor. His behavior before Mark's death is not very different. <br /> <br /> Simon is such an egoist SOB who can not feel any empathy against him. Most of the film. He had to be more sympathetic, and he was too late to care. On the other hand, Mark is watching Demi Moore's "Ghost" movie and watching over the whole movie. <br /> <br /> After Mark Marks returns, there is a strange transition in the tone. Suddenly we get a little help in humor, A la television show "Bowed." But that does not take long. After being exposed to Simon's emotional health, it's becoming more and more popular with amateur attempts to push everything into your hearts. It is surprising that the Simon Waves, a charming, terrifying wave, is not intentional, laughing, while directing a cup of tears to a paradise with a muscular-angle angel with a red rose.
