A great slasher movie - very bad producers and not part of the script. The main plot summary - a red-fetched man invites such women to his home, just to come in to some kind of freaky coma and to achieve different levels of success. Only a scene behind the scenes is that the film is advertised as a movie, and I think it should be a part of the movie. If nothing flies, then you have disappeared from the red beginning with him (though he did not), but rather woke up when he was seen as a camera man, and when he woke up he began filming. We can see that I have been blamed for 2-3 days and have to retreat and restore my attempt to re-examine the existing small plot. When you see the end of the warning, do not try to associate with one thing - just an aneurysm. Time, effort or blasphemy of God. The only reason for reaching 2 instead of 1 is the weak chance of a hacking between the release of the film and the horrible version that I watch.
