The film has no credibility with helicopters that existed until the 1950s. But no woman would have done a woman before and even before the 60s and 70s. The only part of the film you would want was to know where Germany would be. Imagine the moment when all the British spies were taken captive, but if they had not, they would not go so far as to rely on the arrival of those in Germany to Calais. It's not something the movie does not work. It's the end of all the mistakes that make the movie unsuccessful. Bad management, bad scripts, no attempt at originality (at least) of the original movie combination. Spies speaking in general should fall into the tree. The call reveals that spies are uncertain whether or not they are reliable or unreliable. The beginning of this game has come to an end. This spy did something else apart from espionage. It may be your only chance to get something of some credibility and read a book.
