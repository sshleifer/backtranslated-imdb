I'm so glad to see most people here, so I do not think much of this movie. There are some big names in the cast, but that's it. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing but a proposal to adopt several beautiful women who can shoot thousands of films in several films. <br /> <br /> The story looks stupid, arbitrary, chained, and all hip national critics like ... and most of the public do not stop. <br /> <br /> The Oklahoma accent was very fake, laughable, southern racist stereotypes survived the story of Liberal Hollywood 101 and survived.
