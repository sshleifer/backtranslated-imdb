I'm trying to look at the field for Dark Angel. "I think I'm a Matrix, I think Bladerunner, I think Chicken Angel plays Faith in Angel, a shiny black leather - Leave it with us, like a chick, like a dialogue, character, decent movement or budget, just loud bangs and shimmering we will do it without a chick that lives on a big bouncing bike in the dark leather Large glittering bikes in the fanboys with fierce brown shades and shimmering black leather <br /> <br /> Severe, fierce, angry, formless, passionless, delicate, dull, It's a fun, unmanageable, embarrassing, unmanageable anime action, or really a life. SF actually loves Joe Fanboy. :(
