I'm going to read some good reviews about this movie and think it's time to see it. I do not know why I'm upset. Basically this family is entrusted with a hint that leads to a great preservation of the ancient treasure hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence. As you can see, it should be kept in the hands of the British. First, why did they say that they carry treasures from Europe to America? The character of the Nic Cages "Charlotte" was actually a ship? How do they determine all tips and adolescents within minutes? And how could two people suddenly become skillful thieves and play the best protected bit of the world? It went wrong with Hollywood moving only some of the area holes in this bitter bit. Cage in some of the great action movies - "Face-Off" and "The Rock" - why lowered it down? Is it too old? His character is really a very annoying thing - a "ordinary" person stealing the Declaration of Independent Government, throwing thieves out of the arms, escaping from the FBI and generally appear invincible. The whole film does not really mean anything, and all this is a disappointment.
