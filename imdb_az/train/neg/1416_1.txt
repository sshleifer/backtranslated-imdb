Strange ... I love all this movie crew and dark humor films; but it did not like it! It's terrible, terrible and not necessarily funny. Unfortunately, everything can not be filmed, or hate. And it was really boring. Long blank moments fill the film; deleted. Of course, it should be in a shorter format. Maybe the crew is much more than expected - to protect the film lol -. In addition, it is filled with numerous stereotypes of characters and situations ... Why do people like it? "Poetry", "hope"; or 'do not you see anything like this! ^^ In general, it is empty and raw, pessimistic and hopeless. This is not something ........
