Looking at this movie, he always thought of me; Why do some corrupted brakes solve such a problem? There are one million options to reduce the speed of the car! The film quickly thinks the writers are a good reason why the car is unable to stop fast ... <br /> There's nothing very good to say about this movie; <br /> <br /> Every single story stands out as a clich√© look, the actors are very bad, and the story is like a sieve. It also spends time and money on this movie. <br /> <br />
