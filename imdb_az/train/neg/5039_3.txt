Rex Reed once said it was a film shot by pomegranate juice ("Julia and Julia" should be specific). I remembered because I enjoyed purple butterflies. <br /> <br /> This story was rich, and the scene of the actors' faces was completely overlooked or just a long time due to the large sections. <br /> <br /> Also, it was difficult to distinguish between symbols because everyone was the same. I call it "Dead Poets Society" syndrome. <br /> <br /> In general, disappointment is that no one cares about anyone, no one is interested and that the movie does not have a historic moment in a very interesting period.
