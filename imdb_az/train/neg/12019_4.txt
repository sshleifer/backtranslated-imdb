I've read some good reviews for Mr Scarface in this table, but I think the picture for those who are lonely in the genre of Italian gangster films like myself. Indeed, after the first embodiment of the tens of millions of pounds of fraud, the picture turned into a regular revengeful shooting with a small twist in the identity of Rick (Al Cliver). The whole gang of war has been muddied to me inside of the Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but like most other viewers, he is often referred to with ineffective violence attempts on any life in this picture. Tony did not even touch Tony even though Manzari's friends had passed through the streets. For its entire development as its main character, Jack Palance, who has spent much unceremoniously, with a very anticlimactic close philosophy, is the US business title, "Mr Scarface," more moot. Perhaps I have not seen all the spaghetti westerns, so not all of them work. I do not make this at first glance or doing a spaghetti gangster flick in this case.
