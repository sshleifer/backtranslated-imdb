<br /> <br /> Do you have only 8 dialogs in a 140-minute movie? Is Bj√∂rk like a giant fur pit at the head of a lying Asian ceremony? Perhaps mammoth rot and spinal columns are used in a whale blast experience. Otherwise, when you are ready to kill the composer for the minimal and still annoying version of the Philip Glass account? In any case, Drawing Restraint 9 is one of the most ambitious of modern art films. At 135 minutes, he adds that he is doing drilling for the shooting. I think the use of color is amazed and the sequence of opening is interesting, but the rest of the film is for the documentary "Discovery Channel". <br /> <br /> In fact, it was one of the best parts of documentary esquire parts. The superficial plot belongs to a whale ship, and then there is a ritual of making whale oil. Then guests, Bjork and Matthew Barney, welcomed guests with their applause on the boat, their head shavings (think of frat boy pranks), nicotine patches, and giant fur coat hats. <br /> <br /> According to Matthew Barney, this is "the relationship between self-esteem resistance and creativity." They almost say, "If you do not take it, we're not creative in your statement; Oh, wait for this penalty to be the POST-contemporary interpretation and the post-modern movie about what will happen. But it needs to be a modern art. <br /> <br /> So, let's start all this interpretation, or? The following lines are only 3/4 serious and should not be considered as any real attempt to interpret the film. <br /> <br /> In the first half hour it is about the construction of pearl divers and a large ramp. Undoubtedly, the ramp is a symbolic symbol of self-esteem for any standard, and the pearl divers are looking for the wonders of wisdom. Then they build a box that looks like a whale in a whale ship. <br /> <br /> It is crucial to cook a whale whale and take a bleeding section on the boat. They are replaced by a spinal column and then a giant door. They had to be the essence of the film. When its fat, it's fun, but not bad for you. Spinal column can be talked about as "important" parts of a film or a hump. <br /> <br /> When Bjork and Matthew Barney reached different ships, they were placed in strange humiliating outfits. OR SIMETRIC, a suspect ran away from money and Barney tried to quit smoking. That is, they put patches on their heads. A Japanese intelligent man, who says that the ship was slaughtered after shooting another boat, gets information on the ship; if there is an accident or intersections. It inspires Bjork and Barney, who are different from the others, to break the legs of each other and turn them into whales to eat them. They cross. Oh, did you mention that this was seen in a Robbie Williams video? Later, the pearl divers will come back with their mouth full of knowledge pearls to create a foolish Venn diagram. Barney clearly revealed this through the 8th grade geometry. Or, perhaps at least some of the public research. <br /> <br /> Yes, did I want to kill Bjork? <br /> <br /> Art film is something, but when you put all kinds of symbolism in the hope of giving people a response, it becomes a jest of self-destruct. When did you cross the line between being a joke of art? Dali and Bunuel often made unsuccessful, obscene numbers, but they were much more relevant and / or entertaining than the trash can. <br /> <br /> Un Chien Andalou had sensitivity to many symbolisms, as in less than half an hour. <br /> <br /> D +.
