I generally do not worry about films in violence or philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All this is very good with me, and the film brings us a lot of things above. Particularly beautiful views of the lake and the nature, the structure of a good character, has a good direction. This movie can be selected as a good movie. However, for two reasons, it is corrupted, and both of these reasons denied the film. <br /> First of all, this film contains violence against live animals. Film is not cruel, but I'm talking about REAL violence. If it can only lead to violence, perhaps it can be for two reasons; The film's message did not show itself to the directors' wounded attitude towards women. All of us do not have direct twisting of women (respectively, men). But the result of the film is destroying them all. <br /> <br /> "Spoiler" * "Our heroine" is finally dying (although I remember myself, I saw this movie myself with my own hands a few years ago and it made me angry, but now I'm going with a new movie witch) ) and now the natural devil is more clearly described as nature, especially its sexual nature. Of course, he is the director who "kills" her hero. Men should die, especially if they are interested in male sexuality. It seems to come to the final conclusion. ** The last spoiler <br /> <br /> It would be nice if the filmmaker himself would be good for himself. But to use the big pictures, the oppression of living things on living things is to say that women are afraid of women and men are cruel to women. Just not enough. I've seen this movie as "philosophical, eastern, and artistic" and bringing it to good critics for any approach. But for me this movie was completely destroyed.
