Here are some of the negative reviews about "Stay away, Joe." I will not be calm anymore, and this can lead to injustice. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's films are a guilty pleasure for a simple reason: they are perfect movies for pure relaxation, because I should not think of watching them. So, I'm not concerned about losing a complex complex, because there's no match for the start. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I just have to put my shoes off, catch a beer, sit back and shut my brain And all the grooviest ten years since all the common sense and seductive easy rock n 'My Books' Stay away, Joe' is definitely "too bad". Now, if you are like me and evaluate the "waste value", this is the camp experience for the late 1960s. The worst thing is that watching is truly faithful and you are most surprised when you think that you can not create the worst possible imagination. Finally, you are very surprised by all the new levels you do not know about laughing or laughing. In short, I love it because there was once a generation that captured such films, so damn curious thing. I still give 1 out of 10 - when suddenly a movie hit 100, it will be classic.
