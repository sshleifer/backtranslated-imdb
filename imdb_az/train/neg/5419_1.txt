Why do filmmakers always oppose the author? So, yes, things are concentrated on the audience's interest, but see Green Gables Anne. They merge important events into a deliciously united union and did a wonderful job. I do not believe that Anon Avonlea chose to combine these three novels in a similar fear. See what they miss while doing this. . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widows, Windy Poplars. . . and Anne College, for the sake of heaven! Did not you like to get acquainted with the rest of Priscilla and Redmond's band? Kevin Sullivan must have filmed everything in order to separate everything and to combine symbols and events with it. This movie was good, if you leave the novels! But the fine work of LM Montgomery is something that should never be denied. The film fell down after looking at the Green Gables Anne's life successfully.
