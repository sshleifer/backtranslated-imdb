I liked Chiba at the Street Fighter, and no matter how stupid this film is, hey, I'm gonna see if at least you'd hit him a donkey? It's wrong. It's a dull conversation, a semi-writing scenario and a dull, terrifying mix of meaningless designs. Every scene of action, even martial arts, has fewer scenes and has been made smaller, and you do not know what the world will be. Dub is strange and maybe the tragedy of this movie is in the best sense of the Italian Mafia ... Avoid Tuberculosis - Looking at five minutes from the local school curate class window, you see better martial arts.
