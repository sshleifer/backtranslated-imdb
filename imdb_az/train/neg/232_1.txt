It should have been one of the worst films. When Kate and Jed are together with many people and they all start to shout ... Hollywood. Another bad scene Kate missed his pavement on the sidewalk when examining the tissue of the sidewalk. Andie's player is so bad in this movie - I could not communicate with them or feel affection for each other. The other two women were very good and Andie shaded. Anyway, it was such a campaign. I usually like these movies, but I can not access this movie. Very unlikely, and yet, Andie's player did not help the movie. Also, it is all gear. It looks glamorous in those commericals because Lancome needs to put his makeup with a makeup knife.
