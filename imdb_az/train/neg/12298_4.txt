"Witchery" can only be the most inconvenient and horrified horror film of the 1980s, but fortunately, there are quite a few compensating features, such as fantastic dark effects, an exciting musical score and some terrible casting choices. Of course, the scenarios are not something but Linda Blair (with a blond hairstyle) describes another girl with bad emotions, and David Hasselhofun (who is unlikely to be put out) constantly bloody voodoo, stitched lips, cringing to the cross, a movie that offers a very extreme but never creepy melody. Eight casual people are merged into an abandoned island island outside the state of Massachusetts. The young couple have to investigate the darkness of the earth; the unemployed family (who is pregnant with Linda Blair and can not worry about his whereabouts) is considered a yummy female designer who has been re-opened and accidentally interacted with the hotel. Are they forced to spend the night suddenly at the hotel and then at home? an old actress or something always black? in different ways. Everything relates to the intro segment, which in some way shows a woman jumping from a window to an accusation of charm. In any case, the plot is also insignificant in an Italian fears franchise, which begins as an unofficial spin-off of The Evil Dead. The atmosphere is sometimes uncomfortable and the makeup effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the whole film. There is something mixed with a defenseless woman who is thrown under a chimney and waiting to be fried.
