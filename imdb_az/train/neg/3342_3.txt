I did not expect much from a movie starring Sydney J. Furie and a film starring Dolph Lundgren, but I was expecting something more. One-way user commentary - 2nd degree action movie - For a Lundgren movie, it did not seem too depreciated for me. On the other hand, although the rating of this movie was less than 5.0, I would not worry about watching the movie, but it was 5.9 out of 10 points, which was quite acceptable for me in the film. <br /> Now that I understand that 37.5% of 10 (excellent) people have called this movie clearly because DETENTION is a regular Nu Image dump you've ever seen before. <br /> <br /> Lundgren turned a former school teacher assigned to an old military school. His player is simply terrible, emotionally and impartial. The fact that Lundgren is unable to move is seen more often than with small children. <br /> <br /> POLICY has some elements that may be potentially interesting for this small budget movie, or they appear to be great actors compared to Lundgren. The weekend high security school, veteran veteran of war and a group of four who are in jail together with a group of merciless criminals who want to go to prison - but the story (something like the BOOKHANA CLUB, DIE HARD, or the PANIC ROOM?) Is packed with incredible, many clich√©s and stereotypical characters. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Of course, Sam Rockwell's budget version and he wants a Milla Jovovich. In a movie where everything was unsuccessful, their madness and style provided enough fresh air to prevent me from falling into a zero point of interest.
