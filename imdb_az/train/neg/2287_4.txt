I just saw two films in the movie Gretchen Mol (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco) and I really do not remember her, but she did a great job as a loyal girl taking pictures because people were happy. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> <strong> She likes to see the excitement of cameramen and the politicians on pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night and Good Luck) played a super role here. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed the outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl.
