I liked the first movie very much. A beautiful comedy has appeared to me with a bit of smart moments. Costume designer Albert Wolsky did his best! It's the same as beautiful decorator Robert R. Benton - this guy really tasted good! But writer writers were surprised at me. The best ending will be the scene on the ladder, but instead decided that their father and daughter would be together. Do not love the end. The father becomes his girlfriend and his old friend knows about it and finds it well. If scenarios say, for example, that the body has a different spirit, they are simply deprived of their memories. The actors were good and really funny. Sibill Shepherd was attractive, Robert Downey Jr was very funny in the dance field :))) ... But in some moments a good player's impression also breaks. For example, Corinne Jeffries, who played by Cybill Coban, his wife, has been waiting for her for more than 23 years (often!), She is just not liked by anyone and when she gets to the stage with her friend Philip Train (Ryan O'Neal) he loved her so much, and she betrayed those who longed for many years! It would be a good movie if it did not end and we did not release some human psychology.
