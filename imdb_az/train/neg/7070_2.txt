Boy oh boy oh golly gee, The most interesting thing in the film was the dissatisfaction of the bluescreen effects used to create the "invisibility" of the mother. They seemed to be drawn in a cheap video and it looks totally unreal, and so is the good thing that is so funny movie ending ... <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Experimental "steadicam" shots were really miserable. I would like to say that if they have low budget flickers. You can still make a great movie with low budget. However, a BAD movie and low budget and effects. This leads to bad association. In this case, such a condemned combo created the movie "Invisible Mom". If you have children and your children have no taste, they will probably be awakened from all of them.
