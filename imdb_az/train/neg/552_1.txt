I sat down with an episode of this series and could not get it anymore. It felt as if the episode was watching them and then hit me ..... There's nothing new here! I heard a joke in Seinfeld, I saw friends falling like someone, The Happy Days episode was almost the same story, ect. Not all actors here are interested! Some are good at other shows (not here), others are new to a profession they never entered. Avoid this stinker!
