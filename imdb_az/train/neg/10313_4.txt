It was hard to catch the movie, and when I finally saw it, it was a lot of disappointment. So it is probably one of the greatest stories of the 20th century: an unknown person benefits from the innocent airline industry and achieves millions of freedom without hurting anyone or leading to hell. With all of these internal interests, how could this flick of a real life event trigger such a whisper. While Williams is always interesting, the scenarist D.B. Cooper persona was strangely bizarre as a star of the film, and we did not have any kind of surprising information that we obtained, or enough of a man's courage to do it. Harrold's film, boldly and positively, did not miss the movie, but he managed the true excitement surface and the lame direction. It even exists in this movie.
