If Todd Sheets acknowledged that this film was meant to go out and hide the genre of zombie, I could change my rating eight times. Imagine a scene, each scene, line and even a movie designed to be a parody of every actor's nuance. Perhaps I'll embrace alphabet soup, re-arrange the letters, and still have a better script. Especially two scenes come to mind when thinking of this movie. SPOILER ALERT! First, when Mike's father and other daddy go, I want to go down a staircase full of zombies. It is a small staircase and is a cunning mood, but nothing happens. When it finally arrives, it turns around the old sea and says, "God is a bastard, and you hit only one." It is in another military complex. The girl is a zombie stabs with machete and is immediately covered. The camera moves around forty seconds, and the zombie runs through the length of the weapon. It almost came out by chance and united other people. FOR SPOILER ALERT! These scenes need to be believed. Still, I love this movie as much comedy as it is so damn culprit. To Todd Sheets, Kudos has taken a lot of people in his film and has a drive to do so, but not for anything else.
