At least a low budget effort from Texas, which is a good film, but that's not a little comfort. Bad actor, or, I must say, bad, invaluable, new, bad, special, bad, bad, bad, not a pretty strange storyline. It looks like a group of young people put a haunted house for Halloween every year, but this year there are different things. There is a long flavor that does not just cause anxiety, but a lot of empty spots that completely fill it. Putrid, courageous, definitely inevitable.
