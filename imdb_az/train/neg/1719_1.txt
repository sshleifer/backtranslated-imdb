The Crater Lake Monster is made up of the most horrific, amateur movie I've ever seen - Manos, Fate Hands in terms of poor, inactive, useless direction and production levels at kindergarten level. In this film, a meteorite loses a lake in Bumblebum, CA, with a foolish-looking church / stop-motion animated dinosaur awakening and eating in the local haysets. In a thrilling peak, a creature depicted as a "wild giant crocodile", the bulldozer drags the top of the earth to follow his meal before drowning several times and dying of boredom. The moovie is a complete moron of each character. A trivial subplot shows a hick to go to a liquor store to buy a ripple $ 4.75 pint; Instead of buying bottles, it stabs a foolish cashier and other supporters, shoots the police, chases the lake, and can eat all by the monster. The unhappy approach of the beast can not be anything but a piece of strobe. He is a fake magician, fights with an English accent (more legitimate), two overbearing redneck boats, a colorful "pre-historic cave art" decorated with a colored pencil and a boring borjo-pickin 'background moosic. On a painful scene, the fictional magician and his dopey wife / girlfriend / helper will be able to add an extra 4 minutes to the movie to show how it can look in the sky at night, though obviously during the day. Even in continuous progress, this moovie hurts and gets worse. MooCow calls fumigators because this cake is really bad! : = 8P
