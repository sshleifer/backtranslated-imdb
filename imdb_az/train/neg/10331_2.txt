When I watched this pilot, God was shuddering on my head. I was expecting a lot from this because I'm a great admirer of James Cameron (not just "Titanic") and, as I thought, his name was a quality assurance, he wrote strange times. But it was difficult for me to focus on at any point in two hours. At all times, it went beyond the two rows and it would be very difficult to try and prove any kind of confusion that has not gone anywhere. Moreover, I do not think that the acrobatics are even beyond the regular "A-Team" episode. As for Alba, yes, she is, of course, beautiful, but she's just showing me a face-to-face (pouty and neat) expression, and it also shows me a very "gentle attitude" very often. You call me like that, Mr. Cameron!
