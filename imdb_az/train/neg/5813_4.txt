Tierney is a genuinely challenging man, but this film is usually surprised by the RKO, which reduces its impact on every turn. The scenario is acceptable on OM Simpson's On Mmmandments dinner. Only Tierney's fabulous companions are following one another for their ugly and violent behavior. In this regard, the old clich√© "only happens in the film" is used here in the summer. Later, there is a guy watching as it seems to have wandered through a long-lasting WC Fields comedy that violates the dangerous mood in this process. Static room sets also do not help, and film director Feistin has no lack of material feelings. Then add a final car track that does not lose both your dreams and your paying capacity, and the results are pretty straightforward. In fact, the film is selected only in police stations where stationary houses discovered the secret powers of the innocent gas station workers. Tieney's career did not really laugh at all. It's as big as getting on leaked one after the other, just as it's on the screen like a tough guy. His frozen style and the clarity of his feelings remind me that Lee Marvin is good at his tough boy. In any case, this project could have worked as a radio player, but this is a disappointment as a film with a promising nose header.
