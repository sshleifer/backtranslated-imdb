We went to a movie with a band because the game we were going to cancel was canceled. Surely one of the worst films ever. It's not me that the movies I do not like me. But there is nothing in the film. One has nothing to do with the characters. without endless dialogue. And the car. How big a tent and bed chairs and clothes are there for the car every day? It's two people! <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ div> <br /> /> I do not recommend it, because it is the loss of your time
