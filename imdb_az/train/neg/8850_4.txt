Now this film will not scare anyone, but for two reasons - two big reasons and one smaller thing - this is also three reasons. <br /> <br /> The first reason is that these are special effects. I found something very interesting and spectacular. <br /> <br /> Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning were creepy to see their growing hair. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt was a brilliant fairy tale with the famous "Brown" Rolling Stones "song" Sugar "and she was in the stage of rock music shooting in London. <br /> <br /> Apart from special effects, there were other notes, and they were repeatedly withdrawn during final loans, but I lost my account, but Sybil Danning kept these points for at least ten, and maybe even more closing credits, the most prominent feature of the film.
