We have all done some epic in our time, but it really does all of them! The film was so long and so slow that when I entered here to put some promising things, I felt a lot bigger when I left the movie hall. It could have been almost 4 hours long, more tele-series. <br /> <br /> What started as a prospective comedy slowly loses its speed. Nikhil's advani can wrap around a love story 6 and not justify any of them ... There is no interconnection between them, and the relationship shown in the last 20 minutes is only forced to merge the story. <br /> <br /> Political dialogues (much of which are recurring for years in Indian cinemas) and even worse than the stupid cinematic situation. <br /> <br /> Priyanka is really not looking to play a role, just looking glam on the screen ... <br /> And then loud-humorous Govinda and my face-twists-better-than-silk <br /> <br /> Only a good role in the film is John & Vidya's love story and a wonderful game / comedy by traveler and hire. But they are so good in their roles that these two couples could be justified without moving the other group image. <br /> <br /> My guess is that the director has two separate films (may be more!) And a startup assistant has gone beyond a point where all the notes are confusing. listening to them, the director had no choice to show all films as a single movie ... <br /> <br /> Just look at your patience to try!
