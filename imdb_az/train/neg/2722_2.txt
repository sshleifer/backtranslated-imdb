For the great thinkers among us, "The Intruder" is a stunning movie that is named after the so-called "fictional films" from France. The story is about something in search of a heart transplant in Tahiti, but it's about an old old suit Louis Trebor (Michel Subor), but they have no idea who they are or what they are doing. The movie, which has not been associated with any related story, loses us early, even though you can really have SOMEBODY, which can receive a deep message from this movie. <br /> <br /> This dark, snailfire drama works two hours and five minutes - although it will depend on the final credit for anyone with any life.
