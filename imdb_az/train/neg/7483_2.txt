I think it's supposed to be at least a decent movie with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese (like me). These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the all-time comedy pieces. <br /> <br /> No, I was wrong - this is one of the worst films I have ever had. i saw This is how much of a joke can be as bad as one after another. I was shocked by the fact that I did not carry out one of the most nicer scripts in which to deal with these talented actors. I was hopeful for a long time along the length of the film, which was based only on big names, but I was not able to sustain all kinds of entertainment at all. <br /> <br /> Generally, both in film and in life, biased interpretations and extensive generalizations. But with this movie, it is difficult not to waste. On the one hand, perhaps with two or three fingers, I can count on the great Hollywood production that has made me bitter. It's one of the easiest comedy to compile. <br /> <br /> I tried to love it. But Out-of-Towners eventually fails to fail. If you really want a fun time, take your money and curl it when you put it under the toilet. Just do not watch this movie.
