When I'm a kid, I love this show. I thought the helicopter was the best I've ever seen. It was ultra high-tech for the time. Misleading enemy fire, making every kind of acrobatics in the air, and falling into something of this sort. I'm back now and watching today, and I'm surprised at how bad this show is. There are very difficult, very unpleasant moments and the battle scenes are incredibly false images. And in almost every end, the same helicopter fights seedlings. There are many images of the Vietnam War era. <br /> <br /> Airwolf basically chooses the same theme as Knight Rider, a helicopter of a car, except for pre-election criminals. After watching several episodes, I found myself very bored. But I love the theme music.
