Cruel intentions are bloody, terrible, uber-bad. Words can not explain how bad it is, but in any case I will give way. <br /> <br /> The two areas of the cruel intent are very similar to the first film. Sebastian (Robin Dunne) was dismissed from a private school and forced to move to New York. There is a new beginning and only one life has decided to make a normal life. Unfortunately, she wants to slip with her sister, Kathryn (Amy Adams). Sebastain begins to fall into the innocent daughter of the school director Danielle (Sarah Thompson). Kathryn wants to sleep with Sebasta in all schools described as "a prostitute". Kathryn wants to take revenge on the Cherie (Keri Lynn Pratt), who humiliates her at school. <br /> <br /> Kathryn wanted to turn the first-grade student into the biggest prostitute in the school, making a sub-similar plan to the first film. The Severe Intention 2 is a canceled TV show, mostly translated into a prequel. There are many problems with the movie. Poorly written, unfunny and bad move. Fortunately for Amy Adams, this show has never been dropped, because now it's a pretty great actress. Cruel intentions have a realistic sense of reality and, despite the real world, Severity Intentions has been placed on 2 sitcom sites and depicted on the amazon.co.uk in the Randy version of Bell. The first film had some dark topics with regard to sex and drug use, but they were trying to make it funny in Hateful Intentions 2 and some ideas in the film, for example, with Kathryn's teacher. Other ideas do not work as a secret society where all popular children are discussing the fall of other students. The film creates a 15/16 year old sexual problem. I know that adolescents are sexually exploited, sometimes there are many things, but when they're done on film or television, they are treated very seriously. Daneille was a celebrity when promoting Daneille (film 14/15) to sexually assert that she was a sex orgasm behind her horse. The idea of ​​turning a girl into a prostitute at 14:15 is very wrong with me and should not be included in the comedy. <br /> <br /> Sebastian Kathryn was going to an ant for the first time in the mud. <br /> <br /> There are many things to do. I have no time to mistake this movie, but I'm saying it should be avoided. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a direct sex dream, and schoolboys are in very tight sex with each other. This film is just a frustration, but not a classic, yet worthwhile movie and looks good on the subject. .
