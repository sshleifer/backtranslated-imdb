I have not watched a movie in very little time. It is only a fast forward function in the recovery DVD unit. It was like watching a poor CBC movie. Obviously, there was no money for lighting, shooting, gangs, space, scenario writers, editors, actors ... Oh, there was absolutely no story! I have to write ten lines ... bad, horrible, terrible, unhappy, miserable, complicated, bilious, nauseous, nauseating, predatory, abominable, benevolent, icky, yucky, pukey, stinky, smelling, bad, ugly and I'm I do not know if I can continue to finish all the ten lines of how crap-o-matic is so bad.
