I have no idea that these charmers at the Cannes Film Festival in 1999 donated this movie to Palm D'Or. In fact, I was just watching all things because someone would have made such a worthless movie for me. There is nothing interesting about the field, the heroes are deprived of depth and there is no attempt to give any air with music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to spend 2 hours of your life watching this movie, make sure that cinematography simply brings you something that you can not do even after half an hour. See the main themes. This style has been used more successfully in movies like "Blair Witch" because it creates a flaw. There is no plot in Rosetta, and there is no decline in this style. When it comes to 2 o'clock in the morning, I have to get to know better, which will be terrible.
