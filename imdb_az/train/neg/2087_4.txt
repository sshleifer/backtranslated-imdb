Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson) finds a perfect woman, although Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman), who seems to be a quiet, but beautiful woman, soon finds out she is unnecessary and possessive, and he is also a super hero G-Girl <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> > My Super Ex-Girlfriend is still a pleasant comedy but cheap sex jokes are based on too much and a memorable experience ends. What happened? Casting and the director could not overcome the weakness of the script, and I played it. I was expecting the boy to be crushing, and this woman could be a fantasy film of revenge. But they made the boy happy and made a super hero a psychologist. It was not very surprising, and about a dozen minutes later, the movie liked it. Of course, there were a few funny lines, but a moderate and terrible end resulted in a real breakthrough. <br /> <br /> Director Ivan Reitman has lost his touch. After a successful business in the eighties and early 90's, Evolution and Father's Day began to resemble. I can not say that Super Ex-Girlfriend is a complete bust, but I do not give it to anyone with the quality of the film. Don Payne did a terrific job with the scenario. Most of the jokes were naked and most of the supporting characters were just a note. <br /> <br /> Several actors were good enough to rescue. Uma Thurman was great as G-Girl and had very funny lines. Luke Wilson was somewhat faded and not very interesting. I do not think he is making it attractive to a leading human and it is better to support roles like Family Stone. Anna Faris just called "Scary Movie" and becomes a little old. You'll need a problem or at least some good script. Wanda scored either for Sykes or for me. She was great in Monster-In-Law and she was bad at Secret 2. Here, he is just annoying and does not bring anything to the film. Eddie Izzard was good, nothing special. Rainn Wilson was just a villain and funny. Generally, I'm disappointed with the movie. It was extremely moderate because it did not have much potential. Rating 5/10
