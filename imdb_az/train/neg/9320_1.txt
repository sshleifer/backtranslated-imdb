If this film was a comedy, I'd give it 10. Oh, where did I start? Put it in this way - I've seen some awesome movies, but this trolls like Troll 2 as "Private Ryan's Storage". A group of porn filmmakers decided to make a movie movie, midproduction changed their mind and decided to play a comedy, then returned to horror, and then decided that they just stuck with porno (softcore on this subject). Everything about this movie is simply horrible: musical score (someone hits the guy who invented Yamaha keyboard), script, director, cinematography, actor. There are no words to describe this simply. Oh wait, yes yes: Sacred $ *% !.
