Evil Aliens owed a large debt to Bad Taste and Braindead from Peter Jacksons' early films. I have to admit that I do not like these films, and I say the same about it. Jake West is a director who chooses not to have his own inspiration and stealing. Most of Hollywood's films, mostly James Camerons Aliens, have been lost. The amount of blood and gore shown in the show is not laughable, but the final end of the film is exhausted. would have worked better as a short film. Players are poor, the route is weak and the plot is non-existent. What the headmaster is trying to do is pay respect, but others have done the same thing as he has presented here. 4/10
