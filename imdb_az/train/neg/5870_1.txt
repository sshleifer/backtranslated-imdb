I have never loved this movie! First and foremost, why not, but here everyone says that Clémence Poésy's game is very good, and that's totally inaccurate! Not like Natasha: another look, another character ... A worse, too novice actress and therefore could not play this role! Hero has completely ruined her! It was really disgusting to watch his game! In my opinion, it would be better to give this role to a Russian actress, because it would be easier for Russia to understand a man in Russia. Unfortunately, Kutuzov is a drunk man who has not been shattered for two weeks and is not defeated in a battle he lost ... (Thankfully, in this film, there is a great player! Alessio Boni was very good at his job! I was pleasantly surprised! is one of the few people who do not read the book, which is very important to read, to watch them)) The thing I liked in this work was beautiful images and beautiful clothes! My advice is to read books and to understand the true purpose of Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece, to understand the purpose and to grasp the whole idea of ​​the book ... From 1 to 10
