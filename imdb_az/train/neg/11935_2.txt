Billy Chung Siu Hung (Bloodthirsty Swordsman Assassin) film, Love To Kill (Hong Kong, 1993), is one of the strongest products in the boom of the III category in the early 90s of HK cinema. It consists of movies with strong sex, nudity and violence, fewer or less rebuilt and shocking. Lovingly killing involves some of the most unforgettable ideas and "more" categories of celluloid diseases. <br /> <br /> HK psychologist Anthony Wong (who was awarded the "Untold Story" by Herman Yau since)) is a businessman and a nigaran, a little tortured, humiliating, and Elizabeth Lee Mei Fung, who wants to rape her. A cop (Danny Lee) by Dr. Billy Tang Anthony, of course, is not something like this and all the rainfall is associated with Lamb (1992) and Lee's co-authorship films and John K. (featured actress named The Killer (1989) by John Woo) makes it a typical ultra-medium inspirational and graphic final during the storm. <br /> <br /> Although these types of films are very popular, it's almost as exclusively as part of an exploitation to earn money, with no absolute superiority. Imaginations and incidents, at least as a rule, are never found in Western cinema, and some of the interpretations of the Westerners, like witnesses and disorders, are diminished by these films, as <br /> <br /> This film is still she has a very interesting and creepy song. The mentioned Dr. According to the Lamb's tradition, the whole boom began in 1992. Music and music in HK films, especially those in terror films, are interesting and add to the footage. Cinematography should be regarded as immersed in the film, especially in the finale, blue colors and camera lenses (as Assassin), and the angry storm is captured in a beautiful manner on the camera. Otherwise, there is nothing to be said about the film's superiority over the nastiness. <br /> <br /> Actresses and actresses are talented and professional, and do not worsen the film with their actions. The film still has the usual HK humor, so some "humor" is thrown into the soup and the sickness is getting worse. Some jokes about Danny Lee's erection and so on. Includes ... something that can never be found in the "serious" films of the West. <br /> <br /> This film, in contrast to the HK films, is remarkably destructive because humor is only clear and attempts to entertain the audience and the masses. <br /> <br /> The film has a very high level of ugliness because there are numerous scenes. Wong's spouse has been abused by various means. He is exposed to aggression, being beaten and thrown by the husband and wife. We will also see some flashbacks that Vong had in his childhood as well as the same violence that his own father had killed and turned his young son into a state of now being. These flashback scenes that occur at the end of the movie include an unexpected experience as accelerated images (for example, axes) and create a totally crazy and charming scene on the stage. Again, HK is something that can be encountered by exploiters. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is indeed quite "suspicious". It deals with things that should not be perceived as realistic as painful and never fun, as violence and terror, mainly aggression. The version I have seen (I have seen two versions) contains a very long and totally heartbreaking aggression scene, and wants to be as sadistic as possible. I do not believe that HK viewers really do not see it as footage, but in movies / entertainment, no one who is of any importance to morality will think or admit it. <br /> <br /> The other version I've seen is the brutal and murdered in the most sadistic and low ways that tells the destiny of men compared to women in the new release DVD in HK (without). subtitles) has a longer form of subtitled Taiwanese DVD, which is similar to the HK version on the "table cruelty" scene. I've heard that the old HK Laserdisc is two different, and when the last credits are filled with scenes and pictures that are not visible in the real movie, it's impossible to say what the "unpunished" versions of the missed or shown are. <br /> <br /> The film is written by Law Gam Fay and Lau Wing Kin. Previous film Dr. Lamb is written as The Untold. Story and Gunmen (Kirk Wong, 1988), but from other films I have seen, Kill Love is the most free. The Lamb and The Untold Story are both cruel and severe, and they also try to make some criticisms against the authorities and men that it is easy to be an animal or an animal in battle. The Untold Story, the tortured offender, is very powerful and has the potential to change things that can be rotten in the society and the police. However, there is no such thing as "Love Love", which is simply honest, calculated and quickly commissioned. This is a veteran director, Kirk Wong named "Organized Crime and Triad Bureau (1993), Crime Story (1993)"! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < (HK) is intended for the movie and can be more, and movies like Love for Kill are commercial parasites living amongst the true artwork.
