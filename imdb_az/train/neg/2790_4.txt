Julia (Kristina Copeland), her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their baby son, Alex, spend a few days at Savage Island for their family. Couple expects to spend their weekend away on a remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two strangers at the port, and when his brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that he has a hillbilly squatters family on the island. An angry Peter switches off the headlight to extinguish the smoke while the truck is overnight; But he accidentally worked on Savage's younger son, but in the dark he believed he was hit by an animal. Later, the Savage family claimed that Alex was paying for his lost son. Young people do not accept family trade and do not start a fatal war between families. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a foolish scenario, with amateur cinematography, but with a surprisingly good player, a very low-budget movie. The defective story is completely absurd and there are incredible situations. For example, how could two men leave two women and two women on the road during the delay? The logical procedure would immediately go to the continent and bring Peter to the rescue of Peter. Then the Young family lost; Julia and Steven leave the car on the continent, homes and friends, and no one is following them? Peter first called Alexi's sister Julian when she first came to the boat. There are so many lines on this lane that I can spend most of my articles on this subject. I believe that this film is shot with a home video camera, and the pictures are terrifying. Good drilling was a good job. <br /> <br /> Brazil: "Ilaha de Sangue" ("Blood Island")
