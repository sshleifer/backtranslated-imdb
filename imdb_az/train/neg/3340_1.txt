It wants to be good, but sucks the movie. First of all, what are the punks who want to engage in school? In my opinion, children do not understand the weight of the situation. Decker tells the girl that when he asks for their return because he is responsible, but after the right wheelchair hears his weapon and wants to repair the phone line alone. Where is the responsibility there? I understand poor actors need to pay for their food, but why not just give a money to make a stupid movie or give a favor to one another. Oh yes and none of them knows what their purpose is. The stupid punk guy hits the cafe somewhere as naked. They all want to be professional, but they all breastfeed. Children do not have extraordinary access to the school, but they all lock. What happens if there is a fire and the dumass security guard is dead? The absence of an emergency situation at school is illegal. There are many more to say, but it would be too long. I spent some of my life watching a crap.
