A Buster Keaton is a regular breach of your heart to become a fan. Many of us are faced with Keaton, one of the most prominent feature films of The Generals, The Navigator, Sherlock Jnr, which is a great era of independent production. We know him as the biggest figure in the whole film comedy, and we want to see more of his films. Here a heart attack begins. After Steamboat Bill Jnr, Keaton's mother, Joseph Schenck, pressed Keaton to sign a contract with MGM. Keaton was just another actor to execute others' scripts. Then alcoholism deteriorated. After 'Steamboat Bill Jnr', Keaton once again made a truly first-rate movie. Several sources describe Keaton's * comedy about a masterpiece allegedly prepared in almost MGM: Grand Hotel parody. Biographer Tom Dardis offered a convincing argument that Keaton created this story. <br /> <br /> After a long, steady decline of Keaton, she sometimes appeared in a good movie ... because of a short comedy named "Grand Slam Opera". On the dramatic scene of Keaton, I continue to look at the dramatic scene with Spencer Tracy on the "Mad Mad World": this torn cop is trying to help Tracy, a retired cop-phone (Keaton) phone, and Smiler Grogan's money. <br /> <br /> "Speak easily", unfortunately, is one of the Keaton films that began with his fall. MGM was trying to build Jimmy Durante (whom, incidentally, played three years later by Smiler Grogan) as a new comedian star. Unfortunately, MGM tried to build Durante with Keaton, something that was not compatible with comedy style Durante. Throughout his career, Durante was a legendary scene thief who, surprisingly, knew that he was built on Keaton's account, and Keaton Durante was the only co-star that did not try to get anywhere. <br /> <br /> Keaton was often killed as a victim of brutal persecution . "Speak easily," she is a Midwestern college professor named Post (like a wooden board) playing didactic and humorous. He told him that he had to travel to New York City, claiming he was worth $ 750,000. Does it make a phone call to check it? Does it even destroy the postage stamp? No; he takes away his life from the bank and runs to New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> "Post" Dodge (Durante) tries to produce a musical style, but has no money. The symbols of these two bright comedies on the screen just fail to intermesh. Keaton plays one of those egg boats for everything, like 'Viz' as Mister Logic. Durante plays one of these frustrating hits, which are unable to give any plain comment because he always requires scriptwriting. Durante Keaton has a painstaking restraint of dialogue with money, but instead of going straight it out - Durante "taiwan", "trams" and so on. Keaton certainly has no idea what Durante is about. <br /> <br /> I will give Keaton credit: her dry and dusty noisy sounds, straightforward Kansas accents are perfect for a character playing here. <br /> <br /> Sidney Toler, where it looks softer and more beautiful Just one year later, Professor Post is effective as an exciting head of revolutions (tick). Henri Armetta, I was never comedic, offering a stick that flies less funny and stupid than here. Thelma Todd influenced me in a more outsized version of the role she played in "Horse Feathers" (a very funnier film). <br /> <br /> Edwards Brofy is one of my most beloved actors. <br /> <br /> A part of the problem 'Speak easily' means that supporting characters is completely inappropriate. Keaton's lawyer arrives at Durant's theater with an urgent message for Keaton ... but he is not the first to explain the personality of Keaton, the lawyer. At another stage, Prof. Post - a man and all the choir girls who are involved in the changing room for the girls who stage the musical errors immediately compress and cover themselves. I really know that modern lady girls will never react in this way, and I do not doubt the behavior of the choir in 1932 ... of course, the "angel" who will rule their show will come CLAIM. Jimmy Durante, a great Jimmy Durante, sits on the piano, joins the camera, and begins to play a rhythm, making his head slightly shaken. I thought this movie was going to solve our amusing goal for a long time. Alas, no. Most of these are the end of this movie, which uses the single most hackneyed and incredible cliche in all comedies: a totally incompetent dimvit becomes a star comedian with his inability. (Keaton would have to repeat that clich√© in 1955 in the "Screen Directors Playhouse" episode); <br /> <br /> I was very close - in anger and grief - 'talk so easily' that wasted opportunities. Keaton, Durante, Toler, Brophy, and Miss Todd will respect the work done elsewhere, and I will evaluate this movie from 2 to 2 children. <br /> <br />
