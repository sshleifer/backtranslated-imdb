LOC could have been a very good film about how the War of Cargill was fighting; Finding places, budgets and skills for India to "Save Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down". Instead, it is seen as an exaggerated, 4 hour hole trying to force a war movie to suit the film. The scenes of war used even the same hinges on all battle scenes and spent the time unnecessarily in random conversations. Instead of appealing to the Indian people, a better movie would be a book account for the events in Kargil ("Black Hawk Down") or even nationalist ("Tora", "Tora, Tora.") Even better, he could use an authoritative author, such as Ram Gopal Verma, to write, edit, and edit movies, and I would like to re-edit this movie only for a while, and the film could be watched more.
