A number of brides are killed in a mysterious manner at the victim, and then the corpses are sent off to the body. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter has decided to investigate these mysterious crimes. Before each ceremony, the bride sees that she has found a potent drug that is a rare orchid (supposedly supposedly). Patricia, orchid, is primarily a Dr. living with his wife. It is said that he was raised by Lorenz. In fact, Dr. Lorenz is responsible for crimes, putting the bride in a state of abandonment, using her body to keep her husband alive forever. Patricia, Dr. Together with Foster (working with Dr. Lorenz and his wife working around medical secret) Lorenzin tried to force her hand into a fake wedding and eventually led Patricia to the clutches of a mad doctor. This movie was a very good opening reel, but it ended with lots of shooting and other weak scenes. The cast is worthy, the Walters and the Coffin are more worthy, but this is life. Russell performs today's presentation of the Hollywood prima donna as Countess Lorenz, which plays a role in the features of many stereotypical features (even the Lugosi, which does not give one of its more memorable performances, given its Monogram). The weakness and flawlessness ends. Rating based on B films, 4.
