The film uses a cutting edge hood for a wit story. Kill Kill, it would be nice. The film combines taboo scenes to move the audience on the podium. The scenes are unnecessary and desperate. The film is something that can be a novice screen writer. Loss of only one movie and network money. To criticize this film, I have to write a 10-line text that does not deserve 10 lines of time, but let people know to avoid nonsense. If people consider it a good choice for a movie night, choose something else. If you have a soul, do not hurt yourself by exposing yourself to this evil.
