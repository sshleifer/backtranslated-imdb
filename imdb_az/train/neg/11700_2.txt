I really looked forward to seeing this movie, but after looking at it I really was disappointed. It was the best thing when Stephen was in the King. Rober John Berk can not move to save his life, and can be one of the others. Some of the hints made me laugh too loud! The film was not as we imagined, but after the reading of the book I imagined it dark and very scary. <br /> <br /> According to my invitation, this is very important to me. <br /> <br /> If you know that my daughter's daughter is killing, will you not eat another? <br /> <br /> The book was very good!
