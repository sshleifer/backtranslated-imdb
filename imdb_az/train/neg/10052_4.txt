Warner Bros did a lot of potboilers in the 1930s, and most of them were fast paced, economical, and very entertaining. I like how our studio uses less glamorous elements of our everyday life. This is just one of Warner's hard-working curved melodramas. Edward G. Robinson plays an angry newspaper editor in the newspaper and resurrects a 20-year-old murderous tragedy. Robinson gives a live performance, but he is surrounded by mustard-cut actors. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Carloff are good, but the bad acts of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell really hurt the film in the second film. Starr is particularly bad at the big dramatic scene near the end of the movie. In addition, the moral tone of the film is ridiculous in the context of Hollywood. LeRoy's direction is full of innovative visual touches, but it can not overcome bad behavior and unwanted fun situations. Left Polito's camera business is strong. In any case, this piece is part of the Oscar nomination for the best picture ("M", "Dracula" and "Frankenstein").
