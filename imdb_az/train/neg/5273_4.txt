*** APPLICATIONS *** *** APPEARS *** When I saw a preview for this movie I thought this atleast would be a little astonishing storyline. But as most superstation original films I was disapointed. This flawless family takes the driver out of this "outdoors" city to get a brake and finds this video showing everything that shows the people that they are insane and ultimately disappears, the family carries all these mysterious stages, and heck them stalking. They have more gaps than I can think of, and they do not explain how and what happens. The family ends with a car accident and ends with a posest or a brainwasher or something (this is never disclosed). The next thing you know is how he understands his heart, but leaves you in a completely confused way.
