W. Somerset Maugham (1874-1965), author of numerous novels, plays and short stories, has been regarded among the world's greatest authors throughout his lifetime and his work is genuinely respectable for many years, and his work is genuine respect and great publicity. RAZOR'S EDGE, published in 1944, is a story of a WWII veteran who searches for spiritual enlightenment because of steep western values. It was Maugham's latest novel, and it was very popular. Considering that Romani's conflicts have intimidated moral and philosophical issues, it is also a strange choice for the movie version, but Darryl F. Zannuck, the philosopher of the 20th century, fell in love with the book and denied screen rights a little after publishing. <br /> <br /> According to filmmaking, Razor's Edge Maugham would be directed by the legendary George Cukor in the script, and Maugham had written an adaptation. When the film began to produce, Chuck was replaced by an art director, Edmund Goulding, who was known as an indispensable workman, and replaced Lamar Trotti, the author of such memorable scenarios, Lamar Trotti. EXPLANATION DESCRIPTION. Tyrone Power, who recently returned from military service during the Second World War, was raised as a controversial Larry Darrell; Gen Tierney, one of the most beautiful of his time, was removed as socialist Isabell Bradley. Herbert Marshall, Anne Baxter, Clifton Webb, Lucille Watson and Elsa Lanchester, especially the player who drew attention. Both the budget and the layout plan were luxurious, and the film was so delighted by the public and critics that it came out in 1946. <br /> <br /> But putting the time into perspective has one way. Today's RAZOR'S EDGE is actually a beautiful movie - but for this we can say a good thing, that it is a very consistent mediocre. As in many cases, the main problem is the script. Although close to Maugham's novel, he differs significantly from character in terms of character and does not miss the main issues that govern the story. We are informed that Larry is in the enlightenment case; what we have received; we say that we have followed him - but in spite of random and largely superficial interpretations, there is no information about the spiritual, artistic, philosophical and intellectual processes behind any one. We have not said anything particularly important about the nature of light. <br /> <br /> We left the shell of Maugham's structure, based on relationships between Larry and Isabell, a woman likes Larry and breaks through the growing ideological reefs. Tyrone Power and Gen Tierney were celebrated for more physical beauty than talent, but both were able to turn into good speeches after receiving strong bureaucratic and script support. Unfortunately, it does not happen here; they are quite a note and Power is an example of a great boot boot. Fortunately, the supporting player, Herbert Marshall, is quite good with Clifton Webb and Lucille Watson; <br /> <br /> Anne Baxter did not wear a performance she'd hoped for later. <br /> <br /> For just over two and half hours, the film feels unnecessary for a long time. As you can see, there is a similarity to the infinite cocktail party, and indeed the entire Indian segment (as it is singing extensively) is a single situation, so it is the mass of the whole film's hero. Regardless of the particular scene, all of them are just going on and do not come to the actual point of view. <br /> <br /> As for the DVD itself, the movie is not revised, but the print is very good, the bonus package is not particularly memorable, nor is it much weaker. When all is said and done, I will give RAZOR's EDGE as its production values ​​and everyone's readiness to receive the material - but this is clearly a movie, the power to enjoy the stars and the Tierney fans at its best. <br /> <br /> According to Rustam Ibrahimbayov,
