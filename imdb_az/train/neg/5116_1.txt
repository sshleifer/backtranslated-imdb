I hired this movie, which I think may be a good football movie today, because I'm a great footballer. My son, I made a mistake. This film is very religious and preachy and is really unreal. This movie pretty much says that if a Christian can easily get everything you want in his life, like being a great footballer! Being a Christian and asking God to become a great footballer, you practice it and work hard. All you have to do is ask God, and he will give you something .... puh-lease. All this is not true, duh. He laughed several times because of this shame. When it was fun, only a part (Shultz, a cartoonist, a friend flying over the Atlantic, etc.), but this movie was not really good. Especially if you are not a Christian I do not recommend it.
