I do not go out of the way to comment often, but for this I see only a comedy that I should warn everyone who can think and follow. It is not close. Although the two black boys turned into two white girls (color / gender / change), it is one of the most convincing changes on the screen, though it's pretty bad (and, better, than ever before). It would be bad if everything required by the script could change the white chicks. Nevertheless, the Wayans brothers must hide themselves as two special white women. Now, as you can imagine, they are completely unsuccessful. Make up these two more convincing women with makeup people who can provide the best special effects and Hollywood you've seen drag queens without makeup. Terrible. Add to a basketball player built like a building, a terrific dialogue from a golf course, and more space holes, and this movie is a new personality. And I love bad movies! Avoid as tuberculosis.
