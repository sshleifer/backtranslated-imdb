I went to see the Omega Code with a group of about 15 other Christians. We were all waiting for a good piece of Christian movies. What we did was an exciting, drawn and extremely dull attempt. It has good visible production values, also has weak action, poor script with bad dialogue, and has no real aspect. For the first 15 minutes, we all knew it would be a long night. We all hate it and some people in our band have put this movie more like Anaconda than cheese reactions. None of us believed that the movie lasted less than 2 hours. Naked Effect and Deep-Looking Cinematography can not save this bad, bad movie. I would give these 10 to 3 and the rating is high, because I hired a movie "Kurtadam (1996) night and day before seeing this movie.
