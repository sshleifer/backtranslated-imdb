Ok, for the first time at Cinemax at 9:00, I saw this movie for the first time, and I think it will be a reward. This movie is a great bit. That is, the mother of wolves shows only the true form of the film at the end of the film. I'm going "What's this? Why does not it show it in the movie a while ago?" Mother and son holiday in the blood of young women. Some young women would be better off killing their killing, then find a way to find sheriff or police and kill monsters, rescue young women / women, and killed 1 or 2 others in the process? I think this kind of hell would be better. It is also due to his son's character and his first killing. Why not be saved? Of course, he has that power at the end of the film when he starts killing people? He said he was too weak. What was wrong with Stephen this time? Regardless of whether I have acted in any movie by any actor, I will never do anything, of course, trying to do their best. If it did not work well, I would give this movie 1/10. 3/10.
