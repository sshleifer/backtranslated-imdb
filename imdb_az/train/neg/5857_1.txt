WWF Survivor Series 2001 This was one of the worst events of 2001. Perhaps his biggest flaw was the fact that most of the previous Survivor series did not match. "The ONLY Survivor Series match lasted about 45 minutes, and everyone working with a brain knows that they will meet Rock and Austin. but it did not need any of these fools. "<br /> <br /> According to the famous player, it was just a wrestling event It was a good fast paced match and it was good to see a heel winning a good match.Thiriri was against William Regal and we saw it 2 or 3 times, but the test against Edge was good, but nothing great.The bar cage match titles were It was the best game, and the Royal Royal War lasted 10 minutes and no I did not really want to win the first place.Women's header matches were not big, but it's not a small thing, but the main event is the most complicated game in history. The Alliance lost, but after five months postponed what the Union's superstar was. The match itself was poor. The rock broke three of them and Jericho lifted it. 2. When the rock started to be very tortured, he was caught with his teammate there. Jericho, the whole match was in danger. If it were to be erased in the early stages of any one, I would have them. Everyone knew that Kane, the Big Show and Undertaker were just fallen in love with the kids. 7 matches are not enough for a Survivor Series. If there were no Survivor series so bad then I'll do it again
