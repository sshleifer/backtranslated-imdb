The only thing that is often over my head when writing this review is that I'll never get this and a half back! I'll just compare with other cub trilogy (cube and hypercube) films to tell you that the air is blowing! the cube is not big, but it was original and prepared for some technical shortcomings! The hypercube subsequently lost the advantage of originality, but it appeared pretty sharp and even better than the cube (the story was better)! but cube zeros are not really good compared to its predecessors, good fx is a complete lack, very f * ck * d up script and just plain old bad move does not combine well! For example: I would think it would be incredible folly if it happened and then happening in the movie all the time, so it is not very original! My advice: I did not lose half the time !!!!!!!! oh and hope this film is falling and burns !!!!!!!
