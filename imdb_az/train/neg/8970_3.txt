The first Cube movie was an art movie. They created a world where all the main archetypes of humanity are represented, and have shown that they are trying to understand the unfamiliar enemy world. At this non-literal level, the person representing innocence and goodness was the area of ​​"cruel nature," where he was confronted with a new, indefinite world, beyond the confusion of man; a world where there is no greater struggle, but peace. <br /> <br /> The second movie, Hypercube, was a big disappointment. Some ideas were cool, but in the context of the original film, both the story and the setting did not make any sense and did not make any sense. Still, I've downloaded it from 10 to 5, so much fun. <br /> The third film, Cube Zero, does not see the latter, primarily as a low-level B-film rehash, symbolism sans. There is no "respect" or "respect" here; there is only breaking. It had the same structure as some elements (some of them changed as legends instead of head numbers - this is a clearer idea than absolutely peculiar and nothing to say). <br /> <br /> Seeing "Behind the scenes" does not mean anything, because guards are part of a big bad Experiment. And in this movie, those who went out (killed at the end of the first movie like Kazan) were killed - * bleep * in that sense? This is just foolishness. <br /> <br /> Cube Zero's production values ​​and functionality are not bad, but stories and ideas are completely deprived of this movie's lack of inspiration. I only get 3 out of 10 ratings.
