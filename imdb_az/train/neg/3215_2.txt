The film has a nuclear scene: A man sitting on the edge of the bed is drawn to the sex organs exposed in the middle of the screen. This is a pretty long scene. What was this point? <br /> <br /> Some of the films are very important to me. <br /> <br /> Well, it's very nice for me. None of these characters are even disliked. Audrey Tatou is certainly cute, but her character is an unhappy girl. <br /> <br /> I really do not recommend this movie. I was expecting her to be attractive and fresh, but she was unhappy. <br /> <br /> I was wondering if Basbug had learned a French family and looked at these characters. <br /> <br />
