"Laughter is a state of mind," and I'm afraid of Barry Levinson's comment. What did he think when preparing Toys? When he watched dreams, he saw a successful, funny fantasy? If so, he is different from me. This is an exciting picture of 90% of production design (and even a disappointment of cartoon colors). Robin Williams and Joan Cusack are humiliated as brothers and sisters of a toy mogul thrown as heritage of the plant when their grandfather dies. There is nothing far away from the comic (satirical or slapstick-smart) on the screen. It's right, creepy, ugly and worst. NO STARS from ****
