Too bad, I love Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director did not put it together. There are many moves, many words, but all come out of hockey. The director did not do his job. In the future unexpected action comes out of the net. A hopeless attempt to save the film appears to have a great deal. This version of "Rage" (DirecTV is issued as a credit in 1996) simply does not take time to watch it. Another manager would do better.
