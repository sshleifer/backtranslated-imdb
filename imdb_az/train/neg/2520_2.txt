Okay, this movie had a terrible structure. Only a single apocalyptic war rocked the film, even buying big robots and mixing them together. Instead of investing in the reconstruction of their own countries, each country will fight against robots that nobody can afford. Here's a better idea: to rely on our most efficient source, our belts, to fight against our battles. <br /> <br /> Everyone is talking about what the director is about. It is a good movie, it is a bad movie. There is no reason to give this movie credit for the director's probably sleeping? I was very glad to see this movie because it was joyful and funny that I had to laugh. I really did have a good time watching her, but except for a murderous killing (who does not believe this guy is a conspirator, so a surprise, but lame) is a jungle silent anyway. Mst3k did not see this. But I give a two-star rating, because nothing can be as bad as the fate of destiny. <br /> <br /> Budget is also not important, I've seen reasonable movies as nothing more than budgets, as cube. The story is not even logical and I've been doing better at school. <br /> <br /> There are eleven years of any secondary school game. <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie to watch and watch.
