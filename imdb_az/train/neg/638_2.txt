Well, the Earth is perhaps the most boring film I've ever seen in my life. The area is slow and incomplete. Acting is fun at the border. I love Paul Munie, and now we can say that I did not see a movie that did not really perform its true skills. The only saving grace I've seen with this movie is the value of production. The use of hundreds of videos throughout the film creates a very convincing and interesting environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create millions of extreme illusions are easily sold and revolutionary at the time. I can not say anything other than the cost of production is good and fun about this movie.
