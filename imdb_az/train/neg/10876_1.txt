What was the D-Movie movie? Bad fun, bad special effects, and the most horrific dialogues / stories I encountered. The only good thing here was a strange cop, called Coolio. The rest of the film is terrible and boring. It's not so bad, you laugh about it. It's just plain ridiculous. And compare it with Evil Dead Series Kim Tomb Raider can compare Indiana Jones (well, okay, at least Tomb Raider was Angelina Jolie)! 10 to 1
