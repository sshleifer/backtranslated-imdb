I'm a big fan of the Batman comics, and I'm thrilled when I can not find Batman anymore: Television Animation Series. I was thrilled to learn that there will be a new Batman animated film on television. <br /> <br /> First of all, I watched the first episode of the day I was shown and I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> First of all animation is very bad. It looks like a cheap, nasty Japanese anime. And then again, all modern cartoons are like that. <br /> <br /> Character designs are even worse. Batman looks more like Birdman, Catwoman looks more like Chihuahuawoman, Bane looks more like a red version of Hulk, Penguin Kung-Fu's master, Mr. Freeze, is a bitchy with icebergs and Riddler <br /> <br / > Gothic Marilyn Manson looks like each other (it's funny, because I'm not afraid to be a Gothic with talents and puzzles). <br /> <br /> The worst character design is Joker. He turned her into a monkey / dumb Bob Marley / Kung-Fu fighter! The joker is likely to be Batman's most deadly enemy, but this is a serious threat to the show because his murders are foolish and meaningless. In one episode, his plan was to put Joker's venom in dog food! Oh, how bad! Batman is an attractive and sophisticated character as he runs away from his parents' death and is therefore fighting crime. This version of Batman does not seem to be negligent with the death of his parents and is not interesting. He is not only a detective but also a warrior. If there is an enemy, he will not be able to beat, will not work for the enemy to find weak points as detective, and will build them a battle robot again. <br /> <br /> What you hate most about this show shows what they do to wrongdoers. We took everything that made them unpleasant and relative, and turned them into stereotypic bad guys. Man-Bat is the largest example. In comic strips, he is a tragic scientist who learns bats to cure the deaf. By testing himself, he suddenly turns himself into a giant bat. In this demonstration, he is a crazy scientist who intentionally wants to make himself a plain bat creature. Probably all slanders are; <br /> <br /> None of them, except the first and the two, have the actual cause for their murders. <br /> <br /> The worst characterization is Mr Freeze. In the novel, Freeze, a genius scholar, until the writer of the gospel Paul Dini gave the BTAZ episode "Ice of Heart", only giving him a new, more tragic, three-dimensional and unpleasant animation. The episode was so popular that its admirers accepted it as the true origin, and even used in novels as its origin. Batman and Robin used this unfortunate movie as the origin. In this show, there is a little singer thief before Mr Freeze. What do you think after Mr. Freeze? He's a small legendary thief! Great origin. <br /> <br /> As a fan of Batman, I did not like this comedy because I'm not a comedy, because I liked the BTAS, Batman cartoons. Hereafter, Tim Burton's Batman films and obviously beautiful Christopher Nolan Batman films came. None of them were 100% loyal to the comic, but they were still very good. <br /> <br /> This show-related problem does not have any depth, such as comic or BTAS, that makes other Batman media so popular. <br /> <br /> I gave this show a lot of luck. but watching more is something that makes me even more delighted. When Batman cartoons were something that everyone could do, I missed good old days.
