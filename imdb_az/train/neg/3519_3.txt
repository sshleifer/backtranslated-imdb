I love some Stallone movies, but this movie did not respond to my expectations. It's hard to believe this movie. For example, a group of terrorists falling into the wilderness is ready to survive for at least two days. Additionally, Stallone and the company are moving along the bridges and ladders that provide comfortable short cuts or plotting equipment in the desert. And Treasury police do not seem to have anything to do with local firefighters. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's a very good thing for me. <br /> <br /> Do not pay attention to any of your bad guys, or kill all of them. <br /> <br /> <strong> Economy> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
