Paul Naski has made many fears. In terms of quality, they vary widely until they are not good enough; and, unfortunately, the Hero is rising from the Tomb, closer to the latter. The conspiracy is only a deadly story of magic, wizard, or deadly (as it is here), but before the revenge against those who did not. And so on. something leads to another and the battlefield, which is soon to be executed, is still not good. The area is slow, pitiful drilling and the film is always meaningless. These characters perform diatribe reams and never serve the movie in any way. Paul Naski wrote a script and asks me if the dialogue is too sensitive, and only serves to make the movie more intense. Carlos Aured, Broken Doll The Blue Eyes also directed Naschi on the devil's curse, where there is nothing to help the film that loves dialogue. Sometimes similar crap films have a certain charm about them; But the hero does not even come out of the tomb. This is an awesome drill movie, with little or nothing in the exciting way.
