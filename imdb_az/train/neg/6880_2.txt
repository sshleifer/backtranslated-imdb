It was exciting to announce that someone wanted to be a Puerto Rican documentary. When I heard that I was Rosie Perez, I wondered if she really liked to be a Puerto Rican. I knew .... he was a Nugariqan. In any case, I sat down with an angry angel to watch. I spent 10 minutes worried about my first concern. Rosie Perez has little information as he wants to be in Puerto Rican. This "documentary" is more of a first hand, a very rare thing, and it's a very personal account of what it's all about. He has a sense of watering, partly and sometimes wrapped in it (as I know most of the Prophets). (What did they do not? They live here.) Yes, they are all proud. They should be like that! But in most cases REAL does not know much about the culture, history, political background, or language and materials of the language. With his involvement in the Vieques issue, it seemed very clear. Regardless of my own privacy, at least I know what hell is. He was arrested for something he knew little and joined only because he was "the reason for the Puerto Rican." I do not know if it's not embarrassing to accept it. For those you do not have Portuguese Rico, consider this as part of a way to discover and perceive a woman. Do not accept this as a gospel ... many are not even true. Please review the source. Rosie is an actress; is not a historian. This film will not be and will never be for their information, for other Noyiks. Rather, finding more information is a step toward learning and discussing the truth. It's not just one of her eyes.
