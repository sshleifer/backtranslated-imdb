Despite a perfect job by auxiliary actors and an intelligent script by Alan Plater, this film is a fatal flaw - a lack of a central character / actor's appeal. One of these symbols describes the character of Richard E Grant as "an enraged cabbage" and, unfortunately, it perfectes it. There is nothing to her or her job to convince her lover and high-level publisher / friend that she will spend a lot of time and emotional effort. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, destructive, and full of hate. <br /> <br /> For example, Evan McGregor called an actor who could love him even when he was a practical one. <br /> <br /> All of the stunning satiran in the classroom were wasted. this is inconvenient and completely different performance. All I want to do is shake him up and get him to himself.
