I love Dracula, but this movie was a complete disappointment! When I'm young, I remember Lee's other Dracula movies, and I think it's great, but this movie was really bad. I do not know, my younger son, the last Dracula, with which I was deceived by the believer Lee, his style, his appearance, his attraction and his filth. Or maybe this movie frustrated me. <br /> <br /> But can you imagine Dracula to go along with a snobbish English accent and body language? A plot is very pleasing in the realm of characters by the symbols and is elegant and does not have any tension. Then this is a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise, do not see! <br /> <br /> If you love the film, you've been sleeping in a very darkened room and you just have to be home. There is no space behind. Perhaps you are alone in your parents' home or in an outside home. Because the characters of this flick did not even frighten, and I think it sums up everything! <br /> <br /> Or maybe you like this movie on Dracula's movie history, probably from the story of Dracula, from Nosferatu until now. It's not as attractive as the movie, it does not give me the secret to make Vampire's myth so attractive. <br /> <br /> Moreover, most of the 70's think about it. The scene looks like cheap theater. And I'm telling you that everything was done in the 70s. Because I can love both old and new movies.
