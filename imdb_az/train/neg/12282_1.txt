This was one of the most horrific "horror" films ever seen. A child of a college has a nightmare episode that covers the roaming souls of Alcatraz. While trying to present a standard vampire-paid mix of "The Night of Elm Street" and the bad video clips of the 80s, this movie is packed with a bad action and a completely reversible story. Although it was such a bad and often ridiculous film, it would be a good thing to expose an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 by winning these secrets and terrifying dialogue. Do not hesitate to proudly celebrate the film in 1987 by the Sicilian Fiction, Fanatic and Horror Academy, winning the Silver Slurry Award, or joining Devo's music or taking part in the movie Tony Basil. It's a giant disaster, though with a small cult (see other IMDb comments for this movie).
