Seriously, Why America and Frech Actors behave like Czechs Need to speak English fluently with a fake Russian accent? <br /> <br /> "I am a human, and therefore I am satisfied with my own nakedness, but the gross softness of porn would be much more than that and it would not look like art." <br /> <br /> Does the didactic-director hear the subtlety? Acting was both wood and melodrama, and funny relief was never funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am short of Clara's short stories ("Unbearable Lightness") ) and there are good things to do with the writing style (though it's a great guy's fantasy) and I must say that the movie did not disappoint the goodness of the Kunderas style.
