I bought this movie for $ 5 only at a bargain bar at my local video store, it was Chase Masterson, but five were crumbled, dropped to the toilet and flushed. The film is about twenty-one of the things that come together at the high school and on the anniversary of the death of their fool's friends, drunken and jumped in the woods and died. There is a problem creeping monster one by one to hunt them. The player was very glamorous, and these worthless people were shot in shows like 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The leadership was parallel to twelve years, and the script was probably thirteen years old. The whole set looks like a backyard in Malibu. People here are praising this film, obviously the director and / or the actor's friend. Avoid this pile of waste at all costs.
