This is really a mute movie. <br /> <br /> Some foreigners hear the broadcast of the Battle of the Adapters when a small country radio is playing on Halloween. They came to Earth to kill people, but instead of killing people, they make slaves and run away. On the front cover of the film shows that these aliens continue surfing in space ... they really do not know what they are doing. These are not strange aliens, but stupid cartoonish idiots with excited voiced sounds. The stranger, with its most intense voice, always sits on Jack Nicholson's rip-off with his sunglasses. Outside the foreigners, moving, terrible. <br /> <br /> This is just writing to children, because each character is written as a child. <br /> <br /> This is 1/2. 100 minutes. PG for light tongue.
