Yeah, I saw rude pieces. Insignificant sex scenes. Horrible cut scenes. It is almost a horrible action with the movie "Needed". This film is worse than bad movies, bad script, bad behavior, bad effects, bad places, bad stunts, everything is bad. The best 'actors' of the film were the dancers for the time they hired for vampire extras! <br /> <br /> Sean Harry, as in the beginning of another, 'foppish actor', gives a spark look here. Of course, he has a bad influence on the driver of the car, he is undoubtedly shaved by the people on the couch (check the front of the glass), the class of the left turns. Do not forget the OH and sex scene. as well as the remarkable use of a toy gun, children of works could not be worried about hiding themselves as a real weapon. <br /> <br /> The "Special Effects" were very good, so other actors who came to the screen also conveyed their lines. <br /> <br /> If you want a laugh on one side and then rent this movie ... there are still many comedies that do not give money to those who are funny and worthless.
