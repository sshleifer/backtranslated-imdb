There were some scary scenes that I always liked, but another movie was so weak. Many questions remained unanswered and were still uncertain when they tried to explain something in the film. After watching this movie, I've lost many ways. It reminded me Silent Hill for several years. This film was not satisfied, but it started to work, and this story was really meaningful. <br /> <br /> This is not much. <br /> <br /> Most of those who were abandoned were worthy of action, but the film drifted rapidly and did not really produce any results. As I said above, there were some creepy scenes, but on the contrary, this film was a mess. Sorry, I can not recommend it.
