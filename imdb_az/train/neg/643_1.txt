I am a big fan of the Largo Winch series. This movie was a pain for me. I have to use fast forward to avoid drowning. It was squeezing! How can someone else destroy this name? The story was just a good thing. Actors They do not live their role. The main actor (Tom ...) is empty. Follow other roles of this actor. The battle scenes were incredibly boring and not to follow, in a way that did not fit into the situation. Like other reviewers, he said low-budget actors were given a low-budget movie. Perhaps the next time you can do something better than anyone else. The French can not do the right thing with great movies like Alien 4. This was directly followed by Alien 1,2,3.
