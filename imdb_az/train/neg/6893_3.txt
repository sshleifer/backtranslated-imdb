There was great hope for this film. Theater monologues are great, and Nic Balthazar is a very interesting and knowledgeable person when it comes to the film. <br /> <br /> I am an admirer of many Belgian films, but this movie is bad. The 34-member actor suddenly plays the role of a young man who is totally unbelievable. "Language games" were heartwarming and above. Nothing about the film did not look real to me. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed and think that half an hour of my life is wasted.
