A man would have waited for a movie about a film he shot. The $ 300,000,000 U $ D budget should at least be entertained when you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> "Matrix Reloaded" makes this assumption wrong. <br /> <br /> "Matrix" worked better in spite of the open holes in the story logic. At least no one could explain to me why the beating of a boat (aka martix) in a simulation (aka martix) could harm the responsible computer software in any way ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Wachowski brothers This "agent-bashing" is the most important thing from the "Matrix Reloaded": part of the rama. These combat scenes can work fairly (even cool) in 5 seconds. it has been extended for a few minutes, but it's not a duplicate but corrupted, choreographed and recurring recurring recurring thing. Although there is a speculative stunts mentioned, for example, there is nothing more simple, poor quality, more common (or better) bashing. Van Damme 'movies'. The difference in production after the production (etherything 5 times faster, frozen around the camera and frozen in certain areas, and it is repeated for at least 5 minutes) does not help here, all of them have nothing to do with the "martial art". <br /> <br /> In addition to these battles, all actors refuse to comply with what they pay. <br /> <br /> What's apart from martial arts? The Hollywood mode is exceptionally small. This multicultural hippie band, "Waterworld," is being denied as a citizen of Sion (the last city on earth) and begins to dance with Morse's order because it is a good opportunity to show off a lot of greasy greens and legs. The flames of the frozen Francois talk about the nickname "je ne sais quoi", because of the "liason d'amour" many boutiques serve their fortune. It occurs as enterieur as an Erroy Flynn featuring some of the mideaval weaponry for decoration, because it's a struggle between the successive followers of Neo and the "frog" (and unwanted comic) then. For Hellenk and Neo, add just 2 ladies and many statues (corrupted, bad guys and like it) and get 5 more meaningless, dull minions. <br /> <br /> What do you expect? The usual merchandising hell. And "revolutions" will or will not happen - of course, you are.
