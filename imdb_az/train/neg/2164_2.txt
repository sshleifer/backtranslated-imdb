Perhaps, I thought it would be worth watching a movie boasting a castle like Peter O'Toole, Susannah York, Michael Craig and Harry Andrews. Alas, I'm wrong. Both are totally ambitious nonsense, from the beginning to the end with O'Toole and York. I watched him twice and did not know what was going on yet. I feel that O'Toole plays a Scottish castle Laird who has a drink problem and loves childhood games with her sister (York). She looks like mad. <br /> <br /> In some of the movies, it's part of the movie. I just suppose that the cast and filmmaker was blackmailed to make this dangerous, non-thoughtful, stagy piffle. Clear reputation of a castle and director's time. It's alive.
