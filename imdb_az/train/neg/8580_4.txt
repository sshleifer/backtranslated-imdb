If my memory was good, this movie was accepted as part of a comedy when it was released - an entertaining look in the adult entertainment industry. If this is something that needs to be, it does not really work. This is not just that. Since I have no personal knowledge of this subject, I will not be able to avoid commenting on the truth of the story, since it's very important (because I call it a comedy). Except for what the Toronto massage parlor says - if that's true, life is quite elegant. <br /> <br /> For more than an hour, this movie really does not give you anything but basic information about the main characters. Conrad is the main worker of the newly hired massage parlor, the main task is to ensure that girls do not "provide full service" - euphemism for real sex. For girls, Betty 's goal is to buy a room for her to manage her work, Cindy is an illegal immigrant in Canada to return her family home, and Lea is a strange character with a strange nude fetish - because - because it's good! I did not know what his character was. <br /> <br /> It can be fairly reasonable composite characters that clearly represent the motivation of women participating in these three activities. <br /> <br /> The film offers and does not offer anything until Conrad's "twist" appears. the bad guy. We need to get to this point more quickly. Part of the story, which is really interesting here, was Conrad's secret plan and revenge against him by his daughters. This revenge plan was pretty good, and you are grateful when it comes out, because you've been wondering why you spent so much time up to this point. After much of the story was revenge, it could have been a really funny movie. <br /> <br /> All 4 speeches were okay, though they did not think anyone was superior. All four characters were a little quiet. Cindy was a sympathetic character and for some time was Conrad, though he became a bad man of the film. Given the theme, there is an astonishing little nudity (and limited to one scene). In fact, there is a clean air around it. As for the overall quality of the film, the budget is an effort, yet it can be forgiven, despite the fact that you are expecting a particular movie to be certain in the context of a body cooler. Surely, this was released eight years ago and is the only loan of the Writer Director Soo Lew, and given the lack of normal depth in the Canadian film industry, this is even a Canadian version of the Oscars nomination for any Undeniable Award. 4/10 - and a little generous.
