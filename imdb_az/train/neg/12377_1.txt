If someone is under 10 years old, it does not mean stupidity. If your child loves this movie, you have to test it. I am always amazed at how many people are involved in something so bad. This "movie" is a showcase for digital wizardry and ELSE. The writing is strange. I do not remember when I heard such a bad conversation. Songs are unhappy. The player is sub-par, but then actors are given lots. Who decides to use Joey Fatone? <br /> <br /> The worst thing is the clarity of all this. It's like getting out of the way to make the writers as foolish as possible. Large children's films, like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years, are long-lasting, delicate and full-featured movies like Willie Wonka and The Witches. But America's steady crooked-like stream-down as Nemo (yes, right), the last Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and the Red Riding Hood look like garbage dump.
