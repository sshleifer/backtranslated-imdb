'The Omen 4: The Awakening' is a television program prepared for the original 'Omen' film. Instead of having a little boy's body, Satan has a young girl's corpse, taken from rich parents, begins to take revenge on those who harass and mistreat school. The film fights with any horror factor, and most of the incidents are not simply terrible, it's just smart, and it's hard to believe that this little girl is Satan, even with all the incidents that surround her. I just could not find this movie very scary or intimidating compared to the original movie.
