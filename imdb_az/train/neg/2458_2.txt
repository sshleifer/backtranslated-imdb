I can not describe how awful this movie is. Who is the only one who can find an animated film here? Rohan men are 100% fake with their hair color, so it does not come close to what actors look like. Orcs were terrible. Why is the gandalf going through a worse confrontation? Why do not they pronounce the right things? Saruman is not Arman. There was something else called the spooky Tolkiens symbol * sp *. I'm happy that all of these things have pulled out my favorite studio, which was just a terrible awful adaptation. See a hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon in the Tolkiens business. The hell is even better than the cartoon version of the ROTK. 2/10
