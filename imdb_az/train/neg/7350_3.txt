Despite very bad comments, I just had to give this movie? all star HK super-babe Shu is Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies like all the mobile cat theft group. Of course, you need to check it out? Well, as you go to babe-fests, Martial Angels is hard to beat. Eye Confetti is the best quality. Along with this, Shu Qi is always fantastic, and the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang, have especially drew my eyes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, if you can evaluate this movie with other possible advantages, this is definitely a stinker! Story is weak, action is thirsty and special effects are awful. Director Klarence Fok and producer Wong Jing gave us a photo cast and something else. <br /> <br /> If the same Qi is just the only reason you're considering seeing Sex and Zen 2 again!
