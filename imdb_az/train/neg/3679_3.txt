This is a Japanese movie, but many English are spoken here. <br /> <br /> Along with this, it is a beautiful movie with beautiful visions reflecting the beauty of Hawaii. <br /> <br /> However, this is a recurring quality for me. The story was generally boring. Who wants to watch a young woman for 90 percent of the movie? Because her "picture" is older than her husband's advertising? <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes she looks at her face and loves her. It was too late for most audiences at that time - it was too late. At that time we were asleep.
