After watching this movie, I was simply disappointed - not for actor, story or director - I was disappointed with the advertisement of this movie. <br /> <br /> Trailers chose the "third way" of the battalion, except for the surrender or the deceased (Polish information, mistaken that they had the choice between their artillery or the killing of German guns, and even mistakes were interpreted as an "incorrect battalion"). <br /> <br /> My wife has just begun. <br /> <br /> With regard to the events that followed his wife's marriage, I began to think: "Hey, this story can not be so simple ... Well, some cunning way to rescue what this intelligent officer has left will find it. " Yes, they did not, they sat down and waited for something to happen. And so was it. <br /> <br /> The story was based on the real events of World War I, writers could not use their imaginations much, but this movie is really difficult and even a bit boring. And first of all, as I wrote, it's not the fault of an actor, writer, or director - their marketing people have raised my expectations to a higher level than this film could handle.
