It can be viewed in many different ways. This movie is good or just strange. Third, this is the best way to explain the film. There are strange topics and there is only a strange plot. <br /> <br /> <strong> No one except Christopher Vegens will play that bad, medium, even good. <P style = "text-align: justify" I always liked Jack Black, so you know what's going on, but it's not bad, Christopher Walken always goes out of the wall. The comedy is so clever that it's a little funny, but there are moments (very few), but here it can come a bit higher and it feels like a movie that's just hopeless, but not really good. <br /> < Barry Levinson was a little overrated, and I really did not see a good job here, and this movie had much more potential and he did not do much to get it. <br /> <br /> It's good to write this post it's the key to a comedy, of course it's not a post, and at best it's low on average. y does not happen. <br /> <br /> If Christopher Walken and this stupid ridiculous end, I'd give it a low rate, and it's always a pretty character in the movie. This is a weird strange movie that really does not go anywhere. It's not terribly terrible, but I do not really recommend it, though it's a very memorable movie.
