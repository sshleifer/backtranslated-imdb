*** APPLICATIONS *** *** APPLICATIONS *** This fantastic movie record of many opening credits is a record-breaking classic. The film "Kindergarten Cop" or "Police Academy 7." It does not take long to know that it's too big. <br /> <br /> When I left the movie theater, she left me silently and went straight to the ticket counter to buy tickets for her. <br /> <br /> This is just a movie that requires more than one track. Will the first watch leave you with strange "Huh"? I feel but we do not feel embarrassed - it's all right. The story is not surprising about the death of writers. A simple story of a whale coming into the FBI, an allegorical story that works on several levels, and teaches us about the really important things in our lives. Complexity of the field structure will miss you in your first match, but do not give up! Until the sixth or seventh meeting, I only started to reveal some of the hidden secrets of Corky Romano. FBI agent Brick Davis admits that FBI is the most wanted criminals, Corky is not a real FBI agent, Pops Romano is innocent, and Peter Romano is innocent, and Paulie Romano is concealed as homosexual. <br /> <br /> Chris Kattan's comedy abilities are unique because he is guided by Corky Romano through a maze of unforeseen circumstances. John Reynolds reminiscent of Manos, Fate Hands, has many personalities and solves all scenes with perfect comedy. But it's not just a comedy. He is a master of drama, because he controls the feelings of the audience with a small movement. Face expressions are a way of life. For example, at the scene of your brothers' faces, the expression of social injustice and lie was clearly reflected in his angry face. <br /> <br /> Screenwriters David Garrett and Jason Ward are the true heroes of Corky Romano. With a story of these proportions, it's easy to understand why two experienced writers are hired to finish this sophisticated project. Their skillful story and extraordinary adjustments make the Pulp Fiction look like a live skate on an intimate Saturday night. Garrett and Ward's story is as attractive and attractive as you hold on your hair, sipping you completely, trembling around you and coming out alive. At the end of this world-renowned "Corky Romano," you find yourself in a different person with different ideas and different ideas, and ask just one question: <br /> God? Why ?!
