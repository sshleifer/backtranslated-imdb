save your money, and something else. This film was such a crap. I did not want to go, but at least I would like to laugh at once. Not a laugh, it was terrible! Chris Kattan will no longer be a good comedy and "roxbury night". this film is absolutely clear, there is no clever humor and it is repeated. Listen to me and get away from this movie as much as you can!
