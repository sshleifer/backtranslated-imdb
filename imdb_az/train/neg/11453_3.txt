This movie is one of the worst comedy films I've ever seen. I hate Napoleon Dynamite rip-off. When faced with people, it is as if they have already embraced humor. Do something new at a time. All these new comedies are just horrible. Andy Samberq is not yet ready to lead the SNL. I hope that this horrible film can come back. And Will Arnetts's character is simply not bad. Hey, Will you read the script? Sui is the worst of all written. Now you tell me something strange. Rod John's father, Frank Frank, dies and his family needs $ 50,000 to pay for cardiac surgery, so Rod Rod plans to make a big leap to collect money for Frank Frank. Only Rod Rodgard was beaten and he could prove his morals. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size:
