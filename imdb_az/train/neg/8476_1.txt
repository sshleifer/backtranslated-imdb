this movie ... was a terrible pretext for a movie. First of all, casting could have been better; The main character Katelyn did not look at something like a television mom. <br /> <br /> Also, the land was penthic. extremely clich√© and unpredictable. the end was very disappointing and lovable. (but I'll tell you all about it). <br /> <br /> Although she was nailed to the bag, Katelyn (Jordan Hinson) was crying, but the girl could not weep over the team. his face had no tears of excitement with a few unbelievable sadness. he is not a dynamic actress. She made the same fake little smile hilary duff likewise with Maguire (sp?). The film's film is not very good, just when it goes straight to perversity. He seemed to be in action. <br /> <br /> About yourself: this movie was really bad! <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> / t / w, when I looked at my baby). <br /> <br /> However, if you are 9 or under, you can love it. ;)
