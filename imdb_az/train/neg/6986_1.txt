I do not see Al Pacino. I'm watching him on the way to his parents, Scarface, Carlito, and watch one of the greatest actors in the last thirty years. <br /> <br /> Just a couple of days ago, I fell into the revolution and thought that I invested the next two investments. this is the hour. Here's a news flash: Want to talk to the prisoners? <br /> <br /> Because it will protest everything. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to do with my life, but during the American Revolution. Pacino plays an uneducated peasant who does not want to draw, but ultimately. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he has no money, no education or clothes like a caveman, and very warm Natasha Kinski is in love with him for no apparent reason because they have only two minutes of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Clearly, Al Smith would have broken their career if he played in Al Pacino instead of Al Pacino. The scenario was terrible, but Pacino's demotivated performance and fraudulent accuracy were even worse. Donald Sutherland's role was laughable. I really can not describe it. Natasha Kinski is the main character, but the film is like 5 lines. In fact, most people do not talk about this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most funny places in the film is that Al Pacino and Kinski's battlefields are constantly blaming each other for this brave hate. Starbucks like all Northeast. <br /> <br /> After a few months you want to see. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to do with this one star by IMDb. Here is a negative score.
