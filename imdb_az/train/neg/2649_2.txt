My wife and I look forward to this movie. Warm and touchy. Well started; but soon after a while it was boring and sincere. It was so bad that we left him. It was a bad move and honesty in the film, we did not really understand or why we did not want to understand why we could face boldness with this woman! He was rude and wackos lost his sympathy after playing and cleaning. I could handle it. And, of course, most movies made in Hollywood and T.V series, we have to do this in a string of "gay" characters! This movie was boring. More than Diane Keaton!
