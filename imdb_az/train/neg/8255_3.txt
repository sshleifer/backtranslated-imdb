At least this is not full of foolish violence and fuss. This is not a very thoughtful or sophisticated story line. This story had a potential, but the director seems to have lost his green space. The story, which has no results, is different and strange. And I do not believe the director spent a lot of time in a golf club club. Some of the images are absurd. Not very attractive.
