I rented this movie because it is thrown out with some Grand Canyon scenes thrown into "romanticism" and "western" genres. But if you forgot about a typical western looking romance, forget it. This movie is pure garbage! This romance is between a pregnancy and a young girl who has never passed the middle ages! The child is lusted by other delicate men. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is described as Brooke Shields, a good-doer, and his character is largely related. She tries to get her first, but in the end she gives her a happy, loving couple. <br /> <br /> I do not see that this movie can appeal to everyone except pedophiles.
