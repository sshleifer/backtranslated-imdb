The 7EVENTY 5IVE complex unexpectedly includes college kids playing a brutal phone game on their heads (without the fear of them). <br /> <br /> 7EVENTY 5IVE'S STORY, on the one hand, is a bit of a frightening film, which really regretted with a bad post. <br /> <br /> A bit unhappy, old-fashioned slasher's tale was erased early with the idea of ​​a movie maker that the viewer will enjoy watching a loud, rich, rich child like the majority of the film's working hours. <br /> <br /> Each character on the screen is a different type of young A-hole except for a police detective played by Ruther Hauer (the movie only plays a small role to add star power). <br /> <br /> The entire ensemble of men and women, black and white, straight and gay, shallow and sculptural collective is the part of the film's story. Since a Party game with an accidental event is unsuccessful, many of the scenes are completely filled with this smaller version. Therefore, there are several breaks for the viewer who has to agree with the angry sniping of humble heroes. Although each of these people is allegedly a friend, every single character really operates in a very flawless way before any real conflict occurs. This leads to the worst outcome of a movie: The developers are not surprised by a sudden keenness but wish they had come to choose a very important brat in the past. <br /> <br /> The real shame of this poor character, on the contrary, the 7EVENTY 5IVE really has several potentials. Visually impaired. Brian Hooks and Dean Taylor for the first time know the makers of a decline. They also provide simple, expressive, sometimes casual, 80s in the classic 80's. Surprisingly, the pattern of production is also very strong. Actors can not express real human feelings; was written with the scenario (just started by Vashon Nutt and filmmaker Hooks better than a keyboard with a camera). <br /> <br /> 7EVENTY 5IVE can be very difficult, and it can not be worse than the bad taste left behind by a story of unpleasant characters like its familiar place and a few excitements. This is a striking fact that everyone should care about a group of young people who are not even like each other.
