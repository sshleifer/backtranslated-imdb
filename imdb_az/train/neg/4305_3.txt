<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie a while ago on a Video CD. <br /> <br /> I will celebrate good points. <br /> <br /> The film is not biased at first, as it does not look like a character, and the second is not white. Both main characters are friendly and friendly countries, but also develop well in one country and economy, but also develop without success. Their families come together and have parties, and they do not like the opponent, but the sport we love as friends, the Sport Rifle shooting. <br /> <br /> But after 15-15 minutes, the road becomes a hook. The audience is expected to believe that they should hate one another for this blessing. For some reasons, Bosnian conflict is on its way. Of course, the scenarios add symbols to visible television footage of English-language live news programs, but the clips were after 1992 when the war began. <br /> <br /> 1990 elections are not celebrated by people who have historic war. The film tries to place the blame together with Karadzic, the leader of the Second Big Party of the Bosnian Parliament (SDP) and presidential candidate. According to the Bosnian Constitution, the SDP had the presidency in 1992, but it was a blow in January. <br /> <br /> The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Operations Party has taken over the general control and held a separate referendum in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which declared itself in Bosnia and Herzegovina in March. <br /> <br /> IDD History Bosnian Muslims Aliya Izetbegovic did not doubt the "STtH". He was a Nazism student at WW2. Even his own "Mein Kampf" wrote: "It is impossible to live in peace or coexistence between Islam and non-Islamic socio-political institutions." <br /> In the 1990s, the IDU elections, which are members of the Christian Brotherhood in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who support Christian Brotherhood as their brothers in the 1990s, have lost their Yugoslav Juvenile Partnership. <br /> <br /> Following the disappearance of the elections, Iznikbegovic, who seized the seat of power, prevented Abdicin's coming to power. <br /> <br /> The upcoming events have disappeared from the film, but they are the actual events leading to the war. <br /> <br /> Of course, there were also requisites. The Serbian soldiers in the film were wearing Soviet WW2 helmets. Not only did a soldier capture the M-1944 WW2 rifle used by the USSR, but not just Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> Director and writer writers have been given a chance but have rewritten the history.
