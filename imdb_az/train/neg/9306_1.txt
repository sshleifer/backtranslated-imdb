This movie is the worst excuse for a movie I've never seen. To begin with, I'd like to say that the front cover of this movie is misleading, if you're thinking of seeing a horrible horror film with a monster mud, you are very wrong. In fact, the murders are not a bit like front cover, they should have found it on Google and think it's cool. They are cool when talking about what they find and what they think, in this movie there is a scene in which some network is looking for a friend in the old tree, and then suddenly a small junior grown up on the screen goes out into the field where the sunshine is gleaming ... What I mean seriously WTF? How do they go for dark trees? I bought this movie from a man who hoped to be entertaining, would not it be so funny if not afraid? Lying! The next day, my business partner S.I.C.K. I accuse myself of being infected. Bottom Line: SHOW THIS FILM!
