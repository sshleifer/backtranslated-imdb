This movie seems to have been designed by a person with some good ideas, but had not previously seen any movies, or did not think that a script was editable and even funny. When I saw this movie, I saw John Candy and it would be a mistake, it would be cheerful. Instead, there was a foolish control about mind control and many plain, unfunny moments. And moreover, Candy has conveyed some of the smallest lines I've heard so far. So, despite the potential funny stories and stories, we still have a lot of laughs for young people, but with an amateur and a movie that will be very cautious for the elderly. This is really shameful - it would be better. That was nice, with Eugene Levy, Joe Flaherty and John Candy.
