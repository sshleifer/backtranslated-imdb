If another Hitler appears, it is clear from the beginning that this is part of the story of disaster, which promotes the concept of absurdity, which is an apparently foolish betrayal. <br /> <br /> As long as it is not a matter of adhering to such a man and choosing him the highest post in the land, the mindless people will go through the paradise to prevent him, even in the trench, in an unknown and unknown place. <br /> <br /> Who read Hitler's close friends - for example, his secretary Traudl Junge's biographies will make people find him a kind, intelligent, generous person. He was also a brilliant figure, and his speeches often appeared to be controversial and sophisticated, but in political speeches intolerance has spread. At first, an anti-communist, an early anti-Semitic antisemitism, which was not the centerpiece of early Fascists, was neither an unusual nor an unusual time. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that Hitler's Holocaust was the real trick from the start. <br /> <br /> If you want to identify the next person who has killed dozens of millions of people, life described here. Look at her exquisite speeches with a seductive, charismatic man who inspired the whole nation and made a political case and benefited financially from the country. I'm afraid his identity will be more than Barack Obama's Fred Phelps. <br /> <br /> I'm very hopeful about this, and I have nothing but cartoon. The foolish ones who did this were committing a crime against the truth. This is a historic equivalent of "Reefer Madness".
