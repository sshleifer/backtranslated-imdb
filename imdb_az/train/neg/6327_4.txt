I thought this movie would be better. <br /> <br /> His wife attacked one of many European countries. In Russia, the KGB and the Soviet Union spied a spy school to teach the school as Americans, but the city they built for training was somewhat dated, so the United States was in the wrong position. I do not know, but it just appears there. It's really strange when it's highlighted in Russian, not one of the Russian cities. <br /> <br /> And for the comedy, it's a painful drain. There is one, two comic spots peak and they are nothing to read and dance. Finally, the film will make you sleep. <br /> <br /> And, like a wounded blow, this movie is very sick for the United States. The film continues to repeat, God and Russia are the devil in the United States. <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> It thinks the US is self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> It's 10- and I'm good. It was really one, but the dance scene was laughable, but it was still a long drift to be really funny.
