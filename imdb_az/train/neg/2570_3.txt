I read in Peter Sellers, "I have a girl in my soup". When watching the movie, I'm not surprised. There is almost nothing in the film. As you can see, Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the film to exist; does not do that. The whole movie seems to have filmed what's happening just by accidentally writing something. Maybe I have not seen any movies that are about to be hippies about middle-aged people, but these films give a pretty bad name. <br /> <br /> Overall, both sellers and Hawn are better than movies, so do not waste your time. Very worthless.
