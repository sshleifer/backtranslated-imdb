I was expecting a movie about the influence of Samin Son in society. I did not expect Spike Lee to give me more rubbish because of racist tension, complicated justice, or because he could not choose a common citizen under the pressure of retirees. <br /> <br /> <strong> Spike Lee you do not have to rent a video regardless of passionate pleasure; In such a situation theater is worth it. This is not an escapist film.
