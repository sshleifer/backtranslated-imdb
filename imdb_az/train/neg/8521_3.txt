Well, it gives you some sequences. A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of these timeless classics who teach Christmas worth the Christmas and enjoy the holiday only. But it is not. A Charlie Brown tries to capture Christmas, there's another Christmas game there, but it's unlucky and easy to joke with jokes. Charlie Brown is no longer interested in the Christmas spirit, but wants to get a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?) His sister Sally is the most animated in the film. One of his jokes is: Sally wants Santana to write a letter, but because she can not write Charlie (why she needs to be in her letter), she decides instead of Sam for she is Sam. Also, Sally, in a word, is playing an angel with a single game today: "Hark!" He says instead of the hockey stick (every one). If Sally says 12 times hark (all this is exactly the same way), it does not kill you. Mint is a great focal point of Patty and Marcy, but it is hardly better than that. Marcy is funny with his answers to Patty, but Patty is another story. It sounds like a boy (it does not cancel the rumors) and becomes crazy when there is a sheep in the game (terrible baas and all). As you can see, every year is laid and its lines will not forget (there are no lines). He repeats two times, one after the other, and receives the same answer. I think there is a short-term memory loss or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (though Linus still teases them), but it's hardly time-consuming. I'm sure Schroeder is not even in this situation. Generally, it tries to be an original parasite but breaks the message for a few quick laughs.
