My dear. It's a good cast, but it's a direct art and writing, and it's a matter of direct mind and writing. Even need to get a good time and moment to make comedy. They laughed at places where I did not have them all, but it was several times. The main focus of my attention was a continuous flow of dialogue and some people were concerned about the film. As you read the scenario, it may sound very seldom, but it can take it and the camera is a different task. And the handheld camera is energizing several parts of the film. The overall direction was good, but the script was not everything for me, but I was convinced that the script would sound better than you were reading. Sorry.
