I've seen Gator Oil films, and that's almost exactly the same thing. A woman is sexually assaulted by some perverted men and systematically reverses each one of them. What separates this movie from the films (not too far) is the lack of sexual content. There are many full frontal nudity throughout the movie, but it's no sexy for a second. <br /> <br /> Some of the attackers may look a little wider, but the film seeks to strengthen the viewer's desire to get revenge on this woman. <br /> This is a weak film, there is no other way to keep the interests apart from manipulating our natural desire to see this woman taking revenge on the aggressors. Spitting on your grave is not a movie you are expecting to show a serious morality, but with my pleasure, I've seen that because of the overwhelming majority of violence against women's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> B-films are nonsense because of nudity and discretionary adolescence Spit On You Grave is a B-movie and contains more than nudity. does not control the nudity plot. On the other hand, the only thing that governs the evidence is an absolute necessity for revenge by a group of attackers. These men are evolutionists, as in the Gator Bait films, and the biggest problem for writers seems to have appeared in new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason for the movie's failure is not because it does not deliver any message other than a meaningless B-movie, Instead, the viewer wants to see exactly what the attacker deserves for a group of people. <br /> <br /> There is a problem that comes from sexual abuse. Strangely enough, the first half of the film is part of the most nervous (but not least), but it's most painful to look at. Even though several deaths are extremely complicated, let's take a little less as we watch the woman's revenge (and, of course, if the boy in the lake feels such a great desire to fly), pushing the motor on the boat and her gender into the impeller, closes and removes the cord), but again, this film only ensures that the first half is full of vengeance. <br /> <br /> (Spoilers) You know, this means making the whole movie, since the last shot of the film is over. The woman does not live after a happy time, writes her book, never leaves it, and only when she's just in the boat and around the lake, the film stands on music tracks. <br /> <br /> Life is a companion. If you decide to spend time watching, try breaking or burning everyone. Am I really waiting for them?
