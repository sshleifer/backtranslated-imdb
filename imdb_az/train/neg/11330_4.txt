"Giant" is one of the most boring, extreme Hollywood contraceptives. Many scenes appear to be completely fake and without energy. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean wasted this great Hollywood production. A central idea of ​​this film is that it is resisting oil drilling in a ranch's territory and it's absurd, and I know it's from Houston. Dean, who has served several scenes, especially Taylor coffee, returns this another boring movie. For a more accurate and interesting idea of ​​how Texas has changed its lifestyles, see "Hud" (one of Paul Newman's big shows) or the "Last Picture Show".
