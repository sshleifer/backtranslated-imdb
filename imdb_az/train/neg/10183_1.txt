This is a very terrible product. The general consensus has always been that the Princess Margaret could have been exaggerated and inflated and could be more luxurious than luxury, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the weakest point of production, the actress could not prevent it. In addition, the production budget could not last up to a barber - from the very beginning, Princess Margaret's characteristic hair had a permanent bird hole inside the curly appearance and it seemed to be drifting through a bush. The actor playing the Duke of Edinburgh turned out to be watching Rory Bremner following the Prince Charles's role. <br /> <br /> The production was a defective, sticky, embarrassing garbage burden. All Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
