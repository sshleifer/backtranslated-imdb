this film is a stupid Hollywood version of the creepy mom and daughter relationship, despite the "independent" state. In the film, it was bad at first, but when in the movie, when she went out with her, I think this cat is a movie about her mother-daughter. I do not want to apologize, but I know any mother with such a relationship with her daughter ... Perhaps it's so good.
