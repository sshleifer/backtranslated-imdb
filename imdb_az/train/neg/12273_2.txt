PLAN B has a quick, irregular, irregular script appearance for a movie with a picnic that can be mixed from start to finish for gamers. <br /> <br /> Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is not another mafia-based 'comedy' that is concerned with the apparel and appearance of the murder business chief. control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is better than dirt and his ignorance should laugh. Maloni, one of the lenders (married to Fran-Diane Keaton's book) and Maloni, takes Malini as his assistant to work on his deceased debt as Malini's 'stroke'. Fran is afraid of his shadow and can not carry out Maloni's assignments, but chooses to bring "a fool" to Florida to hide his brother James's house, unless he can understand what to do in the future. This alternative to the killing of three candidates plans to kill Plan B, Plan A! <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton made many beautiful films and was one of our most talented actresses and comedies, but here she shouts and often watches her color and twitches through a ridiculous piece of lively to watch. Paul Sorvino is one of the other Paul Sorvino type other mobster films. Supporting casting can also be played on the balcony at the most extreme slapstick, it is possible to imagine. What needs to be a comedy ends just to be ridiculous and excessive. Director Greg Yaitanes has to return to his television series: this bare story would have been able to enter into a half-hour concept. Grady Harp
