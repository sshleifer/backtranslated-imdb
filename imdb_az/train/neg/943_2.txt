Here's an interesting movie that describes the phrase "low budget" as a terrible name. Physicist, with about nine children, creates a strange serum that causes "molecular reorganization." The students are desperately killed by the fake coincidences and flying school supplies of underwater sandwiches. Like the resurrection of the classic B-films of the 50s? Nope! This high camp is not an entertainment experience, it means NO. Luxurious skies and canvas exhibit, first of all, desire to oppose the horrors that must be 99.44% more. Sub-barrel entertainment is best supported by the corpses of red blood and dead students. Such conscious films would eventually make a genius genius with a master's degree in filmmaking GURU THE MAD MONK (1970)! Automatic "F", so relaxing!
