We've had a few reviews about IMDb, and this movie has never seen the whole movie, it's unique. <br /> <br /> This is the "Mel Quotient", the biggest problem of Mel Brooks. It was terrible and stupid. In other words, the shorter the movie, the less you see in the movie. Think about it - Producers and Young Frankenstein were great films and he was very few. <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>, Life Stinks and Space Balls are full of Mel-full and pretty doppy films (yes, I did not like Space Balls - but it's not a place to talk about it). Secondly, I do not think less funny than homelessness, apart from cancer, rectal scarring and mental retardation. It's just a comedy. Think about it, nation. In the film FUNNIEST (?) Scene, Mel looks like a scoop with Leslie Ann Warren! And how funny is that?
