What to start? Oh yeah, the message to the bad guys: Do not waste time talking to him when you first find the traitor who is witnessing a committed crime. yet an opportunity to get away. Victim message: If the celibers talk and argue among themselves, use the opportunity instead of "DO NOT RUN," and do not sit there and wait until they hear the noise. Message from the Director: If one of the 5 or 10 minutes has just begun on a car or foot, there may not be bad guys or bad guys in your bumper! time and action do not work in this way. It would be nice to think that a woman should not be brutally murdered in order to increase her ability to stay away from an aggressive relationship at home (4).
