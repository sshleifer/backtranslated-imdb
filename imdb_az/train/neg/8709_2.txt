Arg. The mixed dinosaurs, in this terrible third film, have a bite of foolishness. This time, European terrorists (ianland say) hi-jack the convoy of a military that is supposed to transport uranium. They go to a shipyard, open a truck and discover our old friends carnosaurs. Pandemonium comes to visit when the dinosaurs follow the terrorists, police, and some sailors. The whole movie seems to have inspired the Aliens (more like Carnosaur 2), with the sinister seas passing through the claustrophobic shipbuilding plant? Weapons are ready. This third opus is probably one of the most terrible and worst movies, with a rubber dino extinguishing a sea of ​​head off with only one blood leak. Dinosaurs, as usual, are tough and mixed, and T-Rex sounds like an angry elephant when it sounds (no eyes also appear). One of the hottest scenes of the film comes when the coppers come to the scene: the hacked truck goes into the building and heard a strange noise coming from another truck. Unlock it, surprise! The Rubber Exile Gang exploded and burned them. Why was the second truck locked after the dinosaurs escaped from the first car? How could the door locks be locked just outside? What was it like to shoot this scene? Ah worried, whom to care? They both lower the size of Rubber Iguanas.
