This movie is NOT NEW or VALUE. After seeing, my husband and I agreed that the studio just left it and felt less care if it were entertaining. This is a good example of a "conceptual film" - they have a concept about a movie, and other details are unimportant, as the only one in the United States will be the $ 1 based on the concept. <br /> <br /> The film begins with Cruella's departure and unconditional departure. He hates puppies, but has been programmed to long for them - he did not hurt anyway. It will not last for long after being released, and it has returned to its old ways. Period. <br /> <br /> The characters were supported by the most fascinating aspects of the film. Eaton Idle, like Waddlesworth's bird, hated him - I think this is a difficult Python fan. He did so for giving him too much money (no other reason). Cruella's low self-esteemed maid Tim McInnerny is funny at Black Adder, but here it's completely spent and unfunny. GÃ©rard Depardieu had to pay a few dollars to win, but he was absolutely frustrated. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> worry about these drivers.
