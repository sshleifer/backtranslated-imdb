I do not really look forward to watching this movie, I got a group of 5 films, so how long have I to wait for them all? and you know that I'm right, all this is terrible, there are a few (and some extending) points of interest in this movie, sometimes the camera look is a nice touch, a drum punk, really really a problem on this subject, it's just boring, it's not something I thought was not an attempt to create tension, but most of the film was ready for the press when it was awesome, but it was gone), and seriously, the band's lead singer, I think they were half as good as hell! he seemed to be the same once again, it was all that happened, and I did not say whether he would join or even join it, it was not worth it. Perhaps I was worried about Star and London, except for the only reason to watch them, and except for London (which was really funny), not for their acting ability, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but I've seen too well . If you get tired of dying, get the best out of it.
