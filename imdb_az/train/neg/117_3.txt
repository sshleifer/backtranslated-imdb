It was great to see my favorite stars 30 years ago, including John Ritter, Ben Gazarra and Audrey Hepburn. They looked pretty nice. But that was it. No characters or a good line to work with them. <br /> <br /> Some of the little female roles were good, Patty Henson and Colleen Camp were extremely efficient and confident in their smaller street sections. They showed some talent and were upset that they did not go to shoot stars in better and better films. Unfortunately, I did not think Dorothy Stratten could play only one role in this film. <br /> <br /> There are some fans in the film, and I was very open minded when I watched it. . I am a great fan of Peter Bogdanovich and his last movie, "Cat Meow", and all the early ones "Nickelodeon" from "targets". <br /> <br /> This film is about a detective organization where detectives and customers are romantically involved. Five years later, Bogdanovic's old lover, Cybil Shepherd, had a television series called "Moonlighting", which stole his story from Bogdanovic. Of course, this series had a great deal of difference on the basis of sexual dialogue to deal with series and several vintage lines. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Paper Moon "and only a very faded version called" What's There, Doc ".
