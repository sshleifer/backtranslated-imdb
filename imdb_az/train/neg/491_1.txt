As others have noted, this film is criminalally inaccurate in the artist's life, and in many ways embodied and humiliated ... by turning his aggression into a tragic love affair, the aggressor's 'own talent awakens' the work, you get an idea as it turns into a sexual object. Also, I'm concerned that people who do not know Gentileschi will see this movie and go with that impression.
