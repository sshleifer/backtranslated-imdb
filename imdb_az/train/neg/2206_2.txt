A scientist on an island is deeply saddened by the death of his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why not turn my dead son into a hammer shark? Yes, who would not? Everyone's killing is that the hammer shark is constantly called "Paul", which is a bit difficult to cope with. Additionally, William Forsythe's MacGyver-kick-ass-savingtheday, as a strange hero, has no credibility. On the other hand, there is a few hot shepherds actually looking at the shark while Paul is killing another. In fact, I think bad b-movies are fun. But for my taste, it would be a better movie if it was less than $ 1,000. It could have been fun later.
