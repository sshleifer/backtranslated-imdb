I say it's terrible, but nothing in this film is illuminated and some are protected by the incredible core development. It starts well, but after the main hit, she gets into some action scenes from a long subplot and absurd non-realistic theater around a young girl who is not attractive. For example, there is a long shot in the airport where lighting is all stroboscopic. There is no explanation for this. How reliable is it that the lights of an airport's storage area and the lights that Snipes can make an amazing runner shoot? <br /> <br /> Certainly, the US CIA team may not be close to each other. aside Britsa's position as "national security." <br /> <br /> This cunning is based on a distant stereotype to be satisfied with the truth. <br /> <br /> There are many good action films there. Better formulated, better performance. This is sometimes fun, but there is not enough meat in the bone and after a while it is deeply boring - something that should never happen in a good action movie.
