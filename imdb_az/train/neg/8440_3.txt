For Laurel and Hardy fans, it was a very sad moment for the team in the 1940s and beyond. Contracts with Hal Roach Studios ended and now they were "free agents" - they could not work in any studio offering them a job. Unfortunately, Fox, RKO, MGM (without Roach) and even a French movie company that hires kids have not had any touching tricks for comedy. Plus, Stan and Ollie were very old, and taking pratfalls seemed saddening this geriatric male, especially funny. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> "Fox Studios draws them into a parallel site that captures them as an impeccable support and creates a parallel field that captures their time on the screen. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <br> /> <br /> Now, however, if she had a decent film if she had been awarded a decent record and the studio's care was taken out and used the B unit with the best second-class support here, in particular there is little laugh and the last 10 minutes of the movie is simply horrible - just counting on a silent display on the back for the stupid scene - just one of the worst types of movie history. For those who love Laurel and Hardy's funny zombie fans, there's probably a movie they like, but for those who want to evaluate this movie with respect to their incredible previous films, it's just those who want it. In fact, until 1940, I do not think that one of my full-length films likes less than DANSMAN MASTERS. Unfortunately, after the 1940s, this is just one of their best films. Unfortunately, it was very bad - with bad movies like ALL IMPROVEMENT AND GOALS ALL. <br /> <br /> Finally, can the overall positive comments of this film on IMDb reflect the team's love more than an indicator? Is this a good movie? For a spectator who is not in love with the team, I do not know if this movie will do anything, but you have found the audience - that, of course, Laurel and Hardy are not gonna agree with anyone. But even comedic geniuses need material worthy of their talents.
