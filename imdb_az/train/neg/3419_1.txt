Okay, so Chuck Norris found a way to draw a conclusion. I have a question - why? Who read this script and "The voice is great! Original!" This film was about to stain my toilet bowl. Of course, Chuck Norris, who is a MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force, and more, is traditionally a person who can get the same America from some bad guys. Even the most weapons are not needed. This pathetic patriotic jargon who gives this mind. It is surprising that the only person to direct this Norris movie is Chuck's son Eric. Eric Norris basically worked on his father's films and television shows. Is not this a sign that shows that there is no directing talent to anyone? Later, the same people are referred to the same stories as before ... Only the differences are the names of the characters. If this brings me patriotism and joy to the United States, our country is worse than I imagined. Hopefully, it will be Chuck Norris's coffin in the nail.
