<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify ; "> On the contrary, there is nothing worse than leasing an Asian movie and using American movie experience. Despite the fact that the heroes of "Yes" are sweet married couples. Fine works have been done. Unfortunately, they are fools who do not believe. <br /> <br /> Let's calculate the ways they think they are exposed to terror by a stalker # 1. <br /> <br /> When a hitch driver threatens to kill you, tell him what you have in your hotel when you leave him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (not to worry). 4. <br /> <br /> When trying to escape, check out her as much as possible to make sure the stalker misses her. <br /> <br /> 5. Once you have missed a friend who has missed your stomach, be sure to send them as soon as possible so that they can meet each other. Is not it just a point of being unrighteous? <br /> <br /> Now I'm not going to wait for anybody to get immunity from making a few mistakes under these stressful circumstances, but the Say Say is a very intense and incredible mistake, so it's impossible for the viewer to focus on his own safety because they become their victims. It kills the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you were wondering, scenario writers did not stop with spotless symbols. <br /> <br /> Because they are so elegant to write this crapfest, all the sensations of truth can create a unique situation as they leave the window. <br /> 1. Stalker kills a police officer inside a police station? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stalker is involved in suspicious activities between men and women around the broad daylight, but no other than the married couple waited for her alone conduct. 3. Stalker is getting rid of some ridiculous violence that will kill anyone. <br /> <br /> 4. There were no imaginations in the "Tension" scenes. In fact, some scenes were directly demolished from American cinema. <br /> <br /> Only a positive ending with dizziness was a cruel scene after being given to his wife. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Koreans should be ashamed of the fact that they are preparing the "Issue." It's better that they just move to California and engage with filmmakers who have a reputation for quality and intelligence.
