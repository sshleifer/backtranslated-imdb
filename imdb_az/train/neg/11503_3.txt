Quentin Crisp once said that things were so romantic when things were so beautiful. When the devils are tough enough, they are realistic. And something gets ironic, they are spotting. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa, he falls into the second category. This director worked hard to make a Spanish "Ken Loach" film without a clear comedy, and it was only the heat between the characters that made Loach movies the 'creepy'. Los Lunes al Sol, just suffering from it. Certainly, things are unfounded. The strongest moments of the heroes reach a peak at the same point and if the silver story is not enough, Aranoa cleans fairy tales with a gray and colorful palette of colors. Films are ridiculously appreciated in goyas. A film showing empathy for more vulnerable people in society, while unemployed harbor workers are not automatically making a good movie, even though I am the first to betray their fate. This film is able to deal with their fate only with disrespect. In the 21st century, unemployed people in Spain live as beggars and public transport federations have decent toilets and it is difficult to face a bar with a few fingers and a little happiness. Leon de Aranava clearly has no idea about the working class of Spain and has nothing to do with it. Yes, it is the only possible outcome. Men play a soccer match free of charge, with a direct "poverty" trap, which is more of a "realist", that is more interested in Purely Belter and is still sad.
