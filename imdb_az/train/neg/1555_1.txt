When I decided to watch these double body bureaucrats, Peter and David Paul, I thought it would not be bad for Ruggero Deodato, a filmmaker who enjoys a good reputation for creating filmmaking films, but is a good filmmaker. Yes, BARBARS is a very fun action / adventure film that wants to be another CONAN THE BARBARIAN and wanting to be unsuccessful at every level. The movie is inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were well shot, but the appearance of the clothes and hair and the shiny, colorless "disco" look sometimes does not make sense, despite such a budget. <br /> <br /> Richard Lynch looks like an old woman with this ridiculous hairstyle and suit. He is thinking of being dangerous, but he comes as an angel. And one of my kids, Eva LaRue, is laughing to see Callahan, she will not be seen in her first movie, and she's missing a fur bikini. I am sure that this eruption wants to disappear from the earth! The wordless barbarian twins are exactly like muscle-related heroes, but their roles, like everything in this confusion, are not really bad, because it is almost impossible to get a proper criticism of their performance. The only way they are trying to differentiate between the two is a suitcase covering a pair of double jackets and the other suitcase makes the muscular cover harder. I'm not waving! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > And its desperation is perfectly reflected in this bare flick. It's just bad.
