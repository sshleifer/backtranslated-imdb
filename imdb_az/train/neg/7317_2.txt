When I read other commentary on this movie, I would like to share my own ideas that if you are not a general Brooksophile, this is a tough movie. It is not me. <br /> <br /> When viewed from an objective, objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more necrosive neuroses than those that can be processed in one sitting. It is very difficult to watch. The character of The Brooks (Robert Cole) is unpleasant and unrealistic to understand that it is difficult to deal with it. Leave a single root as he misses a single-function habitual situation. And no superfluous scene and should not be expected to be taken seriously in the romantic context. No one was exposed to this and could have opened a baby like Kathryn Harrold. Of course, Albert Brooks is not in the production of Albert Brooks-control. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Most control of a movie can only arise when problems arise when one person is settled Not to take revenge on himself, as most people know, director James L. Brooks, in fact, is, in fact, what he is describing: Six years later, Albert Brooks sang in a very successful Broadcast News magazine, James tells us Albert's safe and fun comic <br /> <br /> Albert has allowed James to see (usually as an actor). <br /> <br /> Become an admirer of "Modern Romantiks" now with the next award-winning commentary. I'm telling you that you do not need to be found in a movie that's meant to be a fun world.
