I saw this movie in the cinema class. I'm glad I did not pay to see her. I came up with an open mind and a little excited. I liked Ed Norton and Evan Rachel Wood, and the other part was interesting. I'm never related to this movie. Acting was great, cinematography was interesting, but it was a storyline, or rather, a lack of it. There was no central focus on the film. Is anything romantic between Norton and Wood? Yes, no, not really. Was it a western? No, but not. I'm here for all the movies, I recently saw and loved "Brick", but the place where this movie went. It was very strange and if I did not have to sit with the whole movie, I would go. The article was not afraid, but it was all over. Despite this movie's end, I am very scared and wish you had finished soon. There was something about this non-resonant film, and I understood more unusual films like Fight Club, but I just did not think about the heroes.
