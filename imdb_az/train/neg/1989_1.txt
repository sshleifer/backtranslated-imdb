I would like to give this movie a zero, but this is not an option! This movie follows! Women can not move. When I saw Bobby Brown, I knew he would breastfeed. In my house, nobody believed to change the channel after the first 15 minutes. The black women, like the armed forces in the western days, are ridiculous. This is not just a race, it's also a breed. The combination of two things is ridiculous. I'm sorry that some of the people in the movie were not afraid of actors / actors, but because of the fear of the film itself. movie was not as incredible as it was. may be "entertaining" for a group of people, but I'm not in that group. lol and using a big, great line from a great movie ... "That's what I want to say."
