Kenneth Branaq tries to transform William Shakspeare's dark, rare comedy into music in the 1930s, resulting in both the worst Shakespeare and the worst music comedy, since the actors are rarely superior to one or more of the two styles; in some cases, too bad. Particularly painful, Nathan Lane, looks like quite as hysterically surprising as Costard, but is a bad mistake and Alicia Silverstone Elementary English class, which captures all the powers of the Teenager Valley Girl, which reads Shakespeare's script. Music numbers are staged by the experience of high school production called "Dames in the Sea", and while singing and dancing in a quiet and amateur way, Adrian Leester is a beautiful singer and dancer is human. The film's other saving grace is Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer's eye-spirits, but they have made better performances than this movie, and you're wise to check out some of the other names in their filmography. a foolish mix.
