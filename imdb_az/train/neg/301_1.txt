This is the worst documentary ever to get out of Canada! I'm happy to see children do not do another movie. All they want to do is get a movie and do not have one. The screenwriter continues to change the question of the person who changes it. When he saw the Toronto Film Festival that year, he could not get enough of the theater. Never watch this movie.
