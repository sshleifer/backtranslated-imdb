Lucian Pintilie is very sad because he does not stop filming. Every time they get sick. Niki and Flo (2003) are a heartwarming knife in the camera. Unfortunately, the worst films in Romania every year will be sent abroad (for example, the Chicago International Film Festival). Spends time and money on this movie without plot, action or scripts. Account: from 10 to 0.02.
