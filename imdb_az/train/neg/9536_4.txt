The best 4 is best, better than 3, but only. Generally, I say this because the 4th part does not conflict with the parts of 1/2 (ie third) (that is, they do not associate with their brother, Tommy Lee). <br /> <br /> In any case, the plot of the story, and part of Sven Ole-Thorsen, as Boris. However, although there are several scenes of battle, the film is not something special. The limited budget is also very different (especially on the plane explosion scene). <br /> <br /> Also in Chapter 4, there's really nothing morally or partial, there are a few more <br /> <br /> Well known actors in Chapter 4 (Hudson , Thorsen), but nothing like the beginning of the beginning (and even those characters have very small roles). Unfortunately, Rhee can not show a movie to show and to be the truth. <br /> <br /> I saw the strip, Rating: 4
