Pretty crazy whodunit trying to figure out who killed the smile trumpet player who had to go for a great go to Hollywood featuring all the black cents. Is he his wife? His Girlfriend? Her desire is girlfriend? His father? His Butler? Newspaper boy? Who knows? And who cares? The result is a bit small, and the actors do not take me in any way or in any other careful mood. Why snake poison as a weapon? Who knows? Whose mouth? This music is good, but it's a lot of it, and most of all says "good luck." This is not worth your time. There are better black-and-white films.
