A perfect killer escaped from a crazy argument discovered in a Santa Claus suit (when played by her husband, directed by Robert Zemeckis, wife of Mary Ellen Trainor), who killed her husband with a poker (deviously played by ugly Larry Drake) . She is waiting for her life trying to find a way to hide her husband's body. In order to kill a woman for murder, she decides to use an ax after lowering the Santa Clan, who has lost some chances to cut her head off. <br /> <br /> <strong> Santa Killer hides it secretly and works desperately to rescue his child because he is following the woman's daughter. <br /> <br /> This episode from CRYPT, with the addition of the old "Santa kills", adds gangster gossip killings, with his wife-a-man-she's-been-cheating-diary. In fact, Trainor is also trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body that killed a safe distance from many parts. There is nothing new or new about this area, which is very moving.
