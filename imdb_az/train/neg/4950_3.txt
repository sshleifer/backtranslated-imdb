I think it can summarize something about the show. Batman TAS can be the worst thing to do with comic-based animated films because everything else will be compared to it and nothing has been measured yet. It is good only to be damn well. Batman was good? "Yes, but it was TAS." Is the Justice League good? <br /> <br /> Batman, of course, is not a TAS, but I will not be against it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Batman, who lives in the Caucasus and is less experienced, has a good understanding of crime, and sometimes the art is very beautiful. But the rest of the time is artlessly worthless Americanism, and the show betrays its own flaws. It has been designed, written and designed as American. If I wanted to watch Jackie Chan's adventures, I watched Jackie Chan Adventures. Or I would always take my head to the wall and get the same effect. Joker is a murderous, mentally unstable clown in a suit that uses his ideas, unexpectedness and intelligent gadgets to fight Batman. When he is forced to seize his hand, he may resort to a cheap thing or be completely done. It is not supposed to be a monkey with kung-fuu and dreadlocks, which can climb twenty meters in the air that is accompanied by speed lines. If they wanted to do it with a villain, they could use less important symbols that they could use, or they could create something completely new. And these re-imaginations are not a bad thing, do not get me wrong. TAS (I'm going there again) took Mr. Freeze from the B corridor similar to the standard calf and made it a memorable and morally compelling character. Of course, ice cream was not exactly a classic alien, and they carried out their rise, but the point stood. In Batman, Batman does everything he likes about the comics and lore and takes them a big, fragrant dump. Why? <br /> <br /> This show can not stand against TAS, but it stands on its feet and does not work for me yet. Fields are not good and they do not improve well. They are written for demographics of children under the age of twelve. Can children use a demonstration? Of course they need it. This should not be an expression of blasphemy, nakedness or violent adulthood. But a really good show mark can be used at different levels from all ages. <br /> <br /> Is this show a TAS? No, of course. The problem is not a JLU.
