Valentine fails 13 Valentine in an attempt to bring back the teen slasher genre, which was taken by spoofs like Scary Movie and Shriek if you know what's going on last Friday. Why did people love Halloween? Because it was original, new and went beyond something that had never been done. Why did they love Scream? Because at least this was the sense. My darling is just a stupid slasher-flick. It's funny, it looks like Halloween and Urban Legend. And when the killer comes on the screen, you know who it is, just ssssssssssoooooooooooooo predictable. <br /> <br /> From 0 to 10 at the age of 10
