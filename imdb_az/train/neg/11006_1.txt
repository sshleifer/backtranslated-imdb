This movie, among others, offers the "SlapChop" Vince proposal (also wrote, edited and directed) and Joey Buttafuoco - the exact names of the "quality". And with a sweep bank ("Rhymer"), with a uplifting skits like a sweep "Supermodels Taking a Dump" (which is sound like it's not exactly), a necklace with a rotting body, necrophilia, black market fetuses (featuring a guy, a scooping, a boy) , a skeet about a gigantic tale of many and many gay jokes, a super hero and forced abortion. Sketches are painful (such as "Batman and Rhymer") are not good enough to consider amateurism, and the film is just raw ... and stupid. I really believe that the 8-year-old band can easily shoot a funnier movie with the same budget. <br /> As you can see, this film has resulted in a lawsuit filed by Scientologists against Slap Shot Vince. Undoubtedly, I do not know who knows the roots of this situation! As you can see, Scientologists have violated his reputation and claimed that this movie was smashed. <br /> <br /> No matter what the movie is about to be done from the start and 99% unfunny (compared to the Ebola funnier) ... and this is the best thing I can say about the movie. <br /> <br /> Road, Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV") is involved in a diaper and counterfeit fake porn movie. Will his career be able to overcome it?
