From the beginning, you know how this movie will end. These typical NRA members are even full of clicks that you do not like this movie. I only gave him 10 to 2 because of William Benton's move. I do not believe that people voted for this movie 6 +. This is biased against 'from a certain point of view' (a thief once). People are not born bad. It's not a good birthday. They are born with a clean slate. Community, parents, and education can lead to who they are. And if they take a wrong turn, the line is down, of course, there will not be an American penal system! In any case, avoid this movie as a plague. I think that the better things about your time are like this violet. <br /> <br />
