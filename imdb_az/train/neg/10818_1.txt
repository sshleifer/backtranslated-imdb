Before I saw this movie, I was a great dreamer, since I read the novel, to defeat the arrogance of the wooden players and the manufacturers. This film does not reflect the glimpse of Bronte's work, and has given more impression of a love story. In a short time, the film has lost a lot of its main features, which have led to the understanding and progress of the book, and ultimately led to a small kingdom of land. There is no romantic relationship between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so you will not be able to help two characters, but it's very simple to imagine "love." Bronte's novel is such a shame that Jane's poultry cheeks and boldness are a striking impression of Rochester's involvement and his pride of haughtiness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br If given a better script, perhaps the movie would be more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) for a prominent production by Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton.
