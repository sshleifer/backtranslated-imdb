I'm a great admirer of war movies, as an Vietnam war veteran, has an experience with technical details. I have been working with the children of the bomb and I have nothing else to do with them. Other vets, and especially the Iraqi vets, have summarized the mistakes that are very good in this film. Poetic license is something, but this movie is a complete fantasy and therefore does not produce a bad result. A bomb disposal unit or any device, this rogue carrier could not stand for more than 5 minutes. Military units regain their lives, discipline compliance and discipline of discipline. The opening scene was particularly troubling to me. The man with the cell phone would be shot immediately. Lying, stopping stopping is not an effective barrier. It got worse. The scenes with the gunman were particularly bright. Others say that the EOD boy does not know if you're a sniper, and that any Arab sniper has really improved your dreams. An Arab businessman should not be abducted for an individual revenge. Someone can shoot it, but it is limited to such risk-taking movies. I can continue, but as I said, others have been talking about these issues in detail. This is not a good movie, and if no prize can be won, it is a reflection of the La La land.
