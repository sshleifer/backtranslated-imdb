This film is one of the most nagging distortions of history. Extremely misleading, this film has been killed and tortured by hundreds of thousands of Dutch, English, Chinese, American and native slavery officers. The bridge chief engineer would be built on Japan's "corpse of the white man". This horrific horrors made by Japanese prisoners are the source of a film that the bridge itself does not approach to a real bridge. The actual bridge is built of steel and concrete, not wood. What are the survivors still alive today? They hate the film and everything that it will represent. His friends were starving, tortured and murdered by merciless Sadists. Dysantry, starvation, or disease do not kill the film that darkens the time.
