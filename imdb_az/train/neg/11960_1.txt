Actually, shortly before my heroic films in Asia, I completely retired after seeing a fictional story dump. But lately, I went to the exploitation field and decided to give them a chance. My first port was rated by high-level director Takashi Miike as "Guest Q". When I saw Audition and I do not like it, I consider it to be one of the better Asian horror movies. So I went into this job with sensitive expectations; and, unfortunately, only found boredom. Probably, this movie is really clever and has passed me through, but things that are similar to me are merely violent and bad scenes and have nothing to do with them. Any comparison on Luis Bunuel and David Lynch's case is blasphemy against me; All Miike pushed a movie here; Any intelligence surrounding it was carried out by ambitious fans, it was useless to find some sort of meaning. After about 10 minutes of my headache (after having had sex with a dad for some reason), she was unshakable until the end of the film; at least twenty-four hours later, or may appear. Do not get me wrong, I'm not against violent movies, and actually look for the most famous films around here; But it can be violent, though it is meaningless and boring and I could not enjoy it. Takashi Miike may have many fans, but of course I'm not one of them; and of course I will contact one of these films for the last time.
