In terms of plot and action, this movie was terrific. After about 80 minutes, I thought that he would end up and make it work as he did good. Basically, in the film five characters, A son and father, son's girlfriend and two men's age appear in the film, and then disappear without context or explanation. Films and scenes offer homo eroticism, but nothing has been revealed in this way or anything else. There were several bright scenes. At the beginning of the movie, she appears in a window outside her son's girlfriend's room, and they are alone in the conversation. Photography and behavior made it an incredible attraction to interact between the two, and admitted to having another "old man" with him. The end of this story.
