There are a few things in this film that make the bat. As Dani Filth's lead actor will automatically make some people like this movie. No doubt, I love the Filth Burc and have long been involved in this movie without looking at this movie. Dani Filth is a very well-known character and makes for a great structure. The independent shooting style of the film is great for the creepy factor. There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie. Special effects are also not bad for the budget to be low. <br /> <br /> Now the ways of killing people are very creative and dark. There is little talk in the whole movie, so much less character development. It's hard to be afraid of unusual, static characters. When talking a little, F bomb appeared in random places. Yes, the people I understand understand, but it seems like a child has written something like this before, and I thought for myself to have the whole language. <br /> <br /> In the end, the Fear does not look like a crook, many parts remain silent, and the lack of talk is about what is happening. porn for people who love sex and violence, but it does not work very well, just like a prank who wants to capture a storyline. If you are a patient who wants blood and food appetite, rent it.
