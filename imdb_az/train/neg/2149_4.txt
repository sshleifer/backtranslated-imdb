Well, the big cash machine did it again! Disney uses a very sensitive way as a logic that feels we need to have every video (good or bad) stamped by the Disney monkey. Why do I continue to wait for this "post-war", which I see in a bad day like Don Blunt Leonardo DaVinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three stories (already a poor choice!) Do not deserve at least one linear story from your favorite Disney creativity? These three are coming only near the end, the expected animation and story quality. Music is modest and up-to-date (more than 2 years will be dated) and the story does not add anything. Why should everything be renewed? As you know, the original cartoon is still popular because it is still timeless, so why are not you genuinely original with the songs that reflect the respectable and the same style? Gee, Sleeping Beauty can not be expected later. Instead of music based on Tchaikovsky, we will receive music inspired by Britney Spears !!! So, if you listen to Disney, we're not a child of any discrimination here. How can I put one bone or two to fans who have lived long enough to know the difference between mastery and calamity?
