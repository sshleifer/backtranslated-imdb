I'm not watching Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this poor excuse for a gentle prankstorm attack is unnecessary, there is nothing like mind and only serves as a self-promoting tool for Springer. Though it's fast 90 minutes, the movie creeps excited and I have to have a good idea to go. It's just fierce.
