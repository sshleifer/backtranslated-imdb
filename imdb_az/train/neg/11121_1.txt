Indeed, I do not understand how someone can give this disgusting movie more than 1 star ... How do you like the delayed movie, where all the animals abuse scenes are real? Even in these terrible moments, I do not want to imagine the terrible pain of these innocent and defenseless creatures ... Jesus ... What is a "human" without reason or money? I tell you that the director is either a mentally retarded or a monster with a 'heart' from the stone. Or both. <br /> <br /> A real frog has been healed, and the fish has been cut off as a sadistic, because there are various horrible barbaric scenes that can cause shock. <br /> <br /> This movie is a terrible thing; In addition to the "Hollywood Holocaust" or anything like that, we must be the worst and most delayed movie ever. I will not watch or buy any movie that this monster-like monster does. <br /> <br /> In some cases, nobody should spend time in the case of many great movies staged on any of the scenes of animal use. Of course, it's the worst movie, so it's not a success. Hopefully, I hope that this delayed director will never realize that superhuman oppression and violence against REAL animals will never be praised and that he will staging scenes of animal abuse in the following films. I really believe that everyone accepts, but what does it give? <br /> <br /> All the delayed and brutal "people" will be one day when they feel the pain they feel for others. I usually did not comment on a movie, but this time I just could not get it. I have to tell the truth that animals should be stopped!
