How is this a blockbuster? Dear God, I do not know why this film is going to start with so many sucks. The film was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I like is the movement of some characters. The film was very bright, they should do something with lighting, for example. makes the environment darker. Some of the dead characters look like a horror film in 1970. It's 2006! People are not afraid of other people who make heavy makeup. Most of the horror scenes were taken from other Hollywood or Asian horror films. Overall rip off! That's why I do not watch tagalog movies. The reason why many people are "shouting" while watching this film is just a match. How many times should we take the "Ring" scenes and come to the window next to him instead of the girl's TV? ALWAYS BE LIMITED, ALWAYS LIKE YOU LIKE TO COME. If you like a good horror movie, you can watch the 50 best horror movies listed on this website.
