I was expecting something better than the Battlestar Galactica franchise. A very dull prequel to the main series. I wait for the first 30 minutes to finish it. Symbols include religion, computer, programming, penalties and so on. They are talking about ... There are gangsters, mafia types that carry out hits. However, Caprica does not have the action of the original series to deal with slower parts. <br /> <br /> While watching movies, I'll give you some helpful tips: As a general rule, you'll know a lot of extreme exploitations, and then the movie will be a bit worse. Caprica has so much. The director / writer typically tries to compensate for his bad habits by throwing several naked bodies. It will not work anymore and all this will worsen the young actresses involved and apologize to them. <br /> <br /> If you want to be bored for an hour or a half, give it to Caprica. If you want to see naked objects, there is a free porn on Net. Otherwise, you have to act, there is nothing to see here.
