Shiner, led by Christian Calson, links with three "pairs" around relationships and intimidation. It's a good start as I'm concerned. It's interesting. <br /> <br /> The Het Couple is really a heterosexual couple playing a lot of roles, two heterosexual men and a plain guy's "harmless" movie. There are some scenes showing that they want to be aggressive when engaging in sex or playing with each other, but there is no real purpose for marginalization. I assume that they raise the issue on the agenda of how gender / violence is integrated into the couple's life. Couple is not too aggressive or even erotic. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <p style = "text-align: justify; Someone agreeing to sex with a homosexual person in an alley, some of them with some gay cooking The violence causes them to become violent, and this is a form of sexual pleasure, and as the film progresses, the demand for violence increases, and my main problem is violence, not convincing. It's a big problem, considering that the whole theme of the film is related to the violent relationships of characters, and, unfortunately, makeup does not help. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's too bad, and I wondered if I really was hitting one of the characters. /> <br /> <strong> Here Calson spoke more and developed a more narrative story It may be that the characters are more developed and eventually solved. <br /> <br /> "If I stayed with these two films, Shiner would have been better. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Calson's desire to get a lot of this movie. Surprising. The lowest budget spending is not very desirable. I do not want to talk about Calson's achievements. I did not find anything particularly controversial or uncomfortable. The siren was incredible. This does not mean that the director can not achieve anything with the next movie. <br /> <br /> There is something in his words.
