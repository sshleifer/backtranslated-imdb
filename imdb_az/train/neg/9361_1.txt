When I saw the front view for the television, I thought, "Of course, I'm going to be a good werewolf" but that's it. that was terrible! The move was good, the land was terrible, the military proposal was simply foolish. I think the SCI-FI can work better than this crap. The film sounded like Arroyo's wormback, instead of psychologically turned away and dropped out of the doctor's throat. While you read some of my other films in some other sources, there are positive results, but that's just the story's terrible. Up to 10 max. I'm sure everyone was waiting for my wrist, but I did not expect it. Beyond Loch Nes was a better thing than this movie; heck, any movie in a deep-rooted movie is better than this movie.
