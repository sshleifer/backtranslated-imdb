This flick reminds me of really bad science-fiction films from 50 to 60. It is not frightening or not interesting, but it's boring, cheesy, and stupid. Special effects are funny, all the actors are laughable and the end is just scary. If you spend your money, buy or rent something better. I'll give you 10 to 3.5 (I found this Turkey very fun because of its foolishness).
