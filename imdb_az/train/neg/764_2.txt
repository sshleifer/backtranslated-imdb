The script of the Columbo film came from the soap opera of the 1980s. Deeper films are great, but symbols are compulsory. And in this movie something has changed me. It sounds as though it was written as a romantic writer. Great Lt. Columbo is not his famous, beloved, lonely, self-critical place; and the bride / kidnapping victim, jealousy, a dimness of ugly anxiety (he was scared of a small scalpel kept in his hands). what you know your hand in 2 seconds). In a sense, in any sense, this character could have had TRIED to fight or fight at least a bit. And talk about the truth .... The story takes place around the theft and solved by the police. Police ?? Give me some time. Everyone knows that the FBI seized every theft. It was not Columbo, only a neat and completely predictable criminal drama, familiar Lt. It was written in Columbo and lasted for about 2 hours.
