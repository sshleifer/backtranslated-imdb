The Forbidden Siren Siren 2 is based on Playstation 2 (more than 2s). Like many videos, I would say that most would not really be a good environment. <br /> <br /> There is a long prologue describing and describing the beginning of life and a mysterious island on a writer (Leo Morimoto) and her daughter's daughter. Comes to access Yuki (Yui Ichikawa) and his son Hide (Jun Nishiyama). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Caucasus is a crush and our brothers and sisters These strangers with their strangers enter into a mission around this place to clarify what is happening on the island. But in reality, you will not be disturbed by what happened, just as the majority of folklore and mischief are thrown out to disassociate. Indeed, when he was accused of the evil comedy, he simply deceived the pungent odors of his unexpected, unrelenting moments, as described later. <br /> <br /> Although this is a watch watch over 90 minutes - I think it's a phenomenon of fear film. a business process benchmark - means what he wants with slow development that takes almost two hours to feel. <br /> <br /> It starts to get things right in the last 20 minutes, but this is a very late delayed classic. <br /> <br /> To save the movie, it's how it is understood and how it has changed. Again, it is a common device used to try to add a little bit more of a horror movie that looks hopeful like the audience. It appeared in a very flawless manner, but leaves you a bad diet after a bit deceived. There are two ways to feel a twist - either raising the movie to a memorable level or providing a sense of this story. <br /> <br /> <strong> The Caucasian Siren was more concerned with the latter. <br /> <br /> The protective grace will be his cinematography with light, shadows and mirrors, but I will be clear that it is still not worth it, it's better to avoid it.
