You must admire how to get a perfect actor and spend in such a movie. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, and could not even save this movie. In fact, his character is exactly the same as in Cape Fear, but I do not stop when the actors do the same thing over multiple films. <br /> <br /> There is nothing strange about this movie, but after that, a million times have been reported. Wesley Snipes is a typical baseball player and his definition shows its characteristic. De Niro plays obsessed fan, but his role in this movie is less than fun <br /> <br /> However, since De Niro is in this movie, he sees everything, no matter how bad he is. But see Midnight Run, Goodfellas or Cop Land to see De Niro's best, even go back and check the "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II". <br /> <br /> My rating is 3/10
