I hired a Video Teacher video without knowing anything else. Cannon-winning films are usually very good or too bad, and I'm a little worried about it. Unfortunately, this is the last category. One fourth of this road, saying with a loud voice, "This movie is boring." I'm telling myself that I was looking at more than half a year, "Where have I seen this before?" <br /> <br /> This film is basically a better arrangement of Robert Altman (1969) and is better: "This Cold Day Park." Details are clearly different, and Altman's work is more fraudulent and less characteristic, The two films are the same. There is nothing new to do in this production. Each aspect has already been realized: a character that goes out of control of destructive behaviors (Abel Ferrara's "Bad Lieutenant", 1992); a death and deprivation of "love" resulting in death on a mortal scene (David Cronenberg's "M. Butterfly", 1993); unusual single sex scenes (David Lynch's "Blue Velvet", 1986); and so on. Here, most of the film is "shocked", "crushing" and so on. I'm worried about the negativity they find. This highly derivative film seems to be designed to help the audience feel uncomfortable and some. However, basically, such a reaction is due to the lack of film-review experience. See just enough movies and you've actually seen them all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If I'm the first and most important of Haneke's films, I think I'll be in the same position with Ferrara: an interesting filmmaker, but almost genius will not give it to her.
