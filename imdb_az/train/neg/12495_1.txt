Okay, I love fears. Especially I love the fear that is bad enough to have fun. Demonicus, or the House of the Dead - it was bad enough to have fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < probably, Seattle, see). Who is working around and cutting heads? He did it for more than a year (I do not go back to get accurate figures - thank you so much), probably two or three years. Once a week. The police are now calling "the expert" (ONCE expresses itself as a psychic, but never comes out). <br /> <br /> Schya is right! Feds do what after killing THREE? After a rising death, we will deal with the military situation !!!!! In any case, this "specialist" consults with voodoo chick that ignores all the time of the police, and secondly, Baron Samedi (and possibly the seizure of the world - perhaps possibly going to Disneyland) to get enough power to build a body, it understands. <br /> I hope. <br /> <br /> Setting - this is where it happened? Yes, if you are not Seattledan, there is a poster for a local radio station in the bar / rave (about 10 film workers and their family members) and this is fun, "Pulp Fiction" escalation dialogue (like IF) between two police officers (yes, turned their heads off for 15 minutes), debated in "new stadium", film was shot. <br /> <br /> I apologize for being a Seattledman and I'm afraid to be ashamed of my head. <br /> OK, here's a really critical place - to be a scary movie writer (not published, looking for my name on IMDb), I'm doing research. Many studies. Unlike the writers of this film, Baron Samedi - Voudon Loa (spirit), which protects the tombs and is traditionally associated with the "Devil" by "the devil", is actually a toy like "Loki". <br /> <br /> In other words, they did not cut their heads. <br /> <br /> In addition, a large part of Voudoun's religion can be a corpse when Baron Samedi wants. Their religious ceremonies were given to various members of the congregation. <br /> <br /> If someone already had one, why should he have a new body? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If Baron Samedi is a corpse, cut off his head and go around, get good rum, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In summary, We've done research again. (Everyone remembers the old night-time advertisement in the phone's Tarot reading - "Valentine-You'll be glad with your beloved ...") and all this nonsense? <br /> <br /> If you do not comment on this, I congratulate you. Again I apologize. If you feel the need to watch the movie for me, I'm so upset, so do not do it.
