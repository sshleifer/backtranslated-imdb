This romantic comedy is not too bad. <br /> <br /> But an American footballer (except for a banker) is an amateur. Some scenes are fun, but some are simply embarrassing. In particular, I found the "romantic" part of the story poor. <br /> <br /> In general, it is worth seeing the love of football and romantic comedies. This is not really a bad movie, and the end has made it very good. Do not just wait for something ordinary. It's fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
