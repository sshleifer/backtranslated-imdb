A few non-professional actors fight terrorism by a prehistoric lifestyle. This live, approximately thirty second marginal stop-motion animation appears, but when the rest of the film is substituted with the production assistants swinging around the inner tube, how long will it take for the margin? This funny charity boat, which suddenly became the first symbol of the lease, was abandoned by the doofus, but there was no time for terror; but still have to admit that they are trying to make fun of them. Only one of them eats and the other sits on a rock living alone - it's no fun!
