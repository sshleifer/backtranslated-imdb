I love Alec Guinness. And after this movie he says a lot. In fact, he is not bad. He goes aside, from the heart and his usual taste, but what he spends. The girl they are accustomed to him is as flimsy as a young French girl. <br /> <br /> Sara Alec will not choose her when she is a kid, and it is clear that she is not happy about it anymore. <br /> <br /> An interesting character is the dark brother of this Suzanne. "Donald" wanted to be French Heathcliffe and waited for the source of his secret. How deeply hidden was that secret that was hidden behind his forehead? Did he fall in love with his father's wife? Why did she squeeze Suzanne's hair when she planned to bring different parts of the country to the country? Perhaps he was a very loyal player. <br /> <br /> The film, Guiness and the "old woman", would be memorable, remembering somewhere in Paris. That would be a great story! Two beautifully-experienced people in a beautiful city after the disintegration of World War II. Why did somebody not see this? I recommend Alec Guiness to watch the movie "Card" in a little-known but worthwhile movie.
