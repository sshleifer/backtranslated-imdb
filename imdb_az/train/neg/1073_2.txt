I do not believe in a film that your talent will be wasted! The Gingerbread Man manages to set up the right foot and build great expectations for the end. But at one point, the movie is one of the worst stories I've ever had. It's incredible how it controls Kenneth Branak's character around the magnificent Mallory Doss's nose. The rise of the film is irrelevant and straightforward as a beer kept in the sun for too long. Gingerbread Man is probably the worst Grisham-movie and talented stars will not be replaced by this movie. Do not waste your time here!
