Mulberry is put sugercoma by Teen Ape. When he wakes up, he (it's partly played by Debbie Rochon) gets quite hot and gets revenge for doing wrong. The subtitle and box art meant that it would actually be filmed from the Kill Bill, but because it's a Chris Seaver movie, I love this wildly inadequate satirical (and I have been using it from the last days) than the first movie but to the truth, when I saw the previous movie, I did not even hear that I could not compare these two points at this point. But I should have been happy since I bought it later (I see it when I'm drunk to have a better word, full, and no common movie) A few loud voices laugh (very few) But I remember Bonejack though funnier. <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < br> <br /> Debbie Rochon and Lbp network; Second comment by Seaver; Making Featured on 31 Minutes; Lloyd Kaufman's 6-minute low budget picture; Fake 2-minute sherbet trade; gallery galleries; Promo trailer; : "Mulva", "Search for Egg Salad", "Fiilthy McNasty" 1, 2, & 3; "Feral Man", "Bonesetter", "Midnight Skater", "Demon Summer" and "Splatter Rampage Wrestling"
