This movie is bad, you can not imagine it. The player is worse than the third-class soap operas. This film is the most successful shame in Switzerland over the past 20 years. The interaction of soldiers did not make any sense. The story could have been removed from a bravo photo story, the dialogs were wooden like Treebeard, and the ground holes were larger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. But now it is not necessary to provide this audience. Actors were nice, for example, former Swiss Miss, and the main character was even hanging (woah !!) and, of course, exploited many drugs. This is a wonderful person! Especially for teens 12 and 13 years old. But as the media creates an atmosphere of gambling, it was not allowed to denied the film because of the dynamics of that group because you do not talk to another "sheep" and say it. exactly what happened when I was in the army, what exactly do I do when I must go to the army .. Every cheese that is related to the drug and the cold. And I do not think I love the army. I was there and I hated it, but this film is worse than cleaning the toilet brush with a sticky toilet (I had to do this because I insulted a lieutenant). Not every movie should be complicated. Sometimes I just want to indulge in a couple of hours and forget the problems and I'm not a bad thing. But such films influence young people with a very exciting lifestyle and make them foolish, ignorant and egocentric dumbfounders. But now that my idea is not very popular, I'm going to be calm now and come to avoid this terrible flick and save your thoughts. <br /> 2/10 <br /> (I apologize for my bad English)
