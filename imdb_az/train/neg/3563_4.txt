Most of the film looks like an "attempted TV" effort. Moved to action, moving (except Fred Guinea) was overturned and soapy. Denise Crosby, in particular, provides its own lines as it reads from the beacon card. Only one thing is to watch this movie, and once Gage comes back from "Sincerity." There is something to worry about watching a little kidnapping, and this is one more reason why only somebody can handle it. It's completely bone-cold. This film is just one thing, but it removes something from the park. Just see the last 10 minutes or so.
