I went to see this with my husband and 3 year old son. She liked me more than my husband. Writing is surprisingly poor for the pixar / Disney excursion. In fact, I draw a lot of attention. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> The concept was not simply strange when we first met "family" (bad scene?). I know we can get the impression that the family is a ridiculous, good lord, a good 15 minutes could shorten this look (in appearance, in fact I did not do it). At this point, I scratched my head out.
