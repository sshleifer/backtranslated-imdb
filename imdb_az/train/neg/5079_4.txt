How great an actor is such a terrible story ... <br /> <br /> Film and its production are very good, though London, but in Bristol. It does not matter ?? <br /> <br /> If you see a cathedral in the First Cathedral, you have seen it all. <br /> <br /> The story is ... but it is a man who has been born to die and destroy everybody and every thing. I wish. Speaking of only one passage from the real-life examples of Telekinesis, he builds a picture of a man who has been relocated and made a wrong decision as a boy, youth, and finally a person; That is, in fact, the discipline of discipline is in the true sense of the word. Over time, he has misled the entire world and leads to destruction, so to speak? <br /> <br /> The difficulty with the Prophet is to mix true scientific information about the strange intellectual powers and to combine them with the semi-religious union to produce all these things. The theory about all this. Is this fashionable mixed truth and fantasy rarely worked? and I am convinced that Richard Burton was trying to duplicate in some cases. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Starting with Lino Ventura, Garde A Vu (1981), along with Inspector Brunel, helps to get more and more sound; As Harry Andrews Commissioner Assistant; Lee Remick, who is very low, like Dr. Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi, the publisher, like Towney and several well-known actors. <br /> <br /> I love how the story is presented, and the writer tried to kill Morlar (Richard Burton) with a killer intervention to fill the back story. Until that point, Brunel and a British sidekick were a sight-seeing detective. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that during the last 15 minutes, they went after everything. If you want a clue on this topic, think of Samson and Delilah (1949), the famous Cecil B. de Mille and Samson at the end. And the last scene is simply stupid. Why? <br /> <br /> In some cases: <br /> <br /> In some cases, maybe, Burton really needs money. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Burton, take time to see the scene I have shown above. Otherwise, do not worry.
