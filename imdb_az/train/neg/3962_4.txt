When I actually saw Renan's beautiful debut, I met Nana, Fate Whirlpool. I read that Nana was generally considered to be the best silent movie, so there were high hopes. Unfortunately, it was felt like a step backward step. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hessling is the main problem of this film. Even for a silent film, the player is on top. His film can be seen in early teenagers, not in the late 20s. It is usually reminiscent of someone who has a symptom of pain (sorry). It was very difficult to believe that any man would fall for this femme fatale. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> The story tells me that Pabst reminded Pandora's Box. It is interesting to compare these two films, because these films are only 3 years old. <br /> <br /> This film is only for Renoir sets or very serious silent films.
