The daughters die on the altar, and their bodies are gone. Everyone is upset, but nobody can understand why and how it happened and can not prevent it from happening. Be with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for it, because she is responsible for transferring her spouse from the spine to these young women and transferring their former spouse. Keep going with me. Finally, the authorities understand that one has to upgrade the death and the loss, but of course they do not understand incredible motives. Let's not see lying pseudoscience and act ... If you can overcome the first twenty minutes of this confusion, we will treat Lugosi with the help of a laboratory assistant to disrespect one of the brides who killed her. a casket coffer than a bed, and other uncertain parodies of realistic fear movies (budgets and fields). Anhoo - a female journalist is blaming the nose of a sinner (and remarkable cops will not be together), and then the entertainment really begins. <br /> <br /> Cinematography and toy are good. There are people who are very well dressed and very good in this movie. The director is a bit better than the fair and scenario-decent material. Nevertheless, this film is not the toughest fan of the body, it does not keep all its interests. The best thing about it ... It ends, but not enough.
