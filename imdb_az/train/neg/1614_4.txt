The second half of Steven Soderberg is involved in the latest revolutionary revolution in Che Guevara's revolutionary bios to revolutionize Bolivia. To maintain a holistic visa to Che Soderberghin, concentrate on the massive execution of the Cuban revolution and the conquest of the Congo adventure ("Congo magazine") to support the rise of the government against the Bolivian government. <br /> <br /> Like a Deer of Eden East of Berndikio Del Toro, Berndikio Del Toro is a disaster caused by the release of the first chapter, as he slowly slowed down to squeeze Guevara's authorship while playing Soderberg. The problem is that Guevara has achieved a little success in converting it and soon finds himself and his comrades swallowed up in the darkness of the Bolivian Jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog in the Context, Aguirre, God's anger Soderbergh, can not benefit from the tree's metaphorical possibilities to uplift the guerrilla power. He worries more than checking Che's nimbus more than investigating the panic of the deceased. There is a Chezian moment sitting down because a difficult father snaps and shouts to move, but in general, the Soderberghin mise scene is flat, unique and inexplicable. <br /> <br /> Both films show that Soderbergh has an open Che Group, and its reason is that it is myopic and narrow. He has a lot of time spent on the Lego statue to improve his relationship with players led by Fidel Castro. Making matters worse is a slow and noble approach that never comes from burning. He was thinking that Eisenstein and Vertov had enough to realize that the change that had won was better than a broomstorm.
