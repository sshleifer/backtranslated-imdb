Why me? Why should I kill such an interesting argument? <br /> <br /> In some cases, I had to watch such a horrible movie for college course. Otherwise, I would look at the synopsis behind the scenes and direct them. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> A small character developed and a creepy little white man with an LA-style token black man hang, watch the movie - experience the experience of stereotypical LA overflankity. Although it is not DEPICT that we think of this film as "LA life style", it is a fine example of ARISE products.
