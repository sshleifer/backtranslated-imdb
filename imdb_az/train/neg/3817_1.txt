Seriously. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;">> Characters - neatly bizarre Danny, cartoon Joey, Jesse who knocked on the hair, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ and almost normal Stephanie. Do the creators of this show really want to hate the characters? <br /> <br /> Therefore, I do not think everyone should watch this show. <br /> <br /> According to one of the students, after a few minutes, the show takes a few minutes and I think that instead of lethal injection, all criminals have to watch this show. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10 or: D
