Recap: According to the legend, Valkyrie challenged Odil at Brunhilde and was chained to a rocky forest surrounded by an eternal fire. Only a heartbreaker warrior can pass through the flames, releasing Brunhilda and his Odin claiming free and for him. Now the battle is brewed on Norwegian soil and needs the alliance with King Berserkers. The Berserkers alleged warriors claimed by Odin valkyries, lusting for battle, blood and meat, and therefore outcasts, but superior in battle. Berserkers' leader, King, is a respected son of Boar and his brother, the future king of Barack. But when the king won the battle, he refused to renounce his only remaining son, breaking his blood, betraying and killing him. Boar was just saved on Odin by calling Barek. <br /> <br /> I'm going to shoot a movie about this, hoping for some Viking peaks, Viking, and very few good movies. <br /> <br /> In the legends of Aesir the foundation was subtle and seemed to me very bad. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; Odin is more vengeful, indifferent, and vampire than some of the school I've been told." <br /> <br /> But the fatal error created by this film is from today to the present, if the two brothers fought in the right time, this would have been better in some of the best battles.From now, Odin takes part and sends Boar and Berserkers to Brunhilda and Barek and among the industries is Barek's armored coatings and armored swords are painted, beautiful mountains and forests have been changed for cement. <br /> <br /> As soon as I was allowed to focus on single battles as in the early days, I soon saw that the actors' battles and abilities are slow and calm. Sometimes it is a delicate story, it's hard to watch and it's just another time The only movement that can save him is the slow, boring and calm sword, which is less than the Aesir myth or Viking tradition. Thus both the story and the action are unsuccessful and the film is just bad. <br /> <br /> Finally, in Switzerland, this movie is a little surprising. It is believed that South Africa has been completely filmed and still looks like some Swedish signs, tiles, and original police cars. But the effort is weak and only goes so far, in Sweden. No name is Swedish (perhaps with Anya), Sweden has no familiarity scene, they (probably) speak a little (ancient) Norwegian. Police and medicine are not uniforms, but also Swedish. Even if it did not try to do it properly - and if you really give the illusion that it was built in Sweden, why worry about it? <br /> <br /> 4/10
