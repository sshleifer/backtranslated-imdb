<br /> <br /> That's why it's just about Halloween, Knott's Scary Farm, and it's really a mood for watching a cute Halloween movie. Make me a dollar. <br /> <br /> Usually, I want to go through "good things" like this one, but I resisted the call here, and I'm still not sure why. As mentioned in the opening drawings, this is not a "real" movie, not a B-movie. DeCoteau's "Heroism" movie is more like a horror film (about the fact that I'm not going to lure anyone of his all-college college boy) in a film shot like a 50-gig. There was no cutaway shots (multiple camera installations too expensive) and flat lighting ... but difficult to define. There is something striking about a filmmaker watching a half-decent film in cash. Even if he's done a half-decent job, the price of this movie is not that bad, but photography is pretty good (though it's as bright as it is), there are some surprises <br /> <br /> Many college boys they remain in the warehouse of the house decorated. A scary old man gives them a satirical book and accidentally calls for the power of hell. This is the cause of many confusion and human suffering in haunted men's costumes. On the way we are dealing with a very complicated and thoughtful lesbian relationship - it seems to be the best of both films. Yes, there is a sex scene, but it's not sexual - or at least you will not find in any legitimate movie about sexually explicit lesbians. It is unusual to have time and effort to do this without resorting to a horrific film of horror. <br /> <br /> Another thing that interests me is that "80 children who were sexually assaulted and murdered by foolish children" were trying to imitate the slasher's vibe. It is difficult to accept it, because there are many existing films that have become genres. <br /> <br /> I do not believe these cinema artists are just good or bad that they are trying to make another entry in this genre, but it's still a TYPE genre, but I appreciate it. <br /> <br /> So I sat down; Sometimes it just wants to watch a foolish, off-budget "A-For-Sake" horror movie. Indeed, there was not enough money for filmmaking by the producers, there was a lot of trouble, infinite field holes, dead ends, and clich√©s, and the movie's unsuccessful general feelings ... at least the haunting home scenes were pretty cool. <br /> <br /> In some cases, a few years ago, possible spoiler **, but with a vampire girl in the coffin was a big, short job: "I was claustrophobic, but I changed it." Ha ha, good one.
