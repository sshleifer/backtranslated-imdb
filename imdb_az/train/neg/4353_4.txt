Class is a comedy series that describes a group of 27-year-old old friends. <br /> <br /> I love the idea of ​​the show. That is why I'm concerned that the class is not negative, although the class is not funny. It's not enough, corky, just dorky. (Haha.) This is a slow pace and a lack of really hilarious punch lines. Also some players have difficulty with the time. <br /> <br /> The most invented characters are twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but they appear to be a little more square than the goodness of the show. On the other hand, the characters that most not interested are the main character Ethan and the few used Duncan and Nicole. <br /> <br /> The only thing that bothered me with the series was the Latino character, Aaron, although it was an unpleasant character, on the contrary.
