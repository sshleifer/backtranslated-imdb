I try to understand the Indian cinema and hopefully hoping to give this movie a chance to shoot 2 hours of my life (actually only 35 minutes). All I've seen is a few old films from S.Ray. <br /> <br /> I've come across this one browsing through IMDb and after seeing the rating of 8.7 it should be one that opens unknown doors and bring artistic pleasure. Oh how wrong it was! This rating is only 8.7, explaining only logically, that most of the 970 people who vote are from India and only one venture outside of Bolliwood, Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is a 9th place with this rating on IMDb on the list of 250 best films from Citizen Cane, Psycho Goodfellas! I'm really a mood to review and criticize, because there is nothing worth remembering from this painful experience. My only hope is that many Hindus who like this movie are straightforward with a stupid, numerous kitsch and cheerless music.
