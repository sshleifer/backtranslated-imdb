Well looked good on the paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer reunited this time again with the heist film, The Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But my darling, what speed it is for Indiana Jones 2 Speed. A smart toy (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) fights against a certain scenario and gets worse. The film is a little longer for Freemasons. But Freemasons uses comic handshakes and plays golf, the Freemasons, the Knights Templar natural generations (and no one from "Hell" or Jack Ripper.) I do not think because I have ever found any land spoilers. Indeed, there is no surprise, no surprise, and no climax - it just stops. The National Treasure aims for Dan Brown, but Scooby Doo is hitting the same intellectual level as the episode.
