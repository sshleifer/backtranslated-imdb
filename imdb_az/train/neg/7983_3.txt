In the amount, there are more holes in the ground than the Swiss cheese! The director and co-writer says he wants to mix genres - drama and comedy in this case. Well, at least here these two mixtures like vinegar and butter. Comedy for boot is not very funny and young. In addition, the film is not really realistic. A French citizen will be freed from his own will and freedoms in connection with the legitimate law-enforcement system in France's hospitals. I watched this movie on my big screen TV at home, and I started screaming at the movie. Finally, when I came to the end, I quickly accelerated the last word, one of the main characters, the son of an old lover. At that time, I was outdated by the mixed confusion surrounding her dead lover, comfort, and flawed old lover. Sometimes the plot directs the two main characters to their families and returns to one of them - Ismael or Nora. Despite the harm of the audience, she changes her mind from Nora and Ismail, who limits her old lover to a will in the psychiatric hospital. Perhaps there are two potentially interesting films developed. Epilogue does not really cover many areas and seems to want the viewer to think that he can be happy as Nora, though his chances of real life are equal to the chance of a snowball in Hell. Actors do their best and become attractive, but it's not enough to eliminate all the obvious defects of poor writing, correction and attention.
