My favorite group - Maggie Smith, very young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov, were thrilled to get acquainted with the comedy at the end of the 1960s. My dream is so complicated to find out whether the film is a comedy or a perfect heist film. Ustinov spent a small amount of time going out of the prison where he placed sites just in a large American company in London. Last year, Ustinov, a former CEO and co-founder of Tech Geek Newhart, left himself as a computer expert and is planning to stage the film's "perfect heist." To do this, he must pass a dangerous security system that protects the corporation's main casket. And the problem is one. His perfect plan works only because everyone in the movie is incredible and stupid. Her naked excuses are taken away and this should be the focus of any computer center to avoid having to worry about video cameras. The second problem - heist (really fraudulently) smashes the rest of the dramatic tension in the first 30 minutes of the film. Maggie Smith simply regretted Ustinov's ditsy side-by-side neighbor, who could not handle a job. I like Maggie Smith very much, but it is composed of numerous compositions that sound more logical, a physical comedian. Moreover, Ustinov and Smith are not merged with any chemistry, and maybe age is different, but romantic relationships, romantic relationships, and romantic relationships, are still a little shocking despite romanticism. Ustinov wrote a script and was well thought of at that time, but he had a very good rash.
