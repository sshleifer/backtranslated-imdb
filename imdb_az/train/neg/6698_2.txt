To Say Funky Forest: The First Link is a reduction in incredible proportions of a bad movie. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Now we can enter a good art house movie, even like El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+ surreal and wounded reptiles, because the movies really are> FFFC is trying to be deep and intellectual in every lane, in fact there is no substance in this film. This movie is not bad, the visuals are not inspirational in this movie, the worse the dialogue, the musical numbers are dropping this movie. GUITAR BROTHERS are confused but this is immediately unnecessary and depends instantly. I think he tried to be profound and meaningful, but it's just an ambitious irrelevant nonsense. <br /> <br /> Guitare Brothers and sketches have 1 point between routines, everything is different, pseudo-creative, and heavy-handed attempts. Sogo Ishii, David Lynch, and other REAL directors like Jodoworsky. Give me some time. I am convinced that people who are connected to FFFC do so because they do not know what they see. Because they are nothing but mere statements here, they are mixed up with their shyness and dullness. <br /> <br /> This is a movie, scene, cinematography, charming dialogue, funny moments, good soundtrack, perfect speeches, perfect speeches, perfect speeches, fantastic pacing and flow. FFFC, on the other hand, is full of contrasts, a rich scene (20 minutes at a moderate beach, totally white, floating in a white space, a dinky school corridor, and then ... school corridor?) <br /> < <br /> There are those who say that FFFC is a great movie, and that it's all about its pure genius. non-traditional. It's just a good quality for an "unexpected" movie, if it's not merge with "angry", "innaneous" and "terrible" because it's just a way to hit your own ego. Personally, I talked to two people when FFFC left the theater, but the artisans watched many rave films by elitists and then came back to me ... "Hey Hey, I'll put my foot down, The movie is inconceivable, and I'm telling you that Roger Ebert is the best thing this movie has never been to. "He is a virgin," says the "Emperor's New Wear" ... This movie is another way of showing the other psychedelic / trippy films from Japan over the past 10 years. 7 and Kamikaze Girls are a better movie (even with a low budget) and can not be compared to anyone with the Survive Style 5+, and if FFFC is interested only in making an ambitious stack of anything on a budget.
