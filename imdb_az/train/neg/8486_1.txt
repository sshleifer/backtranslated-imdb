I do not believe that there is something original and interesting about this movie. I'm not a fan of science fiction as the next man, and I can use even old movies with funny buildings as long as an ape is written by someone else. <br /> <br /> A monkey might have better explained my idea of ​​the main idea behind this film seriously. <br /> <br /> The problem is that consumers do not have a low budget. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> San Francisco Chronicle <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'll show them to journalists and would like to remind them that they talk about Island Conceiving.)
