It does not bend over Creepshow 3 but it's approaching. <br /> <br /> It also uses the same technique that uses some roles in at least some of the horror roles. <br /> <br /> This can be compared with Twilight Zone Serling's next Night Gallery). Unfortunately, producers and writers forgot Serling's sympathy for their characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The awesome story: Adam West ... well, himself. He does not go to the 60th route of Bruce Wayne / Batman campaign, but it rarely happens. He has a spin-flash title that is simply to compare with the mysterious "Jay" (Dr. Terror, Eramus and The Cryptkeeper) and makes some mildly hopeless and creepy phrases. <br /> Abernathy: Rod Serling's "Willoughby Stop" book? Then you saw it. Nutso's husband's red fruits are not familiar with any purpose, even the friend of the mother character describes him as a wise person. <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: Recalling the stories of various Serling time journeys involving Stell Allen's "The Minds of the Mind". The majority of actors are not too bad (except Joshius, Josh Astin, walking, talking and even breathing) and this idea is mildly interested. But like Abernathy, it does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Repetition of life: I believe that what people are surprised by the remote-controlled magic features. The main character is soft sympathetic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But, /> <br /> Finale: So why ... do people cost the silver clothes in the cold storehouse? I dont know. And it's not logical. So ... ... all the heroes went to the bookstore and were trapped? Kinda is happy with the boxer (thank you guys!) And the guy in the first half died. So how did he get trapped? Before he died, he visited the bookstore, was trapped and ... did not he die? Yes? Huh? I think it is not supernatural but logical. But still ... <br /> Generally: basically two new Twilight Zone series, or some episodes of Tales Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and the second part are probably worth your time. But there is nothing really spectacular here.
