First, the title character is not the main character of the film. He is the religious leader's sidekick. The actor singing Igoru loudly laughs laughingly and dragging your eyes to a curved smile could be a good way to frighten people. Igor was also afraid to shout at a loud voice (of course, not just talking). He was also indifferent to each other. For example, when the religious leader saw him killing one of the audience, Igor saw that, "Paul, no Paul!" He begges. Why did you do that? On another stage, Igor says to the victim that "he will have to carry out his own surgical operations" because it was time to act. In addition to the ridiculous action, the end is not meaningful, as the smallest bull of Igor's head hook axis, where the story's head and his last friends were killed, are still twice to kill the "good children" of the story. The film tells the viewer that only Igor's soul has escaped from the hospital and does not give any explanation. Yes??? Bottom line does not waste your time watching this movie. Please, I can take back my memories.
