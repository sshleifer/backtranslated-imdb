To watch this was to get a great snack that was swept over your face. Even when you think, "This graveyard will not come back again" * the rifle was there. I'm not sure what they think. A pilot who is watching and wondering: "Did they know that there was a prisoner who did not want to be put into a team of actors?" Not only black stereotypes but also Swedish and Indian. And while "Saddles Blazing" made these stereotypes a comedy and anxiety, these stereotypes were only plainly insulting. There was no plot line, there was no end, and no jokes. If you're still a comedy student, follow this pilot to see what to do.
