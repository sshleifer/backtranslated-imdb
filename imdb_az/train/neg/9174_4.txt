I usually like zombie movies, but it was just bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Good parts: Sonya Salomaa's topless, down the girl's face, was overwhelmed when she fled and when she fled from him. <br /> <br /> The bad part: many video cuts, too much Matrix slow motion (accelerates movements), enough blood and drought, bad behavior and no story. The only one of the theater's minds was clever and left behind the topless swimming area. $ 6 and total time consuming. I'll give it to 10 to 2.
