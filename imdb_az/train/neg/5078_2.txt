When in 1977, "Exorcist II: The Heretic" did not give him any benefit, it is hard to imagine that verbally extraordinaire Richard Burton did not see it in the excitement. As you've seen before: Burton, at an early age, is a writer who discovered that courageous objects have the power to act as intelligent (and Carrie did not have any influence on Hollywood!). Despite being adapted by a novel by Peter van Greenaway, Medusa plays as a recurring item, although it has a special effect on the finals of the cathedral (typically). Lee Remick attends as a doctor, but the castle that supports it is very weak. Burton is hamy, but tired ... even telekinesis can save him from this point. * From 1/2
