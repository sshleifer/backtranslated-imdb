Robin Williams performs well as another player at The Night Listener. However, the film runs out and needs to see a lot of "ends empty to see empty." I do not think there is strong enough relationship between the Caller and Jabrail Noon (because IMDb wanted to correctly write to "no one"). <br /> <br /> This movie runs or appears a little over 1:30 and the first 15 minutes, Noon, Pete Logande, calls a boy searching. <br /> <br /> This is a mysterious seeker about 3 or 4 times. How do you feel about conversations at great depths? I'm in the hospital ... why your lover has moved ... and so on. Child's shadow and help in the book of the child <br /> <br /> Noon in the movie faces finding Logande, but he understands why this guy is in search. Why is the audience so wonderful? No doubt there is no strong connection between Noon and the caller, why is it worrying? Who cares if there is no caller? <br /> <br /> I know that there is a difference between a book and a movie, but these calls and relationships are important for the screen, as it is the basis of the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a surprise to Maupi's other work, City Tales. When put into a mini series, it worked fine.
