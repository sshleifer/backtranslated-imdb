Director Spike Lee is famous for raising racist films. Even in many films, "Do Not Be the Right One," most white people are all cruel racists. <br /> <br /> In this film, the marriage of nations is related to the fact that racism is a matter of all. However, Lee not only demonstrates his suffering against Christianity. The double standards in the film world are wonderful. If Lee or some other group created such an approach to another group, he would have betrayed, but would Christians? Hey, this is the "open season". <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis shoots her dear son in this movie and then puts his sharp gun on the Bible. They increase this business to bring another one, if you miss it. Hey, nations, there is another Bible reader, and see what it is! <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> Who describes his rivalry as a bad thing? However, in this film, he continues this film as in other films. White does not help a painful situation for the population. It only gives fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hey, Spike: "Start the right job" and leave your aprons in a secret place. <br /> <br /> It is very bad because it could have been prepared for a thought-provoking film if it was done with objectivity and intelligence.
