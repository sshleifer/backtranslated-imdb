This movie frustrated me! I think Cat inside the hat. I think a cat in a hat books. You know, parents have read their children for a number of years. Nevertheless, this movie would be such a thing! But my surprise was not as much book! Insted is more like humor movie for young adults. In one section cat speaks horticulture (hoe) speaks to him as his hoe (aging adult humor). Despite the name of the car, it was a bit difficult for a child's movie. you will find below the rating: soft cude humor and some double entrants. In short, it means humor for adults. I wish I could return this movie! wal-mart said they would not be for the film's opening. If you plan to buy it, you can rent it before buying.
