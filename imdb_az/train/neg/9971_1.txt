Why I do not remember the cause of my life - I had to have a free ticket or something, but I saw it in the theater when it was released. I do not remember with whom I went, what the theater was, and even the city. I remember that it was a person who dared to shoot the film, and how did half of the theater go before the end of the film? Unfortunately, I have not finished it yet and I still think it is one of the worst mistakes of my life. My crime has left a strange devil's head behind a sign and "Look for the Problem Child 2, and see it soon!" He says. <br /> <br /> My husband, R. Ritter, and perhaps his wife (to exclude my view of the Lord movie), have the problem child. Maybe they think they can do it or something. I really do not know. If it had not been their intention, they would have missed it because it was the most brittiest, rudest, the smallest devil to shoot the big screen from the first frame of the child to the end. Forget Damian, do not forget Rosemary's Baby. This guy gets a cake. The only difference is that she needs "sorry" because she needs to "apologize". But it is not possible because this child is the most unusual character yet described. You want to kill him through the whole movie, and when (SPOILER, everyone cares about) John Ritter decides to keep his offspring in hell, "Send it back!" <br /> <br /> This is just the second I've given to "1" in the IMDb. The other Superman was IV and I did not know God by the worst of you. The problem, not included in the John Ritter TV Guide, was an assessment of the 3rd child. She said something like, "In another way, I can do something other than Childhood, which is a problem of another problem, to drag me to fulfill my dead body." <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus> 1/10 is just worth it, just because it can not give her a negative score. One of the biggest negative effects of this movie, please!
