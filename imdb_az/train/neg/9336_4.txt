Blaxploitation, a pseudo-crime drama in the black market market in the early 1970's. Pam Grier starred as Coffy's younger brother, a female nurse who was a woman femininity, after the coins dealing with narcotics. Improper self-pity, conservation energy and excitement; Only Grier's flaming nature is a blow to this story (he is not a very actress here, but it connects with the audience with the basic principle). Charles Bronson is no different from what he is doing at the moment, but he has managed to find a great city viewer who has sold the movie and advertised as cash exploitation. But today, in the history of the 1970s, there is simply a footnote, and other films in this genre do not have a large diameter. * From 1/2
