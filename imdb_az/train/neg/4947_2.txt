Dieter Bohlen, a famous German singer and producer, felt a bit embarrassed as "You are my heart, my soul" and felt the need to explain his story and decided to hire a charming ghost writer. The result was an interesting book about his life. Well, more or less fuzzy looks. He did not deny that he was an unfortunate evil, but the whole story was twisted to fit his image. Perhaps he beat his ex-wife, and he reached the hospital. <br /> <br /> Along with this, he is a member of the jury of the German version of "American Idol" - in a comic style and with great success, as his unforgettable interpretations. <br /> <br /> It's really. In the book "Deutschland Superstar" (abbreviated DSDS), a TV show called "Idol" must have a horrible idea to get out of the movie. The result is "Dieter - der Film". <br /> <br /> I rarely work in hopeless ways to be ridiculous and have seen a completely failed film. None of the gags really hits it. Verdonan's voice had to be more, but Naddel's voice and stylus stretched instantly to my nerves. Obviously, childhood, predictable, and long-lasting players will not make any motivation to watch this movie in just a few minutes. The content of the film is adapted to an insidious film written down by a ghost writer based on Bohlen's frustrated ideal memory. They could use this freedom to do almost anything. This should have been a satire, but they failed. The story is completely uninteresting, and the background sound of Bohlen guarantees that the whole movie is not satirical. <br /> <br /> Freedom of the cinema is considered to be bad. In some archives, the possibility of decaying this thing has so far been that the DSDS's current season is a moderate success. There is something in the program, with the help of the "yellow" newspaper of Germany's biggest yellow newspaper "BÄ°LD" and the hopeless situation for the "Rtl" television station, "Wetten dass ...?" the film is finally working on Channel 2, which comes with television - unfortunately, it takes time to watch this movie - there are better cartoons with more fun and a truly worthwhile story. /> <br /> For this reason: 2/10
