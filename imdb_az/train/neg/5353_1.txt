<br /> <br /> I gave a "privilege" to attend a special demonstration called "Lack of Light" at a horrific conference in Ohio. Firstly, when presenting a film director, "Now, take into account that we do not have much money ..." Off-budget films are not bad, but the results are always poor when using the film as a pretext. There is no better example of this unwatchable dream fest. <br /> <br /> Actually, the absence of light indicates the first in the world of underground cinema: This is just an imaginary structure of talented genre veterans I've ever seen. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister come in and out of the random movie and are not interested in amateur prestigious titles. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? Whose mouth? <br /> <br /> After thirty minutes of this endurance test, I refused and left the theater. Not surprisingly, most of the participants also took part. <br /> <br /> It would be good to stay away from this admirer of any interesting genre. With a little success, this movie will not see the "light" of the day.
