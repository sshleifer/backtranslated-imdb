I'm a great admirer of Ludlum and Covert, and I often thought how incredible it would be for a movie. Think of my excitement after learning that such a movie really exists! <br /> <br /> The "Hades Factor", the first in the series, appeared to be a prime place to start. <br /> <br /> Since the beginning, the film was hopeless. As Griffin's first interview with Smith, simple elements from the film are unnecessary and less enthusiastic in the book. A few characters are also weak. For Dorcel Smith, it's just as bad for beginners. <br /> <br /> Not a poor actor, but rather a bad choice because he is too soft and does not show many features that reflect John Smith's decisiveness. <br /> <br /> Renaming, re-assignment, and even some missing characters make this movie even worse. For example, Victor Tremont and all the back story of the virus make the movie a bit drunk, including the presence of VAXHAM. Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and many back seats (the character will not share anything with the character in the book) in his chair is another big mistake. Rachel Russell was probably supposed to be Randi Russel from the book. Not only should Sophie Amsden (called Sophia Russell) be his brother, but should also work from CIA, not Covert-one. Which brings me to the last point and I think the most important one. COVERT-ONE does not exist at this point! The second book of the series is not Covert-One, which prescribes the president as a preventive measure against further biological terrorism. <br /> <br /> I can keep going all day to be honest. In short, if you love books and want to get a good fit, I'm afraid you'll be grieving. Even though it's a motion picture, it's mostly lacking shimmering and poor effects. Bumbled storyline and boring-as-trench water script is the latest nails in the very cheap coffin of this movie.
