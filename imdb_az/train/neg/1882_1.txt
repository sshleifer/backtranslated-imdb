A strange trash piece! How good are all these people? Yes, "arty"; and yes, it's "external", but .... it's not enough. <br /> <br /> The prisoners look like each other. but as the characters do not have enough depth to feel empathy for them. <br /> <br /> If they are based on real people, then I feel very much myself. <br /> <br /> Violence (and some of which is very violent) appears to be very heartwarming and impartial. It looks like the manufacturer's vision of Quenton Tarantino. <br /> <br /> And oh yes: if there were such neighbors, I would move!
