Everything in this movie is bad, story, acting, the effects are funny, funny, funny! Scott Valentine, who is so great with Valentine's form, is so bad in a sad attempt on his face. The leader of the Special Ops band is his cheerful! 'Terrorists' are terrible and realistic as '' predators '', which is so foul and bad in everything you try to make laughs .In fact, the giant T-REX, wandering on a boat and somewhere, dropped below the metal pole you see a perfect ending .If you go into bad movies, bb - bad mona Lisa!
