This is pretty laughable, and I hope many people are exposed to Muslims living in the US, UK, and the world. Religion has more than a billion followers. I was born in America and tried to forgive our country and contribute to the community with my bread, religious lessons and training. I devoted a lot of time to the following teachings and teachings of your religion to help prepare the world for self-reliance and self-fulfillment. I know so many Muslims and travel to countries such as Pakistan. I've met a man who still believes in anybody who hurt anyone or who does not accept any religion other than the people of the media ... why ... It's a sad thing that extremists used to represent the whole religion in the press. One billion people are a religion, and less than one percent, but I am convinced that other people of other religions do not want to be represented by KKK, IRA and more, these simple and small minority extremists who are not used are real books, their revenge, personal and business issues to carry out their religion by means of what they say,
