Joe Dante's classic of 1981 was dirty, poorly scripted and amateurishly templi later. "The Howling" has been one of the best werewolf-films of two or three, and is still "rewarded" by some unusual and inexplicable sequels like this. If there is any comfort, "Stirba" is only a name and has nothing to do with the characters and events presented in the Dante movie. Is the land here a bloody catastrophe of Trans-Isilian resorts? mostly women? Managed by Stirba. Stirba turns into a blond old lady from a loose blush of blond super-babe (with impressive dog) and plays Sybil Danning all hairstyles when she is emotionally upset. His arch-enemy is played by Christopher Lee, a visually tired fatigue. His character? Stefan Crosscoe ?? It is a secret investigator for the Stirman's realm, the American couple has lost his wife to the cow. If you're just looking for paralysis and unbalanced nudity ... this is your movie. Even the smallest murder is shown in a great detail, and we're even cautious to blow up the ghosts of a dwarf that has been pierced on tears and a shiny fence. But if you want a little item or depth, you will be disappointed. Conversations are embarrassing and there is no tension to detect anywhere. The screenwriters continue to mix worms with persistent vampires (Transsily Advisory, garlic, wooden slices ...) and Danning's magnificent balcony, and is used as a shame, as the film is only gimmicky. In recent credits, the overlapping shot is routinely revised (my reviewer, Dr. Gore, is no less than seventeen!) It's pretty miserable and meaningless. The music is good, and some are beautiful. I speak of opening credits and scary sculptures during the dark dungeons of Stirba Castle. A gigantic confusion led by Philip Mora and? as far as I think? its only worthwhile film remains the "The Beast Within" three years ago.
