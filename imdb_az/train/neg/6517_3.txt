Although I went to the show of this movie and had a few minutes to make me laugh, there were many big flaws. First of all, he presents himself as a senseless use of a divorce in real life trying to find love in LA. The film is something that has not been passed through the director's life of love and professional life, and it is nothing more than an excuse. The jokes quickly become thinner and suddenly you do not think how this person's history evolves. The director of fun at the same time presents himself as a very boring and heavyweight character, and then we are worried.
