Documentary documents on immigrant Persians make the treacherous crossroads of massive mountains to take their herbs for grass. It is blown up by a twink-twink-twink Eastern Music account that can not be used in the real show, and silent, black and white features watch, sounds, and even more widows. The magnificent scenery is lost on a small black and white screen and there is absolutely a failure to build any kind of cunning. I liked North Nanooku and Penguins Martini, but despite the similarity of this film, it was humiliating the film. Only physical troubles are not just interesting.
