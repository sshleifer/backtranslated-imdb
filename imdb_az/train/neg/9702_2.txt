I do not think this movie is properly evaluated. <br /> <br /> I took my copy and maintained the PG rating and wrote R. No matter what the R limit is, I do not recommend it to anyone aged 17 or 18. <br /> <br /> Why? There are a few scenes in the woods with some top Indian women. I do not know you, but it's not something to watch small children. True, it can be a traditional "dress style" of African (?) Hinds, but ... I think partial nudity should give a R rating. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the movie lately, but I think it's a good thing.
