Teacher of the Institute of Competitive Enterprise, Mario Lewis, wrote a line-by-line denial of this attractive movie with a 120-point dot. The address of the Web site at www.cei.org, entitled "DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DOCUMENTS". A short 10-page version can be found at www.cei.org/pdf/5539.pdf. When you read these crumbs, you will see that the 1999 "global warming" claim is no longer real or dangerous than the fear of Y2K. Gore also made a synthesis of "TOMORROVER AFTER THE DAY" based on a book written by Whitley Strieber, a UFO monument confirming it. James "The Amazing" takes the psychics like Randi and makes Philip Klass UFOs and Gerald Posner JFK conspiracy-idiocy theories, so Mario Lewis is Al Gore film and all the "global warming" deception.
