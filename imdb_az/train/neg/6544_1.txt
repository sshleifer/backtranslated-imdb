I paid one dollar for this DVD, and first set myself up, but then I began to think and I should be grateful. I found a sacred paper and found a real touch on the evil movies. If you think fizzle successfully flipping through an unusual camera address monologue, wait until the opening credits go into the driver's cover. It appears to have been embedded in one of the ESL textbooks and press coupe. But ..... I do not believe how bad George Hamilton is. He says he can not seem to have anything to do with it, the only one I can understand is that I think I'm very sweet, and that's a epiphany! I know how bad it can be now.
