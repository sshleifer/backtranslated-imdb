Everyone who watches the Comedy Center around the middle of the last few years has probably been advertising for this movie. I've been advertising for this movie for the first time in 2001. It could have been ridiculous, but I did not see the movie on the television screen and call the number. <br /> <br /> After a year and a half, I was in the Tower Records and "less than $ 20 in DVDS". Copy of this movie. Having seen that the DVD was only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I came home, put the DVD into the DVD player and waited for the smile to start ... I waited a little longer. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Poor, poor, and poorly written and directed, PATIENTS, protected from illness, are a dirty piece and I think it's the worst movie of all time. There is no.
