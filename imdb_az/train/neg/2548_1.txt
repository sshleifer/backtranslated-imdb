The fact that this movie is rented in Norway is strange. This movie is just scary. The quality of this image is because a child is getting a better cell phone and the area is very bad. The main character is simply heartwarming and the only ones to sue. Everyone concerned with this film is ashamed. It's amazing that people who shoot this movie have their own names. And distributors; Did I even see it? This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Tagging this comedy is an insult to humanity. I encourage you to support this movie by buying or renting it.
