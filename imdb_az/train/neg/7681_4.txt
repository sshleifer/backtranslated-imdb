Sean, I know you're the greatest actor in the world, but I'm not in need of you. <br /> <br /> <strong> It's not just a comedy in the media <br /> <br /> <br /> Besides, you did not have all the sins. Some things were hard to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but we have to worry about the lines. <br /> Sean again ... I'm sorry.
