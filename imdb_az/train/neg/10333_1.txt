Where did Fox's exciting and pretty original series go? <br /> <br /> During the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly "should see" list, not just for Jessica Alba. Unfortunately, in Fox, the Revolution is the limit, and in the third part of the season, it has completely lost me as a viewer (even Jessica Alba!) The new symbols added in the second season are funny and funny <br /> <br /> In one of the episodes of the second season, Max had a dream and a dream - where he said he would not be able to fall asleep in the first season. <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> "Azjaz"
