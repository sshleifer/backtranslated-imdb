Opening credits for 30 seconds, I thought it would be a bad movie, but I did not know how bad it was. Then the actor, who played the evil Nazi scientist, opens his mouth and buddy and I decide that we need to reduce our volume, organize our dialogues, and double the speed on the DVD to survive. But this did not help. At present we have spent about half. Now I have lived with "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Svengoolie" assistant or assistant, and also very bad movies, but there are some doubts that they can protect the BOTS. The biggest part of the film, which most disturbed me, was that the zombies believed that the green skin was rotting. In my opinion, all of them were hypnotized after their death, and then they were rotting themselves. It looks like a real B-movie cult classic like "Nine Planet from Space".
