I'm a great admirer of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And, in addition, this film was Charles Butterworth (very unpleasant supporting actor) ... why did not I especially love it? Despite being a good cast, this is one of the poorest written and most klipped pictures I've ever seen. "Given the talent and money spent on filming, it's shocking how slipping is the story. I knew it would be tired in the early days - and I was always right! And this is not because I'm a kind of "movie scientist", but almost no imagination or effort, in fact, the whole film is a long, and Fred frustrated a very bad film in the film, and when he came to the congress he still fled to him. <br /> <br /> In many Lassie films ("To save Timmy, will he bring people or will it strip off his break? ") LAST movie has MORE MORE. <br /> <br /> Very tired and tired Despite the ched script, it's a little positive about the movie, and it was very nice to see Fred appear to be frustrated at the end of the movie - it was quite convincing, and he did not eat it, eat it, or did not sleep in the daylight. Also, the "prattle" by Charles Butterworth provided a few humorous moments. But this film was not enough to just look different from B movie. It was shame ... it would be better.
