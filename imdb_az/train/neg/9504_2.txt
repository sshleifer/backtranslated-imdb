The only reason behind this film is that Robert Hough's Big Cat coach Mabel Stark's less than his perfect, fascinating, fictional story. Beaty looks like a character in the book, less flattering light. <br /> <br /> I did not understand until the film was inspected at IMDb for a while since then. Who has done a good job when preparing a 68-minute version of 233-minute DVDs. The abbreviated version plays as any B movie of the era, despite many "duh-ne"? moments. For example, do not we really believe that our hero has trapped a tiger tire twenty times in the morning? Looking at the chapter titles, the five numbers are called "Gorilla Warfare" and the number one is called "The Gorilla". There was no gorilla in the film. The place where some interruptions are made. <br /> <br /> The history is interesting.
