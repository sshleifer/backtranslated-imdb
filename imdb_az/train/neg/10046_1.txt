I did not regret that Dante's offer at Homecoming was the first season, and that was not a terrible story, or rather a clever political statement with undead. Screw condition is a story of a virus that causes men's sexual exploitation in the world. The episode is just beginning with a short film telling that a screwdriver was killed by scientists. Then, when a woman's body is found in her house, there is a brief scene where one man was arrested. I think this is the beginning of the epidemic, but it is not clear that this is not repeated. This episode presents blah blah blah for some time characters. It looks cool and mysterious, but the episode stars get worse and worse as it moves to its sad and unpleasant end. The worst episode. Out of chocolate.
