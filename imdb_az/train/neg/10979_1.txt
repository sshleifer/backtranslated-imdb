Words can not describe how awesome this movie is. I wish it was "bad, that's bad," but not. It's just dull, lifeless and boring. <br /> <br /> Anne-Marie Frigon is not the aim of the film in response to other posters. Only one charismatic man, director Brett Kelly, took the lead in managing himself as a true statement of misery. <br /> <br /> The Caucasians are a brother of Şeru Türig. Anne-Marie is on the contrary - attractive. This girl is long and diligent and can move. <br /> <br /> All players, especially the supportive man, seem to return Mark. I saw less trees in the rain forest, but better than Kelly. Why did Kelly keep actors moving? Is he really a bad manager? Everyone else perfectly summarized this story - no one. Kids are abducted and pole steps to solve Kelly's killings. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it's not something for me. This is the best home movie to be seen by the directors' friends (and if you can explore them, these friends are the ones that give positive impression to the movie).
