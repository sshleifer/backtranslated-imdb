Totally fantastic. <br /> <br /> Now let me give you detailed information before I'm kicked in the names of the movie portals. As I love it, it's one of the worst films I've ever seen and the worst movie I've ever seen in cinema (when I see Daredevil on the big screen). Two goals (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were the worst and most terrible in the worst case. Of course, Daphne & Celeste did not help with a script with more emotional depth that was as convincing as OJ defense as its singular and characteristic. The plot was somewhat subtle because it was non-existent, and 'princess' scenes were undoubtedly brutal, irrational and laughably shaped. There are some 20 kidnapped, arrested, and subjected to various psychological and physical tortures around Cuthbert. Torture scenes feel like fragmented pieces and are more shocking than scaring the audience. Even though this film is really little, though, it's a little bit spectacular, but its indisputable features are so many flaws that make such a terrifying movie. I did not hear more vocal audiences in the movie. Within twenty minutes all cinemas were sewn, and all that remained. I was shouting laughter for myself, and I was involved in a film that I was climbing at the summit of a sad film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm in the movie I've been able to make it ... so we can laugh about it. I still did not want my money to be returned ... it was really bad.
