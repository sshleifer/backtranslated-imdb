This film is a deadly serious, though it is a visible comedy. His theme is Imperialism (with one capital): English, foolishness, chorus, tries to convince that there is still a great power after the Second World War. At home, the Empire is ruled by the beloved Tori, the beloved, who can not distinguish their close friends; The Government Office has long been forgotten archives (an excavation in the Orwellian Paranoia), living in indolent rats and reading ante-rooms, lounge awesome cinema, and famous novels. <br /> <br /> Abroad, England's old pomp; but the pomp that comes out of the context seems to be smart and foolish, especially when used in twig twigs. Carlton-Browne is an unprecedented form of recession, which has undermined the alleged anti-imperialist tricolor in oppression with none of the lacrimation decay. <br /> <br /> The film is worthy of mockery and hatred, not because of the Cold War, but courageously insulting and insulting participants. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> </ font> <br /> <br /> <span style = "text-align: br> Of course, it is serious to kill him. It can not be said that important subjects can not be cured by a comedy - Morgan's crew's miracle, Dr. Strangelove and Brian's Life proved all of them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < , so low and incomplete. In the above-mentioned three films, the majority of the comedy is not an extreme situation, rather than a characteristic reaction. <br /> <br /> One of the parties is too weak to pursue the rich comic characteristics of Terri-Tomas, Raymond Huntley and John Le Mesurier many times. Often, Thomas shows that he can not control the head device, and shows that he must play arrogant, arrogant boundaries, not foolish toffs. The music has a large part of the comedy, but its mockery merely shows the dissatisfaction on the screen. (Being fair, unlike the majority of English comedies of our time, disobedient and unfounded, Boultings often works to build and compose itself with the film itself) Huntley is just trying to create true laughter <br /> <br /> Boultings does not matter - they do not think enough. Carlton-Browne praises the empire's fall but looks anti-democratic and militarist. I am convinced that this is not intended, but these errors will occur when these characteristic moments intend to be superior to comic exploration and film form.
