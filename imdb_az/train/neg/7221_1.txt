.... WANT GREAT! Go to you and shoot the film maker and "WHY?" The type of movie it says. The terrible camera job ... The camera is trying to stay steady on a guy and can not count. Dialogue is ridiculous. Acting is funny. As you can see, they have captured a city of ghosts in the west to find out if they can afford the least amount of money. To do that, I'd bet $ 10 for home video cameras. Or most of the cameraman was drunk. Indeed, trailers are more fun than movies. If you want to have no "Worst Movie Party", bring it. Want a lot of fun ... look at a wall.
