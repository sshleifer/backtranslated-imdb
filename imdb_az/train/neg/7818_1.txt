I usually do not go out of a movie, but I did half. This movie gave a different promise, but did not think I had not seen it before? Spoiler alert! Back 1, the spaceship crash and lands on the earth, well, after all this year, with a super adult on the lesser boat, this thing still burns and manages to crash! What can not this evolved civilization be like to develop a descent device? For a more liberal industry, we will not see another Woody Allen movie, no gypsy! Superman, working around protecting people, reaching Europe and the United States, do not go to dark areas. Perhaps about 30 years ago, I could have had this condition but now.
