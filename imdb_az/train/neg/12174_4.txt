This is a stunningly pleasing original then a big step. It is not as entertaining as part of the continuation, and instead takes much time to coastal development. Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series, but his foolishness tones at this entry. All performances are enough, but this time we put scenario. The motion is simply regular and the territory is just mildly interested, so I need a very stupid laugh so that I can enjoy a Trancers movie. Unfortunately, the laughs are small and remote, so this movie is the best in the world.
