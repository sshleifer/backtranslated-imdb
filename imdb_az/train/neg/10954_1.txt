If you have a 0 star rating, I would gladly take her to this absolutely terrible waste pile. If the original summary was perfect and different, it would be brilliant, it only worsens her. The main task is to lock a group of people on a trial camera, but what is their experience? Unintelligent surfers and blondes who talk to music and culture who do not know or know everything I've seen ... are tolerant and stupid. The whole point of reality TV is to show REALITY. If you have a 'challenge', do not force them to play with over-cooked foods and stereotypical elements of culture on Thursday. Make them a real challenge. And like 'win' prize money, it's fine, if they really win! These people are hazelnuts. If only the show would be better, the true idea would be glorious. But this will not happen!
