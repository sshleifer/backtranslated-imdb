<br /> <br /> A lot of things about "Purple Rain" have been written, a clear "short-sighted" musician's bio movie, but I'm here that the movie is not worth the high praise. <br /> <br /> First of all, something is a plain prince of a great musician, and Music is an area with the Purple Rain excels. <br /> <br /> The first is the game / action you're up to, but it's just like cornish and incensere, like writing, the character of the character "The Kid", a few words of mysterious companion. A good single character must have at least a few moments of conversation, unfortunately, the character of the Prince rarely has a few words in the movie, and it is difficult to believe that the girl will be this way. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Everything here is a bit unfortunately, this is shame because we can say that It is a pretty coincident and very complex creature, but it is not permitted to enter it. > A striking feature of this film is how much it cost the concert. The life of Prince and Morris makes sense here from a negative business perspective, but the half of the scene appears on the stage, especially when it comes to stories of the character appear tedious to take a 2-hour film. <br /> <br /> So, to sum it up: This is not a very good movie.
