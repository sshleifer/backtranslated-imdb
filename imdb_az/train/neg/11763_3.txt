Yes. I will admit it. I thought about all the fun that involved, about the difficulties and challenges of sex with six people in Mexico. And so, finally, I was looking forward to seeing an exciting Mexican film (s) of both popularity and interest. Unfortunately, the film was absolutely hearty. The story presents us with two pairs of great marriage problems. When the third party enters the life of every human being, their problems reach a point. Or absolutely absurd. The field is then turned into a sex battle. The position taken by each group (yes, they are a group of words, girls and boys) are clearly foolish and childish (perhaps it is likely to be humorous). And all of them go bad. The performances are good (Miss Zavaleta) mediocre (Mr Bichir), with Serrano doing the opera prima. However, it is proven that there are flat conditions, one-dimensional characters, mature relationships of sex, and so on. The very poor (if not stupid) perception of the film causes the movie to fail. Incorrectly. SPyL received one (effectively) at the cash register. Accuse yourself at your own risk.
