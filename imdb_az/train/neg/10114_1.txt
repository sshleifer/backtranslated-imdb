This is one of the worst films ever. I love movies I love, but it just frightens me. Where's the pictures in the box in the box? I think that more money is spent on DVD box illustrations than all the movies. <br /> <br /> Why does the company cover a very deceptive DVD? I feel like a fool to seriously hire this movie on the box. I should do some research on IMDb and prepare a list before visiting a local video rental shop. No one is guilty except myself. I want my money and my time back. <br /> <br /> DO NOT WANT TO THIS THEM. <br /> <br /> Put your cocktail umbrellas on your eyes, even if your employment encourages you. It will be more enjoyable. You have been warned!
