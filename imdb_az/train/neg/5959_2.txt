A spoiler. <br /> <br /> Which three words can make you a terrifying movie? Cheap Canadian production. THESE perfectly matches these words. Terrible comedy, ironic actress and hilarious special effects should be a must for every admirer of this BAD movie. Horror is not welcome. The post production group seems to be abandoned. The BRAIN is trying to be really good in the second half, which creates the admiration! <br /> <br /> Magnificence and consistency can save a little bit of enjoyment? <br /> <br /> This is around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are killed by one of the funniest-looking villains. One day, a rebel girl gets into trouble, she is sent for psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> If a police head is cut and blood is a stranger neighbor, some guys did it, and who did you believe? BRAIN is entertaining and exhausting when you try to be serious. Children will not be scared by fear moments. BRAIN is a very funny attempt and a flawless concept. Psychological Research Institute is bigger than large production facilities! Our ugly villain and his cohorts take credit for the worst of what I've seen. The viewer's admiration was highly recommended.
