I've seen some bad things in my time. The half-dead cow tries to get out of the clay high clay; head of clash between two cars; one thousand plates tumbled down on a kitchen floor; <br /> <br /> never in my life seen anything as bad as the devil cat. <br /> This film is worse than Hitler, worse than the 911. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie of all time. <br /> <br /> I thought, a joke, a joke, and Mike Myers some spectacular or anything, maybe the odds and the odds of drug-addled junkie who had cocaine koklayan was high. <br /> <br /> I'm shaking
