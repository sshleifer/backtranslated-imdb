I just rented this movie (yes, I've done money to see it!). OH, MY GOD. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. As another reviewer, Mrs. Colagrande, quit movies, PLEASE! Never see or appear in another movie! The lady is in a bag. No, this is not fair for cantaloupe, it's probably going to do so. He does not know how to move; He has an unpleasant appearance from all the days (reminds me of my younger brothers in Europe who have always hated me). It's not tempting; he is not beautiful. There is no true story. And edit! There was nothing I could see! When you're watching a movie, it's pretty bad, and just click the "forward" button to move it, and nothing happens! I do not mean that ..... I screamed with indecision, "Cut it!" What do they think? Surely, they think they can film a joint together and show love to PAID! A very good deal for THEM; considerable agreement with the audience! Now I think I'm going to throw it now ....
