I've been a "horrible" horror film, but it's just a dog foam! Anyone can say this movie is cool or worthy, beyond me. If you want to edit the escapes to cover special effects, go for it with bad behavior and a bad script! There was no tension and therefore a fake factor was so fake. Every day I will take this stack on the Hostel or Wolf Creek. My partner refused in about 20 minutes, and one stinker knows when he saw one. On the other hand, I've been stupid to sit and wait for the whole movie, and see that it's better. There is no such chance! I'm not your other movie Torched and now I'm sorry I'll be upset.
