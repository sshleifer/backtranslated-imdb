First, there are no flirts in this movie - Anthony or anyone else. These people do not flirt - just do it. The first test of tolerance is to combat intense violence and sexual activity for more than 15 minutes. It would not be bad - I look at hell, violence and violence, but it's pushing it without context. So, be tortured and confused. Then we are facing Donna and the film turns into something different - not the best - just different: a heartless picture. Thanks to Cameos there is a comedy problem - widely written and widely distributed Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (and a few prostitutes and dragging queens). Everything is good. Photography causes intentional dissatisfaction and, therefore, a motion sickness (or indeed any illness) - it's not for you. When it comes to thinking about it, I do not believe who it is for this bumping, and maybe fans of gay and bi-sexual S & M love poor scripted, and take an unusual movie about themselves.
