What was all Turkish actors? There was no crime, but there was nothing for all these actors. There was no script to test any actor with skill and skill in the film. It's nothing I have taken this movie to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors, but this film was another failure. The scenario was very bad. There was nothing to immerse their teeth, and all the symbols were of two dimensions. Madsen tried to act as a heavy donkey, but the script did not allow him to suffer from his character to make it more interesting or 3-dimensional. <br /> <br /> The sound effects of the attacks sounded like the dance ball guns when shooting at the start of a movie. It was very strange and they did not sound like a real weapon. There were better sound effects than this video game. At the beginning of the movie, a member of the robbery group, there was really a heartwarming block. She sang like a voice from America saying: "Get $ F $ here and what do we do?" It sounded like a girl. Let me laugh in a few seconds ... Hoo! Silent movie, poor Madsen.
