<br /> <br /> In my opinion, there are better things than writing in my own time, but I'm very pleased with this movie once I registered with IMDb, just put it out of my chest. <br /> <br /> It would be a bet that Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be played on a movie ... well, this movie was just terrible. "It is impossible to stop the blasphemy"; I used to actually work, but Justin Timberlake did not let me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake should move freely to music, to a dreadful performance. We can not blame everything on Justin: The film also has a terrible space and bad timing arrangement; <br /> <br /> What do I really encourage actors after seeing her? I do not mean that Morgan really read the scenario before taking his part. Did not he see how bad he was? Why would he have been encouraged to take it partially? Money? Certainly, the actor is more than just talking about who you are, not just about developing a quality business. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great player; this movie goes far beyond Freeman or Spacey and really struggles to agree with the poor script. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the audience goes: "What is hell?" <br /> <br /> In short, apart from Justin, the execution is very disappointing.
