(spoiler) Wow, that's a bad thing. One day, while watching the episode of the former Star Trek, I took a double step - it was a place where everyone was infected with earth sickness, then a little nuts, and Stewart was Moss, and the brother was a challenging 'protagonist' of the night! He played the first group who died of terminal depression. Everything I thought was a matter of depression, as he watched his movie many times. This movie is packed with people who are not really challenging. The film does not have any delusions, it is not. It's hard to feel bad about Dr. Beck's return to a bat (or actually turned), because you just do not like it. And his compassion, his crooked spouse, or the darkest darkness Sgt. Ward, or Dr. Mustache Love ... So why spend any time or energy on this movie? If there is no empathy with characters, there is no reason not to care about it. He wanted to film with urine, and most of them did not remember the terrifying cinematography that looked like special 5-cm special effects that seemed to be a piece of paper thrown by a fan to simulate the flying bats. MST3K is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but in the bottom row, definitely.
