Why did I go to see this movie? Honestly, Jim Carrey was there and made interesting films that made me laugh in the past, so you blamed me for waiting again? <br /> <br /> Along with this, my "one line summary" suggested me to be involved in my place, comic trailer, his co-star Jennifer Aniston, and encourage me to take this massive hit stateside. <br /> <br /> Disappointment. <br /> <br /> For various reasons <br /> <br /> Cause 1: It was not funny. In a 2-hour film, I laughed for about 5-10 minutes ... all together, I thought, "I really should get an ice cream". I admit that it is wrong to play Jim Carrey on his previous films, but it's wrong to say, "The Truman Show, Liar Liar, Me, Myself and Irene, Dumb and Dumber, 'The Mask' and 'Ace Ventura' movies, then Bruce Nolan's words produce such a mediocre movie? <br /> <br /> 2 Reasons: Jennifer Aniston's role was a criminal offense. Hi, I want to say! For nearly a decade now, she has been around the public eye and says that she gets four lines. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4: . "A teenager says no medicine, and yes to a study - a miracle! Do you want to see a miracle soon? Be a miracle!" God may have faced tougher resistance in the markets to keep Bruce, a heavily flipped idea, but an inclination for the subtle looks seems to have gone down a cure in the United States. Besides, I'm still not going to school, and this statement shows me and my wife's miracles ... or maybe just brains? <br /> <br /> In this film, Carrey's mom Bruce Jacob is a common disaster, but you have to consider your expectations, though you are giggling and avoiding it.
