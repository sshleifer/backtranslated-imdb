I did not think of it, but something came up and replaced Key House - a budget horror that killed the high price of an immortal property - shortest, but still sweet, was presented as the best film in Montreal's latest film festival. , this believes that every other entry must be made up of empty walls of people who read poetic poems. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was part of Hell. It strives to stage a series of dark pink on the various heroes living in a suburban area from Austria and short and blue Velvet tracks. She has a fat dog and has a fatty maid who has a striptease for her, the wife is still a frightening female shooter who reads the top ten black leather divorces that live with her in a non-smoking room. The list goes on. Forever. <br /> <br /> Yes, the characters are mutually exclusive, but not smart or interesting or even relevant. The Austrian equivalent to the subtitles is "You are too naked!" A gift was given. <br /> <br /> This is not one of Gummo or one of the above-mentioned movies. There is no art to discover, and there is nothing in the future, perhaps changing the policy of "never going to film" (or some of the elderly couples have worked on an occasional orgy scene) and if this is appetizing. film, your parents' sexual intercourse, and if you are not one of the few people who do not have a few local middle-aged couples). <br /> <br /> This movie attacked me. It's not bare nakedness, it's a fierce soundtrack, not shockless scenes surrounding weapons. It seems to me that anyone who has been able to earn money is a writer and filmmaker, and has spent money to earn money. It hurt me that someone outside the city was going to see Dog Days and wondered if Montrealers was the best we could find. Above all, when the people in the festival were stunned that the emperor was naked in a naked striptease, they beat everyone, believing that the emperor was a spectacular and surprising new outfit. <br /> <br />
