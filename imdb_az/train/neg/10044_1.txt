This is the biggest Flop of 2008. I know how big the director is thinking of creating a catastrophe. The songs were added unknowingly, the story lengthened to fill the 3-hour gap, and one of the most incendiary actors fighting with 100 people in the action scenes where everyone has a super-powered shot of bullets and that nothing is happening. Anil Kapoor's best performance is the best man, Hinglish, playing a funny act ... Akki is also a good job .... But the movieee just forgets it.
