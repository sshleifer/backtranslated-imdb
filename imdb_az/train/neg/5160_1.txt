You get a gift. Gently wrapped around. The box in his hand is made from the best wooden hand and demonstrates skill up to the smallest details. Later, the most talented artists of the artists are wrapped in beautiful paper, hand and hand-painted. All this is in a ribbon made of fine silk broccoli. <br /> <br /> Therefore, cut the ribbon and pull away from the paper, open the box and do not find anything. This is TOYS. <br /> <br /> The film's purpose and purpose is not: War is not a good thing. Well, it's original! Morality is so obvious that it is embarrassing to even mention it. And even with these elegant ideas a warlike elements, especially war toys - something pretty bad, they need to climb an exciting, and the movie has dropped a story that simulates a battle using innocent toys. <br /> <br /> Although it is a blank box, the film is conducting a close investigation. Yes, it's an overview of some of the remarkable, striking images. Sets are creative and captivate colorful scenes of cinematography. But the pictures are cold and emotionally sterile. As in the scenario, the film's appearance is unlucky and sometimes aesthetically barren and surreal. Toys are a movie that wants to praise as beautiful and special things, but shows them to create a free and cold world. The film works in a very complicated manner, but it is humorous and artificial. Robin Williams, like a toy maker in the manufacturing empire, is sitting in an ad-lib stamp that looks like a strange, cold structured world where he lives alone. Indeed, on the surface of the actual references and delicious sex innuendo, the film tries to be unusual. In order for this film to function or to be meaningful, it must be established in its own universe, and a Blood away from Kansas. <br /> <br /> The director of this film was Barry Levinson's pet project. It was not because he was trying to get involved. ten years. He regretted why he had to support others. Finally, most pet projects like RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD: EARTH are great examples, appear to be a blind spot in the film field. Probably, Levinson has often directed his head to TOYS, when he finally does not see any fresh vision for it. <br /> <br /> Many of the toys released in the movie raised an unusual, mechanical, wind. This is the film itself.
