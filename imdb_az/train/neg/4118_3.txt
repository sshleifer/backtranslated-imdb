While watching on the canal, we found this movie in a hopeful summary. We are in a typical story story, functioning properly. We discovered the car images that we explode, incredible shooting, and we started to crash with the weight of the cartridge and carton. More fun, like Dante Peak, all the recurring scenes from the front of the church to the front of the church, the store fronts flooded the brick streets down the main street, the overpass and the red truck down the road. Despite being undesirable, he did not laugh well and wondered whether the viewer was primarily intended as a low-budget parody of disaster films.
