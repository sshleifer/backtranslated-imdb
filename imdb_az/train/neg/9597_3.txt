As I love Japanese movies, it just did not cut it ... A film about the rebels and the royal blood line was a very slow pace with a suspicious plot. br> <br /> Photography is good, though in other Japanese movies I've seen better fighting scenes and have not completely convinced me of watching fast cameras and symbols. The soundtrack is so weak that you do not even notice its existence. But the worst was the development of the field. At one time, I have to understand who and what he understands. In general, platonic love between the main character and something else was absolutely unnecessary and appeared to be influenced by Hollywood. <br /> <br /> All this,. Very slow, very few sword-fighting scenes and very sensitive ... in a bad way ...
