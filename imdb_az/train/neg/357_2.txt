Indeed, Sean Connery is a fundamentalist south serial killer of Harvard law professor Kate Capshaw (still coming to work) in a statement totally top, like racist southern police (!) And Ed Harris, like his wife (light difference difference) and Lawrence Fishburne. <br /> <br /> Strange casting, but the movie plays a serious idea with the audience. (If you're serious about watching this movie or not intending to watch this movie seriously because of spoilers) First of all, I felt that my Liberal stereotypes were widespread for many times: the cops were all Sadis, and this is a black man without any evidence. <br /> <br /> Konyeri, the Gypsies, the witnesses and even the lawyers of the accused are also cooperating with him (he is accused of committing a black girl and being killed). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Konnereri is stonewalled by street officials and good kids club (yawn ...) but finds that the grandmother's grandmother approaches to defend her and reopen her. The alleged killer against Blair was all fabricated according to the order of death. <br /> <br /> Beating was controlled by a black-colored police (! Connery sees that another prisoner, who is in the ranks of death, actually kills her, and, after a few days, finds where Harris, who was murdered by Hannibal Lecter, hid the gunfire hiding Harris. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Blair has been released. <br /> <br /> I think the film is over. <br /> <br /> Suddenly! Apparently, Blair is a psychotic psychotech, and he uses "white offense" to attract Connery. <br /> <br /> According to the US Department of State, Blair has prepared a story along with Ed Harris, who has committed several murders for Harris. <br /> <br /> Connery's crazy PC principles helped Blair resign! Last 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This was a strange movie, a legal drama, Connery and Fishburne stilts, an alligator skin, a strange action movie that fights the serial knife at home. <br /> <br /> Thus, the entire system is corrupt and ineffective; all of the police are unfair and are punished by Abu Gharib, but the criminals are really psychologist and deserve to be frustrated. <br /> <br /> Those who suffer at every level! <br /> <br /> This system is completely rotten, and PC networking defects are seriously deceived. <br /> <br /> Two head finger down. Connery clearly had to make a mortgage payment or something.
