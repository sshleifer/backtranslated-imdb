To be honest, I knew what to expect before watching this movie, and I would say it was the worst I have ever seen. He has moments and is very entertaining at the comedy level, but I am not afraid, I am not afraid, and foolishness is brought to a new level. There is a lot of unnecessary things and the sprinkle is over the ground. I had no idea why the aliens were bad, and why did they come to this distant part? (Who am I going to do?) But at this point I was not interested in it because the clothes were of concern to me, and the bad CGI. B movies, it is good for filmmakers to be "very bad", and deserves the title of the kudos because they probably knew what they were doing. Long-lasting movies .....
