It's nice for me what's going on for fun today. Maybe I'm a dinosaur from the elderly, and I'm not going to touch the generation of today's film, and that's why it's because she loves this movie for a long time. I found her bad and vulgar. I do not talk about many films in my life, but it corresponds to the bill. Humor is sophomoric and raw. I am not a politically correct person, and even I've found funny jokes, not just funny, but obviously attack (gay). The main character in the film is even an unpleasant person, it's simply sad. At the end of the movie, I've heard disappointment that many people have not paid for the good money they have seen.
