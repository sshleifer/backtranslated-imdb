This is not a horrible comedy around the surrounding area, but it is very ridiculous. However, there is no laugh, and this wastes many production values. Fu Manchu has the following point when he proposes a double dose of his "nemesis" and says, "You are my dearest enemy, and now we can start again". But this scene is the only memorable part of the film, along with a fun crowd at the head of Burt Kwouk. (* 1/2)
