Like a girl, Hinako drove away from his small village to Tokyo, leaving behind his two best friends, Fumia and Sayori. She was surprised to find out that Sayori was dead as a teenager. He is united with Fumia and is terrified to learn that Sayori is mysteriously resurrected through Shikoku island. Oh, boy. I leased it because I loved the horrors of Asia and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is a bad actress. Unfortunately, if I describe Shikokun in a word, it would be "fruity". This film is nervous, boring, weak, imaginative and, most importantly, indestructible. Kuriyama has a minimal screen like the Enhanced Sayori, and it's hard to work with its character.
