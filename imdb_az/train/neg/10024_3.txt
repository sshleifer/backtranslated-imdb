Some movie makers (especially Hollywood inspiration) need to know that the first lesson - not just 'style'. When translated, it means style. <br /> <br /> <strong> Trouble is not something. For example, Saif, Kareena, and Akshay narrate the different points of the story, but this is not a proper use of the story, a better mix of their narrations and their compatibility. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think that Vaibhavi Merchant just went through this movie, but Vishal-Shah has a good result, but it does not belong to this film, why does Tashan have a sufi song (Dil Haara) <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the grace of the film, but it has its stereotype, and you will not miss this movie.
