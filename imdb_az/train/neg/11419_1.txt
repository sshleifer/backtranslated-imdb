<br /> <br /> I think this movie was something like this: college graduates complained about their lives. <br /> <br /> This movie, Great Chile <br /> <br /> It was a music when something good came out of this betrayal fest. <br /> <br /> I'm not sorry about my worries ... but I still did not expect anything less. This movie was directed by Batman and Robine, the same man who was directed; <br /> <br /> Now decides: 1 out of 10.
