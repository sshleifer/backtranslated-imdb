A film about animal harassment. A marathon race, known as the name of the race, ends the exploitation of animals, including the horse, moving in sliding. The man who did that later cleansed his conscience, fired from the horse graveyard, and, of course, tortured to death. It's one of the dreamers, the naked movies I've seen before seeing the landscape. As Gene Hackman and James Coburn are near the finish line over their DYING PETS, we need to admire their spirit to finish the race. I would like to put producers and directors in the marathon race; When they are finished, I will decide, probably about 20 minutes after the breathing.
