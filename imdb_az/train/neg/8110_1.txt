Phillip Kaufman, I think Kundera's novel is reading the Notes version of the cliff, and then decided to build this movie. Okay, of course, there is no real punch. Clara's novels are great for the manipulation of the narrative concept, the ability to navigate stories and steps he has built. This movie does not even try! A ghost sequence of Tereza is very important for the book's atmosphere, reworked, and in no sense makes no sense. In addition, this is perhaps a small point, as Daniel Day-Lewis looks like Ben Stiller (I'm not really a valid complaint, but hey). A perfect example of the beautiful Hollywood literary literature.
