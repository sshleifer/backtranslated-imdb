This site looks hype, and other reviews, I was a fantastic afraid movie to focus on junkies. What happened to me? Is there a movie called "Cookers" that these people are considering? There are only 3 main characters and none of them has written me and moved well. In general, it's all my movie, which shook my head and was surprised by the addiction of this drug addiction. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a blessing. Do not rent this movie. Rent "Cabin Fever" or other terrific movie. Hell, rent "Mary Poppins"! Animated penguins are more than cowardly and more convincing than the "cookers".
