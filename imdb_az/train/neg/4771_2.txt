Do not waste your time in this movie. It could have been good, but it was one of the things I came to the end. I am seriously interested in how the people involved in this film look at the last scene and think that "there is an end". and hit the back sides of it. It seemed to me that they had escaped more ideas! They sewed the final scenes for a cool twist, but instead you corrected the whole structure and corrected your face. When the last shot struck in black and I heard the start of credit music, I was shocked - and did not believe I could see it and someone could say that would end. The best thing anyone can do with this movie is to re-write the end and give some stuff. Seriously, I really like who's in a room, looking at his face and saying - WTF ?? !!!!
