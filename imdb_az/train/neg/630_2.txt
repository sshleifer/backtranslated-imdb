This film can be used in film classrooms in the course "How to Know B Movie". The B-movie has some disadvantages: Budgets are tight, Time is very valuable (Fear is laid on 8 days) and actors are often green and inexperienced. One aspect that you are fully controlling can write the best script within the limits set before you. The terrible scenario appears to have been written in a drunken blurry. I could pass about eighteen examples of this movie, but suddenly I will celebrate: The Gravedigger. The nature of the grave takes about an hour to the film. As you can see, none of the other characters in the film have anything to do with it. The film is shown with her daughter, who has nothing to do with anyone else. Gravedigger is given several scenes to move neatly and then killed to reduce body weight. Why Gravedigger Give a Girl? Why give her a lover? Why do you offer this movie so late?

He is an artist who draws birds and does not crush with a classmate called Judy. His mother is a lush and urban prostitute. A man who is opposed to him is entertained by one of his beloved (by calling the birds "fagots" instead of "monsters and cowboys"). If a middle school student still cowboys, I think he is more gay than a middle school student) and later kills Lester in a corn under the titular fear. The magic of Lester's soul is frightening. In any way, this change translates the soul of Leester from an artist, an intelligent gymnast (I know that some sculptures are called a Kung-fu scary.)
