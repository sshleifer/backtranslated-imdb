This documentary (or I'm in need of) is the best example of how ridiculous the people are when it comes to something like this. Honestly, I hate Cryptozoology. Knowing it is to destroy it. However, positive things were visual effects (dragons were beautiful), but some of these mockumentary information was totally fake, and this is really disappointing, because scientists have come to the conclusion that the double data can be the idea of ​​hydrogen: hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but can not be produced in that proportion, so a dragon stomach really needs a good explanation. Many substances shake the nature of the hydrogen, but it does not need to sound like an animal to fly, and hydrogen does not seem to be anything, so it is impossible. In any case, there is something worse than the platinum idea: this element is much harder than gold, so I can not tell myself how dragons live. It's ridiculous, they offer dragons like creatures that have little chance of conquering the planet, but at least they explain why they are extinguished. Perhaps cryptologists call themselves science, but they are not. People like them lie as if they were dear, the worst thing is that some people take them. But I think someone who was interested in science would believe in dragons after watching it. Fake scholars spend their time.
