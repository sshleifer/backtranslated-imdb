There are several stories in the film that follow several different characters. <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> Watch the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery Channel with Steve and Terry Irwin you are better than doing. This movie is more entertaining and enjoyable. But I am also sure that the crew and crew of this squad have made this movie very entertaining, but the film delights the audience. For a comedy, this is not just funny, and Steve and Terry Irwin are not just the best players, even when they play! <br /> <br /> It's not good enough to shoot a movie around the movie, and their scenes take a long time, feel unnecessary and sometimes even annoying. <br /> The film had many potentials, namely, Steve Irvin is a character. Strangely watching something exciting and exciting, so when I first heard that he was filming a "crocodile hunter", it was my first reaction; bright The film, however, draws heavily with a weak story and incredible story lines with unobtrusive and unfunny characters. This film has at least a bit of fun to watch this movie at least once, but it should not necessarily recommend this movie yet. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, time. Still, this movie can only be watched at noon, on the TV at noon. <br /> <br /> <strong>
