I have to admit that I have seen a few dreamers in my time, but it is with the worst of them. I'm having difficulty watching. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the castle will look back to the final product and will not want to collect dust on a shelf. Be concerned for a generation or two. Unfortunately, in my case there is a DVD. He sits on the shelf and looks at me from time to time.
