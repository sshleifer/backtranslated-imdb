This movie would be absolutely zero because I created a film thermometer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> High school pupils one day in a camera together with a camera drew. <br /> <br /> It's enough for any artistic value that does not want me to be afraid to watch the kids at school at a higher rate than watching the movie. <br /> <br /> HAPPENS, I have to say something for abysmal depths. The "shooting" in Marmaris is always one of the most fun comedy scenes. First, warriors wave plastic arms to each other, compressing their weapons to simulate the escape. The pair are really "duck" one of the other non-existent bullets. No squibs, no sparks, no spaces, just shake around spraypainted squirtguns. If you want to see the role of an actor of two grown men, give a spin in the daytime ... After cleaning the refrigerator, after finishing the carpet, all the elbows are polished, gravel laid, books have been made, and so on. .
