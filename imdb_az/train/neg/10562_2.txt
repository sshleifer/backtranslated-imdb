This very low-budget comedy movie is only available for the budget. The dumbfoundingly foolish, chaotic scenes are straightforward, and the majority of the screen appears to have survived a series of hurricanes and explosions during the last five minutes of the film (shortly glimpsed port-a-potty crashed and twisted at the beginning of this scene's head assassination - no purpose). The whole movie reminds reminiscent of Rodger Corman's studio when the director wanted to give a few dollars and a camera for the first time, but Corman would apply without discipline.
