Disney, once again, is preparing a baby film that completely ignores the background. The only thing about this is the names of the original Gadget cartoons. The most striking mistakes are a symbol - Penny does not have his book, Brain has downloaded a fancy window from a single character, Dr Claw is a worse ancestor and more, but more. The horror begins with the first moments of the movie - like a security guard named John Brown does not help identify it as a Gadget classic Inspector Gadget. Indeed, at the beginning of Disney's attempt to turn each story into a love affair between a man and a woman, we know Brenda, but she's just adapting it to Disney. You see that "Claw" and the classic Dr. Claw, which is seen in this film, are almost diagonally opposed, and that this will not go anywhere near the original story. What can help, replacing it will be a good story character - but Disney has failed to predict it. The whole movie is simply a gadget that is steadfast for the sake of lusting and after Brenda. Disney introduced the new "Gadgetmobile", does not work or thinks it's an old Gadgetmobil, just the canonical "comic relief" for inciting insults. Disney Gadget clearly knew that cartoons were a comedy, so the film made a comedy, but all the intelligent smuggled rides (like the head on the head) were replaced by legendary Gadget. Gadgetmobile showing a wise donkey and "Claw" off. One of Disney's "children's films" does not mean that there is no general use of any brain. The gadget should be meant for children aged 10-12 ... 10-12 months old children are not like this movie. Regardless of what this movie is, it is NOT, Repeat, the Real Inspector Gadget. Because I love the old Gadget, I hate it.
