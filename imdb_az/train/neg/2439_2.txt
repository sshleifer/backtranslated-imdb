Dorna von Rouveroy is one of the worst horror films ever created by "intensive care". This extremely cheap Dutch slasher flick offers some miserable and very absurd situations. The horror veteran George Kennedy, as Professor Bruckner, is completely wasted. Unchanged, the motion is slow and the summit is ridiculous. The famous surgeon has a car accident. He's been in coma for seven years, then he wakes up and gets into a bloody hurricane. "Intensive Care" includes "Halloween" and "Friday 13" series. Murders are fun and dialogue is painful. If you're still in the right mood, you can give this garbage piece a look. one may believe in me!
