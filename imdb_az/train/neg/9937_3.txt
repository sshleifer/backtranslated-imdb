First, this is a series of non-focused films that are exposed in the left wing political revolution. Honestly, when someone tells me that the only way to really be revolutionary is to stop thinking about intellectually (because he is totally clever enough to accept his answer) he makes me feel hopeless; Just as if we were to become ape in the name of equality - it's just ridiculous. Our intellect is one of the many features of many people, but this does not mean that we do not teach ourselves as highly as possible. Undoubtedly, this non-education message is related to the use of Godard's rock music; so Rolling Stones. <br /> <br /> The song "Sincerity for the Devil", which we are witnessing the creation and the name of the film, is really nothing. Especially the original chord sequence was used because Led Zeppelin's "Thanks" (Led Zeppelin II) had a better impact. "Sir," Mick Jagger, says in the ordinary way, as Bob Dylan - repeat what the first melodic word repeats in the recurring way to create the verse. <br /> <br /> The Black Panthers reflected in this film know why they are fighting, and fascism in the most interesting areas includes the equality of pornography; <br /> <br /> Sexual freedom of the 1960s and today (a message that violates the behavior of Rolling Stones at the time of the film's preparation) came free with The Sunday Times! Listen to Luigi Non's masterpieces for a really deep history of left wing sincerity, 'Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore'.
