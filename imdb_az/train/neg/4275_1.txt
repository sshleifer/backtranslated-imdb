Why did many people praise this show? The twin peaks are one of the most boring names I've ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Now I have seen the episode of the season and see the 2nd episode of the season. Simply, I can not get this show anymore. <br /> 1) Where is the necessary indoor unit in the investigation? <br /> <br /> In the first season, Agent Cooper threw a stone in a glass. Why did he do it? While celebrating the supernatural ability of the Tibetan dream, he only wants to determine the murder by doing this "joke." <br /> <br /> 2) This show has many unnecessary scenes. <br /> <br /> For example, the 2nd season began with a "dumb" scene, Cooper put Cooper as he agreed with a cup of milk. (She had already found a weapon in her belly). This old man says nothing but says simple words. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and even long (3 min 30 seconds like Hell.) <br /> <br /> It's more than just reading some comic books that show.
