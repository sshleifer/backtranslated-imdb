Or "Marlowe At Sea". Another funny overrated old film with Bogey. There is much to talk about. Bogey is basically the same as in Marlow movies; Never be frustrated under the control of a situation - even though the situation is dangerous, women say "subtle" and "dames" and "other nonsense", but in the film are only "real men", ie alpha men (except for the other alpha male men Gestapo - she is just an oil fat men) and, of course, every attractive young woman can not resist her charm and does not want her penis for the first time. The character stereo is all here. Bogey, as in Casablanca, should be considered for the same typical reform and, of course, refuses money or other valuables when offered, but how does it fit with a harsh cynic? That is, he can not be kin. The princes wanted in both ways: a "cool lone cynical" and a character that is still a good humanist. Bacall makes this rhythm for the first time incredibly "beautiful babe" and has numerous numerous "sex innuendo" exchanges between him and Bogey; these dialogues are sounded in line with today's standards. "Only lips and breaths ...". A burdened cargo ... She was 19 but seemed much older and less attracted to the day's female stars. Its bony face, with its sharp features, does not leave alone the beauty of Havillanda's femininity, the mystery of Myrna Lough, and the Irene Dunne's fluidity. Bacall was more suitable for femme-fatales than vampires. (In a real life she likes: a Hollywood orchestra.) There's a scene in Bacall's tears; Very unsuitable for his character. <br /> <br /> If you would like to read the "biographies" of Bogart, Bacall, Huston, and other Hollywood personalities, contact us. email me.
