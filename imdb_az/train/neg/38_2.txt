The film starlet Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) was kidnapped by a group of 6 million US dollars asking for the island's shelter. The Vietnamese veteran Peter Weston (Cliver) was not hired by a filmmaker to save her daughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Drawings of many films, such as Cannibals, Franco confirms that they split ping pong balls in an interview with the disc).
