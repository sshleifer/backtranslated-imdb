I really did feel bad about the actors in this regard. Certainly, a high school drama class can do a better job or at least one job. Actors should have thought that this film could have a great chance, of course, not. In addition to horrific actions, stories were boring and predictable in most cases. Something about remote control did not mean that. <br /> <br /> Some budget projects that support the new filmmakers, but this is a waste of time and insult in Turkey. I watched just because of some good comments written here. They should be planted by people associated with the film. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > Of course, it failed, but it was an attempt. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a blessing and skip this herd. I wish I could.
