No matter how bad it is, I have to finish watching a movie I started. This movie was painful to sit. The "sparkling" bullet, the correspondent with "ninja", the act of hitting hundreds, hundreds of bullets, and the only outgrowth, the expected outcome and all the bad acts, which seemed to be just innocent, were terrible. Like a girl who has a reporter in her apartment, "heyet, you also like wanna @ # $%! ???" like in 1.2 seconds .... Just bad ... Keep yourself for one hour and forty minutes and play with your children (or dog)!
