There is no way to care for any of these characters in the world. A middle-aged child with a bunch of spoiled children takes some medications in a party and goes out and disputes with each other. I just saw it on television and did not think like a movie, there was no more resonance or a proper drama that was in line with the wishes of "Life". Such things are similar to those of a moderate "lifestyle", which is very intense, from the very beginning to a striking process. There's David Baddiel in it and you know from the Cold Feet, the bird, what he expects. In 2000, there was a lot of things about this, especially the English anger ... "They study and do drugs? Friends, but movies and incestuous relationships are great!". It's nonsense and post-Guy Ritchie comedians ... are dark days. If you have the taste, it will incite you to the point of violence.
