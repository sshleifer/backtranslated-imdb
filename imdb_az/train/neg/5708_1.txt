People like me will break this movie separately. This is not just a realist. Plot can be predicted to be toooooooo. Of course, he finds the treasure and becomes rich and prevents everything from deceiving the wicked. We've seen a million times before. Writers of the film should consider the majority of the film going to the public. They should be true because most people love this movie. I am solving a few seconds of wealth. Hidden treasure room hidden under Manhattan subways? In the underground workplace in New York City, think of all the work that you have to find in the past. and during the entire civil war? Please, love story between Ben and Abigail? how sweet and Clive Cussler's novels I thought were weak in romance. They fall in love only in 2 centimeters. WHAT would I worry about saving myself? Girl with hell and stupid paper piece. 1/10 Trash
