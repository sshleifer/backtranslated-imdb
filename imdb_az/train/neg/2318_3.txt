Found in a baby outdoors and grown up in the martial arts academy, the child managed to sink into the basket. She gets into the college with the help of the person who finds her and rises to the championship when looking for her parents. Moving comedy in a futile way is a complete mix of the whole. The Shaolin Soccer seems to be trying for a hipper basketball version, but his comedy scatter shot wanders more than one Chihuahua with an espresso ADD. I asked, "What are you watching?" I watched it from beginning to end and still do not know what hell is. There are some great action scenes, some entertaining jokes and casual moments, but there is never a time when there is nothing, I would give a link.
