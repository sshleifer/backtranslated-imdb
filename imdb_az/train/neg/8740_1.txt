Last night I rented this movie with my friends and we have one of our biggest laughs. The film should not be laughable, but it's so funny and there is no reality. First, Phillippe uses his regular worker identity to cross all high security terminals (remembering what his character is and actually does not care about me). It's not only sad, but it's overwhelming when it comes to finding the terrible Lego room with supercomputer in its big work. This is plain funny. The tense mood that must be experienced is completely damaged by the childcare room. The latter, as well as others, is so bad that a bad man, especially a bad man, will "rejoice when he is in the right." Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something to play, you'll definitely see it.
