Before Stan Laurel became the smallest part of all time, Broncho signed Billy Anderson a series of cheapies, and most of them were Hollywood's main features. After controversy with Anderson, Laurel continued a series of unofficial parodys in the smaller (and less) production company of Joe Rock. Most of Laurel's parody movies were funny at the time and less funny for modern audiences who did not see the original film, Laurel parody. A fairly common parody of the "Hot Alliance West" cowboy boots. Interestingly, "Pecos's West" has a special parody. Since the Pecosun West is not a great success, how much is Stan filming this movie as a target for lampoonery, why did they wait long after leaving so much parody? And where did they get the name "West of the Hot Bird"? It's possible that 'Hot Dog!' It was a sexual intervention supported by the American people in the 1920s. The film "Hot Dog West" was developed and co-directed by Joe Rock. Among his many other achievements, he presented Rock Laurel to Lois Neilson and was later the best man at their wedding. Full description: In the last years of my life, I was honored to befriend and talk to Joe Rock. At that time, about ninety years old, Rock's memory was strikingly clear ... but he did not remember anything about Gastan West and could not blame him. <br /> <br /> This movie is not a big responsibility. <br /> <br /> The character of the lady is called "Little Hardard": "In the West of Pecos" is a parody of something, I can not get it. There are several "impossible" hooks, including the Horse Mounting method, Laurel. For a moment in this film, Stan Laurel recalled about the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly fled. The theme of the "Hot Dog West" and Keaton's short comedies are similar to the tone and "The Frozen North", but the Keaton version is very funnier. Part of this film waits for a feature of Keaton's "Our Hospitality", but compares to comparisons: here two challenging brethren wait for the Legacy of Halloween, but the previous owner made her purple violet Stanley. If Stan dies, the brothers will be legal heirs. Hmmm ... <br /> Seriously, though: is such a law? Once Stan receives property ownership, any other property or inheritance questions become his or her decision, rather than the decision of the former owner. <br /> <br /> While watching this flawless comedy, I had enough time to look at these points of the law. <br /> <br /> At some point, a stick covers some raw animations that are taken directly to the movie fund. <br /> <br /> This 'Hot Dog' is no washer and there is no winner: this is just one thing. My rating: 10 points. Stand him up, Stan: you will be half the legend of a comedy for several years.
