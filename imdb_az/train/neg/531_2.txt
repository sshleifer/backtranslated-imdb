I expected better with a cast like this. Venessa Redgrave spent most of the film lying in the bedroom. The best actresses in the world can not do much of a player's fun while limiting to sleeping and falling asleep throughout the film. The summary of the plot says that girls are given a secret because they are approaching their death. Undoubtedly, she tells her something other than encrypted advice to be happy with her daughters. All the relationships in the film have not improved. I also felt that from the past to the present day was backward and backward unnecessary. This idea was either denied by the Da Vinci Code from the Notebook that the device did not use or the device used to create an endless romance of the story's main characters. It was a cheap device in any way, because it did not work to create anything. It was a way of contention in a film that had no movie. I wonder why good movies can not be written for women. It was a disappointment.
