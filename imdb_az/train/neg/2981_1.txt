This movie has recently been featured on the DVD in the US, and finally has the opportunity to see the hard-to-find. It even came up with original theater preview of the classics of Italian fright, like "SPASMO" and "DARKNESSDAN". "ZOMBI 3" was launched in 1979 by Lucio Fulci, "ZOMBIE" franchise. "ZOMBI", "ZOMBI 3", keeps this "hero" trash that is a spinning area and many extreme bad actors. <br /> <br /> This time around is a plot surrounding some of this kind of people <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: a humiliating scientist who develops a kind of chemical called" First Death "intended to revive the dead (ie, a healthy man and his stupid female side-by-side). If my ears do not need to be checked, I do not remember one reason for the Death One's research. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if "Death One" is tested in a corpse (with whom I put it "no" as Yul Brynner), and after being injected into his system, he stays upright and exploding! The sound effects are also very pleasant - like a purple green bone on the face of the corpse, the 'spark of paper' is heard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The guy turns into a zombie, but when he does not run on a cheap motel in time, he hits himself in a balcony mirror (!) and kills a servant. Take action before blocking it and avoiding anyone who is unlucky to be in the "pollution zone" and who turns the head of the motel over. <br /> <br /> We have cut off a group of people to find the thief who thieves and burn his body, and only the flock of birds (!) will infect the birds. leaving the army by listening to "groovy music" from a little dinky bum box while watching the trailer load of a driving girl, who goes out of the window and shows heroes. Can anyone say "zombie dish"? There is a sub-plot for a girl driving a car to check a group of birds lying on the road, and a sub-plot that's related to her ... The same birds infected with zombie smoke! <br /> <br /> The birds attack the boy, and the girl takes her to a flammable fuel station to search for water. This is one of the most incredible moments of the movie. He goes around this old dirty, rusty and explicitly abandoned building, he continues to call, "HELLO HERE HERE IS A WATER THERE!" The other faces the wall (!) With chained zombies and the other throws machete. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, birds attack the prostitutes' bribe and a girl is shot. and infected. All this is drawn up to the same motel where the original infection is, and this is where the film is the second most memorable moment. After one hour (one day most), the same motel is already covered with dust, grapes grow over it and released for several years. In any case, is the shelter a better place for this building? Of course, several people come together to break into each other in an incredibly stupid situation with the zombie attack. <br /> <br /> Discover the third most sought-after moment of the village, the woman's description, "THIS PLACE IS LIKE!" Then he continues 'pushed' off the balcony of the Pirahna (?) Infested Water Zombie, where his feet are over and turns into a zombie within a second! Meanwhile, her friend is still a zombie friend who retreated and hits a HOURS infected motel earlier! <br /> <br /> In this movie, there are many regrettions that make a lot of fools for the words in this movie. . For example, the proportion of people infected with "zombies" is different. Sometimes it takes seconds, and the other time takes hours. Some zombies work, others drag their feet and walk really slowly. Some are doing kung-fu moves, and some are hiding in surprises. Some zombies talk like this! Of course, the most spectacular moment is the "zombie head" in the refrigerator, a foolish man who wants to "upgrade" and "attack" himself in the middle of the air. <br /> <br /> For me, the biggest disappointment for me was the absence of story lines covering people who are related to the events that happened to me. was actually killed by the zombie. We do not return them like zombies, but in reality, a girl who was watching "zombies" squeaking birds and her feet squeaked. Moreover, at least those who were killed in the kitchen and / or killed on the bridge wanted to return as zombie. Please note that these zombies only take 'a few bites' and then go to the next victim. <br /> <br /> The most laughable moment of course was the zombie fetus. A pregnant woman who is infected is in bed at the hospital. A baby who looks like a "medical knowledge" tries to pull his face away with a zombie before putting his head off his stomach and leaving her stomach out of the stomach. he closed his face. Timeless! <br /> <br /> As usual, all the characters are a perfect stereotype of this genre. Megalomaniacal Military Officer, the pitiful useless women who scream to kill, think that this movie is a comedy, which is a clear sign of being killed (that is, followed by a chicken pursuit). There were many funny scenes exploded by a hand grenade (obviously the whole budget was spent) and a scene from which a man screamed "I'm THIRSTY GAN!" Costumes are really bad - the same zombies can be found in the same "Asia "wearing a dress, appearing again in the movie, and looking at the skirts of the blue 60, the girl at the motel <br /> <br /> The end of the movie opens the door to the apocalyptic story line. A radio DJ, narrating through the whole film, comes out of itself, and the two survivors warn of the "beginning of the end" when going on a helicopter. <br /> <br /> If you do not know, this movie is very laughable. Gore is minimal and there is something that is unsatisfactory, irrelevant. The blend of black blood, green greens, green leaves and "zombie makeup" remain. "ZOMBI 3" gives you a good night's sleep or beer and an exploded night. <br /> <br /> Those who want to escape the horror,
