Yes, I can ask a question for one and all: "What's the worst movie?" Fury Flight, starring Steven Seagal and co-starring. <br /> <br /> This is a Romanian-made film, how far should it take to catch Romania? With Bollywood. Steven Seagal also speaks of a lack of intellect and abilities. <br /> <br /> This film is so bad that after watching it you feel as if you're in the corner of the shower and weep and cry, because nothing will ever feel clean. <br /> <br /> I just suspect the workers (who can not imagine) in the video and the DVDs using protective equipment and regularly consulting.
