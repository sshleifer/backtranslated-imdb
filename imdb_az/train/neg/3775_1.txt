As other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experience in photography. Colors are comic book thick. In my opinion, the director has been replaced by the "artistic vision" of the film's appearance, but on the contrary, the content should be considered. Despite the magnificent cast, speeches are unstable and the story is nearly incompatible. Madonna was probably raised as a stunt to get a free press. Here's a good thing as his appearance is that his stylospheric hit ("Vogue", which includes a large portion of the hit "Vogue"), "I Breathless" (Film Dick Tracy Inspired Music) has little to do with this movie. After closing most of this movie, I guess Madonna's "I'm Breathless" album. <br /> <br /> If you watch at home, I think, "I'd like to get two hours away from my life," according to the last headlines. Get rid of your wasted time - do not worry about it.
