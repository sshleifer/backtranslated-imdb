This movie is ridiculous. Everyone who tells the actor is great, and the cast is very nice, and even has not seen the can. The first 5 characters you can imagine are openly scared by the player. Lame. I feel like all the other "fast" comments made by people associated with filmmakers. I was not very impressed with the storyline, but I just wanted to see a few beautiful Oregon villages and there were some nice cinematography - but casting was nothing but inspiration. In my opinion, this film emphasizes that something deeper in Amerindian culture has been abolished and possibly lost, and that it is worthwhile and viable. He puts jokes in erroneous and in all open spaces and thinks it's the State Department or something he wrote. Go back to the drawing board. It is absolutely flawless to show that this film is worthy of a classic like Harold and Maude, and in the same film, begging and claiming, and at the same time, "joking" was also featured in this film.
