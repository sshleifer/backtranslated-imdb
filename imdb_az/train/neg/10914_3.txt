Is not it a pleasure when a magical magical thing happens when it comes to spoiling the life of a scary life that has led to a lifetime of worthless lessons along the way? Is this formula not old, or is it? Such a fire way to make a classic movie! See great hits just like Liar Liar and Big! ... It made a semi-lucky Deuce Bigalow: Rob Shneider's line of thought should be followed: Men watched with Gigolo and The Animal. Undoubtedly, let me have more color since I looked at the evidence: Schneider plays a missing police officer who is suddenly involved in a catastrophic accident, but he is often called a horse like a cheetah operated and so on. This film is a little bit more enjoyable as another Schneider-head roles (like The Hot Chick in another bare-footsteps area), but by putting up a community by almost romantic lead (Colleen Haskell of Survivor) and Norm MacDonald By capturing a TV star, she feels that she wants to hate viewers. My favorite scene ... just does not exist. Unfortunately, there is nothing more memorable than the cost of production. I want to finish this review by saying that only one movie may have slight references to other films, but when it comes to delivering lines in the same way ("You can do it!"), There is one word - "milking". In fact there is another word - "cheap".
