This show is not smart. In fact, this is how much it stems from. The "original humor" that these writers are trying to avoid by completely burning the rest of the world is just unfair. In another statement, someone draws a few hilarious lines. It was surprising to me that George H.W. Boxing tells children not to watch television with Fox News. Amazing! Wow. I thought the episodes I saw were bad. <br /> <br /> This line is a high point for the serial. <Strong> <br /> <br /> I am a liberal Republicanist and I know that Bush is not a good president. We all do it. However, this is not an excuse to spend absolutely free time. I place these writers at the same level as Genius behind "Meet Spartans". <br /> <br /> Again, it's just a bad thing. Unfunny, and this is just as refreshing as the crap that makes me more unhappy, but the development of the arrest as beautiful and original shows are conserved after 3 seasons of the season. If you are one of the bloody liberal hippies who are thinking of any sentence with spaces and pink comedic words, do not watch this twist. <br /> <br /> At the same time, there are Bush's voices. A portion of his work imitates a Texan's emphasis and, at the end of his sentence, is really hard. At least South Park agrees that votes are not right. Follow the Daily Show / Colbert if you want a funny political satire. Stop moving motion figure animation is EXTREMELY well done, watch out for any political sketch, Robot Chicken, which is fun watching. Search for George Bush in Jedi Fish on YOUtube. Expensive
