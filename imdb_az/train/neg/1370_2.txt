**** WARNING: Here are the spoilers **** Why spend so many years looking at the garbage fleeing in such a hurry? This film is an effective collection of clich√©s, poor writing, worse director, and then we have not yet mobilized. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can predict the whole story from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The hero fights against expert, foolish, corrupt and inefficient chaos. An avalanche extinguishes all the heroes who are able to survive, despite all the dangers of abyss. The corruption partner, who caused all the damage, flushed with the money he earned. The second episode was shocked by the adventurous experience of a renowned expert. Finally, the bad guys have a heart. The troubled teenager falls into the weapon of his strange element after his salvation. Etc and so on. And so on. And so on. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are very few reasons to warn the spoilers. When you give the basic items, you probably could do all the effort. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous commentator that, even some of the worst movies have GREAT recovery features. you will find it difficult to find in one. <br /> <br /> Some films denied me, but that was of course.
