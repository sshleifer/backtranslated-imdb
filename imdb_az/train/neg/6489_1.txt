It looks like a good place for a movie ... unfortunately, it will not deliver at nearly every level. It's hard to watch at the start of the movie, and I've found myself struggling against the challenge of solving the biggest problem from a visual point of view that the camera job is just a series of "arty" splicings, and part of the movie that will spoil you in a semi-actually story. It's really hard for you to immerse now, and it just works to create a neutral structure, but the movie has only half-fallen characters and untouched stories that just make you feel frustration and confusion because they are trying to get you out of it deeply.
