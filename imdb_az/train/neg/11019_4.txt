Fred Olen is a bad director of Ray B's film directors, but Haunting Fear is probably one of his best films. Well, the story of the great Poe 'Premature Died' and yes, it's a bad paced and uneven butcher, but it's also quite entertaining. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens builds a trick to earn money (like Robert J. Richardson), as he needs money to pay a gangster (with Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of soft-core films in the early 1990s, actually presents the best performance in the film as a rebellious lady. Karen Gara's psychic, Robert Klarke, the doctor and Michael Berryman, will benefit from the smaller roles they play in one of the better scenes. The latter was not very meaningful!
