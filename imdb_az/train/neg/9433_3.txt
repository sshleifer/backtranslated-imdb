I bought "Unhinged" because I had a strange picture on the cover. If you want to see all the best part of the movie, just look at the back of the box. <br /> <br /> All the detainees are shown and I'm honest, I can say that they can be better off than they are in the movie. A group of college girls going to a rock concert (through deep, dark trees in one of the longest haulers in the celluloid). There is no visible damage to the car, but it was enough to put one of the characters in the comedy scene for the rest of the movie (or maybe reading the script and before commencement). <Br> Two other girls wake up in a large, isolated house. The house, by the way, is incredible and drives more drama with the participation of more than one participant. For some reason, this house has no way. The only way to get to the main road is to walk five miles from the forests. Girls spend an unhinged resting-place sitting around listening to strange conversations between an old-fashioned bitch (like George Washington's drift) and an equally straightforward, sexually-conscious daughter. <br /> <br /> We will return from this concert because we are preparing more clothes than Gilligan Island stone to go to our audience today. killing scenes, we care about it now. We want someone to kill us to end suffering. Unhinged finally completes with an extremely shocking end to be deserved to be a better movie. <br /> <br /> A good idea in the film, when it comes to writing, writers tried to shoot a movie. <br /> <br /> The latter, in the worst-case scenario, is a vengeful directing and a porno movie that is more hollow than a leper (we're sorry, when you get a glimpse of how bad this film is when opening loans, The screen is black for about two minutes while talking about something worth mentioning, but do not waste your time. You just feel Unhinged and want your time and money back.
