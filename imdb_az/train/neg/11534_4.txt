<br /> <br /> Let me begin by saying that Gillian Anderson's great talent for the incredible talent as a diverse and versatile actress - I do not understand his reasons for accepting it. <br /> <br /> The premiere of the film, in my opinion, was a great idea, and there were really a few thought-provoking topics, but this was a collapse. I hate 99 percent of English movies. It is very long, tiring, and most of the time, it will not be a lot of things after the first twenty minutes. When you think you have a chance to move fast several times, Paula runs a marathon like Radcliffe. With less creative guidance and a minimalist structure, there is nothing to lure audiences to populous creatures. As for the scenario, I think the writer is trying to save some trees, but the average scenarios "Alice: F *** OFF!" (Alice Alice: ADAM! ADAM!) The word is probably the actor's doubts that Kate Moss is paying more for Virgin Mobile ads, some of whom are friends of Bridget Jones, Shazza There are not many changes in the use of f-word that often leads to pride. <br /> <br /> Alice is the main character who left the most intimate followers for the characters outside this terrible reaction, creating the main characters before the incident. he has a great job, but he has an expensive London apartment with a roof cover to die for, to see the ghost, pain and dissatisfaction of the screen before losing a bad turn in his yard. After several attacks, explains that they will begin this way; he has taught him to beat his gun that the last he fled to a big city, not his footsteps, he fled in search of something He had to feel like his life - instead, he had a Lexus and everyone who was not rich enough for luxury driving with an integrated security / entertainment system a stereotypic mid-grade Toffs group (looking to be Ms Robinson if you do not want to be an electrician in a cocaine) is someone who looks down to me. It is performed by Gillian Anderson, a saving grace of character. In the hands of a small actress, she would have been dimensionless, but Ms Anderson was actually able to bring a few imminent moments to this paradise, especially when he was sincere in an idle attempt to apologize for a traffic accident <br /> <br / > To stop Adam from continuing his attacks. <br /> <br /> I can not say that Adam is either better. Danny Dyer played it as Jack-Lad with a fish-water, but a good performance, not a single script, and the lack of any characteristic background could not save him. <br /> <br /> This film was mostly based on shocking cost, but the timing was extinguished and upgraded from start to finish. When it comes to shock, one of the shocking things about this film is a demonstration of how a gentle lady, Anderson, passed; It was worrying to see it as cruel attack scenes. In a single note, only a single British film set a time for a group of violent sexual assaults to offer contraception to each other before continuing to applaud their spouses - talk about the over-lips being overloaded! I'm not surprised if the National Lottery is a movie to earn money, fewer or less people spend their money each week. <br /> <br /> I say that I hate this movie, I give a lot of credit, not enough care for one of the heroes to provide a strong emotion. I want my life to take one and several hours back!
