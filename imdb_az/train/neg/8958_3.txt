I love the first Cube movie. It was a good idea, but the frustrated players and heroes always kept me out of love. I really did not need to see the continuation but heard when I heard making a third movie that would move more than an original prequel. Perhaps I was thinking about making some of the original problems and offering them a memorable character. I thought it was a good mistake. <br /> <br /> "Cube Zero" starts quite well, giving us two characters in the Cube, responsible for watching and storing a maze of traumatic injuries. Cinematographers are able to gain a sense of mystery through the daily conduct of two men. There are several questions about the nature of the people being sent there and the true nature of those who manage the whole process. All this is for the audience. The player was a little weaker, but the whole movie was relatively good in the first half. <br /> <br /> One of the two "guards" begins to make serious doubts about his actions. Then a hasty group decided to go and help. <br /> <br /> We get acquainted with the character of the "Jax" sent by the managing Cube. Along with its two floors, there is a major reason for this film's failure. For the beginning of Jax, it first appears and speaks as a third-degree victim, directly taken from a James Bond film, which is a "well-known" glass out of any atmospheric velocity. More precisely, it is not a serious movie, but rather a comedy. With some incredibly small lines, perhaps the screenwriter was squeezed and did not care. When the former "observer" faces the group at Cube, self-esteem is even lower. <br /> <br /> Again, weak characters, dialogue and failure to influence something that operates "Cube Zero" is a waste of time for those who are looking for something better. horror movie.
