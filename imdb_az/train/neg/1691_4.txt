This movie is really nothing, an inevitable "gotcha!" at the end of each. Indeed, there is no real structure to develop and speak of any characters. There is the most skeleton of motivation to do something as the heroes move toward inevitable proofs. It's an excuse to show a creepy ghost child (it looks like he has taken some of the mixed family cats in her ectoplasty) and her dreary mother ("The Ring" with a long black hair in her face), the English version of The Grudge <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not recommended. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
