If this movie is directed and produced to create a bad movie cult classic, this can be a hit (I can say). Did you ever sit and explain that it was a terrible movie that was interesting in terms of its flaws? That's it. Each player who plays the role of a player must be a candidate for the best-performing prizes. It would be challenging to find another movie with such production budget. Everything goes against the logic of opening scenes. The dialogue is totally unbelievable and illogical. Something for the film's own behavior and its overall story. What really boggling the mind is that some flaws in a meeting really made the decision to waste money on this trash can. Amazing! Wow.
