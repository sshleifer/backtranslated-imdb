This was the worst movie i really had. Michael Vartan hot, but who is this woman? And throughout the whole film it looks terrible, the hair is so bad! They speak monotonous voices and have nooo chemistry. The cover of a DVD can not really produce a movie that is really far away. Really really boring. I had to take some of it forward because it was very painful to watch. Would I really like to know that everyone on the ground thinks it's good? hhaha they say as if they were 'yes' and have no passion. I was not in love with them. Sorry, but this was the worst excuse for a movie I've ever seen.
