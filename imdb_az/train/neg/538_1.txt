Wow, how loose the talent is. With my husband, I sit there, think, and get better, these actresses are very good to waste their time. Unpleasant characters, hackneyed scripts and unusual pacing take up to two hours long. In fact, I could not hack it and started shopping (cats were more attractive than this movie). Her husband left and confirmed that they were not better - just as Buddy was killed, he wanted you to hit a car and finish their pitiful lives. It would be infinitely more fun. Beautiful scenery and costumes can not save these creatures.
