In a cheap and intelligent way, it's a mixed story and action. Not a good line, even a line is not bad and no memorable to be good. Even with the DVD, the bluepod saw showed how entertaining the actors were and how much they enjoyed. Esoteric and confidential key was apathetically inauthentic and antagonists can not be creepy or convincing. The "homoerotic" overtones were imprudent and dissatisfied and restricted to young boys who clung to fungi while playing in their boxers. I am not gay to appreciate it, but a bit of action kept me and my girlfriend waking at least.
