Whoo-boy, this is one of the worst screams I've ever seen. Of course it was Sci Fi and I'm not watching the Sci Fi, but the human being is a delicate structure and a maximum of two-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> These characters were stereotypic and overdone, the cunning and seemingly unbelievable, the vampires were less intimidating, more funny, seemingly unnecessary, the specific effects were healed downwards and ended? Here's something that is unexpected about the end, when suddenly it becomes a tombwe lesbian and when it starts to do so with a female vampire, it's not really hot, given that it takes place in three seconds. "What is hell?" then "Adam, this is hot." If this ever occurs again, do not follow God's prohibition.
