I do not believe in the number of people who simply compare it to the first movie. Removed me from this comment! This is an open endeavor to make money for the success of the first film. Dialogue is terrific and original, as it is original or attractive. <br /> <br /> This story is ridiculous, ridiculous portraits of the French police, and characterization of Doyle's first film. Do you think to think down to the dock personally to see how many drugs are sending a load of drugs? The ease with which Doyle finds his son is sad. When Doyle left the United States and some REAL police, they all drank coffee as French police. What a joke. Go to an overseas city and kiss the earth's largest rifles with a travel map and some tourist brochures. Disappointing. <br /> <br /> The real terrible is the next one, anyone else thinking crazy.
