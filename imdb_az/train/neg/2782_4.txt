I saw the movie last weekend, I was upset and disappointed with it. Basically, the film, especially those from the former Soviet Union, says that immigrants coming to this country can bring them to the old countries and capture the work of the Americans. It's a very bad way of looking after refugees, and talking to people is a worse way to talk about it. The main thing is that. Another thing is general writing, directing, and shooting at the level of rural amateurs. The actors were very good, but the team did not help them to get rid of them. Some jokes were laughable, but most were bad and cheesy. I did not wait to go out of the theater, I do not want my money back.
