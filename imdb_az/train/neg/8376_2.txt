The DVD "Little Man" is a Wayans Brothers flop. A smaller story than a midget criminals played by Marlon Wayans, hides a diamond in a lady's bag after a heist. He and his wife, Tracy Morgan, plan a grueling plan to hide Marlon as a baby and build a lady's house. Then he goes through all kinds of "Homey Only" or "Children's Play" as a Mayhem to get back and be treated as a baby. I was amazed at how humorous this movie was. Sugars are made repeatedly in other places, they are not cute or funny. I think the film will be strange if it does not use CGI and use a small actor adhering to Marlon's face. While watching deleted scenes (exclusivity CGI), this player likes Mini-like, but chose a different route. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
