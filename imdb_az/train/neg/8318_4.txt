I have already seen fantastic stories, but it's incredible that this building's building is too close to being ridiculous. A rich and young man carries a heart attack on the day after his marriage, and he is aware of something to kill his own surgery and his surgeons. Even if there is a medical explanation of such a phenomenon, it is a mixture of the subsequent events ... say ... spirits? ... and will do everything to save the life of the mother's son, who is dedicated to real life. <br /> <br /> Along with a series of coincidences that can not occur in life, it is a combination of a bad and simple concept. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that the film is absolutely ineffective - in fact, the first time director Joby Harold, Anakin Skywalker suit, the gorgeous Jessica Alba and the super-gift Lena Olin, were the first to have a good role on Hayden Christensen does a decent job in managing a group. It would all be worth a better story.
