Payback is a dramatic game, and the revenge line is withdrawn by the line of absurd stories that determine the scene for the subsequent fireworks. Why does a man become a trophy wife of a gangster's boss in his home? Why does an unhappy husband encourage the attention of a stranger and wait for him to leave her husband and his livelihood to live with her happily after her new love? Of course, the hero, Kevin Costner, should wait for a response from his husband, who gives the film a pretext to hate it. Anthony Quinn, a great actress, of course deserves it, and Madeleine Stowe is a tragic person who suffers as a prince of his princess. Stowe is good but Spanish accent does not work. The arrival of smaller players is good, especially as Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland are as pale as a rock star.
