I do not say this is a bad * movie. Unfortunately, for me, as you know your sword, it's just completely unrealistic, it just happens. I've been a fighter since I was 14 and that this movie is very bad. F. Murray Ibrahim is good (and there are some fencing backgrounds), but most other actors, especially the student, are simply missing.
