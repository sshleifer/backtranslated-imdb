Our teacher showed us this film in the first grade. I have not seen him since. Just watch the trailer though. Is this your first class movie? I do not think so. I was scared of this movie, but I could watch it. Basically, Sheleley McClain cut off a little girl and became a scene, then a ketchup boy! This movie has saddened me. Now I'm 20, probably not thinking of that. Even though there is only PG, I would like to share with my younger children the experience and the idea that I should not see this movie. Be aware of possible consequences for children. I do not even remember what it was, once it was enough!
