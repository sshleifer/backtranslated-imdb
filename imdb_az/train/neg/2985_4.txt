Finally, when I got the chance to watch Zombie 3 (Zombie Flesheaters 2 in Europe) on an imported Region 2 Japanese dvd, this zombie epic was blowing me up for fun. Transfer is just as good as it was before. Anchor Bay continues to look like it is. Gore really looks like this and can really protect the price of perfect make-up and fx.Telefon. The sound is awful. Only 2 channels dolby, but if you have a receiver <br /> <br /> Dolby Prologic 2 can be really effective, even if it really is a very happy music (actually a very good score) and really good sound effects. It has never been well sounded and the perfect transfer adds to the overall taste. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have never understood how much blood flowing in this film, the explosion of headaches, cat-filled mega-rats, a garbage on a zombie throat, burnt edges of a woman), gut munching, zombie babies and more i <br /> <br /> This is doubtful for fans of the Italian Zombie action, especially. There are some perfect numbers and cinematography. People do not give enough credit, <br /> <br /> This movie will never give you a second, and because of its consistency, the dubbing is awful, <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the best scary movies , you can not do anything. film is bad, very good, purpose. At the highest level, even at random. They would have been a disaster for Guler, but they played as a straight axis and eventually this is a terrible religious classic. Signals of the movement, exotic places, excellent design, good, sometimes cinematography, fine cheese and contrasting but still interesting area, great makeup effects, butt, excellent music and sometimes gruesome, sometimes creepy but always funny zombies. Beautiful women, who can go wrong with this movie, all have a cult classic based on time testing.
