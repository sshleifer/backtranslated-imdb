Let's be honest here: The only reason why anyone can get it, just one review, and the only reason why everyone can claim that David Lynch is for David Lynch's children. But what do you think? Even David Lynch can make a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Maybe Lynch wanted to make the normalization and feel absurd as a clean topic. <br /> <br /> Perhaps dirty, cacophonic sounds and chicken spraying mean something about the absurdity of all of us about the world of humanity, our relations with Real. <br /> <br /> Instead, he tells me something: I just lost $ 20. <br /> <br /> If I did not want to attack for attack, he threw Hansen up and bleeding his ears. <br /> <br /> "Demirbend has an evolutionary quality - it's meta-meta-comic." That is not so bad that it is not ridiculous as it is so bad. However, this is a little funny. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, you will receive Dumbland. If you do not, protect yourself from punishment.
