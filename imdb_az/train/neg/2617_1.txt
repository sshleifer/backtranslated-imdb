This film was pure pain. When I was sitting in the theater for x-sizes, I wondered when the movie would start. All the devices were in place; a typical love story has to overcome the short gear of heroes, but she has to go out, but none has ever started. When these events took place, I was tough and the devices were completely ineffective. On stages requiring much tension and development, she felt the necessary frames cut off. Children's things should not be in this way. Children's films can be as catchy and attractive as minors. The excuse is, "Hey, for her children" is a bull. Every day I carry "Sword". That was terrible. I feel Disney will extinguish everything today. As for children, I've seen that they can negotiate for ten years ... a clean garbage.
