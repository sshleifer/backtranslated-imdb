When I think I'm going to finish it all year without a single movie, the Bomb rating, a friend of mine last night, brought this disaster home. I was afraid of the worst who knew his reputation, and he was afraid of God. This is a Mexican-made confusion prepared by K. Gordon Murray and dubbed into English. There are terrific kits and effects and little elfs that do not operate in the North Pole, but help them make space in space and make toys, but virtually all different groups have children in every country. While Saint-Nick observes monitors displaying all the children working in horrific festive songs in all languages, the opening sequence of heartbreaking songs is not eternal and no story. Undoubtedly, this Santa Claus does not follow the rules of child labor! <br /> Finally, we take a series of evil and reptile reels for Satan, who travels from hell to hell, to create miserable and inferior children. It turns into a nightmare on Santa's Christmas Eve. It is a triangular and wrapped experience that follows the film, and it's bound to scare younger children and transform them into Santa Claus and eternal life. Surprisingly, the name of Jesus Christ is frequently mentioned in this Christmas movie, and this is something in the context of all the strange things that have happened. It makes my personal list of easily the "worst movie I've ever seen", but I'm sure nothing is unique.
