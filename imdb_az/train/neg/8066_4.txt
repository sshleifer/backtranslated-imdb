Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck are young pupils at Middleton College, Middleton. Four teenagers form two love triangles. It's a terrific full moon riding and diving on a slippery and twisted mountain road overnight. They do not look properly, they care for another car and kill one or more people. The soulless nightmare begins ... A very terrible and politically correct horror shone without darkness and nudity. This is clearly influenced by the "Spirits of the Spirits" .The cinema art is good, unfortunately, there are zero tensions from 10.
