It was really bad. <br /> <br /> I'm a Murphy actor, and at the same time (also cheap in Yugoslavia), with "Mercy!" In parallel with the short-term "Dirty Dozen" television series. <br /> <br /> I am embarrassed for members of the film and especially for Telly Savalas. He was too old and dropped off for his role (it pushed 70 when it came out) and John Wayne in The Green Berets, parallel with Telly and Greece, and other reviewers said that most of this crime against the celluloid was a lot of rude viewers, so I will not repeat here. But I'll add that I was not surprised by the ridiculously small helmet that Savalas wore on her big, swollen head. <br /> <br /> I'm also surprised that this train accident is 4.7 degrees above IMDb. <br /> <br /> If I am concerned, this is "1" between the right board. <br /> <br /> More than "Dirty Dozen - Fatal Mission" too. <br /> <br /> Terrible - avoid !!!!
