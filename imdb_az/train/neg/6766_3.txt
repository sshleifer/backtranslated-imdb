As for this movie, did you hear this statement? "Herbie: Completely twisted" and yes right. This movie is really terrible and completely naked. <br /> <br /> This was supposed to be the second worst movie ever since Lindsey's Recognition of the Queen of Teenage Drama. The only good thing about this movie is that it is better than millions of movies and the only point of sale for the movie. I do not see a dear actor such as Matt Dillon as part of this film, does he read this terrible scenario without signing up for access? <br /> <br /> I did not like about this movie, Herbi's unusual abilities and fantasy as well as the wall climbing, and all this, faster than just a Beatle racer. I know that this is not a children's movie, but they are as if they were entering the sea and becoming smarter than fun. <br /> <br /> Last words: If children are really 5-12 years old, I doubt everyone will enjoy this delicate movie. What is my money? <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
