Many people point to this movie as Tom has actually created a horrible movie ("The Bachelor Party" is great, but that's another story). The film stands on the "Dungeon and the Dragons-style game", which ultimately manages the young gumpu hallucinatory madness. <br /> <br /> At the same time, in the early 1980s, it was a remarkable event that pointed to the dangers facing our youths playing a bad role. <br /> <br /> However, "Mazes and Monsters" "Whatever Chris Makepeace is?" story. We recall it as "Clifford" in "My Cahimdigim" that we remember him as "Rudy the Rabbit" and "beat" Matt Dillon and gave us all the important excitement. <br /> Then Rona Jaffe came. Perhaps, at least a little (especially Dynamite!) The line between bad and bad writing is thinner, so I'm leaving Macepeas to find out who is guilty in this case, and I know I've seen that the last big issue " Vamp "and was in 1986. Sean Pann had a small job as his brother," Hawk and Protector ", but then a Brat Pack torch." I can not recommend this film well honestly, Jaffe would have seen a smaller, more idealistic Chris Macabese before feasting in her spirit.
