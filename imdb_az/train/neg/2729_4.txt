An actress, Ruth Romance, a gesture of goodwill in real life, helped make the whole star star of Warner Bros patriotism and song in an air base near the airport in San Francisco, helping entertainers who come and leave for the Korean War. Many celebrities come to the game, but a lover develops between a romantic aching starlet and a painful green and skinny Air Force Corp. (Ron Hagerthy, she seems to be delivering newspapers from bicycles). He already sees the actress cheating when he is part of an airplane flying to Honolulu and Honolulu (think that he liked to be on a bad road, but instead he was the most childish daughter in the 1950s). Doris Day is the most enjoyable laugh and charming songs around or around the first thirty minutes. Romance here is also attractive, while James Cagney is entertaining in the screen and Gordon MacRae sings in his wonderful baritone. Jane Wyman, entering the bedroom of a hospital after Doris Day's seizure, "Did they escape from the set?" He asked. An interesting flashback to other time and place, for non-depressing viewers. Still, low rent and adequate technical terms, "Starlift" is exactly the second biller. * From 1/2
