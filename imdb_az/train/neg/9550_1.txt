After Highlander 2 (still denied), I thought it was so bad, because it was not possible to postpone me later. I was wrong. I liked the original Wargames, but this movie is incorrect with details on the computer details and the original movie. The original Wargames were at least some hacks that worked. Anyone who writes this movie does NOT know about COMPUTER unless you use a word processor. I do not doubt that he watched the original film. Acting is not even convincing. Please do not watch this movie anyway. I do not think the canal is squeezed on television and can not turn off the TV. THESE ARTICLES ARE AGAINST YOUR LIFE.
