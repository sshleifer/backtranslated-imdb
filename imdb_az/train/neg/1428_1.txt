Although this film did not appear to be the basic method of filming Dogme, digital digital warrants were shot from the very beginning. You get the point. This 1991 masterpiece explicitly waited for these developments. Corin Nemec is not as prominent as a good writer and narrator. Speed ​​is slow, but elegant, because the cinematography is very beautiful. Celebrate it at T.V. again, because I will not see you for a better nostalgic predator-for-T.V movie. Direct-to-video did not feel good at all!
