There are no scenarios, bad actors (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... <br /> <br /> Give a budget to do so ... In Belgium, we have ten films that earn all the prizes in Cannes <br / <br /> Last time I saw such a NULL-movie, it was Hypercube. <br /> <br /> The better things in this movie were the word "End." <br /> <br /> Why is it allowed to sell? It's expensive. <br /> <br /> I paid ten dollars to get it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The next time I have to break my arm, but I get this type of shit.
