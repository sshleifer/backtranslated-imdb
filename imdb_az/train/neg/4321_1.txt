This was WORST Christmas movie I saw. I took two little children to see this. It was the darkest, the most hated plan - his family did not get money, his mother lost his job, the father was killed in the bank, the bank robbed the car with the two children on the back and after the high speed, he went out of the bridge and drowned them in the river. My mother was left alone. It's no surprise that his Christmas sprit is gone. Christmas angels do not save the drowning children, and Santa does not bring dead ancestors back! I thought it was the worst thing to send children. It's best to tell them that there is no Santa, just to show them such films!
