I was able to watch it through the MST3K, and oh boy, even though the film's excitement has worsened. Imagine that someone with the power of the camera will be exercised by a monkey. <br /> <br /> Objectives (little ones) come from special effects that are "OK". The majority was moving "OK"; <br /> <br /> It was a higher quality than any other B-movie I've seen in the past. <br /> The rest of this film is worse than a horror, the camera man appears to have put a lot of work on the roller skate and pushes him. The story (if it is to be called) is full of gaps, it is almost ridiculous; it does not really explain why hell is in the first place or needs human flesh to survive. The scenario is poorly written and dialogue is calculated exclusively with a fluid fool. <br /> If you can not find the version of MST3K, pull it away from any distance.
