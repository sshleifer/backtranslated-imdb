Often movies about self-hatched characters usually do not give good drama. 'Downloading Nancy' is no exception. <br /> <br /> Nancy (Maria Bello), who is married to Hero Albert (Rufus Sewell). Albert is a successful software developer who develops a golf game that successfully sells to various bars and bars / restaurants. Unlike most people, Albert has virtually no positive quality (apart from the ability to succeed in the business world). Throughout the film, Albert has a terrible and enduring expression on his face. There is no blessing for his wife to provide all the emotional problems and whores. <br /> <br /> When the spouse of his spouse is asked, he is punished by masturbation. <br /> <br /> Nancy is an equal note as a character. She had only a 15-year-old boyfriend, but she was sexually abused by her uncle when she grew up (thankfully, there is no story in this story). Regardless of himself, he has a self-injury result and is forced to make a decision to come to the conclusion. But there is respect for his therapist that no progress can be made. <br /> Finally, Nancy is in contact with Luis. She is a sadomasoist gigolo who comes into sexual contact with a great deal of pain that affects women. <br /> <br /> Luis has two children, but he does not see them (his mother is no longer associated with her). <br /> <br /> Nancy's plan is primarily to deal with painful sex with Louis and then kill her. There is a particularly unpleasant scene with sex with Nancy, which breaks her vaginal area with a fragmented piece. These scenes are displayed as alerts after visiting Leberbourg and visiting Albert after hitting a golf club. As you can see, there are two layers to see Louis Albert: 1) Nancy's cure for her treatment, and 2) enjoy the support she has received. Initially, Albert gets a little lower before the fate of Albert Nancy, because Albert asks him to take his dog to his brother, so someone is waiting for it in the future. Of course, Nancy's fate Louisin finally ended up dying of his death (but he hesitated when she realized that some of her feelings were "for her"). <br /> <br /> We soon learned that Louis was being arrested for the murder of Nancy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> It's a man who is a person who is away from his feelings and is responsible for the fall of Nancy, but is it true that people in real life are one-dimensional, I do not think, they are a man who paints and pains Albert to blame for Nancy's neglect. , Love for Nancy ( before killing him.) <br /> <br /> Finally, the filmmakers determine that their dreams are not related to where they are. Different characters in the movie. They were spun at the loading scenes with the creaking of the audience so that Nancy's loading was nothing more than a mere taste and soft pornography.
