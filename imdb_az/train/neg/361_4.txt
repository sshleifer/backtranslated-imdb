After reading the book, I liked the story. I was disappointed with the many changes made while watching the movie. Books and films differ, but there are two different stories, but there are names and some of the stories of the book. Read the book and get a better understanding of the movie. The book provides you with better development of characters. These characters are extremely interesting and you care about them. Places really fit the description of the book. Some characters are not included. Television is a great example of a great deal of books and stories in the microwave. The author does not always insure a good movie, but sometimes he can help.
