Poor standard for any standard. The story in Match Point was directed to a certain enthusiasm and wrote a certain attraction (Woody Allen, blending his own culture with classic English murder and looking at what he could do with it). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Scoop, however, does not have one of them. Poorly written, the second is hopelessly wooden, and the story itself is of no interest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Allen's various Hollywood genres (Cairo and other Jade Scorpion / Purple Rose curse ) has been very pleased for us over the years. Even Hollywood's end was a great central idea. Unfortunately, his inspiration left him this time.
