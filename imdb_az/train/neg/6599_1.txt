Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a well-known actor. In fact, any movie is better for her. Now Ol George has absolutely nothing to do with this movie ... but once he has said something that describes this movie to T <br /> <br /> I do not remember his exact words, but basically said the great writer, he knows, but great things can not get rid of the bad writing. <br /> <br /> This little observation was no better than "all new adventures of Laurel & Hardy: For Love or Wax". <br /> <br /> Extraction of two potentials was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy), despite the fact that only part of them, are actually acting as a mere good deal (their behavior and all). This film should stand as a constant word for their talents. <br /> <br /> Pinchot and Sartain (this is "very characteristic") and, in addition to a short-term dialogue, fall flat on the face of the film. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > Why Mummy wants to miss the pretty English lady? We want to see Stan and Ollie (or at least their stands). <br /> <br /> But this movie, despite all the jokes, would still leave. us ... <br /> PROBLEM # 2: Most legends say I'm a "watered down" slapstick. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> Life is a companion. <br /> <br /> Maybe a description can help: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His bill falls and returns it. This is a classic slapstick. <br /> <br /> This "gem" accidentally hit us some people. They turn around and tell them to be careful and keep on doing it cheerfully. This is not a slapstick. Not even funny. This is just ... boring ... and this movie is full of such jokes. It's like going to this movie as bread and butter. The writers and directors only draw these dull moments and behave as if they are laughable. <br /> <br /> The Azerbaijanis living in the Caucasus resemble each other. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; and Sartine's Stan and Ollie capabilities, but the script fills border exposures and lame jokes." <br /> <br /> Watch this movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> stick with a contract (only "Atoll K" and "Be Great").
