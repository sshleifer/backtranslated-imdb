For Eliza Dushku, I wanted to watch this movie, but there is a small part in it, and its character is not very popular. However, the main character played by Melissa Sagemiller is a very nice and enjoyable look to watch throughout the film. This is really a showcase for his appearance and talent. <br /> <br /> The very essence of life is quite foolishness. After a car crash, some comrades may be dead but live in their previous lives, and mysterious things happen. Some bad guys are after them, but we did not really know who they were (probably they were in the other car, but we did not hear what they were after). Recent scenes, especially in the film, seem ambitious, but I can not get anything from it. The opening scene, the bad guys (wearing some strange masks) cut a blonde girl's wrist, and no part of the blood was ever explained or watched. If bad guys are not representing Cassie (Sagemiller) by the surgeons they're trying to pull back from the dead ... but not this, it does not work. Bad guys are just bad guys; a story mess that they can really be interested in anything else. <br /> <br /> In a supernatural story about killing, love and sacrifice, hell needs bad guys? <br /> <br /> From 3 to 10.
