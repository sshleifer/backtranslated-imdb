I just finished watching El Otro. My wife Julio Chavez's performance has always been with me because he is a great actor, but this movie is really hard and slow. It would have been even worse for Hulya. Anyway, this is a movie that you can not understand, if you're not necessarily Argentine, and even advise you to rent this movie to have a good time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends ... it really is suffering and is incredibly slow and the land does not feel anything. Perhaps the director wanted to show the sensitivity of human life, but despite what he did, the audience was amazed by scenes that were a bit shocking. It gives you something to think, but not in a good way. Generally, I did not really love this movie.
