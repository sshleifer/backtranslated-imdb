With more than 70 styles of predictable, sometimes funny, the occasional drama with a few dramatic dark scenes combining with some character paranoia combining with random violin horror music, I can not help chuckling myself. /> <br /> I usually love Defoe and say that the player is not all bad, the plot is developing at a reasonable pace and guessing from time to time. Simply, it is predictable, and I was watching something new for a television drama instead of a new movie. Maybe the filmmakers wanted to, but the film I had read before the movie could be written by only one person involved in the production. <br /> <br /> Wait a while, and if I can wind it, I would not go to see it in the cinema. I would wait for bargains in our video store, but I'm sure it will not last long.
