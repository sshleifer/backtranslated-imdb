This film was not a bad one, despite the fact that he wrote a recent movie with a plot stolen in the 13th film on Friday. In fact, most of Horror movies recently shot by Hollywood were not as bad as it was. The killings were sometimes original, although they were a little creative. Camp is a better thing than low-budget features, but much more than the larger Artisan / Lions Gate studio. Regardless of the film's budget, my only real complaint was to be small. Sorry, but this movie puts me in a bad category. The last was just stupid. Before that, I was a little bored, but in fact I love it. 4/10
