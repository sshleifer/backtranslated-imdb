This line begins with a clever, dull British philosophy of art. Great Vorelli from the "Devil Doll" film builds a teleportation machine just to cut off his cup, Blanchard, a bearded man and a large eyebrow. When the experience is unsuccessful, a good doctor will learn that Lambach, who oversees all the grants in the world, will stay in London for several days. With his beloved laboratory assistant Sheila, she tries to get into Blanchard's home. Something goes wrong and means winds looking like a mouse. The rest of the film travels around London, which is shocked by a good orange-haired physician, a hand-held hands and a diaper on her face. There are some crimes, a modest paper job, and finally the doctor will disappear to where the rats face. Fortunately, nobody decided to continue.
