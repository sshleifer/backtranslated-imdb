Yes, there's another movie here. Extremely banned, though sex was restored. But this is not the case. In previous studies, we have a point about the overall enjoyment of Haim films that began in the 80s. <br /> <br /> "One of the girls" about a middle-aged child (Corey Haim) trying to escape theft by wearing a girl and going to another school. He joins the cheerleading squad and is friendly with other honors, Marie (Nicole Eggert). <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was illogical and was not even funny. However, according to the majority of analyzes, this appears to be the admirer of Alanis Morrisette or teenage queen Nicole Eggert, only those who want to watch it. If you are looking for a good Haim feature (or comedy comedy), do not look at anything since 1989. This is the point Haim's career holds.
