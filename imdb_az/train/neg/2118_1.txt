What can I say about the Seven Pounds ... Well Seattledan looked at a flight to Tokyo and this flight was long and because the movie did not really help. Will Tomas's character Thomas Thomas, at the end of the end, is not entirely difficult. The film's two-hour working time delivers the most time on the screen with a random trash, which breaks as far as possible the surface. Although Rosario Dawson's character is very limited in protecting the crime, he gives the film a little. When I want to do it, I do not understand that everyone can never cry in this movie. And Will Smith kills himself with a jellyfish, which proves that the most deadly way to kill yourself with a jellyfish.
