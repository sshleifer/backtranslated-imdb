As I've done to the writers script, I'll spend a lot of time at this glance. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Mark Blankfild's performance of QOD-AWFUL not only so, but everyone! Physical comedy was forced, flat, and predictable. The violin, pen names were written by mongoloid monkeys using Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. Manufacturers have mastered their ability to squeeze these kinematic nobility. Even veteran actor Ray Walston was able to look like a talent. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself. <br /> <br /> For 96 minutes of my life I was waiting for a shining comedy to return and condemn anyone involved in this cinematic murder.
