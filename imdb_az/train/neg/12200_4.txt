Usually, any movie with Sylvester Stallone will usually take the donkey. Rambo: The first part of the blood is no exception. Sylvester Stallone's best films were Rocky and First Blood. This film is incredibly unreal and boring. There is this move, but there is not a very good move. I did not like watching it, and I can never watch it. Why was the Razzie Award for the worst picture ever seen? I would give it 3/10, the only reason I earned 3 was a little good, but it was not good enough.
