Johnathan Frakes is a good actor and a family movie, when a fine director does not rule. However, it should not really direct this movie and the screenplay should not be denied. The director and writers must understand what the original television show is and what the characters are and how it works. The original series, using a good dialogue, has made a few episodes with stylized writing and has never denied the use of American producers in children's programming programs. I would like to say that Tracys is college graduates and some have even smoked alcohol and tobacco! Though the worst people were, there were fatalities. While writing this article, the joint venture of this Universal / Studio Channel would not have had such bad thinking, even if it initially wrote things that were poorly maintained with weak dialogue, kindergarten humor, and a weak structure. <br /> <br /> This movie is almost a blasphemer. When you see the original Supermarionation series, you'll know what I'm talking about! <br /> <br /> The first thing out of the ground was the constant references to the Ford Motor Company, even though Lady Penelope faced with an unprecedented Ford Thunderbird. Considering Mrs. Penelope's station (not being original to the original) , ROLLS-ROYCE FAB-1 feels more appropriate. One of the selected members of the English community preferred the selection of the best car brand in the UK's original series. According to another reviewer, Penelope Ford will not be dead. It's quite right in Ford's idea of ​​driving in Ford. At least the Jaguar Ford car had an English car, so a Jaguar Penelope trip made by FAB 1 could do, but NO! They had to use a flat Ford! However, the Ford product layout does not end there. Every car you see is a Ford! Even the Ford-sponsored TV commercials are sponsored by Ford! Ford, Ford, Ford! The advantage of Ford's cars is that it is an open marketing tool for Ford. <br /> <br /> The original series had a future futuristic design for the 1960s and is still ahead of that day. However, the original series has worked in futuristic design because effort has been made to make the design practical and functional. The film does not have any such stylized treatment and does not mean functionality and practicality. <br /> <br /> Many of the film's designs have not been implemented with style of style, many times, with no sense of function to give it a sense of intelligence. <br /> <br /> The original series brings good performances to talent performances in episodes to eliminate limited speech in puppets. Bright and lively music score by Barry Gray has helped audiences to join audiences when they come together to get stories, characters and super-purpose (a little Stanislavski talk). The film, on the other hand, made a very striking performance. Anthony Edwards mistakenly overplayed Brains, but Jeff Tracy, like Bill Paxton, had not worked for a few good moves, for Hood there was a better choice than Ben Kingsley, and many others would not last too long). Very simply, the puppets were more convincing! Secondly, Hans Zimmer was a very sensitive and unreasonable musical account called "Day of the Day" and "Apollo 13". <br /> And of course, Hood. In the original series, Hood had the ability to communicate with Kyrano through the Kyrano statue and became a way out of the ESP connection. However, his extraordinary ability has come to an end. It is a disguise and deception mystery that allows Thunderbirds tools to gather information for their capabilities (for most, in any case) uncertainty. Although Thudnerbirds tried to steal Thudnerbirds (and Thunderbirds 1 and 2) from the Thunderbird 6 series in the 1960s, he used his weapon for his own defense, including the pistols, and the Supermarionation and the release of the Thunderbirds theater. However, as the victim of International Rescue, Hood is not infallible in every Thunderbirds episode, and it directly interferes with International Rescue. In the film, he is obviously someone else, but he and his cohorts have expanded their ability to control minds, taking into account the ability of Hood's objects to move and to move on for a short period of time. <br /> <br /> This is a character in the Hood's original series, characterized by a person who is laughing and laughing or infuriating his head, or a hacker who is familiar with the series coming out of the theater. <br /> <br /> There are more criticisms, but the 1000 word limit for IMDb maintenance will not allow me to do this. So, I'm going to get closer to the point where I'm not using this movie. In fact, I think this sucks! <br /> <br /> After seeing the original series and Supermarionation films (Thunderbirds Are Go, Thunderbird 6), I was hoping for something better. <br /> <br /> The original Supermarionation was far more advanced and elegant than this lively activity.
