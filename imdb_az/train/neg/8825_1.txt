The only reason I gave this movie a single star was the fact that the latter made me laugh. I generally love the festive horror films in my bad heart, but it was simply not worth it. This is not really a bad surface, it's just a bad surface, it's a weak thing here. Some scenes (like the last one) did not mean to be laughable, but really laughed at loud. There were several times that I thought the film was actually going in an interesting direction, but it should and should not. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
