This movie really made me feel strong, so I signed up for IMDb to warn people. This is patently AWFUL! BUHIN is not meaningful in this film. There are many sub-fields for a start. The character of Josh Hartnett is a post-graduate and yoga teacher, as well as a seemingly alien to his own means, and teaches yoga to hot girls (some of them naked in jacuzzi when returning from work). Additionally, add the fact that his father was killed by a crooked police officer who had been investigated with unhappy prayers. Harrison Ford is trying to sell property on the side of the character, and from time to time lies with the former spouse of the Interior Inspector, who conducts a psychological radio show calling Ford's character. <br /> <br /> <strong> This is cruel. That is what brings me here. Put each book on the clich√© (bartender is examined in a dark stick on a dark day in a heartbeat known as his name, and secondly in internal affairs (why?); Hartnett opposes his father's killer <br /> <br /> As I said, conspiracy is unhappy and there is no sustainability: 1) How do you know where the park is located? How did the hell of repo's children when Ford's car was replaced? Did they pursue him? 2) When Hartnett went to the morgue and only reposted organs (happy by the wind) 3) When the two were arrested and captured, Ford answered his phone and Hartnett made yoga on the table. Instead of taking a Ford phone, the IA boy waits to call each time and then tries to hit the table before Ford. At the same time, all the female HR officer with Hartnett favors him. Then, clearly, both are released without question. 4) Hartnett's car crashes and crashes around Hollywood, but suddenly the car is perfect. Not nail! 5) When a Ford boy entered the building and knew what floor he had come from, he went to the elevator. 6) Ford is trying to conclude a real estate deal while pursuing a bad man in the car of two hartnett. Come on! 7) The bad guy is the most unsatisfactory record exec. Motivation to kill a trusted dancer with his own label? It may leave the tag and warn others to remain loyal to it. But, regardless of how, how will it be possible to sign a new one with this business plan? 8) Why was IA finally arrested in Ford's investigation? No description available! <br /> <br /> Hartnett is able to "take action" to get the bad guy. <br /> <br /> I can continue. Everyone who looks deeper into this film than a straight-line comedy needs to be treated because they are all. There is nothing else! It should not be satirical or ironic. This is just one thing.
