The only payout feature of this movie is the original scenes of death. Besides, this film is a great DUD. We have a beleaguered housewife Kim Basinger, who has been browsing the local shopping center for the first 30 minutes. a movie that does not add anything. Later, he caught a bit of a clash with 4 punks holding two parking spots in this unfortunate xmas house. They attacked the local security guard who was trying to help him. From there, this film gets worse and the road gets worse. I know only one movie and need to go through the stream, but it's only 5 minutes. head start and he can not hide or find someone to help him. Instead, it takes a forest near the bottom half of the unit. Typically, he does everything he can to keep track of his followers easily. But now it turns into a harsh moth. You get the point. In any case, do not buy or rent this movie regardless of how much you love this movie. It's very illogical to question every stage. Basinger and Craig Sheffer, as well as consumers, also embarrass the rest.
