This is the most complex collection of clich√©s on one straight line, despite no evidence or action that is not worthy of action. Canibalising scenes of Star Wars, the Fever of Domination, Godzilla, The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter went for a whole battlefield of visualization. Was this movie good? <br /> <br /> Although it's not so low to be really funny and to achieve religious status as a comedy, the movie offers some laughs. This game is to place the copied scenes in the context of original films. If you compare Gandalf with a cat, how far forward or direct the transgression between the bad manipulator Sauron and Jaja-bing, Korea, the basilisk may be a divine snake. <br /> The following line: Any happiness from this movie depends not on the director / writer, but on the drunkenness and imagination of viewers. Do not cheat you, Shim!
