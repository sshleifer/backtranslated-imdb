Sight, less space, a pretty clever trash. Even Greenaway does not have a better job. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is nothing to recommend this movie; <br /> Of course, anyone who says Ewen MacGregor's work is brilliant is not mine. <br /> <br /> I'm not so sorry about a movie since I've seen Darby O'Gill and Little People!
