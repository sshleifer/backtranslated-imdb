Can I do it until I need it? proves at least a point where everyone can make a movie. Talent is not a care. People who drag the pile of vomiting into the world are not like talent, taste, or intelligence. Purposeful audiences should be newly-labed and have babies playing with their own feces. Everyone would be very wise to make even a smoke on this film. The punchline consists of a series of sophmoric skits that do not even extend explicitly. This ridiculous ends. The legends said that the types of jokes that said they did not know all of the conditions used by elementary children (usually potty or sexually interwoven). You know, about the horse car and my mother's garage. It would be pointless to apply any critical method of criticism, because behavior, writing, direction and ordinary standards have never been heard by creative "minds". Behind this turmoil. The court does not have to decide, but anyone who loves this film should seriously reflect the purpose of this world. <br /> <br />
