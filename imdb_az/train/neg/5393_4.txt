I'm a fan of Shakespeare, and I appreciate that Ken Branak is making a new generation of Shakespeare to the audience. However, this film runs out of the ridiculous music sequence to convey the overall intentions of the game. Let's add that Alicia Silverstoun plays on the dialogue (Keanu Reeves remembers Much Ado about Nothing) and the other weak role, which is a striking endurance to all.
