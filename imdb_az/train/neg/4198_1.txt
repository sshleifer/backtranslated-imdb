I held this Cuban film in an arthouse movie club. It was shortly after the Silly Symphony cartoon in 1935 after agreeing to the island of Jazz with the Symphony Island. The scene in which this old cinema ballroom and the old canvas mud motifs are linked to the flag of Ruby González and the flag of the Cuban have been prepared for the fun cinema and synchronization festivity in Helms-Burton's plot. But the movie started. <br /> <br /> Nada Mas's story has long been promised. Carla is an envelope compressed in the post office of Cuba. Avoiding only his entirely breathtaking existence is to breathe and rewrite the letters, changing the breath of the breath to the Brontëan bursts, changing the basis of the main contact. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <br /> <br> /> Marx's brothers have a rifle and even - especially during the unseemly editing tricks - after a cellular fracture of a school defect on a character. <br /> <br /> There are many single-dimensional characters. Cunda, post office manager, humorous dominatrix-nosferatu. His boss-eyed conspirator, Concha, shows various fingers, ears and cries. Cesar, the metalhead doll and romantic interest discovered the secret writing ability when Carla went off for Miami. A sad scene (very excited, fast forward) is thrown out for a good measure. <br /> <br /> Some of Nadia Mas's "Stad" Amelie's quirky-heroine-matchmakes-strangers and "Il Postino" a great redeemer of poetry. "Like Amelie, her protagonist is an eccentric single lady who struggles to anticipate the spinsterdom of the stranger's life, and like Il Postino, the film does not dwell on the continuous recitals of poems, and a bicycle postman gets into a romantic structure. Unfortunately, Nada Mas is unable to deal with the inimitable and unobtrusive nature of any movie. <br /> <br /> This film has two things to watch on TV night and day: First, a slogan that cuts the crossword puzzle of Carla, The second is to look at Nada Mas as a careful example: our message, Cuban performance, and the Buena Vista Social Club's decision have often brought us This film can not be globally deserved - the waiting list and films like Guantanamera cover the subject area much closer to the subject than the bongo soundtrack.
