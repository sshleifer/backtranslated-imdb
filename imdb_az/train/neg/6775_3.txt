This film is a local video library - a comedy dedicated to Cary Grant, to director Stanley Howe, how glad not to dislike so far? I have a movie that deals with two things - all of them (including some well-known names) have realized that they have a Turkishman in their hands, and what is the worst thing among many controversial aspects? Still, I think, but my last votes are sometimes an ambitious script, an uncertain tone, a lack of consistent and advanced character, and a lack of link between characters. We need to add a lot of criticism to criticisms, but we can understand that actors are fighting these things and at the same time preparing for the trainings. Often often they can make their own lines faster. Cary Grant tries to describe the usual charming and characteristic personality, but sometimes it appears invisible and staccato in his lack. But I have to say that the initial suggestions were relieved when he could connect with Suzy Parker's appearance with vulgar Jayne Mansfield, which was not understood by his character. What do you like about the movie? - For me, Parker's beauty is also limited, and Grace acts as dearly as Kelly. Generally, it's nice to look at the movie. The sea symbols are very clever in their uniforms - but they really need to be surprised by the pink brown Fu Manchu tunic in their luxury suite. Even Grant can not seem its elegant. On the credit line, Ray Walston is doing a great job with his character, and for me, there was an interest in talking without Hogan's heroes Werner Klemperer without a German accent!
