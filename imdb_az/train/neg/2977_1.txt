Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /> Administrators: Many Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei. Cast: Ottaviano DellAququa, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br>> And this start is really Dawn of the Dead Romans. After leaving Dawn 79, Lucio Fulci decided to give him an indirect sequence and call it Zombie 2. This movie is something we know as straight ole zombie. You know something that fights with the Zombie Shark! OK, after the whistle (after the Zombie 2 in Italy), the Italians decided after collecting big money. Allows more zombie screams! These are made of dough! So Zombie was born 3. Still confused? Return to Living Dead, this one story is a rehash of stories I've seen so many American zombie fliks that we've seen before, come to mind. Look ... The government is testing a toxic gas that turns people into zombies. Canister is released to the general population and to the heel! Envy zombies for human flesh. A group begins to escape from the zombie and dropped to an old abandoned hotel. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of difficulty in filming this movie. First of all, Lucio Fulci was ill from his beloved husband from Italy. So she did not finish this movie as she wanted. The film was then delivered to two smaller directors, Bruno Mattei (Living Dead Hell) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They have done their best to decorate a movie that is not already good. You see that Fulci does not really have the heart and soul in this nakedness. He agreed with that. He gave the producers a flick, and said, "Do what you want with hell!" <br /> <br /> Therefore, ladies and girls resemble the great Fulci, known as our "director." In my opinion the main problem is its such a delusional blockage! There is no item! After the first few minutes the terrorists have stolen toxic gases and accidentally released, the rest of the flutter is a very empty, empty symbol without any identities escaping zombies. <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: !! As some eagles are infected with gas and are attacking people, there are some There is also a scene that covers a flying zombie head (in that sense it opposes all logic and explanations) and a scene from the abandoned hotel pool and a zombie that backs a weak girl foot, but besides, another trail <br /> <br /> It is infinite with infinite scenes that have not done anything to make an inaccessible part of the body that is already invisible.It was my main concern with this whistle, the devices seem to be unfinished and the direction of art is practically non-existent - If everything seems to be so damn, I hate it! I love b-films, but it's really like it! <br /> <br /> <b "Zombi" Pure Shit. The Zombie is all Asian actors (film shot in the Philippines), so get a bunch of zombies looking for Asia. However, there is no big problem for the film being settled on the Philippine islands. Indeed, the suit is zombie appearance! They died for the same reason. What happens to the zombie is a black group (more like a stain) on their faces. One or two zombies had a slightly more complicated look, but it was still not good enough to regret it. It only lacks a goo set that is spirited by actors. So, this whip is slowly paced, and zombies look like shit. These are the dead people! Anyhows, a Fulci flick does not come to expect the usual coolness here waiting for, it basically causes someone else's flick. And these two (Mattei and Fragasso) did not really put their heart and spirits on the participants. In fact, when he sees attachments on the DVD, Fragasson does not even consider it serious when asked about his feelings about the reminders and the squabble here. She is ashamed of it and in many cases says "doing just one job and doing it". And these friends, this is the last nail to the flick. There is no love, and it is not heartfelt. <br /> <br /> So you get a half an ass, you get an unhappy zombie crunch. <br /> <br /> For people who just want to see or see just about every zombie plug. Do not worry about anyone! Rating: 1 out of 5
