Creature Unknown is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Unknown Film. This movie is a part of the right from the beginning. It's really stupid "structure", really sad, "moving" and so has "special effects". <br /> <br /> Some thirty years ago, "post-teens", hiding in the trees, the horrible, rebellious, rubber suit has been infinitely rooted. What this movie is about is a speech and a little less action. There are girls in the forest who tell you, and then the guys who speak the tree (with heavy mask). <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> When it is seen, the picture shows that a person is in a suit and that the movement is a suit, so the blurred image and distortion of the reason for distortion distorts. <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie ever since, and those who can be praised have actually pulled out of the street to make "action" in this really stunning movie. So take a certain jumper!
