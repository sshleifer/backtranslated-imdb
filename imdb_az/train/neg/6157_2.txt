Yikes was one of those sleepless nights where I surfed these channels and jumped to this stinker of a movie. For some titles in the cast, I'd expect a better movie. I'm almost embarrassed to see Oscar Winner F. Murray embracing such a terrible part of Ibrahim. I hope the money is worth it. The disciples spoke about the sword as they spoke about living in a war or a terrible disaster. I would like to say that it was a fun, but never so intense. The only reason I watched all of this movie was because I was so afraid to get away from it and to get it back.
