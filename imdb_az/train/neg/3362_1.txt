Haunting is a great horror on shadow-free special effects and screenshots, and maybe with no exceptional quality except cinematography. Perhaps the remakes are not bad at all, but relies on Jion Da Bontun is definitely. I suppose that A-List actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson) have to get us out of the boring scene, funny special effects and terrible attempts to scare the audience, but this is not a tabloid magazine, We do not care about two rules about stories and stories about heroes. Storyline is about using the layout of the film "The Haunting Of Hill House" and removing the four chapters, and then using the film as well as many and unexplained.The characters are pretty thin and the toys are good while you really care about any characters all.Lily Taylor she does a terrific performance and sounds like 8 years Lily Taylor is not prepared for all horror genres. The spirits are foolish and cheesy, they look like Casper-friendly Ghost, and the dreams of the crooks resemble one another. Hugh Cain looks like an oily man dressed as a charming costume for Halloween with a smoke car. There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms with a giant purple mouth, and it is not only sadly sadly sad. beautiful and good way though it is a good thing about this movie, but it does not save anything else from its cruelty. I honestly felt like watching my watching time, but I was paying to see it, but fortunately, Scream Channel.Overall would have been more pi $$. Haunting is a boring remake that tries to strangle you with poor special effects, a poor attempt to horror.
