Although he was in the "Ivy League" college, he was actually shot at Flagstaff's Northern Arizona University in the fall of 1976. There I went to the theater department, and then there were members of the theater department. <br /> <br /> In this movie (if you know Arizona geography), there's a strange scene that shows up to a few biking players from college to one stream. We know NAU'ers that the campus and the valley (actually Oak Creek Canyon) are about 35 miles away, and if the trip is all down, it's absolutely impossible to ride a bike back to the same road!
