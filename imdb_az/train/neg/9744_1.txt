This is one of the worst things to get out of England, so it says a lot. Tension is unbelievable even when it comes to finding Lembach's presence. She is looking for a good secretary Sheila after a long time after being captured by Dr. Rat Face for a picnic table print dress. Some of this movie is good, though there are several reviews in London. In addition, there is a point where there is almost a car accident that reduces the heart rate down the normal level. There is also an hour of teleportation and parallel to the "Eighth Sense" horror, which is frightened by the woman's fear, which is only dull and English. Add a strange weapon battle between the British police and Dr. Rat, and do not give any results, plus many people have an electrocardiogram, a cat, and a single ... ummm ... An English movie. The MST3K version is pretty good, though there are not the best of them.
