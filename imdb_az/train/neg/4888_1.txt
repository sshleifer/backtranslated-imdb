Nick Millard aka Nick Phillips, 10 years before the divine time and effort, remained alone as a "Criminal Insane". In fact, although the "Criminal Man" was less than an hour, he probably had been cured for wanting to get out of the story line ... despite the fact that the TON original retirement loan was returned to him, images from the original! Unfortunately, returning Priscilla Alden, who was rapidly aging, did not save that. The smaller the original images in this flick, with a rented video camera! If this movie cost more than $ 100, I would be surprised and would be astonished if it did something close to that amount! Avoid this and watch the original instead!
