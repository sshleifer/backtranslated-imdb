Why do filmmakers make this movie? <br /> <br /> The 1972 movie with McQueen and McGraw is almost classic. Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor and Baldwin was just an inadequate actor. He has no ambition in his game. The move to the original Getaway was fantastic. But remake has no action! <br /> <br /> The filmmaking in 1972, though difficult since 1994, is almost annoying. <br /> <br /> I do not understand Baldwin's arrest in Mexico. I think this story is a mistake. <br /> <br /> I think that if it did not have to rebuild it, or if it decided to re-build a classic, it would have to be an excellent player for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt.
