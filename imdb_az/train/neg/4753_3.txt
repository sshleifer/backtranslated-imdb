Director F.V. Murnau remains clever in a quiet, well-lit, environmentally friendly movie environment that covers the story of the native island life in the South Sea. The documentary style works very well for the first half of the film. The landscapes are beautiful, it is interesting to watch the island's daily life activity. The film gets accelerated when the two aggressive lover begins to concentrate more on the story story. Although well managed by Murnau, the story story will not be interesting. The Academy Award for Best Cinematography, though the prize must be for the best scenery. You can not really attract the DP to get such a beautiful place.
