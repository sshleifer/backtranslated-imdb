Last weekend, I bought this zombie movie bargain and watched with some of my comrades thinking that it would be a budget version of the Land of the Dead. <br /> Boy, I made a mistake. <br /> <br /> In some ways, it seems that they spend a good portion of the budget on the coating art that misleads the admirers of the zombie genre. <br /> <br /> Get the car with some yuppie in the middle of the zombie barefoot where the barefoot comes alive and speaking on a mobile phone at work. One of the girls is talking to the boy before they die. <br /> <br /> Some people really think this is "very bad, good", they are lying. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I did not finish the film, but one of the other investigations at the end of the film is actually a police officer > It's worse than the Zombiez! WATCH!
