I thought that I would never find the fear movie as "the return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre," but this film was competing with it. <br /> <br /> I'm not the one I went to sleep I watched a movie but did it 15 minutes after the Trance started. I woke up, I started watching agian. Why did I deserve this? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> All films were tortured. I think that the director had a favor or really needed money, because the film was destroyed after the film; <br /> <br /> What is unkind, fraudulent, terrible is character (but I love something that Jared Harris has played), the effects are very poor, there is no death and blood, and so on. In three words, there is something. And I said that. Do not worry that a director can not shoot a movie like this. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when I see the movie, I'm more disappointed with the movie, Stephen King, I think I can never get this crack, is not it? (I rented in Argentina). <br /> <br /> I will bring this movie from 10 to 2. (As I said in the view of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre return, movies that are always bad will cost 1 to 10)
