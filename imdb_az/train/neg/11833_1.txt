So I do not think about rent from this store because it's hell of a bad movie. You thought JJ Abrahams wrote this movie. Basically, a rice is washed in a toilet and is forced to return in some way. A completely shocked "Shrek" admirer can enjoy, but Wallace & Gromit fans will turn away from passion. Besides, why did not they do it in plastic or clay? That is, CGI animation? For AARDMAN movie? !! Obviously, Aarman has been in danger around doing all the work of Dreamworks. Wrong, wrong, wrong! Almost every character is just like a horrible frog boy, a survivor of a movie. But everything about the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL! It's almost a dream that I'm bored with watching this movie. No, wait, in fact, I was lying in the boredom of watching this movie. Just horrible. But fortunately, it's not as bad as Shrek.
