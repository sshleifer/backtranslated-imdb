This film is a religious phenomenon that promotes classic Hinduism and New Age Occultism, adorned with Western descriptions to be washed by those who are ignorant of basic religious comparisons. The main tenants of Hinduism are reincarnation elements. (Some characters are reincarnated explicitly, both now and in the 1600s). God is an unmatched force. Animal life and plant life are identical. (This is pantheism). Redfield is trying to mix Eastern Mysticism with Western Christianity. The syndicate attempt can deceive or amaze those who do not seek the truth, but this film is a weak excuse for any final truth. When advertising on the Old Berkeley Barb $ 10.00 tells you how to open your own religion. A famous prophet said, "Use Force Luke."
