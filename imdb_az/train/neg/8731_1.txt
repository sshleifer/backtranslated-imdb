Is it possible to score the lowest score? This is shame. Indeed, I'm going to the IMDb lobby for a "zero star" option. This gives a lot of opportunity to give the film a single star. Do I just watch the cigarette lighter on the hopper head? and not acting, or not? When it comes to casting, the cast was seen as a talent. My younger brother's primary school talent show more sense and depth of emotion. and these fake Irish sheets were nails on a chalkboard board. it would be the only thing that could make this film worse ... oh, wait, no, it's as bad as it is now.
