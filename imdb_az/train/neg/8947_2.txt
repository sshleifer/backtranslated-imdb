The book is fantastic, it's not a movie. There was no reason for this film to accept the book's futuristic vision. Hell, after a few years, the entire recall was freed and a one-hour work released in the 1970s did a good job to make an orange a futuristic world. The sad German expressionist colors, the black and white images coming from the vision screens, have no reason for this approach when the film was shot in 1984. The main character is in the white-colored writing, but he and the oil in a garage. This film has decided to approach a communism to design, atmosphere and theme, but the novel has not necessarily reflected on the subject of a communist, worship-submissive worker. This book should be seriously aligned in a contemporary context, because this book is so far more appropriate. This shit could not watch for more than 20 minutes. The soundtrack is annoying, frustrating, and it seems that this film is for denying the feeling of realism or convictions when there is the accuracy required to convey the message to the viewer.
