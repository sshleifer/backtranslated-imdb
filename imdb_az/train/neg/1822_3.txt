Greetings from the darkness again. What happened to the great Barry Levinson? He ruled out two of my favorite favorites in Avalon and Diner. There were also some nice films ("Rainman"), but always provided something of interest ... so far. The worst thing I can say about a comedy is that it's boring. "Envy" drill definition. Never was the biggest admirer of clean rifles ("Dumb and Dumber") ever wondered how terrifying this film was. In all things, maybe 2 chips - if you pay attention. The best part of the movie is the fugitive headline of a Redbone unity. It would be unbearable if the film was written in a song. Rachel Weisz is a great actress and I want to make a comedy (and even Julianne Moore), but I understand that the real world has revealed some weaknesses. SNL cast member Amy Poehler is not his usual on his role as the romantic park turned trash prince. The film's disaster is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. When the first work comes together, some promises turn off, but after that chemistry disappears because of poor scripts. This script looks like most Jack Black's ideas - not a bad idea, but a hope for success.
