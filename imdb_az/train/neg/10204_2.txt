Initially, the film had done a great job, the characters set the profiles ... the plot would come in the right direction ... but the development of the movie seemed to have directed the director to something wrong. .. many things have been edited from the movie. The identity of the heroes worsened in the film. Also, many words were meaningless - in other words, the film was invisible to the movies. And the name ... the title in the movie did not fit anywhere ... I say that the title works for the front view ... The actors were good at what they did ..... If a better manager would be a writer, maybe that would work better. But he did not. Now this is a new horrible film that came out on Friday ... My opinion! .... do not waste your time or money.
