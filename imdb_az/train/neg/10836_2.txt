Magnolia is a spectacular, stunning, showcase that adds little to nothing. Like the Eyes Wide Shut, Magnolia is a series of episodes with no disturbance. The camera turns away from corridors and corridors, glows sad symbols. What is the reason for caring for these people? The general theme is the people who forgive many things that can not be cared for by others (except John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters) or are self-destructive flowers that are split or dead. He reminded me of how much I liked the Glitter for the lifeless monster of his father, Armin Mueller-Stahl. <br /> <br /> There is nothing about Magnolia after a few days. Paul Thomas Anderson left his thoughts and leaped onto his canvas. The bomb has two ideas, especially. Both appear at the last hour of this 188-minute film. Aimee Mann's coffin has each one of the folks singing a song from one character to another. Sweet, but ineffective, because they are not like each other. <br /> <br /> Magnolia has a great player. According to Magnolia, it is not completely unexpected and absolutely ridiculous. Especially Tom Kruis, who did not know that he was in the performance. And the best and really good police in the next memory are perhaps John C. Reilly. But all these things go up to nothing. When a hidden surprise happened, a girl behind me could not hold it in the theater any more and it was "stupid!" He said. It's a movie that most of my emotions can come to agreement.
