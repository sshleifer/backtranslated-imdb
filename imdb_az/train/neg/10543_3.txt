The First Power is really the only thing that's going to happen, allowing Jeff Kober to play one of the different types of psychic sneakers who have done a very good job over the last 25 years. <br /> <br /> Kober is a worthy successor to Lyle Bettger, who specializes in these areas for over fifty years. <br /> <br /> But not enough, First Power is a desperate flick of Lou Diamond Phillips, the first LAPD detective, with a specialty of catching serial killers. Kober is his last position, but Kober remains less in league and makes his life difficult for Lou. <br /> <br /> After perfection, after Kobe's gas box is given, his spirit returns to every word. <br /> <br /> Mykelti Williamson, a supporter of Louin, helps Lou as a nun with Tracy Griffithi psychology and Elizabeth Arlen's insights. <br /> <br /> When you finish the movie, you're no longer in trouble. Lou really was stranded in Turkey. Perhaps the devil did this movie.
