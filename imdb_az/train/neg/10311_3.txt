SPOILER ALERT In this common and unforgettable action movie, Lorenzo Lamas takes the usual tough guy / favorite boy's movement and its future real life is Kathleen Kinmont, ass chick Alexa cast ass. OJ Simpson accuses a public official of his own. Translation: cable TV filler. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The best / the worst moments: In an error scene, OJ's partner expresses his hatred to the morgue. OJ reported that some bodies were too hot or responded to these words. This indefinite necrophilia reference is very insulting; but in the light of the killings that were shortly after the release of the movie, this is really terrifying and therefore unexpected, terrifying. I thought I was laughing until the champagne came out of my nose. Now it is a sinful pleasure. BC
