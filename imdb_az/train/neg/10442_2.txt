Beyond all internet buzz, this movie was terrible. I expected the movie to be something more than anything. Instead, filmmakers have tried to make a serious tension / horror movie, and have completely missed it. There were several good parts and several good lines by Samuel Jackson. In addition, it was a bunch of snarls and some weak animated snakes. All the jokes of the Internet were better than the actual movie. Now the movie really came out, hopefully this joke will die. Do not waste your time or money over excessive waste. If you're looking for something funny and entertaining, just go to Snakes in a Blog.
