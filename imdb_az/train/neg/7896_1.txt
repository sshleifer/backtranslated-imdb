I'm sure why this movie seems to have gotten rave reviews. <br /> <br /> While watching TV on a "Bang" night, I was bored with an absurd, casual area that had been happening on the screen. The part of the whole movie filmmaker seems to be something other than a trivial, artsy-fartsy self-restraint. The director / writer goes on with a nickname, which only reinforces this sense of implication. Those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better and I would dared say when this full waste is more entertaining.
