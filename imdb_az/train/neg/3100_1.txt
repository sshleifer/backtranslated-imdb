Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... Where should I start? <br /> <br /> This movie runs for Manos - Talas Hands and the Future War, the worst movie for the money. It's fun to laugh at where Manosi is painful to watch. Hobgoblins will end up in a single capsule as a perfect film to describe the term: "80's cheeze". I'm betraying (and I use this term freely), the Hobboblins are the worst puppets you can see and believe in the battle of garden vehicles. The film was the perfect tool for MST3K, and this version is the only way to watch this mess. This film gives Mike and his boots a large number of ammunition. If you are trying to watch Mike and bots without it ..... God helps you!
