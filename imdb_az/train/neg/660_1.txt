I can not even begin to describe how sad the film is. Do not get me wrong, I did not expect to start long ago. Let's say, a PG-13 slasher fracture is predetermined which is missing ummm ... is intensified, so no one should be surprised by the lack of eyes. But in all other aspects of this film, it's the level of stinginess and clich√© that really distracts me. <br /> <br /> You just have a completely useless hero, because you find yourself the root of a bad man. And here's a turn of books ... THESE IS NO EVER - this is the cardinal rule breakdown of key screenshots - character development. If you think up to the end of this movie, the poor little girl will turn around and finally, you have to hear and re-think a few times. <br /> <br /> On top of that, we will give every kind of killer to the least interested (and, of course, least scary). <br /> <br /> As a result, the potential for tension or benevolence is dramatically eradicated (and, of course, a thirteen-year-old), possibly what can she do to fill the 2-hour display time? <br /> <br /> Closets, this is what it is. <br /> <br /> Some things and many toilets: big toilets, small toilets, mirrored toilets, up to the streets of Narnia, many curses, do not want to wear yourself for another year. In fact, this film should be called only "CLOSET" and has a great fear of a coathanger in DVD. Behind him, he could have a picture of the dreamed audience and Roger and Ebert's offer: "f * @ has just fallen as we watch what we do!"
