It was better than the middle movie I thought because it was in the cables. I love the melodrama lines and Christmas Rush or the First Daughter / Target / Shot and so on. I was expecting some sort of bad effects in the classics. The mill was well chosen ... I particularly liked Ron Livingston as a hard-pressed SWAT commander. It is good to re-examine the same substance as those who are very fond of brothers. Producers and designers gave their homework because all scenes and shots appeared in 1997. <br /> <br /> So if you have the chance to see this movie and I am sure that the FX will come back 50 times to everything. Take 2 hours and enjoy it.
