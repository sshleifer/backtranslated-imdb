SciFi has had a very bad luck in making quality movies (like Minotaur or Dog Soldiers) lately. Grendel laid the foundations of the great composer Beowulf, but there are so many things that television commercials might call "the definitive Christopher Lambert movie" (and so little offers). I did not expect it to be as accurate as the production of fully blown Hollywood, but I did not expect the "artistic integrity" to interfere with the true story (even if it was a good way for a couple of hours to streamline the flow of story). <br /> <br /> Do you have any ideas (did any research begin?). Undoubtedly, I can say that Beowulf and his crew (except for jeans) are massive horned helmets. Grendel had a lot of looks, though Beowulf had to rely on him, something he was not sixteen feet tall and 2 tons tall. Grendel's death was also in short supply? In my opinion, those in the epic were better than scripts made of script; For example: Should Grendel's arm be disassembled by Beowulf? After being shot with an arrow thrown into a visible crucifix weighing 300 lb did not cut it in front of the arm! And Grendel's mother combined her with the dragon's epic end when she succumbs those who created it? And honestly, what was hell with this mullet? <br /> <br /> You want to see this movie because it does not have anything to do with the epic, because it's not really one (except for the symbol names). Do you like the only way I can recommend this movie, the Druids movie (directed by Jacques Dorfmann)? though I do not recommend watching.
