For some reason, the CBS local branch in New York in the late 1970's and early 80's played this movie on Fridays or Saturdays, generally at night 2 or several times a couple of years. This is a sequence of films, because it is really amazing to watch and look strange (see other analyzes for specific story information). Anyway, after catching on those days several times before cable television (and even after programming all night), we held this little oddness. After many years, I decided to find out if I could find him on the DVD. As a whole, Brentwood Video, as part of a 4-pack film (4 movies on 2 double-sided discs), is "pretty bad, Alien Worlds" for everyone. It is usually less than $ 10 when shopping around, often less. The other 3 films on this set are available in many other collections of public domains, so there is no need to comment here. But I did not see "Eyes" elsewhere. Despite the "unredeemed" version in any way, this minute lasts exactly 92 minutes, so the IMDb's 90-minute operating time is incorrect. Even with a 92-minute working time, a movie that has been dubbed into English from another language is not uncommon, and some end up working. If it is not important to the story, it sometimes seems like a common budget-conscience practice to earn money without worrying about the scenes. Will a longer version make any less confusing? Who knows, you do not see it in your mother tongue ... By the way, my attempts to watch it during the day do not work, and I'm simply connecting it. Only in the middle of the night, which corresponds to this film, there is something that's watching ... maybe this is just my previous experience?
