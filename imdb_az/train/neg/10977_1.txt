I live in Ottawa where this film is released and I really wish it did not do it. This is a terrible flicker from God. Although I have really tried and supported independent films, there is still a stigma that is bound to everything, and this stigma: Indie Films Blow. Well, this movie has nothing to do with this curse. The actor, writer, director does little to avoid contributing to the genre of Brett Kelly, but retains the stereotypes tired of past films. I'm really tired of the bad looking characters that are hiding in the shadows and never duped under any doubts, which is too late. <br /> <br /> I remember the scene, especially near the end of the flickering spot where the whole scene is lit by car lights. Now, some people may say that it was used to create a mood and tension, but unfortunately, it was a tough budget to show. Also for a charming movie to call itself horror, a tracer can hardly find solid particles to find the actual sophisticated syrup and some other colorful colorful eating scenes. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing about dragging this movie is the lack of pacing and character development, the main conspiracy is to kidnap children, and parents should tell their Bonesetter spouse some time before taking back their children. This concept does not remind me, but I really do not believe that the two main characters can find time to meet each other when they both lose their children. It's not something that is not done in such a short time, but my first priority is to get back to my daughter and get to know her at least before getting to know her. <br /> <br /> I have my final point .... and I will not hold it against Kelly, but the film is filmed with a totally boring, emotionless video and really gets away from any tense moments. it would have just shown the style of the film. This movie made a million dollar makeup and could not save this movie to correct the story and save everything and destroy it. My hope is something to be avoided later on in a later meeting, as reported on Brett Kelly's website. <br /> <br /> Our lord helps us all.
