Well, I finally saw it. When I left for the first time I did not go because I was scared. He is afraid of how bad he is or how disappointing he is. <br /> <br /> Although it's not as bad as the sight and is better than Clones, it was not particularly memorable or unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> I was 11 when I saw Star Wars. I still do not remember to live in the theater. The last film credits that I could never forget was the experience. An exciting story of a dying farm boy, who knows how prince and galaxy can better escape the danger of being mentored by a clever magician, cunning pirate and various comic reliefs - together, using Lucas's old formula not to punish. Since it works, there is an old formula. <br /> Then Empire came and the story was more than just a tale. He went into the darkness and we learned one of the greatest films of all time. The great villain Vader was the father of Luka. Wow, no one has ever seen it. Of course, I'm sure Lucas did not do that before appearing in this scenario. Go back and follow Star Wars again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Caucasus Revenge is a fun movie - great effects, lots of action, some good fight scenes. But a movie still lives or dies in its lifetime, "she says. But, of course, it can save a well-functioning weakness, but a weak plan combined with a bad act - it's not a burden but that any director can not win, of course, by George Lucas <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Oh my. Understand that it is an obstacle for what happened in the first two films, an incredible burden. <br /> <br /> Firstly, we have absurdities in the background. Anakin's "Tatooine" was found as a "chosen" child, a virginal, delicate birth product. Well, this detail can never be explained remotely. Indeed, the closest explanation is that Yoda may be inaccurate. Well, then good. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> Now this jungle is the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence. And will he return to Tatooine and never know that he is there? Amazing! Wow! How about that. There is a ceasefire stopping test who wants old, eh George? In any case, we have this dark boy, a moody, petulant, who has to become one of the greatest cunning in history of this kinematic - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - a good man from grace, finally to achieve <br /> What is it, pray, this happens? Why does her husband have a dream to die? Now, I'm sure he's living in a civilized, starry world, but he's probably a "dark one," probably a doctor, maybe this futuristic society is something about this problem? Why not, not just something you can think of is to kill some children. Because the evil man said that in the root of all the evil that you have followed for two films, there is the secret of immortality. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Everyone cares about us can Hell, why do they want this brat to be saved or bought first? <br /> <br /> I did not want Kenobi to kill him because he was not bad, but because he was foolish. <br /> But Amidala is finally dying. At birth. Why? Yes, they do not. The physiologist, who is a droid who demonstrates incredibly high technology for the development of this society, offers the result "only if he has the will to live". Of course, oh, of course there is. <br /> <br /> Therefore, we have a Kenobi presentation for all of this. He knows the birth of Luke and Leah. He knows who his father is and what he is doing. Both R2 and C3PO know the role. For a few years, Luke has been saying that for a few years, 3PO and R2 (with curiosity, the 3PO is deleted from the mind, but not R2 - why?) "I think these droids belong to you," Kenobi said, the protocol droid's "selected" I do not recall that I was not strangely aware that the emperor was himself a rebel and that he was built by a man on this planet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> Unfortunately, the story has started to disappear from controlling VAder as an ancestor of Luka because the story is not part of the episode 1-3 is simply unclear Palpatine has done nothing in rational sense <br /> <br /> This is a subsequent event and it looks like this. <br /> <br /> I can not give a high rating to this movie, which reminds me of Triple Xi, an entertaining movie to watch but it's totally unforgettable. will stay Fortunately, both of these and previous two will soon be fade.
