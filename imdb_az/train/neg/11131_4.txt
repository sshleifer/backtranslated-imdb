First, I agree with Mr. Chomsky's frustration. From an interactive point of view, his goal is to make a person's university campus uneasy. He goes through unpleasant, dissatisfied, practical. <br /> <br /> He is a wife. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus is the essence of the film itself. In fact, I am not a documentary, but rather a collection of conversations. Watching the "Rebel Without Pause" is not the same as watching a speaker at CSPAN in the 3rd band segment. There are no camera motions, adjustments, style touches. There is no story, no story. <br /> <br /> Technically, production is totally amateur. Audio is terrible and contradictory; Sometimes we will not hear Noam talking, and we will not hear questions from other participants. Noam is rarely allowed to see the reactions of the audience, but every time her spouse visits his spouse with a sense of humor and consciousness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 stars ... and today I live in a generous mood.
