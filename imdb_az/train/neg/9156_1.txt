Me and Arthur were 10 years old. Sam Mroovic wrote, directed, watched and drew this movie. Sam was a good writer, had to give the director an idea and let the actor go. a good example of a person who controls all production. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it's not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, work with actors. <br /> <br /> This film is very bad, and I think Sam Mroovic is similar to a chair and has been prepared to watch this movie twice. Acting and direction was very bad, this movie became a comedy. it was just ridiculous and wrong places. <br /> <br /> The second good point .... would make this a great historic film. After the first two minutes, you have been watching the film and paying more attention to your history.
