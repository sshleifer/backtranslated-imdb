When I go, I have to admit that I am a great fan of Bon Jovi. Actually, I was first put into a DVD. <br /> <br /> But this is not a good half. <br /> <br /> Even Jon could not save this movie for me. My main problem is not just scary. Notwithstanding Derek Bliss, none of the other characters are impressive, and you will not be able to care less about the annoying vampire / drug addiction woman, whether they are immortal or not. Women's vampires are not just scary or sexual. On the contrary, anorexia looks like 14 years old girl, so hopeless for blood. Another big problem is that everything is just too bright. There is no atmosphere or fear. I know that the first vampires set up in New Mexico do not have a full bumps in terms of heart tolerance, but I still have to be dark and able to stay in the foreground when needed. There is no such tension in this film. <br /> <br /> This story is similar to the previous one. The vampire wants Berzin's cross to go daylight. However, the story has less cool times this time. All master master - no woe factor in knowing that he is an original vampire as in the first movie. Do not really care who or what it is. The masters have no army. <br /> <br /> Therefore, he hides a few old ruins that appear to be more of a Disneyland charm then a creepy temple. So there really is. Lack of fear, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting story. Indeed down for me personally.
