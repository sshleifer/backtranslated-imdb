I actually watched the night last night and usually delayed the film, though it's usually delayed. Even though I tried, I could not endure this movie, but it got worse as the movie went. I know that I'm thinking of being a comedy, but I'm not very funny. This was particularly striking illustrations of non-realist and rural life. If you think that any of you is like a country life, that is not necessarily. I have to agree that some gamers were cute, but the French man was really fake. I have to agree that I'm trying to teach a good lesson in the story, but in general I would recommend that no one over the age of 8 will watch it, and it is very dissatisfied.
