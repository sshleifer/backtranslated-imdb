I can not stand this show! Is there even a paid quality, a funny punchline, or a "plot line" that the average viewer does not want to strangle himself in a bowl of maize fungus? <br /> Sounds. Oh, these terrible, unhappy sounds. It is like his ability for each character, compassion, and nasal vocal to slide on a dusty board several times from a nice cutlery. <br /> <br /> Cosmo sounds like a screaming mongrel, Vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew and Timmy's grandfather hosts a game show (Guy Smiley comes to mind "Sesame Street") every line sound like a bad personalization is. <br /> <br / Animation is awful; even the "Yu-Gi-Oh!" producers. laugh at this show with a very bad work. Each character has three dimensions for a big head for teeth, square head or body. And with every single line of symbols you speak extensively and compassionily, do you think you want to take a photo with the president? It is true that every character in the show is completely moronic. Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson and Buddy Lembeck have been described as such a tale since the subtle grace of Charles Charge. It is usually synonymous with "unreal" "unfunny" and this is definitely the case here. <br /> <br /> Since Naked Gun 33 1/3, so many clich√©s based on cloutlessness have been nothing ... at least Leslie Nielson was also good. <br /> <br /> Finally, and each episode is equal, spoiler warning is a great time here): Timmy wants something with two "Saints Oddparents", something goes wrong, can not immediately get back to the lesson and one reason and then everything looks fine in the end. Oh, and one side note, Timmy does not believe her parents complained about Vicky and they continue to work on her every opportunity. Maybe it's just me, but it seems that a child show contains a message that does not have a good thing to say to a pretty insulting nanny, it's probably not a good idea. <br /> <br /> If you're writing a story and want to give an example of how far the quality of animated films is, the "Stable Odd Parents" should be a great place to start. A major example of television producers is that they focus on little or no effort, since they know someone can watch somewhere.
