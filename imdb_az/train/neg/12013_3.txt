I did not believe that any movie with Poltergeist would be good. In fact, it's okay, but you know that the movie you are watching on the first crime scene is a movie in a movie. There are people sitting in the movie theater watching the movie. A girl in the audience would turn me around and be so bored that she could bite her. It's a bit odd, but far from good.
