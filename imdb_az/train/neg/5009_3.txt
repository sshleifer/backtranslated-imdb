This was the worst movie I ever saw. The field did not make much sense and the player was sad. I think I'm a great admirer of Amber Benson, usually I think it's a great actress, I can not imagine why he decided to make that movie. His character, Piper, is drunk for almost all movies, except for the opening scene. Moreover, there were many points in the movie that the player was very bad, and I laughed really loud. Nevertheless, I do not recommend this movie to everyone. Only 80 minutes, but 80 minutes of your life will be completely wasted.
