How difficult is it to write a movie that is watched by Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? It seems very difficult for the writers here. <br /> <br /> I still have no idea how young Santa is and Vince (BIG brother playing) has no better idea of ​​the 20 year old. I have to miss this part of the story, but in fact it is not really important. Many scenes were laughing and laughing; <br /> <br /> The commission director / producer tried to cross the "tear" that would end. <br /> <br /> Good, great disappointment. I can see how some people can use this meal because many people will get any garbage they need, but I'm looking forward to the DVD. Your family is not worth $ 23,978 to buy movies today.
