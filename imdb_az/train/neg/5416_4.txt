It was a third effort by Von Stroke, a director, and it did not show any of the exceptional passion for a camera and editing mastery that she would show with masterworks, GREED and WEDDING MARCH in a few years. In fact, we have a grifter triangle masked by two Russian princesses who rent Russian literature and a villa in Monte Carlo. Their goal is to use counterfeit money on gambling tables and earn a living. Part of the plan is the "Count" form (von Stroxem) to make sure that the American ambassador traveling with him and his "foolish" spouse hopes to earn a bit more money by playing with his weaknesses. He is making a mistake by taking the lifestyle of a servant who promises to get married. Looking at each other, they look at the room with fire (von Stroxem and his hunt on the balcony of the room). Here, von Stroem first builds his identity as "a man who hates". He is absolutely evil and his character deficit ultimately ends with a very bad and worthy end. The movie is not as good as cinematography and editing unless the director is surprised. When the Ambassador attempts to meet his wife, he reads a book - we see Eric von Stroxem by FOOLISH WIVES. It was originally designed as a 210-minute movie, reduced to 140 minutes by the studio, and finally released for 70 minutes. Movie Release restores the surviving images (often damaged) from the previous version to give us a 107-minute print.
