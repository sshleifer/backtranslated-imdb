This movie starts very slowly, but when the movement is finally over, it has to follow a bit. I did not understand why some of the events took place, and many things happened before they were explained and confused them. Although there are not often special effects, the only thing that really goes for it is the mass of blood. Blood red looks like Kool-Aid. Skin tearing sounds over someone like a stick. Still, the story feels some sort of amateur, as the writer did not take for a long time to perfect it. I think it is better to have a better movie and a better movie if more time is taken from scripts. Honestly, I did not expect it, though I felt that 90 minutes of my life was wasted. If you want extremely strange movies, stay away from it, if not for you.
