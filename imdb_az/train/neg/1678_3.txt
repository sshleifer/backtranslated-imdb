I do not want to make a "door with Holmes" sign, but I'm not exactly alike. Accordingly, the bad and very variable WONDERLAND Kilmera gives Morrison channels at the same time ... but how is this movie about the famous 14 inch coy! Australia's criminal films can not always jump in and out of graphic violence ..... As someone's communication to the US film dual standards once said: "Kiss a kiss and push it to one X and push it into an PG 13". WONDERLAND 14 minutes too long, and at the end of the tawdry spiral we're glad to escape the cinema. How many films do we get from WONDERLAND? Must be six in the last ten years. Pixilated sets violent and silent colored sounds, but almost always resembles their nose. EXCLUSIVE AND TAKSI DRIVERS take a few instruction and the next day will be forgotten.
