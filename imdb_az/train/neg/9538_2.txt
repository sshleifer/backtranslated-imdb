When I saw the trade for that, I did not see it. Forgive me now, but for a long time I have not seen how it went. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that the movie I've seen in this movie is not the same as the movie I sell. <br /> <br /> I was bored, dissatisfied, and incredibly disappointed in this film. And if it were not bad enough, they had to immerse themselves in this bad reggae music. Not a complete mood-setting music for a scary movie, eh mon? I do not see any trading (or trailer, I think), it's a warm thing. The trade for my money was even better.
