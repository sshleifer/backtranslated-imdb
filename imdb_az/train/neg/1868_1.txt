This movie is terrible. Each line was stolen from 8MM (at least the Italian dubbing version). If you want rubbish ... real trash, give it a try; But be careful: this "very bad" is not good. It may seem like a porn at the cheapest, but I believe you can find something else, if you're looking for a "puffiness", s & m, hardcore, softcore ... or even an ordinary erotic tension! I'm telling you that because of the shooting, players, structures, dialogs (Joel Schumacher's only good line stolen from 8MM, as I said before) is a tearful reminder for a few minutes and a "happy end" completely rebels !! I'll give him a star: half of the half shot down on the back of the scene, the "monster of the victim" (after being stolen from 8MM) and for the mother and daughter sexual organs (nervously to keep me awake while watching this!)
