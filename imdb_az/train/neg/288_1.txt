The original film did not have anything worthwhile, and it was even lamer. Even the rental was really nice. Everyone connected to this movie should be on something! So, what's the story line? What was the girl? The viewer had to draw the line in the first four minutes of the movie. Unfortunately, I tried several times to watch it. I borrowed a child from someone to get some feedback. Kid said he was stupid and he was four years old. Maybe I find that a filmmaker can come to the filmmaker, and maybe some shootings are more than the B movie. It can push it. I liked the theme song. Good thing was just one dollar, it was worth it. I think you'll enjoy the movie if you're lucky because of the need for silver and crew. Is boiler in France lawful?
