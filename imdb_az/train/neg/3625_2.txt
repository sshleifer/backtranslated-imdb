This is a film that is about 50 strong. The American Cinema Institute is surprising to have chosen one of the 100 best films of today. I've seen all the movies on the list, and this is one of the most frustrating fighter. Musical numbers (and many, many of them there) are very extensive and boring, and have nothing to do with the story. The end of the film has an extreme long ballet sequence that has nothing to do with the film's story. It should be noted that it is well-designed, the music is good, and the dance is performed with the highest professional standards, but there is no real reason for the sequence in the film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is extremely childish and unmatched and behaves unusually. His mental age is equal to 14. If you want to see a good music in the "golden era" of music, go and see "Reading a song in the rain".
