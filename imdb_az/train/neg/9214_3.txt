Many things become clear when watching this movie: 1) The player is very scary. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are such, but the mother-child conflict is a border with a soap opera. The other two boys: a very sensitive kid hearted and stereotypic me, a family-but-a really blonde sensation of blond sleeping boat; 2) The film is generally heartwarming and desperate; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes worry (run by Tom Hanks); 4) is the only choice for the collection of beginner lover ("we are all special friends"); 5) strange lines and sideways are not improved for terrible action; 5) This is a really bad movie. Wait for disappointment - and maybe worry.
