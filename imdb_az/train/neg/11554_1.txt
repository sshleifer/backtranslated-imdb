This movie is embarrassing to film. Not even a comedy - I do not think it's funny. The scenario is not strange, but castles should be shot. Gail O'Grady is just a great actress, but apart from that ... 99% of the rest ... ouch. Still many else ... Wow, that's so hard ... Wow. The number one rule related to the comedy will not be "FUNNY". There are many talented actors in Canadian drama and comedy - none of these films have been used. Canadian nepotism and molding managers are helping to film a bad film in Canada. I understand that it is technically a "US" movie, but I'm a director, actors, location, and so on. I look. I just saw it in Bravo - they are ashamed that they have the right to show this movie. However, there are also many great movies that can not get the airtime and show it.
