I saw "Paris Je T'Aime" because a friend really wanted to see it and went with it. I'm going to be indifferent to the film, but I left the theater and wasted two hours of this life-saving production. The stories are almost completely unforgettable, with the exception of the majority. Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara have something to do with Paris? The infinite paradigm of American actors has made this movie the most strange kind of non-French feel. The clichés about Paris were endless. Yes, most of them played clay about Paris, but often they used French cliches to entertain, directing them with regret and again. Yes, Paris is a city of love. <br /> <br /> The worst parts were: Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); Along with Nick Nolte; Mime one (worst?); hair products one; Juliet Binoche (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of Paris?); Vampire One (I think of Elijah Wood in Paris). It was really a stupid man with Natalie Portman, who seemed to be a Mentos trader (the blind youngsters should know that Portman played a role only when he called it). Ten and ten. <br /> <br /> I did not like Coen Bros. It really plays with the Parisien clichés, but I did not find it funny. It's just annoying. <br /> <br /> Gus Van Sant was an interesting one, but it was so small (and punchline clear) that they had registered him. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful" segments and they were like a baby for a rich woman in a kindergarten whose immigrant nanny was her baby. There is a nice irony. And the segment on stabbing Africa. The best part of the whole film, but this segment has nothing to do with Paris. The story could have taken place anywhere in the world. <br /> <br /> She was interested in slaughtering a middle-aged woman in the latter part, but the main tone was bad. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to solve any problems to use some projects. Almost as the French government has sponsored this film to promote tourism. In general, only about 10 to 15 minutes "Paris Je T'Aime" was a sad cinematic experience.
