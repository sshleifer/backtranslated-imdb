This is really a bad movie. I have suffered my brain and can not comment on a positive one. The player's shamelessness. I've seen more convincing speeches than cables. The area is ridiculous. The stolen diamonds, the president's secret recordings, and the shark that attacked something approached for the worst cheese tradition. The shark night is not so bad that it's good. Dialogue sounds and illustrates a few seconds since it is shot. Plus, the night of Sharks is the worst soundtrack I've heard. <br /> <br /> From all that I read, the Italian film industry was murdered until 1987. The shark resembles the coffin in the last nail.
