I went to see this movie at the age of 17. girl. I insisted that we go to the matinee, not just because I'm trying hard, but only feeling it. In the spirit of NASCAR this is a sponsor's dream. Very striking ads are known as almost informative products, of course, not for acting. Following the tradition, Herbie franchise continues with joyful story lines, and the car is just a "tool" for this movie (no purpose). Previously, Herbie's installments (even though cheese) were produced more seriously, and it was easier to digest them. Ms. Lohan, the protagonist of Disney's heroes, is gaining less strength. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would join such a project. Only the snack bar was a bigger endurance!
