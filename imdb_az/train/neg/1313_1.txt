Do not worry about watching this terrible mini row. This is a crazy, incredible love triangle of six hours between three people who are not completely chemistry for each other. This story has no heat, no real passion, no romance. It's dry, boring, drawn, and does not wander as though they were. And even does not meet technical skills at the expected level. Take six hours of your life and use it for something more valuable.
