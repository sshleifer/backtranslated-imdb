What's a part of this movie? Mercy was good, but at first I knew it would be a giant mixture of normal people (even better than Hercules's effects). The really terrifying part of the film is dialogue. It's totally unbiased, foolish and stupid. I felt like I was a 9th grader in a class and won D. <br /> <br /> I'm going to slap Casper van Diem and other actors to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I love my bad and bad movies (I love the cigarette series), but this ... I do not recommend it. Silly and completely flabbergastingly bad dialogues will make you cringe.
