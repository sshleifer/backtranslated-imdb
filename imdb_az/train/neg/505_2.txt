Wow, this is something. I have to finish as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> One of the four wins back to the castle. Many things do not happen for a long time. There are some naked and non-erotic soft-core sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Some girls cut their heads (off-screen) -The End. <br /> <br /> The only things that go for it are worthwhile looks and suits, some bad dubbing, and a few short nudie shots. And I believe that these films are not enough to cover the film's 90-minute tune. In fact, the best part started with a distributor who presented a few barren goth chicks, covered with blood and their emblems, and this is not necessarily the acceptance price for the garbage. According to everyone, the name of the film is completely amazed because the film has no blood pressure or no dance. It could also be called Goat-Raper Circle-Jerk, and at least in this movie would be a better name than nothing. A real address could be "90 minutes of Freedom from Defense" - it would be another charming title, at least for truth. Honest-disc trailers show all the good parts (and I'm 'pretty good' ... using my term). I can not imagine those who are fond of this movie - take my advice and leave it on the shelf. 2/10
