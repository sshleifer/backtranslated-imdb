There is a great difference between the original, the tense, the outer places, the scary, the gore-fest release, and the filmmaker Eli Rooth and his team's "cabin fever" and just like it. The film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins the fatal proof after the other succumbs to the mysterious, fast acting, meat-eating illness. Friends had not gone past one another and could not follow one another, and they wanted to be the same around them. Like all the sounds, in general, there is a certain spark that behind the basic structure of this film. Unfortunately, the only thing we have come to the end is the weakly drawn symbols that seem to be incredibly incompatible with the inevitable divergence at the outset, leaving the viewer disconnected, subplots who motivate a little more than the director Roth's screenshot. It's a few ways to shoot an incomplete movie! Avoid eating this time.
