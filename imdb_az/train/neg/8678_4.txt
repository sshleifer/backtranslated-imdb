<br /> <br /> After watching "The Bodyguard" last night, I had to review it. <br /> <br /> If it were not for a terrible camera job, it would have been a pretty decent film. Not confused. These angles were completely wrong, and it was impossible to see anything in the ranks of the war. <br /> <br /> The prisoners were extremely terrible. <br /> <br /> The story Sonny Chiba puts himself as a knight to everybody who wants to take her to the drug chain. He approaches Judy Lee, who is not very dependent on Chiba. <br /> <br /> It was a good movie, though worthy of prisons and a terrible dubbing. This was a classic Kung Foo movie because it was a better direction and editing. <br /> <br /> Note that the opening sequence is familiar to the fans of "Pulp Fiction" and then goes to the Karate School in Times Square. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with the rest of the film
