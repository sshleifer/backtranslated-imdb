One of the aspects is that Gabriele Muccino's project is quite mediocre, although it is solid and interesting in some of the artistic styles of Seven Pounds. The film is becoming more pleasing and manipulative when it moves to the end: hearts are human and emotional, physical and metaphorical. The Seven Pounds are more than just an amateur imitation of Alejandro Gonz√°lez Ensarritu's Amores Perros and 21 Grams and many flashbacks. The story of the problem is much more predictable than the film. This is very bad because the Seven Pounds could be "good" when Ben and Emily were put in their right hand.
