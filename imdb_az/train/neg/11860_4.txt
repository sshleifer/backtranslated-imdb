Give it a few minutes if you do not realize what will happen in the first five minutes of this movie. Liliya is a widow. It is stored for a very long time and it exploded. She has a teenage daughter who emphasizes that she just did not get the youth. When checking on her daughter, she looks at a world where she can not do it ... Kabardir, where men can dance at him, dance in flawed suits she does not expect. The film is very misogamist. The images of these men are very uncomfortable. Like Lilia, money is rather strange for strangers to go just for hell, not for money. When she succeeds, she feels like a woman again. He does not want to communicate with them, but it depends on your attention. Other dancers are all women who quickly appear to be men and are short-lived women. I say enough short. He finds a romance, but in short, you have guessed it .... We did not come today without any surprises. You realize that although the end is good, you will not end it anymore. Maybe this movie is not my demographic goal - 30 people
