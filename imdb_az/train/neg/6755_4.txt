Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a clever, unstable young woman. She gets more than the bargained party when she goes to the pool with her favorite partner. While telling her history and friends joking about the Murder Club, Maddy takes her seriously and moves towards a "3rd level" in a car parked on a woman's carriages. <br /> <br /> This film (originally "EM BLEEDED") is thought to be too weak, but who is also a mask of mask and who kills other members of the band? , before the end of the left and right bend, is completely filled with spaces and spirals. Some of the dialogues are clearly laughing. I had no problem with Rochon's performance, but the supporting player was strange. However, she was able to sit with her full moon free entertainment. There is a lot of skin and blood, and it's a great kind of whistle for you to come together with your friends. Terrorists also came out with Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (like Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (early victim). <br /> <br />
