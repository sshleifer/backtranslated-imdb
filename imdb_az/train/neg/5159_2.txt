Watching this movie is like eating a feast other than a banquet. <br /> <br /> This is a toy factory and a dark confusion about the evil forces. So how is it possible that the main imagination and the movie of Robin Williams are still bad? As you can see, the appearance is not a substance - it's so sad, as Popeye's image was at the beginning of Williams's movie career. Although the film cost a fortune, perhaps there was not enough money to hire writers who graduated from secondary school. <br /> <br /> The movie, I'm sure, is really why it was made in the first place - of course, it did not provide any entertainment.
