It's a Texas hill and equally as dull as it is. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills, and Dennis Hopper can not bear this unfortunate boat. Taylor sees really bad - wrong wardrobe, wrong hair and false makeup - a unique success in his remarkable career. Hopper gives the only convincing performance, and on the climactic stage Dean shows a remarkable talent, of course, something that he does not remember - a comic actor. Rock Hudson, Barbie Doll Ken, is a prototype of what makes Redford a great miracle of what she can do with her boyfriend. Until the last twenty minutes, there is no clarity that provides any tension, but stages of very little attitude toward each other. Except for Hopper, there's only one collection of cardboard cutouts that pops up regularly for no apparent reason as a shotgun casual targets. For movies, movies, taboo subjects, they fight against racism and sexism and have SIZE, and this is an excellent choice to sell unfriendly guests to yourself. Those who have a DVD version can begin to feel complacent by starting a second disk. You will not be interested.
