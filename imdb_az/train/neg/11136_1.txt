I was forced to make a comment about a film about it. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I was the best film I ever saw and was for Memento. <br /> <br /> As he saw Darkwolf, he was invisible to Memento, on the other hand, in the worst movie. In addition to the two scenes involving naked women, there is nothing in the film to remove it from the trash can. <br /> <br /> Let's look at the other side effects, animated films, bad behavior, and about 90 minutes. For a long time. My husband and I laughed and relied on very badly. Surprisingly, I watched it until the end, I did not know how! AVOID !!!
