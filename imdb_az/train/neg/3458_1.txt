I'm usually not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was a painful feeling to me. I laughed at the terrible predictable area, the barefaced and tense situation. Indeed, the majority of viewers seemed quite bored and almost seemed to be in the "most intense" moment of the film. Molly Ringwald acted as the sole performance of any kind of torture in torture. Even the "twist" was not at the end. I heard that the film did not take it seriously; <br /> <br /> <strong> Decisive events have taken place in the Caucasus. Give yourself a blessing and spend your time and money on something else!
