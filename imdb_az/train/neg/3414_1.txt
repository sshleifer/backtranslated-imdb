This is just terrible, really terrible trash. Yes, beautiful naked women dance and have sex. But can this work in a porn movie? can even be a hit like a porn movie? It tries to disguise "real" emotions with real things and "film" in the fight. It is not. It is a pretext to get some girls naked and have fun with them. I'm convinced that all these women (and men) in this film could have been worthy of the porn movie business in the 1970s. . . <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Can not I blame all of these actors? Nothing to do with them. The film's very broad structure or complex can be good for good writers and authorized actors. A very broad structure or plot is a psychotic man who draws his time away from people as a fighter. These shots were not enough for men to respect their wives. <br /> <br /> Shoots, shooting, movies, movies, movies, movies, movies of this movie; would have made more money. It's already a hardcore porn movie and I only saw an erotic penis that shows that it's just a non-porn movie.
