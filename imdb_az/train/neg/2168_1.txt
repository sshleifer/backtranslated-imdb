Once I reviewed it, this movie would be really good. I use "B" movies, but it could not be classified in such a way. Photography is probably a decent one in the film. But editing was very desirable. It was very closed and staccato. Who chose music and sound did a terrible job. Music was mild, especially atmospheric and scene setting. If the player was better, he filmed it. Unfortunately, I worked better in porn movies. If you want to see a "B" vampire movie, check "Blood Gardens". You will be entertained more.
