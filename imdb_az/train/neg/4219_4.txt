Due to the fraud of the DVD liner, it is an amateur movie taken on the video, not a "terrible drama". I've seen something better than Undergrad film students. Most of the story is packed with a taxi driver around Jakarta. This movie could be used on a video camera, but only two cameras were used, and the content had come in a number of ways. It's a strange thing to do. The last editing is likely to be turned into two cameras back and forth instead of a correct editor. Did they have a taxi? English subtitles are written by someone who is not well spoken in English, for example, "Where are you now?" It is generous to say that the quality of the product is parallel to Blair Witch. If you're not scared yet, this movie was an ambitious and creative effort with all the cool and strange images in Jakarta.
