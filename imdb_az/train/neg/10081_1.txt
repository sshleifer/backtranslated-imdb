I've read some comments about this movie, and I think some people are enjoying it. This movie is nothing. Very badly written, directed and moved, but it creates an impression. The characters speak in stereotyped dialogue and the situations are completely complicated. Although this is attractive and entertaining, the film is unaware of the fact that everything is so lifeless. Lee Rose, as he decides to write a drama about a woman who is struggling with sexism, but he or she has not been allowed to give the story a real-life gusto or a wish. This film may come from an encyclopedia such as the standard issue, Living Life TV.
