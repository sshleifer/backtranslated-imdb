This movie is terrible. PEOPLE. One of the worst films ever. I can not imagine that Gigli is worse than that. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < STRONG> Affleck is not an actor. It may sound good with an image and explosions, but even Bruce Willis has "Die Hard". <br /> <br /> The best part was Catherine O'Hara - it's always good. <br /> <br /> Despite the events in the Caucasus, there is any motivation for their actions. <br /> <br /> ALL THE FUNDS OF ALL GOODS.
