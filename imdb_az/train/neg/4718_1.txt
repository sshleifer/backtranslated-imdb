This documentary does not lead to serious receipt and there are four reasons for this: <br /> 1) Since this documentary (including director and producer) is Serbs or Serbian origin, neutrality criteria fail. For example, they did not mention that Yugoslavia had played a major role in the autumn of the diaspora (called the "Master"), but also of Serbian organizations (Cetniks). For those who are not familiar with the history of the Balkan WW2: the "Cetniks" demonstrated in a documentary shows that the Serbs helped British paratroopers during the war. Yes, it's half the truth. They were a fascist (Monarch) group that collaborated with the Germans, but after Hitler lost the war, he went to the side. The film does not recall Çetnik leader Mihailović, responsible for the killing of thousands and burning hundreds of villages around Bosnia and Herzegovina. But they talked about certain Ante Pavelic ... Hm ... Let me be a little suspect. <br /> 2) The majority of people I have met are not completely known to me. And I studied this war for a long time (who is the old English lady!) She did not actually give a homework and they were not even given the name, so they could be more or less, perhaps someone from the street. Who knows. 3) In a documentary, they talk about Kosovo and how they live in the Serbs' age, and therefore, to Serbia (even though it is a minority). Indeed, Serbia's predominant part of Croatia (Krajina) is suddenly described as having the right to live there because it is a home for a long time. Beautiful, but people do not know, the largest city of Krajina (Knin) is of great historical significance for the Croatian people. One of the most famous kings of Croatian history (Zvonimir) was a crown tyrant and the city was a historic place for Croatia. The Serbs came about 800 years or more later! No, Serbs should have Krajina and Kosovo for a documentary film. Is this fair? In my opinion, the director has double standards. In the documentary there was no law on minority rights in the Croatian constitution, which was a lie because it was one of the first laws to apply. It is likely that Croatia has a large Serbian minority. <br /> 4) The movie is called "Glavas", a radical Croat Paramilitary leader. Or the Muslim radical Oric. They accused them of having a great cause for the negative development of the war. Yes, they were radical, but if you want to talk about radicals, why do not you remember Serbian radical paramilitary leaders such as Serbelj and Arkan? There are a lot of flaws that I have just presented a few people watching a documentary. Apparently, the people who prepared this documentary were not well-prepared and did not have the attractiveness to criticize the Serbs because they feared that their Serbian relatives would slap them or something. Here are some of the coolest documentary films, but the best of all the important participants of the war (Milosevic, Jovic, Bulatovic, Tudman, Izetbegovic, Karaczic <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 5- <br /> <br /> Another thing is that in this documentary, I saw a document describing why the US supported a bin Laden country (Bosnia) during the war, first of all, all the nations had nationalist presidents and Bosnian Muslims were forced to rely on something other than the nation because they did not have an ancient ethnic identity (previously called "Muslim Croats"), to link the spirit of the people and the only thing that united them: They help the Mujahideen because no one would support them, and they had to fight the 4th biggest army in Europe! They needed all the help they could get. Nationalism is the best way to unite the people during the war. History shows us that.
