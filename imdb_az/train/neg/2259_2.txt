I do not know why I want to shoot a film about Jerry Springer Show for my life. It's something that is so increasable. Some ways, unfortunately, are a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we have seen at least one episode. This is part of our pop culture. I recently saw in the United States. Very bad. I will admit it. Jerry is doing a terrific job of what I'm thinking of. Or something like that. There's also Jamie Pressley. He basically plays himself. All his lover needed was Kid Rock. Then it would be perfect. So, I recommend Ringmaster. Just watch the "Jerry Springer Show". <br /> <br /> 2/10
