This film is the biggest loss of nine dollars I have spent a long time. If you knew how often you went to the movie, it's probably hard to imagine, but in fact nothing is wrong! After seeing this trailer, I knew I had to see it! If you admire horror, mystery and decline, why not? Trailer is not an exciting and exciting thing; Unfortunately, the film is not one of them. <br /> <br /> From cinematography, to craft, this movie is a complete flop. If you plan to go to the movie, I'm afraid you're in a disappointment, unless you wait for nothing but excitement, excitement, motion, horror, or loss of one hour or forty-five minutes. <br /> <br /> "Why is it so bad?" you ask. Let me know. The film was neither mysterious nor suspicious. Nothing about the film was "on the edge", frightened or interested. The scenario best laughed. The dialogue in the film was so funny that there were many times that I started writing as a comic relief to imagine that after a few seconds. The player was absolutely terrible. I love Nicholas Cage but it was a miss. Undoubtedly, each performance in this movie was incredibly low. Cinematography was a moment or mystical moment, terrible. Finally, the story is completely transparent. <br /> <br /> You can see a mile away from this movie. <br /> <br /> I am not a tough critic at all. Certainly, I want to laugh when I see a comedy and just want to be surprised when it comes to seeing a mystery / tension / horror. This film was boring, weak movement, poor writing, and a great disappointment. Do yourself a favor and look at something else.
