Given the amount of money spent for this movie, it would be a long way from the story as a whole. This may be perhaps the most worthless movie ever seen. Nothing was real progress. Character development, minimal. Yes, progress. Enjoy, none. I'm not sure which points are trying to even try. If you want to see a terrorist movie that is a good kid, the American CIA bomb shows everything that does not belong to our ideas, corrupts all the capitalists, and likes to see something similar to the story of death accompanied by death. For those who realize that they will not kill a good person for a single point, we will refer to other films. In summary, it was a mistake hidden in the style of 'Ocean of the Ocean' because it does not know what the filmmaker is. Home Alone 3 was a better kinematic piece.
