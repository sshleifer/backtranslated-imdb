In his interview with David Duchovny, he said he could not even watch the first hour of this movie, nor did you need it. In the event that he could look at the surroundings, the scene he was asking for the owner of a house where he had committed a crime was to change his name and cancel the exit of any of the X-Files episodes. The whole film's autopilot. Brad Pitt was horrific.
