This should be one of the worst films I've ever seen. There is nothing positive in this movie. Someone really loves this movie! I saw many of Dracula's films, and I liked everyone I saw, but when I saw this movie, she said to myself: "What is this hell?" What a stupid movie. Now, Dracula is because he is, because he is Judas. Judas betrayed Jesus for those who did not know who he was, and then he felt guilty of hanging himself. Do not deceive me. I have never heard of Dracula because of the bad. Anyway, wanted a reason? What's a part of this movie? For a movie it should not be tolerated by anyone with this excuse. Even Dracula is terrific. If you had seen this movie, you would not think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Was this title so surprising to me? Do not waste your time or money during this debris.
