There were some interesting scenes like "Big One" hitting the middle of the film, but what would be expected? Earthquake * litter *, wait a minute! This is Dante's Peak! Yes, some parts of it burned down. If I do not believe how weak this film is, it gets "borrowed" from movies better than other films. <br /> <br /> Remember my advice, Bond Wanna-be, Nash, and do not forget that the viewer has wooden mountain sketches in big cities. <br /> <br /> <strong> One of Dante's hills is by accident. <br /> <br />
