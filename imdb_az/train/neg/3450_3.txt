Here's somebody who really liked this movie in some ways with High Noon. Now this is a real stretch! I'm a fan of a number of Sinatra, but there are some role-playing roles, but the only person who could play that part would be Don Knotts. First, as we have already noted, Sinatra does not only have the structure for the bad people of the West. At this point in his life he is very 'light'. Maybe he was at the same height as Audie Murphy, but Murphy had a very solid structure. <br /> <br /> Sinatra faces as a small boy who is a great chatter that someone should not be in serious trouble. <br /> <br /> The story is outdated and is not really reliable. I do not want to spoil it, but it does not mean that the last one and the townspeople react to this story. What's more, these people always allow themselves to be completely lorded by the 'bad guy'. <br /> <br /> This is just a small town, because I can not get the charm and do not understand why people will dominate this way. <br /> <br /> There is a "love of interest" in the story, and if I was watching it, she refused to know who the main character was when she refused to kill another bad guy. Now you have real love for you. "Stand up for yourselves, speak up, and he will certainly kill you." LOL. Stop, you kill me. Unfortunately, the film's basic structure is not good enough and even though it has been tested for the story, there is no wacky way to follow the garbage bag. Want to know why you are not in the video and never broadcast on TV? The critics were upset and correct in 1956 - this film is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> People in the Caucasus are forgiving one another. Try Tennis in Table Rock or Gunpoint - two really, really good West on this subject. Johnny Concho Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the biggest singer, but you did not have that movie.
