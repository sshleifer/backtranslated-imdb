I do not know what this movie really is. As a student art school project. They say why the world is dark, but it's always dark, except for seconds. Without any reason, all kinds of insects have long, unshakable shots. How little dialogue is there in the film, unusual and unusual as pictures. The black woman enters the main character's apartment. She is pregnant on one night and then gets hit in the head. The main character serves the body, then becomes a cocoon after a white naked woman appears. I have never exploded in such a way that a movie can be so bad and meaningless. I'm honest, I want someone to watch, so they think what's happening to me. But I would not want any of this hell to anyone else.
