Here is one of the most persistent films in the studio's happy ending. The protracted conflicts are resolved in a matter of minutes. It would be more interesting to draw more of this uncertainty tone. The talented Barbara Stanwyck withdrew with a metamorphosis with a woman similar to that of an independent and ambitious woman who stopped her whole life. Brent, as usual, is above his head and then has a ridiculous situation with Gig Young playing a character called Gig Young. Someone is named "Gig Young" and then seen, but Gig Young, actor! No matter what, regardless of what we are looking at.
