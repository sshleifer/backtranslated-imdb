Michael Caine has always claimed Ashanti "was the only film (he) for money" and "the worst movie he ever played." Stand up, Michael, did not you have a swarm of Swarm and Sundown? And did not those two movies be worse than Ashanti? Perhaps Caine remembers the physically imposing demands for a film of action at only 130 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures (directed by Richard Fleischer, who was hospitalized as a result of a stroke during a stroke). Ashanti really does not appear to be the down point of Michael Caine's career. Instead, it is a multitude of moderate pursuers who have a very talented cast, exotic places, dull stretches, and a story of a high level. <br /> <br /> Dr. David Linderby (Caine) is a W.H.O herbal remedy that black hero Anansa (Beverly Johnson) was missing during a visit to the African tribe village. Linderby immediately understood that his slaves had been captured under the direction of his wife, Suleiman (Peter Ustinov), and that the continent leading to the Middle East led to extensive follow-up. <br /> <br /> Along the way, great stars are inactive and hospitable as a guest. William Holden has a poor community as a chopper pilot; Omar Sharif shows little or less of his charm or grace as an Arab millionaire; Rex Harrison looks right when he plays a brief role as a helpful link in helping Gaine. The film was named best seller by renowned writer Alberto Vasquez-Figueroa, but the popularity of the book has been greatly reflected in this adaptation. Ustinov is vulnerable to harsh speech in his films, and Caine is creating an incredible rage like a man who thinks he will never see her husband again. There are random movements, but Ashanti's all are moving slowly. All this is not a terrifying way of Caine's often offering, but a very inspirational film and, of course, not a fall from all talents, but an accessible part of the mocking spell.
