This is one more tough and boring movie about AIDS and tragedy. The film is very exciting and predictable and continues throughout the movie. I was expecting it, but unfortunately it never happened. The player is fair, but the script needs a lot of work. If you are looking for nudity, do not waste your time with so many hot actors. I missed 1/8 of the film due to poor audio quality and lack of headlines. If you have never seen five gay movies or agree to be gay soon, you will find this movie interesting, otherwise this is your low-budget budget movie. It's one of the worst gay movies I've ever seen.
