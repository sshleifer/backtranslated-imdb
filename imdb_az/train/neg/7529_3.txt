Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this is one of the worst films ever made. Bruce Lee dies after helicopter crash after hitting her neck, but does not reveal how he is on the helicopter because he is near the previous scene, but is no longer in the 200m helicopter in the air. It is already talking about a cheap comic book. Perhaps the idea is not ugly, but in terms of cinematography, no crafting is done. There are dozens of war bombs with them, in general, all of them in Hong Kong. I think Jan Klod van Dam is a genre of filmmakers who know how to use logic stories in their films and how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are better than 90 percent of the smallest martial arts films produced in Hong Kong in the 1970s and early 1980s. Despite being in Bruce Lee, 'Death II' is in my opinion poor film category.
