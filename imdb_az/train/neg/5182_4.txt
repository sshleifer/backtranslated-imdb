Like most Hamiltons Festival entries, he draws an intriguing film that captures all the ideas and little performance of the film. Apparently, although the budget budget is clear, the film is kept in the final curve and leads to profound results and a clear outcome. The film has a family who want to get married after parents die. They kidnap people, drain the blood, and feed something locked in their basements. Mckellhar and Firgens have some nice dark conscious speeches, and the rest are just so-so. The film is actually or very concerned about it. But it is a strange humorous and dark mixture with a striking result for the first half. The next half-movie would not have been forgotten, as it turned into an unfounded final that transforms the entire film into a completely unhappy experience. Although some talent is doubtful about this production, it is a shame and deeply flawed but original and creative. Unfortunately, when it comes to delivery, it is completely unsuccessful at every level. <br /> <br /> 5/5
