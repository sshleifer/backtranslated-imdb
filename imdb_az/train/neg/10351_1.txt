This movie looked at the storyline of the movie. Not all the interesting points in the book were in the film. They ended up delivering the joyful "tween" Disney movie between Meg and Calvin. Hillary Duff was supposed to be the one who played or loved the party. This film is nothing but an insult to the book's exploration and mysticism. I do not think Disney can go away by creating such a cheap, basic impression. Though I'm still reading a book, I think it will make it easy for you to make it a movie for the Equity of the Lord of the Rings. This movie has never been able to use the A Wrinkle head. Poorly seen.
