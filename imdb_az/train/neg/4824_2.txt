I would like to love this movie, but many elements have been destroyed for me. The use of the bubble lens did not give me a sense of being in the world of meth, but she thought it was waiting for MTV a few minutes. The film did not go anywhere, and acting was an excellent example of a player. I like movies that give me a look at the awesome underground world, but this movie did not decide whether it was a worse commentary on a worst horror film or addiction horror.
