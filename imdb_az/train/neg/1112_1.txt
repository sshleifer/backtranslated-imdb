I watch western films, but this movie gets biscuits. Scenario and dialogue are laughable. The player was a hero, where did they take them? I say music was good. Fortunately, he did not buy or rent a movie, but now he's been released. <br /> <br /> I am strange (martin's glow) to tell her story. I must admit that Hopalong has hit the Tex finger and the tension between Hopalong and Tex, who says he has been following him for 40 years to reach the league. But all this was then shaped by the pear. I never had to look hopefully for the whole movie to be the best.
