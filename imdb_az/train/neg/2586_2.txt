Let's end our chase: This film is a soft pornography sold for masses under the name of a studio, the last penny of the American Pie teas. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you're a Tween boy and if you are too busy getting actual pornography, this is a movie for you. Otherwise, the film has no suggestion. <br /> <br /> The player is sub-par, character development is almost unavailable, and the story is an unusual nudity, > Caucasian> Animal House, Kids and even the original American Pie are all great kinematics and all of them use heavy alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "How it is, but how you use it"
