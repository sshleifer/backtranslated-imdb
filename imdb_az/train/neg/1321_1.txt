Richard Dreyfus is not a star here. She has about three or twenty seconds of community, and what is Gene Barry over this movie? I do not know, the director was his older brother! This is a film that does not make any sense. The discipline writer / director (the same friend) threatened everyone's talent with terrible uh ... work. I brought a penny to the DVD, so we can not complain! But it's strange! And it feels strange and not a good way. It was 70 and the director was on a bad pickle trip and everyone seems to have wanted to experience what's happening in his head. There is a little fascinating and controversial concept, but like a scratchy note, it's breaking down quickly. <br /> <br /> "Menzone's family resembles pickles," she says. <br /> <br /> I do not know how the other reviewer came up with this movie. Maybe when did they work there? In any case, be ready to lose 80+ thousand lives, you will never come back. Yes, that's terrible!
