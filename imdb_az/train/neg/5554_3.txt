Darkman 3: Derman Darkman Die is directed by Bradford Mine, the man who made the first Darkman. Darkman 3 is worse than Darkman 2 and is not something special in my opinion. Larry Drake is no longer the ultimate hacker ever played by the great Jeff Fahey, who wants to get Darkman's job anymore and who wants to build stronger people today. The film is quite similar to scattering and execution in the Darkman 2, but I have long been overwhelmed with the presence of more than two scene scenes from Darkman. These sequels were prepared shortly and with little money, and such decisions were made. Most of the scenes are pretty stylish and out of the way, but it's still a tired movie and is often heartbreaking. The heroes are very shouting, laughing and very boring. There is no philosophical depth in the film, and it is like rebuilding the Darkman 2 that is not yet equal. Darkman 2 had many great scenes and stylish camera work, and Larry Drake's ability to play a great deal. Darkman 3 offers only a few beautiful scenes and moments, but mostly this movie is tired and full of clips. A few positive things in this movie are flashback editing (Westlake's nightmare) and really striking landscape types and traits. And it should be noted that the main villain, which is also a unique and creative comic book, is a very nasty scenic scene. In the second part, the main murderer is more interested in death. <br /> <br /> The Darkman 3 is the worst in the entire series and we have to remember that these two albums were shot straight and Raimi did not come close to the original Darkman with Liam Neeson. Darkman 2, with great scenes and durability did well, but this last (?) Entry was tired and often foolish and later drilled. It has some advantages, but it should not be a common feeling first. <br /> <br /> Consumer can be a director, and I hope he can get some remarkable projects in the future. <br /> <br /> 3/10
