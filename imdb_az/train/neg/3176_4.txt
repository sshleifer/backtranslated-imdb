Lovely Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate, an angel angel fianc√©e Henry (Paul Rudd), who killed her before she protested. Henry is still very concerned about his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) after two years. Chloe corrects Henry to talk to a charming psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley will appeal to Kate's soul who wants to help Henry's life. When Mental Henry is involved, Kate's dreams come to close the romance of the mud. There are some funny things; but when you see it, you see the essence of the movie. Cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. Personally, I thought Bell Bell had stolen a show. And Biggs is a pain in the leg as usual. Still, this movie was very sensitive.
