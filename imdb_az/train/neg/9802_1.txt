Many people here say this show is for kids only. Hm, when I was a kid (about 7-9 years old), I watched this show first. It was disgusting to me. I talked about this with other kids and am sure that I know other shows and what? When he wanted to emphasize the calmness of something (either on television or in something else), he laughed, saying, "Uh, like Power Rangers." <br /> <br /> Before visiting this site, he was not actually able to imagine that he was a fan of MMPR. It was such a strange thing for me that I decided to watch it again, and I was trying to figure out why. I have not enjoyed this image. But he looked at me: maybe I had no idea? Can be. But this argument is not enough for me to rank more than 1 star.
