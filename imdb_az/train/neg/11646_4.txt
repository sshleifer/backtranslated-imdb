Kojak meets with the mafia. Telly Savales looks quite unforgettable. I did not think his show was big. It is a dimensional characteristic of a murder boss, and it has many expected results. If you follow the car and generally go out, there are not many things to do or do. I feel moody in films because there is no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. Hollywood and in this case, Italian cinema, treat these kids as heroes. I saw the movie and a few days later I do not remember much about it. Many fires, innocent people die, betrayal and loyalty. The movie is pretty good and the player is good. But the dubbing is so bad (due to sounds that can not be slipped off), I immediately started to approach the godzilla bay.
