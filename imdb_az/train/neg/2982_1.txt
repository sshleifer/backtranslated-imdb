Zombie Review # 3 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is a film that has been given to Lucio Fulci, which, according to his standards, has no connection, sense or sense there is nothing. But Fulcani does not blamed Bruno Mattei, who did not have Fulci's style to carry the film, as it did not really control it. Mattei brought a lot to the film, but not surprisingly. <br /> So I'm ashamed to say how much ZOMBIE has used 3 of the value of the riches. There are no indisputable features - in a known genre, Zombie 3 boats, but it is more enthusiastic than Nightmare City. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Who is the thief, why he stole, and why would it be a good idea to set up a Canadian lieutenant from the dead of a US soldier? All these and more questions will not be answered at Zombi 3 ... <br /> <br /> After hiding in a hotel, the infected thief is terrified of all the green plastic that grows on his face before being watched, making a slightly foolish decision to destroy his corpse by the army, bringing the name "Death 1" into the atmosphere, it will burn it ... zombie birds! Who then attacks people and turns them into zombie people! <br /> <br /> Then we welcome our "heroes", the horny GIs trio and a girlfriend. (Zombie cannibals, why do zombie birds do not attack other birds?). There are a few other children with them, but it is not important - it is important for a person to be here. You will find yourself in a difficult situation to remember everyone's face, write their name, or take care of them. <br /> <br /> This guy is hiding in the same hotel as a boy ("A week ago this place was hit by life, now it's funny!"), but there's no running. <br /> <br /> I think he or she will be pushed out or cursed. The scenario is so scaring that it does not scare the world's biggest motion, so the worst is not just human characters, but the zombie that operates here is the lowest level of all time. There is no discrepancy in the behavior of the zombies - sometimes in a respectable style, some shamble, others are engaged in fist battles or wander around the machettes, yet they will not speak of the zombies that can talk (A HIM GIFTING HORRIFYING TWIST ENDING). They die from gunfire in the sky (even more) and even with a good left hook. How is a zombie fisted ??? !!!!! In fact, it resembles a very similar V episode, focusing on the bad movements of the 1980s ... <br /> <br /> The zombie will spend a lot of time waiting for a little poor place waiting for some time, fear will be. They hide under shrubs, garages, huts, roofs, water, and even pregnant women. At one point a zombie takes a woman out of the stairs. Kill him and eat? No! It's zombies and insidious sense of humor to push her into the water! <br /> <br /> There are, however, many. The hands are closed, the wounds are sliced ​​in green, and the body has a lot to eat and people are sipping their faces. There is nothing to adjust the original wear piercing, but if it's a bad effect, it's your bag <br /> <br /> All this and I'm a horrible musicist, an unnamed flying zombie head, a scientist who steals to show it's really bad, punchline did not recall. a master twist scattered by zombies at the original radio station, Zombi 3 gives us a real zombie DJ! "He went to them!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zombie 3 <br /> <br /> The number of people living in the Caucasus is very high. I was 88 minutes short ...
