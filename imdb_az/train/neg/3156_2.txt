I just want to clarify something - I love Michael Vartan! But this movie really lets it down. Her player is still outstanding, yet still as charming and still beautiful. But the film itself is a burden of garbage! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say this, comes with a little hero ... You're always waiting to escape with her best friend, her sub-storyline is a bit strange. My family (film) was watching the movie with me and me; Sometimes music did not just fit in the scenes. But this is not the worst feature of the film I am very disappointed. I can forgive the lady of the lady, I can forgive the strange characters thrown into the mix, and I can forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment, but I chose to cut off the entire film and go straight to ??? The latter was planned from a clear start, but how long they remained was not clear yet. If you are a Michael Vartan fan, take this movie: Take a plaque instead.
