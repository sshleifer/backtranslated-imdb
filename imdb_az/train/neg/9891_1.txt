In my opinion, the biggest disappointment in this film was that until the end of the game, teachers were moved to apologize for the bad play and apologize. <br /> <br /> A strong theme is a sham that is less focused on action, given the effort to create a magnificent scene and a spectacular look and magnificent images. <br /> <br />
