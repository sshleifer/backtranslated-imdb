A gay couple, influenced by AIDS, is the "orbit" around the "perfect day" rather than the linear movement from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The narrative has lyric moments that describe the particular or expected damage. This film is a life mentioned in asynchronous fragments. Unfortunately, there is no such kind of grace. The scenario often requires actors to say stupid, stupid or indifferent things that are not entirely out of character. In a second casual encounter where they clearly hit each other, sensitive Phillip calls a Guy who does not want to talk about a challenging week. But Guy begins to open, Phillip, British Metropolitan, "Are not you a Crisis Fairy?" Later, while the naked, crisp body of his beloved, watching his bedroom against himself, our lover begins to say beautiful words with the words of Shakespeare: "I can not even describe the way you cut out in space ..." - do not have the verbal skills to complete his thought. Such actions continue with AIDS Hospice scenes and are decorated with lines such as "I'm sure death will be wrapped around clean and ribbon." and "See Florence Nightingale as Nurse Ratchet." <br /> <br /> The film is often aware of wound healing. The inexperienced characters are quite shocking, and they are more rectangular than what they need. Phillip, a proud self-sacrificing fund and a leak, cries needy, to protect a kaustic diatribe, who knows everyone's going through their own paths. Such a writer could offer a writer a wealth of opportunities for intelligent social commentary, but, unfortunately, their words are simply unpleasant, tasteless, or trivial. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to know if a screenwriter has deliberately designed an intellectually limited character, or if he just controls the surroundings of his beach. <br /> <br /> This question can be resonated with those who are most appealing and praising this film. Serious investigation of middle-level gay life of the 1980s: the first encounters, respect, retreat, nesting, complexity of open relationships, friction and breaking, cancellation, physical exploitation, approach, forgiveness, terminal disease, death and healing. The leaders of Phelan and Spirtas are becoming fairer for good speeches showing complex characters over time. Their acquisition gives a good look, as well as with the sensitivity and selfishness of each other, along with chemistry that helps some viewers to block the painful weaknesses of this film, to help each other explain one another. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The decision to divulge the sting rod into the sticks and present them directly in sequence has added complexity without obvious dramatic benefits and in some cases abandoned a series of sequences, and therefore the results of a particular event are not clear. Can I recommend the movie? Sticklers for the literature and technical quality, is not completely! Perhaps for those who are in serious mood in the mood for Tearjerker, who is in serious need of AIDS survivor or a sinful taste, with a little eyelids. However, there are better written alternatives that investigate the influence of AIDS on the relationships of this era: Philadelphia and the group, Long-term companion, Angels in America, Early Dress, Parting glances, Love! Valor! Compassion! and even Jeffrey.
