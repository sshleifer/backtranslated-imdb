It was very difficult to watch it 5 minutes after the start of the film. <br /> <br /> There was a great deal of life. <br /> <br /> So, for 45-50 minutes, I hate the stomach and do not watch the monster house. The line line is very clear and boring, especially when it comes to acting really good (just like daft and kastrato) from moving, especially from Justin TImberlake. Morgan Freeman was particularly troubled to dance around rock music for some reason, especially from half a week to meet with Timberlake. Freeman and Timberlake's symbols should have a kind of parent-child relationship, and that's just another thing; <br /> <br /> Freeman's character has nothing but Timberlake's ignorant and stupid character, though it reduces all stops to help him uncover a completely ridiculous cover. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie, it's a good time. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie.
