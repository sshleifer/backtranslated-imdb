I'm an inadequate skeptic and agnostic, and I was looking forward to using this movie. After looking at, I think I'm a better documentary with myself. His arguments have only four artificial sources (although he has never seen Richard Dawkins in his IMDb list of credits), and it's also a little bit out of laughably amateurish computer effects and it seems impartial. This story is full of sensitivity to adolescent Christians, which is a betrayal that destroys the likelihood that the film can change the mind of a movie rather than propagating it. Despite some of the fascinating discussions of Jesus' historiography, the film creates an unbearable blow to a Christian school where a filmmaker participates as a child, so some have psychologically frightened her psychologically <br /> <br /> Although TGWWT has a clearly low budget there was an opportunity to make a clever interpretation of the very suspicious roots of Christianity here. Religious documentaries that are suspicious in the market are of no great importance, and this can help fill the gap. Instead, the director refused to insult our intelligence, and ultimately appears to be a series of therapeutic exercises. Too bad, his Christian discipline struck him, but he was not subject to the fight against the audience.
