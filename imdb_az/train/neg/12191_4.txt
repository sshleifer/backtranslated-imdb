I do not want to compare Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear classic 1962 Cape Fear movie, but I can not help. I'm just a great admirer of Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck, but I play Cape Fear, but when the Scorsese enters scenes from the previous movie (Ciden, taking the keys out of the fire, the dog dies), and even Bernard Herrma's whole movie, I will not be able to help , but the classic Cape Fear does not give me much opportunity to compare it to almost every scene. Comparing the classic version of Scorsese's Cape Fear version, remake is destroyed by the classic; but it's still a bad thing if we hit the film itself. <br /> <br /> Now Scorsese and screenwriter Wesley Strick did not rebuilt for Cape Fear scene scene in 1962, but tried to do something else. Unfortunately, this is one of the problems of the film. Max Cady's 1991 release, Max Cady, an original barefoot and animal produced for revenge, is a religious fanatic for his "salvation" of Sam Bowden and his femininity (not his words, mine). Both went on and saw Sam's classic Cape Fear movie in a powerful Sam, discovered in 1991, is that Sam is a lot of corpse, Magoo, unreliable and very difficult. Even Ms. Bowden is a completely different character - more horrible than Max Cady! The general story has also changed around - Sam did not testify to Cady in front of the court for putting him in prison as in the classic version, Sam is now Cady's former lawyer Cady, <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <strong> The Caucasus> Other sub-fields are not a big picture, but just a badly written mixture. The film includes a few sincere absurd scenes and you will not be able to take a little bit of seriousness that is full of realistic and even ridiculous lines. <br /> <br /> Now, the classic version of Cape Fear is unusually bright with lighting. is a powerful, effective, thought-provoking incarnation that combines the film with a bare cruelty that excites it when it calls for a whole sense of danger. However, in the early 1990s, the Scorsese movie could not make a movie, Cape Fear, a cookie-cutter, no threat, no irreversible scene and little style (if you do not count animated fire and skyline style). <br /> <br /> Behold, there are some terrible violence, and this Cape Fear has made more effort than the original, but it ends up empty and all shock, but there is no fear. <br /> <br /> All this is not enough, the player is not good either. Robert De Niro (as an Oscar nominee for his performance) starts out as good as Max Cady, but until the end of the film, it gets worse until it starts to get something out of laughter instead of laughter. Contrary to Jessica Lange's and Ms. Bowden's speeches, she goes on to make her feel extremely frightened and endangered for most of the film. Nick Nolte like Sam Bowden remains the same throughout the whole movie: beige. Juliette Lewis (also awarded the Academy Award) is as adequate as Danielle Bowden, but he has called it a really stupid character and it's hard to really love what we see on the screen. <br /> <br /> This movie is often considered one of the few good rehearsals and I can not see why. I would like to love this; I really like it - if Cape Fear was rebuilt - but I did not. After being incomparably comparable to the original Cape Fear, he found Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear really a very bad film. The best things about the film are Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck's supporting roles - the figure to go.
