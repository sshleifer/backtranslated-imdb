I think this movie is one of the worst in the Nightmare series. <br /> <br /> About 20 minutes after the movie was shot, I could not remember anything, and I repeat that I wrote an article about it. <br /> <br /> Okay, # 4 was a joke and Freddy joker. Tried to turn to the roots of # 5 series. Basically, Nightmare 4, which was a good thing, was darker and more atmosphere. Instead of a comedy, they tried to make a horror film. Unfortunately, they forgot to scream and add fear. Because of this Nightmare 5: Dream Child is neither funny nor scary. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not enough for a 90-minute movie. Sometimes the story is surprising (perhaps not because) and you can not defeat the filmmakers. The scenario should be more delusional than Swiss cheese, and the film was so disliked (so I do not want cheese from Switzerland). <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 get, # 6 is also a messy one ...)
