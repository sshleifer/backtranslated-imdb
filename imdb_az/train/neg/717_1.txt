LOTR-Trilogy was supposed to be a parody. But this was one of the most horrific films I ever saw. Bad fun, bad scenario, bad things. I DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TWO. There are people who love this miracle source, but I do not doubt that there are better parodies in movies than well-known filmmakers like Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I work in a movie theater and on DVD, and the success of this movie was similar in both areas: the films did not have a great (but not great) success in the first two weeks, those who saw it were not good, the film fell very fast. The DVD sales were good in a short time, but no one wanted more. The worst movie I've ever seen in the last decade was The Ring Thing and Torque. I can not decide which one is worse, but there are very good films that you do not have to think much about.
