Wow, how bad it is. That was very bad. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible - the character of the main road was a common joke. Vinnie Jones, a sexually explicit couple, begins to cry when she is photographing with her girlfriend. Um ... all these New York photographers are childish, thought-provoking, and weak? <br /> <br /> Therefore, he is something he owns. a weak, low self-motivating effort to throw into a modern MTV style - all cgi, blood is still no real emotion. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie opens a criminal case on the basis of another potential idea. The atmosphere (like the stupid monsters at the end) was destroyed in favor of "seeing myself guilty". It was not prepared for the film and the audience was prepared for a CV - a logical motive.
