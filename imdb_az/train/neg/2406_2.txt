Another piece of cinematic sludge comes from the mind of Harry Alan Towers. Undoubtedly, based on the work of H. Rider Haggard, Haggard looks like something he really wrote in Africa (even though we have a dinosaur African, our strange avant-gardes use them to draw their canoes), <br /> <br /> Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) set out to look for treasure, armed with only one medallion and completely abandoned the treasure. luck On the way, they meet a variety of extremely bare monsters, get a French chef and have a relationship with McCallum, the Queen of Phenicia. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny thing. This is the only reason I have not given one reason.
