Perhaps I'm not in history or I do not know Electra as being in the current publications. But the Electra I read was very manipulative and there is always a plan. He often used other people to carry out dirty work, and more frequently did not have a double cross. <br /> <br /> This film was weak in the dialogue, the player was not particularly convincing and tactful for action. We searched for much more along the line of Frank Miller's "Electra Assassin" book. <br /> <br /> There is something in the film that's even darker than anything else. <br /> <br /> The special effect on sexual activity, not the story and the structure, was often slow or unreasonable. Tha El was not quite dangerous and Electra ..... was not quite bitchy. She is your favorite girl to hate ... but in this story, I'm just a way out.
