This film is pure, intense, irreplaceable boredom. Before I entered the dark room, I did not know anything, took my seat. I think the poster was deceived by the "mysterious and suspenseful" blurb. Also, Lena Headey is beautiful and unsatisfactory, and Richard Jenkins is always a reliable man. This headline could have been mentioned above, so instead of doing something else, he agreed to go with it. <br /> <br /> Let us note that the Valkyrie did not go for the second time. The point is that Headley's Gina McVey, his wife, his father, sister, many louche, and the doppelgangers from the mirror lighting mirror in a mysterious way. It's a big movie behind this idea (actually, I remember you, but still ...), and in fact, if the directors were away from all supporting players and just joined the story of Headey's character, The Broken Made a 20-minute short . <br /> <br /> For example, in a mirror, in a mirror, all the main characters in a room collapse a mirror; they seem striking, but quickly forget about it. In another scene, a mirror flashes into an empty room, and the doppelganger "goes out" of the hanging bottles on the wall. So if you ever come up with a creepy crawly creak, smash the first mirror? A little excitement? Very light London houses have many scenes of characters, they look around the corners, as they think they've heard, but they see nothing and move there. Do not we start to wonder if this hate doppelgang really does not want to try to scare them? You have the chance to scare the characters and scare the audience. If we want to experience any excitement during Broken, our viewers will be threatening each other in the darkness of the theater. By the way, after spending time with these bad couples, we are totally worried as everyone is expected to be afraid - they just stand around, waiting for their faces, maybe completely harmless after killing others <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
