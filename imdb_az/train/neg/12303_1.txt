This movie is very bad - it's funny in an unwanted way. I could not watch it, I was very laughing! This is not a parody, but a romantic tension parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell. A legitimate advocate's spouse, Luke (Corey Sevier), is ultimately a dreadful, mysterious drifter who is in prison, but the only thing Sevier is guilty of is bad! You are not worse than other actors. You feel that there is no idea that actors are really in a horrible movie; they play straight. Everything about the movie is bad: actor, script, love scenes, pacing, twisted cropping, music selection. Climactic scenes are just so funny - first in the church, then the words for Luke the last Emily - I hated laughter. <br /> <br /> Of course, Luke was so angry that he was angry at the prison and began to see most of the naked body. This is probably the highlight of the film.
