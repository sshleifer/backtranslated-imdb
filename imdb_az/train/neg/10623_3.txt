"Three-Straight Girls" is a sweet, rose-colored look of divorce, arrogance and single parent. Undoubtedly, social issues and economic difficulties are the absence of a perfect life in the picture of a mother who draws pictures, feels exhausted, cruises and then marries a group of chef conductors. The phrase "Its Only One Movie" is an excerpt from the fact that the songs are made up of numerous unusual highlights, with real children and group leader Hose Iturbi. It is not surprising that the real person will shoot a star in a film where they are actually married. <br /> <br /> As we confess, this film was released for the nineteenth and forty-four years. Only old-fashioned Hollywood romance and comedy love 'Daughters' can make a tolerable film.
