Yes, I thought I was a musician, maybe I'll check this movie at TMC, nothing else is good. One of the worst mistakes my life has ever done, and only half finished. I seriously thought that this was one of the fairy-tale films, unhappiness and malevolence, malignant shooting and malignant effects. But I can not even enjoy it. Even "musicians" were not very good. Perhaps they were hoping for some laughs, but I was not sure if they would not want to throw a liner. But now I have to watch the rest of the way down until the start of Pulp Fiction. Or maybe a better thing. Now I want to sit down to write up to 10 lines
