This terrifying film combines every Asian stereotype that you can imagine in a treacherous package. Money laundering, with improper Japanese businessmen, sends strange but pretty police to reinvent industry secrets in Detroit with Patro Morita. Here he faces a ball called Jail Leno and immediately addresses a murder victim like a Jap and calls Morita Tojo. Not all down there.
