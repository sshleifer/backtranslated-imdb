This movie just goes from the corner and gets ridiculous. I really wanted to watch "Darkness Fall" and I thought it was a movie. Boy, what a mistake! I've been sending a lot of time and still can not get rid of drilling moments. I only envy those who are obliged to play or work in this movie. They were actually paid for this crap. Is not that great? In this movie, a man is killed and is born small bloody pieces in front of the tree, and after a few moments the mother and child quietly speak at the table without drinking coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for these crap films? Oh, and "dental-fairy". It's a dull stunt that is not terrible and unhappy with makeup.
