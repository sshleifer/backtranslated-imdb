AVM Phantom is the most suitable movie for a "forgotten" category. It is a pretty bad option about Opera Phantom, the famous story by Gaston Leroux. It is not a bad idea for him, but the structure and production of this film is weak to give it a worthy esteem. On the brilliant side, Gaston Leroux is still not forced to return to his grave. It could have been too bad. <br /> <br /> There are many useless flashbacks at the Mall Phantom, causing very dull stereotypes to make your memorable. Also, screenwriter writers wanted to give the story a lot of projects. Despite the many mysteries related to the nature of the ... the main plot is ordinary and déjà-vu. *** ALLEGATIONS *** About a young couple who are so different in this kind of kid, because the boy was killed in a fire. She was set on fire because she and her parents refused to sell her home to build a mall. The boy was rescued from the fire and hid in the mall to avenge himself. Now she keeps her daughter working in the mall and tries to forget her loss **** END SPOILERS *** It's pretty straightforward, but more effective - it's thickening with many trivial elements and boring conspiracy theories. Not only is it a fun horror film, but desperately trying to be a clever tension ... and it's not what fans are looking for. There are several innovative killings but we're not happy enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie. Furthermore, Phantom of the Mall could use at least a little humor! All this, including casting, is very serious. <br /> <br /> I will try to finish with some positive aspects ... For example, Ken Foree stars! Die-hard-horror fans, Peter will recognize him as the dawn! It's like the horror period needed to find an equal yet. Although the role of this film is limited and even absolutely unnecessary ... it was good to see it again. The admirers of the television film will recognize Morgan Fairchild as mayor, a beautiful actress and elegant lady. Pauly Shore looks like this, but I can not stop it ... so my opinion can be a bit biased. And, finally, the lead actress is a little praised by Kari Whitman. She's a very beautiful girl and has a little talent ... she never went too bad. In fact, this movie is the greatest success and tells you enough about your career ...
