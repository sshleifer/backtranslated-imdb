When it comes to watching movies, I really do not call myself "student", watch them, form feedback, and that's it. But all this changed. This movie is undoubtedly the most important thing I've ever tried. Every child at the University should think about the future of Spielberg or Tarantino and present this film with a book titled "Not to Do Films". Although not just one event, filmmakers were not enough to shoot a movie to watch. It's been a while since I've seen it, but we can say that it's watching the upcoming shooting in the startup scenes. They will never end! It's not just fun, just like pulling teeth.
