After seeing the first ten episodes, it is necessary to say that this show was ordered. <br /> <br /> What's worrying about me is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper, but they hit California, and we could have scenes in the desert. It would be more accurate to film. The first area outside the world is in the mountains, with many pinters that look cold. This is not very Egyptian. The film worked so well that it felt like it was in ancient Egypt. Here he feels that he fled in a fight against aliens in a Canadian forrest. And on another planet, appaerantly comes in such a naked, fall. Forrests on the edge of Vancouver can see the leaves anywhere forrests to look like. The show is just more incredible and dumb. <br /> And then there's Richard Dean Anderson. He is not Kurt Russell. Of course, he does a decent job and tries to copy Russel's performance a bit, but he's not as cool as Russell. Rassel is not a good actor. And the way Russells was playing Neill, he was also more quaint. Andersons O Neil, in a very gentle way. I liked the Russels version simply did not do anything, and did not have problems with the bomb explosion until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Schans is doing a really good job, like Jackson's sprayer. <br /> <br /> Teal'c is a really boring character. It's Jaffa. Not Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh !! Former guardian of a miserable Ra symbol, seen only in the pilot and still in another episode. Teal'c speaks and acts as a robot. <br /> <br /> Teal'c and Ra are characterized by the character they are in the movie, and they speak English fluently. mute Why are so intimidating aliens in the film talking in an ancient language and they were real monsters. <br /> <br /> As for special effects, they are really good at the pilot. However, in the real show, very rare effects are bad and appear cheap. A planet they visit especially with crystals. It is clear that they are walking around a noise with an ill-drawn picture in the background. This is an insult to our viewers so cheap. Especially they can do with a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. <br /> <br /> The X-files had a better impact when they broadcast their first episodes in 1993. Four years have elapsed since the start of the SG-1. There was a budget of two million dollars for the SG-1 episode. They should spend all their money for catering. Because I do not see it on the screen. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong>
