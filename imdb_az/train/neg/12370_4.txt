Perhaps this film was called "Map" because most of the stupid movie roll around the cemetery map. More of the same dull shooting of the map can not be noted. The only thing the map has to do with itself is the swathe of small beads, which are constantly built on our main character. Of course, filmmakers are the way to show how incredibly tense things are happening in the Immortal Hills cemetery. Now, could not he show us one of the scenes of death? We hear a lot about everyone on the map flying like a fly, but we do not see anything. Some people have been defeated in order to pay my attention, so I was quite generous with the rating I gave them, but I do not recommend this movie to anyone. If you do not have a deep charm of maps or sweat, I suggest that you rent a better movie, because I spit in your graveyard or drink your blood.
