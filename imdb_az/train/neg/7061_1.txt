I'm still trying to figure out if this movie is a point. <br /> <br /> The things Maddox distributes to students is so complicated by the content that must be so "rebellious" and "controversial". Learners are uneasy about fragmentary words written on uncertain anti-authoritarian feelings and grids. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> Big struggle in football fields is a two-man fight. <br /> <br /> Characters are characterized by wild personality traits. <br /> <br /> Maddox has a soccer fighter fighting in the battle (and later has a staple on it), all smile and should apologize for the next day. <br /> <br /> This does not make any real results of the plot, and I feel that everything could be placed within a half an hour from the school. If they did, they would cut most of the pseudo-glitch soundtrack.
