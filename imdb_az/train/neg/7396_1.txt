Unfortunately I have to agree with the critic, written by the halopes. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, costume, kits, sound, editing and everything else is a good movie for a short film. This may seem strange, but I was told that the technical staff in this case is a specialist, so quality should be expected. <br /> <br /> This problem, as usual, is in the story itself. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not really a story. You need a plot and conflict to tell a story (or a movie, show a story). You need the hero's events: events. In these events, the hero wants something and can not get it for some reason. Tim Watcher has no problems or targets. He is a supernatural body that observes humanity. This is so. So here's a clean exposition. Instead of demonstrating a story, we simply learn everything about this Tim Watcher individual. Of course, given Tim Watcher's short film duration, it's hard to give enough backgrounds, as the film is based on the notion of "Sound-Hearts." In this case it is used in the worst sense, on the contrary, we will never eat. In fact, for VO, I would think that the character was an oranged old man who was just looking at something. Explaining what happened on VO's screen is even worse! <br /> <br /> This short film can say that it will make a good video for a group or something, but pictures can not be said. Of course, the crew's technical abilities (incredible but not good) are worth the value for entertaining, entertaining, exciting, or at least a story.
