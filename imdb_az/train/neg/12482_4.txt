Deathstalker, directed by John Watson, and Rick Hill, the founder of such a body, is famous for the stars? Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something from the evil lord, and goes to the Lord's cave. During his journey, he meets many dwarfs and monsters, and the parameters are very close to Tolkien and, of course, Barbarian Conan. This is something far from Conan's great achievement, and it's a very stupid film, but it's got a great deal of good rubbish and is recommended for garbage lovers and movies are tolerant! <br /> <br /> Many kinematics are the essence of this film. Many of the scenes are almost atmospheric and interesting, but what is concentrate to show Deathstalker, naked women and Hillin's big muscles? Women are generally harmless victims and very stupid, so this is a very funny movie and so can not benefit many feminists! Struggle scenes are not special and pretty dull, and monsters are nothing special. All other aspects of the film are also amateurish and bad, but what have you expected from a similar budget? It's trying to be as big as Conan, but it's pretty miserable. As I said, it can ask fans of Turkish cinema, but no one else. <br /> <br /> Deathstalker is still not as bad and as a Turkish movie, I like it as other Indian. of course! If the bad movies are your cup of tea, try and have fun, but if you do not understand "bad movies", stay away from it. If someone is unable to withstand a great deal of nudity, then stay away from it. Here's more nudity than violence and has a film R rating for these scenes. Otherwise it can be a couple of safe PG family movies! <br /> <br /> 4/10
