At the age of 11, Oil 2 was like a crack. It was a classless, embarrassing, euphoric and powerful addictive experience. My sister and I would watch it, pull it back and look again and again until it's too mixed up and turned into an enemy. So if you're a 11 year old girl and you're considering this movie as "bright" or "entertaining" or "better than the Original Oil," you're responsible for your adult teenage hormones and this is unbreakable. > If you are not a little girl, blessings, unique, slipshod for everyone who joins oil 2 is not embarrassing. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> music, songs, or the development of symbols. In Fat 2, with a number of controversial exceptions, it is pointless to music. Most of the songs are too extreme about sex and generally the characters or subject of the movie "Today Ton", "Heart", "Do It for our Country" and "Prowlin". Moreover, all the music is disturbing, it's stupid and nobody even reads the song and the most terrifying appearance of dancing skills. <br /> <br /> 2. T-Birds must be badass and at least a bit unpleasant, but instead of each one is a boring wussy-dufus-loser.In the end, Johnny Nogerelli Michael The offer is a sacred T-Bird jacket and a networking initiative, Michael should duck it down, spit it and tuck it off any part of his body, and, of course, think of gold as though they are a lot of bull head, There is no greater honor than being one of the T-birds. <br /> <br /> Michael is always beautiful, clever Stephanie will finally embrace her when she is self-sufficient to be a man behind the mask because she is efficient, resourceful, and above (despite her musical weakness). On the other hand, Stephanie is verbally similar to silence, pumpkin gum, dirty sweatshirt, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbats. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it is a very unpleasant thing to me that he has no similar features, so there is no reason for the audience to be deeply involved in Michael's involvement. <br /> <br /> he did not want to mention any weakness against his predecessor because there are many cranes that seem to have felt that such a comparison was unfair. Perhaps you want to re-think this confusion for an ancient era: Fat 2 is an experience to reset your first kiss. You're only 32 years old and you're kissing a 13-year-old boy with slime and slobby braces. The magic is gone and you feel ugly and uncomfortable. Trust me.
