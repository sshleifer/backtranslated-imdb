I did not think the French could take a bad film, but I made a mistake. As mentioned earlier, this film actually uses the title character as a single point; the images of his life and personality have nothing to do with the true Artemisia Gentileschi. <br /> <br /> The scenario is terrible - ambitious, stylted and vapid - and the rewriting of truth is an unusual attack on a date, turning its life into something that often happens. Valentina Cervi's physical charm is the primary asset of this movie, and it's similar to what previously filmmakers know; never lose time to have different "erotic" sequences that are associated with more titling in comparison to sequence or character development. Unfortunately, the desire to see a pretty young girl in an entertaining state of sexual desires can not and can not hold this movie. Acting is awesome and an interesting accord, or both, is quite comprehensive. Cinematography is good and there are some pretty colors, but there are some pretty ridiculous sequences, using the more dangerous lens effect for the freakout movie of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> In any case, the script leaves Cameron often living in Artemisia's body and is rarely seen in his paintings. <br /> This is not a delicate or pleasant enough to be a serious movie, and it's too slow and ambitious to work as softly basic pornography. Thus, all French can fail!
