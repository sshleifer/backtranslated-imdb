This film was a disaster from start to finish. There are also interviews with Bono and Edge, as well as performers, who are accompanied by those who are "deprived of the next good". Leonard Cohen himself is less entertaining in the film than anyone else, with wisdom and humor. The rest try to make it as St Leonard or some of the Old Testament prophets. Most of the performances are numerous memorable comments (especially Rufus & Martha Wainright) or unsuccessful accomplishments. Only Beth Orton and Anthony remained at a gorgeous distance from Leonard's own versions, using a little restriction. Many of the concerts and interviews, the red-blurry camera work, has gone beyond the centralized superimposition of red spaces, using some of the digital delays in some of Leonard Cohen's interpretations, at least a few lying avant-garde movements of the movies were leaked to the conversation segments (try the extra gravitas?) spooky, ambitious low buzz, what you hear. In fact, watch the documentary released by the BBC in 1988.
