My God, this movie is very boring. Gina Gershon's great admirer, when I hired this movie for a romantic drama, and some of Gershon's great performances. Gershon is always as great as it is, but he is not the right actress for this role, but for Rade Serbedzija. The romances between Gershon and Serbs are not very convincing. And I totally hate the character of Serbszija (a winning organization), which is not attractive in the film. Dr. Lauren Graham (Gershon) was out of my way. Perhaps Sean Connery, Robert DeNiro, or Harrison Ford would have done a better job but I did not have the European business I thought. In any way, I was very bored with the movie druing. If you are looking for a good Gina Gershon movie, watch the best movie Bound ever. If you're looking for a romantic movie about a young woman and an old man, shoot some of Harrison Ford or Sean Connery. Gina Gershon is so small and she deserves a better chance, and I wish her a better choice in the future.
