There are two reasons why you did not give this movie one reason. Some of these actors (like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh) have tried to play on a generally well-functioning level. But on the very scene they were blocked by some bad scripting. <br /> <br /> The other reason is Cyborg's neat idea, which is completely different to other roles I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Everything else in this movie is as bad as it might be. Boredom scenes, useless and boring dialogues, bad script works. And it seemed to be the first movie for many actors. But it could have been an interesting story, but it was completely unsuccessful.
