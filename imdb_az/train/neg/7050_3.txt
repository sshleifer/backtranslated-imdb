The film's outer, dark, and celebrity notes because Catherine Zeta-Jones does not mean good at all. Cooked something in 1995 with a "Blue Juice" about a surfing enthusiast who appears to be a more difficult place to find surfer in Cornwall, England. It might think you have makings for this entertaining, quirky little comedy. If so. The film is less than nineteen minutes, but it looks like it's about to end. The easiest way to describe this is, even though it does not sound like dance without the '90' English version of the 'Grease'. No, the best way to get it is a small slice built in a small town. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays a Chloe, a woman living with a surfing instructor JC (Sean Pertwee, remember her). Pertwee is actually a star of the movie, and its character is a small group of surfers, a free legend, a sort of oddball group of free souls that are inevitable. In this case, a journalist is a nerdy man who stays in a stereotype of a drug dealer who wants to become an old nightclub who wants to be a record producer, and of course, the best thing to do with it. Honestly, I can not say anything predictable because everything that is happening in the "Blue Juice" has been put together and that has not come to my attention, but of course there is nothing surprising or even interesting about what's happening there or on the spot with. Comedy, though, is a long-awaited and brighter. His goals can be one mile away, and he / she almost reads the dialogue from the beginning (in the American form, of course). The relationship between JC and Chloe is not every bit as hackneyed. He wants to grow; He wants them to stay in their vulnerable youths. He is afraid to lose his face with his gang; he thinks he is predominant. You think. When I struggled to stand on "Blue Juice", as I said, it was an hour and a half of my life that I would never go back.
