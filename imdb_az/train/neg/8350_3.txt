I returned from El Otro, Buenos Aires, and I was very disappointed. The film is moving too slowly (do not get me wrong, enjoy slow-moving movies!), You're slow to a crazy driving point. Everything you hear is that Julio Chavez is breathing heavily throughout the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Making a movie ... makes it forgetful. If you want to see a good Argentinean film, I recommend looking for a movie by Sorin.
