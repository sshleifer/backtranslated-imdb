I did not know anything about Elijah, so you can not comment on the accuracy of this story. But as a single movie, I found this very boring. The martial arts scenes were great and spectacular, but they were obviously CGI. <br /> <br /> The player is poor and, of course, Brad Pitt has been removed only to attract women. But not a good warrior, I'm scared. <br /> <br /> Good points are design. This movie looks impressive with scenic and castle buildings / walls. At least I resemble the characters I'm trying to find, but this movie seems to be totally invisible. <br /> <br /> What is your expectation of a US, Scottish English language but a movie about an ancient eastern civilization? <br /> <br /> Generally, I do not recommend this film for a family sitting. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, it's too small and young people are bored. <br /> <br /> It is good for adults, even though there is no puberty.
