Sith's revenge begins with a long-acting reality, which is quite exciting without much excitement, is really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, the same terrible dialogue and the rest of the prequel series shook. The only thing that improves the court process is slow - I want to say that Darth Vader's birth will be something slower. And when it finally arrives, it is very good. Not great. Not even good. But it is very good. This movie does not give water to a paradise like previous albums, because it is long ago praised. Instead, it is just loyal, boring and routine. But VGI environments are sometimes really impressive. Do these lights fight? All this is a mockery of mockery. I think the dark side of Lucia has started these precedents and nobody has seen it. This will make a ton of money, but with God's grace, this one-time franchise has been beaten down enough. I saw the show at 12:01 and then heard a very small group saying it was awesome! But everyone who was eight years old hurt the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was so boring. I just thought he'd better see Darth Vader's birth. That's all we said.
