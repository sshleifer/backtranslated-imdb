Why does any movie about Cleopatra reveal the worst of the latest phaoroh movie? Julius Ceasar, the greatest novelist of the woman and her successor Mark Anthony, did not appear on the screen, except for the seniors' superiority in the sex-related high school. Despite the small sets and costumes, this movie is as bad as any of the 50's "sandal and toga" extravaganza. Of course, it is such a magnificent big screen, so the Gladiator was good, but the Gladiator did not have a romantic novel. <br /> <br /> Miss Varela is like Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothee Dalton has a reserve. Some did not apologize, others did not wash.
