Janeane Garofalo announces his dissatisfaction with this film, and among other things is anti-feminist. He also said he hated "romantic comedies" in his radio show because he did not believe them. I agree with Janeane here. The best film is this movie. He did his best, but in the real world, there was no other boring, unbelievable "romantic comedy". However, there are some who say "stop k√ºfrlerinizi", when you get a romantic movie from Hollywood, it is tired of staying abandoned. Jane's character, for some reason, is generally shadowed and darkened, which in turn causes the shooting of Uma in light tones (this is probably one reason for Janeane's dissatisfaction with the film). Janeane, if I think that these two should look better, I'm going to lower the movie. Many of Janeane's ugly, as in here and in other commentaries, is actually pretty beautiful. I have not read any research that says that Uma seems better. Nevertheless, I believe that Chaplin's character is not Janeane, but more likely to be with Uma. Many men do not like really smart women (and many women do not really like smart guys) and, unfortunately, I was probably with Uma. Although the director's attempt to make Janeane attractive, it does not work. Its natural beauty comes in anyway. <br /> <br /> I think many Janeane supporters who are obsessed with her because I think Jan Chaplin's character and want to really calculate with Janeane. Janeane is more complicated than the character she plays here (real life is far more complicated than Hollywood's imagination), so take the ladies with cold shower. This is a well-known role in Jane's, and it's really shameful that a movie is not really good.
