Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match describing quite different siblings, but Winningham can only bring something convincing or important to his role. Leigh, a bar-band singer and singer Sadie Flood, is a well-known folk singer in the form of Joni Mitchell. Perhaps, as a partner producer in the film, Leigh put himself in the corner box: he is not as reliable as a singer, and even deliberately, though he / she is showing a lot of microphone. Probably hoping for a tour force, Leigh was stranded and nervous and mixed; But we just do not see any character in this character (Leigh is obviously a great actress, but he decides that we should separate it). If Sadie had even a small crunch or a charm, we could understand that he took small breaks. Here's the probability that she's going to stage. Director Ulu Grosbard works in several intense dramatic sequences, and the finishing arrangement demonstrates Sadie's bar performance on the Georgian arena - it's just a nuanced moment ... but is it really a point? * From 1/2
