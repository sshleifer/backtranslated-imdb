J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson are not usually mentioned when talking about great directors / actor combinations. Apparently, nine joint ventures operate from good entertainment to mid-level boat. Unfortunately Kinjite: Banned Themes falls to the second. <br /> <br /> It's sad that many of the moviehouses will be better. But for my life, I do not understand why it is necessary to make a missing Japanese father to use a little cheap jollies because romance is running out in marriage. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It could also be explained in the same section. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br> Bronson's support team conveyed her where she was abducted. A stylish, boring mouse boy playing by Jaime Fernandez and Bronson's history. In the best scene of the film, Bronson made him an expensive rolex watch and put the car on fire. At one point, Fernandez focuses on Bronson and Lopez all night's sweets, and then rolex snacks, O Uzi kill everyone, but spray space with Bronson and Lopez. After Fernandez, there were more than just a few assistant police officers from the LAPD. <br /> <br /> For Fernandes there is still a very rude justice. I want the whole movie to be even better. It was the latest film by Bronson-Thompson's team and directed by J. Lee Thompson. He had come up with something better.
