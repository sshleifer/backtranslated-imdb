Mission mission: Follow Galactica and Instead of the original Living Legend episodes. The network took the 1st and 2nd parts of Living Legend and pushed them into an area with a terrible Fire in the Space Episode. Although Galactica has a lack of time to write network control and prepare it for proper production, Living Legend is one of the best television series of 1978. Fire in space, itself, is one of the worst episodes. As a historic note you will see Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the Revival Trek series and the differences between the fantastic and syndicated fantastic philosophy of network production.
