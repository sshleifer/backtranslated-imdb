The satirical novel in New York's snobbery, which contradicts Tom Wolf's contravention, looks bright here, but still does not serve well. The film does not bother anyone worrying Tomman Hanks's untitled Yuppie, Kewpie-doll Melanie Griffithi manipulyant southern Belle and Bruce Willis (!!) as a lover of New York literature. The most serious complaints were at the director's office. Robert Altman could give life to these different characters, and was interested in them, but Brian De Palma had never expected the nuances of human experience, according to his vision. As a result, the film appears good, but against the status of dehumanizing. Honestly, if a Satire does not frustrate the audience, what is it?
