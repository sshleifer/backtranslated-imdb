Yes, I'll tell you about it, so I do not read for any surprises. I bought this name with Christmas Christmas. There was another Christmas horror at Silent Night, The Blues Night, on DVD. Silent Night had a lot of potential, Bloody Night (Quiet Night, not to be mixed with Deadly Night) and was very close to being good, it was not quite good. It's just that you are looking at some of the children who are watching and kidding and writing about beautiful ones, but after some time you are looking for some action and this movie is not transmitted. You need character development, but this is on the boat and you never know why the guy can escape. It kills about three in one hour, the whole crowd is related to terror, and the men who killed kill him alone. This is one of the most unsuccessful attempts by the murderer to beat the criminals. She continues to try and kill another boy, and she is trying to enter her home by squeezing the fireplace. Immediately stuck and manages to quit difficulty. Then he entered the basement and then strangled him in the bedroom and tried to kill the boy. It does not seem like to kill a boy in this way because he holds a star in the tree and cuts the throat strait. First of all, was such a tree in the bedroom? Yes, before the murder, the killer stood on one side and was very entertaining. Yes, in this city people are persecuted by torches and unresolved part of their brother, and he wants to play. What was it? He never talked about something unexplained. How much you ask, I will tell you because I have spoilers. She can tell that she's just bare !!!!!!!
