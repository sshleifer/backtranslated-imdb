... basically, it's worth the movie when you consider that Ju-2 has a hard FORTY minute value of the first straight-line material from Ju-Ten and lasted 76 minutes later. Ho-hum. I saw that it was terrifying - as if the audience did not remember the same things! <br /> <br /> Perhaps, the withdrawal of this complaint was a direct line of Ju-2, explaining many of the unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> The first movie, which is open for more than 36 minutes, is not enough to make every sense of the original storyline. <br /> <br /> Besides, there are some really nice new horrors, if there were some time to show how good the film would be; <br /> <br /> So if you want to see the first original movie about your favorite and story, do not go. for that - press and hold a forward button for forty minutes with your finger-on-the-fly.
