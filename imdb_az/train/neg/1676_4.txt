Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, a solid performance. Three very interesting players who make humble speeches. The question is, who looks at the plan? John Holmes. <br /> <br /> Despite the arrests, drug addicts, and AIDS contracts, a person who continues to give adult movies is not only an interesting character. Following Holmes's involvement, arrest, and murder, and after a massive massacre of Los Angeles in the late 80's. As with the case of OJ, no matter what the outcome, the factor of guilt is quite high in the "He did it" zone. <br /> <br /> In this film there is no one to betray anyone like a criminal that serves him. There is nothing far away from here.
