This movie maybe I've seen one of the 2000 most boring movies! Music can not be interrupted, especially when music suddenly disappears. In many cases, such as martial law, no serious illness is being treated. The story itself also creates problems: the United States will not only allow the United States because China, Russia, Japan, and so on. This will also be the case with Nicolae Carpathia, someone trying to take over the world. It resembles the James Bond cinema, but it only works them more! Of course, film is for Christians and for Christians only and they can do it. Because I can not think of myself as a Christian, I think all the ideas are ridiculous. This prophecy seems to have come as a threat to the end of the world by the cults and other prophecies, when the truth is followed. When we can do the best possible life on earth, we are afraid of such a possibility
