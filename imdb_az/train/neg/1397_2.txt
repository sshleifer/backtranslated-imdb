Let's face it, here is the Brain Machine's "emphasis": 15 swimming pools and houses; Construction of 15 non-office office buildings; 5 countdown by a moderate technician; 7 The Terrible Guard Approach; <br /> <br /> Different posters commented on the difference in the copyright history of 1972 and the 1977 DVDs. It's easy to explain. This dog was just not shelled for five years, someone dropped it out of dust, and after relying on the government he used the Watergate mood very well. Now, after seeing the Brain Machine, it's just my miracle that has never been released!
