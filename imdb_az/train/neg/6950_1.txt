We all knew before the release of all, Ron Moore mini series is not Battlestar Galactica. This is a good. It must be stopped by itself. Do not beg Battlestar Galactica. If there is any good, it's good for its essence, and Ron Moore has something to be proud of. If reports are true, this is what Moore wants. However, if the mini-series rings, she is shamed not to point out all the excellent players, many off-screen staff who perform on the screen. <br /> <br /> Yes, this mini-series does not update. I do not even imagine it again. A new production inspired by Battlestar Galactica. There is no place in the galactic universe with the same places, jargon, and technology. It does not refer to the quest for the fourteenth tribe of the galaxy. He does not believe in the legends and secrets that form the basis of the galaxy. Ron Moore's mini-series is a cosmic opera with a ceremonial nod to Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I'm saying "another" space opera, the act of shouting. Because the columns go, there is nothing original and even interesting. I can give you all the things without spoiler warning. But I will not give you this punishment. Only the most important point will hit. Are you ready now? Here: Just watch the novel. <br /> <br /> Yes, human creativity turns into a person and tries to destroy people. (I forgot Azimov's rules). They look like human beings, and so are all the aliens. At least there is no travel. Oh, and many battle scenes and casual acts of sexual and violence. As a result, when Moore was pulled out of the Galaxy, the ceremony was more dark than respect. Do not he think of anything? <br /> <br /> From the first minute, I wanted to watch something else. I did not want anything from Moore's characters because I could not get to know one of them. It hit me when Cylons attacked. Armageddon is a planet size and I did not curse. <br /> <br /> When Mourin's heroes faced an obstacle, she tore her tail and rescued her ancestors. For all of these, remembering is the only way to save humanity. To safeguard others, they risked their own lives, but they were safer. At least hate is not apathy. But in the end Ron Moore mini series was a purposeful action, a movie on a treadmill, which goes anywhere forever. And I just wanted to finish it. And after finishing, I was fired from my life. Against my own will, I have become a vulnerable, weak zombie of the type that I will refer to this mini series. I needed to improve myself. I needed it, and I was forced to follow this reality - Babylon 5 episode. In fact, I felt the two episodes better. And happier.
