This movie only takes a second star because I'm working in the center of town and liked to see it destroyed. the effects were pretty good - it was the most expensive Korean movie. This is the most expensive and yet completely scary, causing a massive loss of money. I rented, I'm not going to complain about what I paid, but it was a couple of hours to get back. There are plenty of field hollows. all scary on the board is terrible. I do not recommend giving you time to watch this movie, life is too short. Do not escape if your friends want to watch it. I do not stress how bad this film is. <br /> <br /> Where did the second dragon come from hell? Why did not he show up quickly? How many rockets did dinosaurs 500 years ago?
