The documentary revolves around Eva Mozes Kor, a part of Mengele's experiences on twins, comparing the version of what happened in Auschwitz from the beginning and the feelings of the other survivors of twin practices. Of course, there was a great deal in the film. <br /> <br /> For me, most of the film has drawn the desire of the filmmaker to the audience. concentrate Erik Monderin (obviously no matter to talk about the issue at public forum) could only find the sweetest nectar on the IMDb user review. "In many dramatic sequences in which many Jewish groups have debated in the Jewish center of Cornus, the meaning of" forgive "is also discussed, but isolated and numerous Kor is self-conscious." But in the meantime, I was expecting again that the film was in the emotional repertoire empty. "Strong" Eva Korun begins to see what happens at least with Korun's vision after the film "Nazi Prisoners" donates. The film has passed a public disclosure of the Nazi's forgiveness and transition to new territories. For me, this is the flesh of the film, it is covered by the "obscure" of the "forgiving act". Of course, it was a very sick cow. <br /> <br /> In his mission to test the theory of forgiveness to correct the wounds of the past, he can discuss the problems that the "promised land" is facing with the Arabs and that dialogue can not lead to a better understanding of the situation and to focus on discussions and debates with Jews in the United States. a resort, in central Chicago. <br /> <br /> Then, anyone who does not look trickier to see the screen will make it difficult to miss a clear contradiction in his statements. <br /> <br /> Firstly, they do not want to listen to a body full of body language, Arabic scholars and teachers. Commenting on fear of kidnapping shows that all the action has taken time, effort and money. <br /> <br /> Sometimes angry Dr. Sami Advan (a professor of education at Bethlehem University) says for her statement that she will be asleep in her own apartment in Korea. <br /> <br /> I am in the Jewish center in Chicago. As it is here, he has the right to do so after the "grid" in the sense of forgiveness and after continuing to act. <br /> <br /> He will be sad. They were hoping to abandon watching the movie until the end of the film. The film did not deepen anything about Auschwitz, which was sufficiently important enough to trigger genocide in the memory of the agitators and cause a tearful panic. The subject of this documentary film showed that Korun could not go to a fair discussion. His debate was restricted by restricting his ability to forgive (in the best case) his attitude or complete reluctance to attend. <br /> <br /> Finally, today everyone is so late that there is no difference between the creation of peace and forgiveness? Referring to another IMDb user, "I do not see his forgiveness as weak, but on the contrary, he wanted to release his soul freely, and he wanted the punishment to end, and he left it." <br /> <br /> Of course, in the world of propaganda, there is no place for asking those who have "more than human beings" in a part of their blindness and political integrity. <br /> <br /> PS The Glossary must, of course, be included in the entire list of Buying Book.
