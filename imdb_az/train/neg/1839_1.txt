When I hired, I did not expect to put this movie on my DVD player. Then I'm not going to leave my DVD player after it's started. Actually, I watched the whole movie. My husband and I were looking forward to something funny, but nothing funny. Reading like a box would be really funny. The premiere of the movie is good. I'm Stiller funny. Jack Black is funny. How did this movie miss? Well .... it runs! This is the most memorable "comedy" I have ever watched. I did not think to anyone, it was a little funny. This is really a naked film. Trust me. Avoide it .... AVOIDE IT!
