Eleonora, an Italian-born, inherited the ultra-modern and isolated home in the woods from his beloved lover, Carl. <br /> <br /> <strong> Winter and she meets the mysterious guard Leslie, who ends up, as she finally does not just look at her home, but also Eleonora, trying to adapt her to new surroundings and to draw increasing numbers of couples. <br /> What did I expect? A real tension, but not so much. This is just the bundle for advertising! I was very surprised about everything. Title, story and motivation. So how can I classify it? Here is a dramatic drama that is more moody romantic than wrapped up in a sophisticated passionate relationship with more secret personalities than alienation, retention, and dependence. Co-writer (along with William Dafoe) and director Giada Colagrande's craft movie is very clinical, distant and calculated with its mysterious metaphorical story, which actually means what? though, when it comes to a sudden conclusion, why do you really care about it? It feels uninterested by paying attention to the insignificant detail and pictures of the dead weather we are experiencing. Sterile dialogues can help with many exciting developments, but have a deeper experience, as it is not deep enough. I believe it does. Only fresh-drawn sexually explicit activities are never satisfied and far from erotic ones. They are somehow in a weak flow. The base of the field creates an interesting and surprising thing, but never fulfilled, and I thought that there would be more after that all of this is inevitable. Colagrande's direction is proud to be professionally stylish and imaginable, but everything is just as slow in moving and admired by the same ideas. Is part of the activity somewhere? home Camera-work is very powerful, but silent music can be a little ridiculous when walking on ropes for some dramatic stabbing music that has little sense and purpose in the scene. Giada Colagrande plays her in a charming way and walks through William Dafoe's dream part. He was tired of the dog! <br /> <br /> Seymour Cassel, now and then, when his head is empty. <br /> <br /> It is everyone's guess where it's headed alone. Yes, wait for that. I think that's what I'm expecting from this movie now, and I'm going to doubt it.
