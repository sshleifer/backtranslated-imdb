This picture is reminiscent of The Admirable Crighton's "Keneth More" in 1957. He was a servant on the boat and became a master at the island and then returned to the servant after being rescued. Madonna was OK in some films, but this is the only one if there is any picture showing that Madonna can not do these actions. </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm not sure if the Admirable Crighton is a delicate copy. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ Strong> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> <br /> <strong> I think many here have been conserving Madoona for all of their activities, and I think it's pretty good and enjoyable in movies such as "League of Friends" and "Who's This Girl" showed a similarity in Madonna's style before or after. I would like to see a Madonna Animation series from "Who Is This Girl," but I love music from these two films, but "Spilled" here is under the pile <br /> <br /> Everyone has a bomb right?
