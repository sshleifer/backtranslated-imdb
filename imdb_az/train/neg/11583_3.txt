This movie presents the first half hour and many other characters and their relationships. None of them are curious and do not respond positively. <br /> <br /> For the first time in a few years, this move is not worth repeating. We can say that the story is not bad, and maybe some problems with the script - that is. I thought it would stunk it. Look at the loans, there is strong power here and there is no use. Most of the old procedures in this crazy work are doing well; Deborah Kara Unger especially liked the actors before. I'm talking about everything to talk about this picture well.
