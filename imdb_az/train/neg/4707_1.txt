OMG was the bitter experience of my life. I even knew what happened to Nick. The best thing about Teen Nick is about Drake and Josh and getting out of the air. Children's songs are very boring and children are like that. My younger brother wanted to watch the show, because he likes everything coming from Disney or Engagement, but after watching this show, he said, "It's so boring I've seen one of the worst showings." My younger brother actually envies him. In short, if you do not have 3-year-old brain activity, we'll use this show, but you can now change the channel.
