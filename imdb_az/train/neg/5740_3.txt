I found that darkness was just DARK. There were some good ideas and some ambitious ideas, bad mood scenes, and some ghastly moments to go to UGH! BUT, it is below the confusion point. If you always know what's happening in a dark scene and a movie shot in Super 8, you have all this bad grain to get your hands on. As with Nathan Schiff, this is also a great deal. Director Leif Jonker seems to have wanted to make an original movie, but there is no know-how. The camera is nowhere to be signaled to the right place, it's the absence of basics like simple dialogue scenes and how to hack a movie. All actors are quite inadequate and everyone is. But despite these disadvantages, music is good, very good, and from laughter to miracle to really good tools. Is this a classic one? Are you worthy of two worthy discs? NO. But it's a good attempt. Now these guys can do better if they stop for a while and try a bit more (for what I have understood here for a moment).
