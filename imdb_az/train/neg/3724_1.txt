I saw this movie twice in 1970 with a pentecostal church where my family attended the city of Nanaimo. When I was 6 years old, I was 6 years old when my brother was 4 years old, then 8 brothers. I was scared of this movie and looked at the world without trusting it. It was not a film but a philosophy that included a large number of "Christians" about the "betrayal". This film, church and volatile neglect, leads to heavy paranoid in the future. Over the years, I have lived under the delusional influence of the church and under the fear of being forgotten by Christ. Now I'm 40 years old. For many years he has gone through consultation. Once I explained to a psychiatrist this film and the church and family's belief system. I was associated with a delusional illness. In fact, I began to believe that my brother was a reminder of the philosophy of the word. Now I'm not afraid of the future, but I've come to associate with the members of the church with the fear. I took this experience to one end, and I'm approaching my license as a psychologist specializing in childhood traumas.
