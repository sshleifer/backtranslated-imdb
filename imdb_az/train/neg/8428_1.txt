Despite mysterious positive reviews and a high rating, this is a horrible movie. Do not worry, I feel I have to warn you how bad you are. <br /> <br /> The film was designated during the last years of Raj, during the independence of India. Those who follow the ridiculous scenario fill me with disbelief. What the characters do and how they behave does not convince me that there are characters in that era. <br /> <br /> For example, a local villager has a relationship with a young married Englishman who marries a Hindu married woman, is not likely to disclose the case entirely of social exclusion and shyness? It will not, but may still be. However, at the same time in Indian conservative society, the same old Hindu lady will work, like semi-british Britney Spears, will be open at the right time, open in the open during the day at open sex? <br /> <br /> In some films, this movie is part of a movie, a movie. Only one thing thinks it's more intelligence than I've seen in the first half of the day.
