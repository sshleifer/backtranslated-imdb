I have never reviewed it before, but for this movie I have to do it! This film is very bad, trying to justify myself as a kitsch or parody. But that is NOT. This is really un-self-conscious BAD. This is a serious attempt to flop the glorious way. Other reviewers have noted many of the film's defects, so I will not repeat, but I urge you to see this movie. All this I was either silent or full of blasphemy, or I fell in the hysterical place. For many years, I do not have much fun watching a movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite feelings are: - Arthur sounds when he is selected, but I try to see all my friends. -O boy (his dance is unbelievable) - selfless nudity (the director / leading actor was just a bare stroke) - in the messenger's office with the definition of Christ's cardboard and pencil - Of course, the scene with the famous wedding palm trees and forgotten rings (what is the narrative function? ) - Wrestling with his previous spouse's weapon with Ben - a detailed sequence of killing Arthur's lawyer; Perhaps, with this clever clever brother's white hair and WeHo fashion, she's the most favorite, Joplin's "The Entertainer's" opening soundtrack and "Pachebel's Canon D Major" soundtrack! - list goes on and on - look at it!
