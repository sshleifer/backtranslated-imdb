You know that John Cassavetes is having trouble running at full speed, and the "Incubus" is a great actor's horrific, worst-case scenario and takes action to pay off your accounts. In fact, it can be hard to blame for the hammy script and the direction of John Hough's "baroque" art. The film is about a series of rape and murder in a small city. Hokam with many nature is also mixed. In any way, it focuses on the tension and interest of each area, and Cassavetes may seem attractive. sometimes ed. <br /> <br /> Incubus, who is not seen until the last stage, is a well-organized structure, but it does not have to wait. <br /> <br /> 1/10
