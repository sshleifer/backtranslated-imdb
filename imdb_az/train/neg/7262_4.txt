Spaghetti-West may have upgraded it to something special when it is explicitly executed in a violent film. Unfortunately, A TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the worst edited movies ever imagined! The scenes start and end suddenly, the characters stretch long, the performances (and accents) of the actors are quite contradictory, and so on. <br /> <br /> Robert Shaw is a revolutionary, Mexico (!) revolutionary, remains a priest (!) ... Ten years later, the "village mayor" is ruled by Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens is looking for vengeance for the murderer. Colonel Martin Landau is looking for Shau. They all fight each other and hit each other. There is also Fernando Rey (like a blind man). Tips are not bad, but quite inadequate. Savalas sometimes has an emphasis like Landau (which is actually grating here). Shaw and Ray prove they really can not embarrass themselves, and Stevens appears to be quite foxy (if there is some space between the sweaty witch).
