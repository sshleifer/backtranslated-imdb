OK, the box looks hopeful. Whoopi Goldberg, next to Rabbit Glevard, casts his picture with a famous farmer and his wife. Then you open this baby on the DVD player and all the hopes remain less than five minutes. I was thinking of being a comedy. And it must be understood that I would laugh at about ten minutes until the end. This film has the following elements: a neighborhood or an abused neighbor, drill legal trial, racism, lynchings, and death and arson talks. Hi, huh? No, please do not listen to anyone, please do it here. You can not even force yourself to watch this crap. CRAP! I said that, CRAP! If he's given this name on his behalf, he should actually appeal to the court.
