A sad, sad look is really the revenge of Münster. The Munsters was finally brought back (Fred Gywnne received a great salary to come back to his role as Herman Munster) in a film made in this film, about a few wax copies of the father and Hermana, in a film "robot" in a city as a molesting robbery of a mummy. On the heels of the police, two-year television icons seek to find those behind the crime to clear their names. Seeing to wear it as late (a small highpoint in the movie), the father has been converted into a bat several times with a wire (once Herman flies to Transylvania with his often flyer miles invoke in some way) and the most annoying relative "The Phantom" hilarious advertising badge and breaks it! It's hard to clarify what is most grievous: Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis are so attractive on every scene and indifferent to the material. Do the robotic hockey costumes of these school-produced values ​​look at them? Perhaps this is a ridiculous script. Sid Cesar's naked, basically groundless antics. Perhaps a super K-Mart sees something that brings joy and treason to me as a child treated for fashion makeup. Despite such a conclusion in terms of Münster standards, it ultimately creates disappointment and dissatisfaction. As for the remainder of the remainder, Yvonne De Carlo is considered to be the most important role (although there is more than just an autopsy for a woman with her age and experience). K. C. Martell is unpleasant Eddie Munster. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings appears and acts like the Phantom mentioned above and talks the most absurd. There is also a real sense of cheapness for the film, made for the movie.
