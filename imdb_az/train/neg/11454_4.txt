So, I did not have much expectations about the start of this film, but even those meetings failed. Even though some of the funny parts are laughing at the high part of one or two voices, this movie dropped very shortly what it says. The funniest jokes were unexpected and very fast, leaving us sitting there and saying "WTF was not alone?" In addition, it was just dragged and there were a few jokes ten and then. The falling part of the mountain made me fall. And the editing was really incomplete. There were some poor scenic transitions, but these days seem to be styles. It made me laugh, but I still do not want to watch it, and I'm so glad I was expecting to rent it. Give it a chance, you can do it, but do not think that you are anything along the 40-year-old virgin or Superbate lines.
