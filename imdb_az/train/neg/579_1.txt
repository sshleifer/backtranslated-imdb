Listening to the director's commentary confirmed that I was skeptical when watching the film: this is a movie made by a man who wants to shoot a movie. The site is outdated after teenagers are able to write a "book / script / award-winning sitcom". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He does not seem to act as the actors need, but keeps the scenario in his hands, pointed to the camera, and told them to report it. Who knows, with a little workout, these actors have made themselves better (what can be said about the musicians in the film, Jon Bon Jovi Row is more acceptable than your Boat and Leading Man). <br /> <br / Stop, there is no chemistry casting. Bon Jovi's character is a wonderful opportunity to use the par with the classic sex and vampireism to instill the character of Bondi Jovi's hunter vampire with his illness, giving him a transplant. He finished it. If you think about it, the rest of the film resembles one another. The only real moments of sexual tension between two women potentials coincidentally coincide. Initially, this silent sequence was intended to be used as an excuse for a more meaningful plot exposition, so it was thought that the finished product would be worse. But not many. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, movies are increasingly in bad form, foolish and unforgettable. Nude movies, though, are not sexy enough and are not strangely enough to be entertaining. It could have been a fun and bloody minority, but the director was left with more comedy than for all the wrong reasons.
