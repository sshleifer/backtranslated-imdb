Do not waste your time watching! Unless you want to learn the wrong thing you should not do to make a good movie. I will not be able to review a movie again, but it's not personal. They lost my precious time that they could not give back. I have to write this report, and I do not waste time telling others. If this were a pupil project I would say bad, but for the first 15 minutes ... then it becomes annoying. screaming, bad sound, bad video (a good camera man could do better). Yes, what is the effect of Blair-Witch? no budget? I hope you will be better, but it does not. How is Hell now 4? 2 is more fair, but it's 1 to cancel my time! I told my peace.
