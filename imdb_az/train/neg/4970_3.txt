Well, nations, when I assessed the documents, I shouted at this movie in the evening. My academic qualification is Anglo-Saxon literature, and almost no one has ever seen the worthy honor of this genre. Icelandic "Beowulf and Grendel" is the most attacking I've ever seen, and I paid $ 3.00 for my copy. This Sci-Fi version is ranked by the version of Christopher Lambert. Yuck. <br /> <br /> What did I like? For CGI one. It's strange. More importantly, to avoid styling, the story's fidelity. I'm using it with all the versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Peter
