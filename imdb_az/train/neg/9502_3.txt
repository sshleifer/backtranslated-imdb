It was strange, completely unobtrusive and hysterical to watch with friends when drinking in a big empty house. I love the livelihoods that Lisa has lost in a magnificent city. I do not want to be a good stranger lost in some exotic European space, perhaps not to reduce budgetary horror. Complete the definitions of non-sexual sex scenes (anyway on my DVD). Do not try to understand, just go and look at strange bits ... everything is. Do not follow it if you really want to trick or characterize or anything to be meaningful. Very nice, but you can only refuse it and say that it is a real horror film like Dead Alive.
