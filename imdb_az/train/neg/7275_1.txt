"The National Lampoon Goes To Movies" (1981), the worst movie, and no foolish "Plan 9 Outside Space". The Lampoon film takes part in three separate and unrelated vignettes representing different performers. <br /> <br /> Yes, maybe one. He said that the naked shots that were another review on the site were beautiful and that was true. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry assets, sometimes in one, and the other in the assets. But their glamorous looks are sad. Directors seem to have forgotten that they need a reliable story to cover T & A. <br /> <br /> The third part is Robbie Benson's and Richard Widmark's, the most disgusting thing, and the wave of this film is a failure. Benson is playing an exciting young police officer, on the first day of his job, getting ready to escape the evil streets. She was pairing with old, cynical police, played by Widmark, and felt the possible failure of the film's previous failures when the oil-and-water partners set off their first patrol. Perhaps, maybe the old old timer will be renewed with the task and loyalty of the new partner. Maybe all will be happy. But, unfortunately, this film is headed straight to the toilet, there is no endless, happy ending, no related story. <br /> <br /> "The National Lamp is Going to Film" from Hollywood, perhaps the worst shock I have ever seen. Unfortunately, I did not see half of it. <br /> <br />
