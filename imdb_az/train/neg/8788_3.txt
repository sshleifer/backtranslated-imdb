A potentially attractive and fresh low-key story is a shame when it initially drives you to pay attention to your interests, and then gradually sneaks up more and more. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton was not guilty; it was a pleasure to see the return of a new movie once again, perhaps a bit wrinkled perhaps looking but still managing to give a strong and sincere performance. As a man who recently died, his spouse is cautious with his wandering spirit in the next life (not a new idea) and appears to be in contact with the funky electric fuzz case you see on the television screen. The spirit that communicates through the air is called the EVP (Electronic Voice Fenomena), and there are so many people who believe in the fact, so I will not comment on what I think. When it comes to buying such fantastic movies, I say that I'm about to stop all the curses, but I can not stand that I do not understand the idea that hell will take place, when the loans finally began to spin. <br /> <br /> Sometimes movies are similar to a similar movie, but if a movie does not reveal anything to me, I think it's a filmmaker. I did not watch it myself (when I was tired of focus or something). Yes, I was very awake, shiny, and wavy tail for GUESS - so who's guilty?
