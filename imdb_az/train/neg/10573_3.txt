In my school, I was exposed to this film for a relationship class. As we have seen, it is not something attractive and something new. However, the father is trying to be genuine by reflecting the problems with his father instead of his father. There was an interesting aspect for this, but in fact it is not unique, in fact, nothing else in this movie is original. In every movie we have, the oldest brother of our beloved is the main character, there is something against him, there is a long-awaited mother in the house, and that he hurt more and dusted him. Then the girl has parents who want everything and expect everything to be perfect. Like the story, I said it was interesting, but not the best player in the whole game and the lack of good writing or story writing. Everything about it starts to communicate with a small child in school, comes together, gets into a sexual relationship, and then we have a little child. Perhaps it would be great if the writing was better and I knew that the move was improving. Leatherface and his chain have earned more emotion and more than any actor in this movie, and Leatherface Movies shocked and saddened. The only exciting teenage pregnant girl I've ever seen is Juno. The funniest side of this serious situation, which is currently in the same situation, has become even more entertaining. In my opinion, the original films of these films pay attention to a teenager, but instead of paying attention to the father's drama, but still the originality does not save the movie. Indeed, someone decides to make a movie with a good cast and a better writer or to make another movie, because it's a waste of potential.
