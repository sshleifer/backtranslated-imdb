<br /> <br /> I'm looking for a favorite, simple comedy to have time to prove that this movie is a big mistake to choose. <br /> <br /> I can not write a good thing about it. First, the script is generally foolish and funny, based on tired, laughing, repeating jokes and farting turtle. <br /> <br /> In my book it's not funny, it's a pity. <br /> <br /> Low budget 'effects' with horrible cinematography (even I can give effect to them). <br /> <br /> In many places it feels like an indie movie with almost no money. <br /> Actress ... I apologize for the actors. Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards are not desperate for some of the money they have agreed to attend? <br /> <br /> Pamela does not like her age and generally sexual as well, it's not funny. <br /> <br /> The film is not so bad-it-is-funny. <br /> Do not miss it!
