There are so many gaffes and goofs that you can not even bother to recognize the hero and hero. <br /> <br /> Vermont Airport is surrounded by palm trees. <br /> <br /> Benin is a miraculous form of phone call. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> There is a decent story hidden behind a very bad film. But even if you are dealing with technical shortcomings, do a pitiful move and cast. I was most interested in playing an actor to play the right wing devout weaker brother. <br /> <br /> I welcome the writer / producer / producer / editor / star / dining / dentist / composer (and whatever else), hitting his cat cat, in order to actually get a movie like this) . If there's anything better, this fun band can be a movie or a drink, but you do not hire a powerful story about homophobia and gay marriage.
