Okay, I remember watching the first, the boy sucked it. After watching this, I just laughed and said to myself, "Oh boy, another low-budget B-movie, I will not see a part 2." Then came to the second part about 1 1/2 years later. She ate more. But he still laughed and said, "I will see part of this part three times." Then, about 1/2 years later, the third part came out. It was a fool enough to hire her and a boy, and after I looked, I realized. God, I have never really seen how many films he can shoot these days. Just save yourself $ 7.50 and do not rent the entire series. Believe me, it's worth every penny.
