Treasure Island DVD should be viewed at any movie production course! This is a manual example of how to make a movie. Shows the timeline between watching the movie and then listening to the writer / director's commentary, what he knows about heroes, and those related to their audience. Call me old, but think of movies as a means of communication, and if the audience does not know what the director is talking about, communication is incomplete. The direct purpose of the director is to make a film of "Hollywood Conventions" a waste of time. Among these conventions, unfortunately, the consistency and consistency of the concept. The director himself explains that viewers frequently do not understand where the Hollywood cliff is inevitable. But for some reason there is no reason to think that there are clich√©s. Stenographers to deliver complex ideas quickly and clearly. It is good to avoid them, but they are not simply eliminated, but should be replaced by another way of communicating with that idea. It is based on an interesting premise, rich in movie potential. Two puppets are set up to prepare a personality and background for an unidentified body that will be used in a disinformation mission during the last days of the Second World Day of Resistance. Soon each one begins to fill their own fantasy character and their invention becomes even more real. Someone who has less respect for the Hollywood Conventional Book of Traditional Book has created a beautiful movie with this idea. This movie is of course not! These puppets do their best to match these characters, but they are often overwhelmed by dazed and mixed scripts. Especially, I'm increasingly impressed with Gonzo, who plays the live funeral. In many muppet films, it is always a very charismatic puppet.
