First, I am not America or the Middle East. Secondly, I have no religion. The closest thing to my religion is the sport and the movie. <br /> <br /> Moreover, I will be fine, and I will serve the most nervous and unbiased opinion. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are completely disgraceful. This terrible event should be used to commemorate all innocent people killed by some "barbarians" and "uncivilized morons". Instead, most of the things I've seen in these short films have tried to value different political points. Examples: <br /> 1) Ken Loach's Segment. Of course, this man had a difficult life in his country, but what was his relationship with innocent victims of 2001? Do not justify two mistakes? Whatever! <br /> <br /> 2) Youssef Chahine's segment, which is very uncomfortable. Obviously, it is logical. Because Americans are democracies and some Americans have sided with politicians in the government, and then all Americans are responsible for the actions and decisions of their leaders in the Middle East. Helloooo! Is this man true? Some Americans do not vote! Some Americans do not know where the Middle East is; some did not know what religion was there; and the majority do not know the real political issues behind the scenes. # # # Mr. Chahine, the reason for all these problems in the world is that you have many people with your logic. Twin Towers' innocent victims came from all over the world. Deadly rescuers, rescuers, office workers, supporters and passengers have nothing to do with politics. However, "some" people are not allowed to go to our lives because we think everyone should choose one side or one religion. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed its bomb victims. Another filmmaker uses this event to push himself to the political agenda. Sometimes, this is not about you. Some people always think about "me, me, my." <br /> 4) Idrissa Ouedraogoun's segment is a joke and another political point scorer. Obviously, they want the money from the international community, emphasizing their poverty. <br /> <br /> This film criticizes the memory of the victims of "September 11, 2001". <br /> <br /> The best thing to do is TRASH CAN.
