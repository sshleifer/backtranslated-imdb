Ho-hum. An inventor (Horst Buchholz) creates the danger of fatal biological weapons falling into the wrong hands. It is unknown that his son (Luke Perry) works on all the grave. Enter the CIA agent Olivia d'Abo and cat-and-mouse car driving and start the gunfire. The cast also includes Tom Conti, Hendrick Haese and the old Roger Moore. Moore will certainly not go through one of her best efforts in this confusion. Perry will welcome the supporters. d'Abo is wrong for the role, but it looks amazing.
