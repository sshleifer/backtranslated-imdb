It's just like the 6th movie. The film is really bad. There is nothing in the Death Department. One-liners are bad and NO NO should be a movie. Freddy comes as a happy child in the whole film. Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that creates this value. These characters have developed very little. Everything is better, better than the 6th class, but still the worst films in the series. Rating 2/10
