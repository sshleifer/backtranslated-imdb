It can not be the worst movie of Peter Sellers (I think this horror will go to the Zenda Prison) but, of course, the most striking. Sellers, especially Nyland Smith, seem to have just undergone a new chemotherapy. Like Fu Manchu, when he falls under the weight of all this makeup, he looks so good and spends most of the film (except for strange scenes that are caught with electric currents). Supporting players seem tired and run away and Sid Ceser's Chinks! (A brilliant point: this is a big movie that will show off a great deal of insult to the Asians ... or it will be shown as an Asian star!) The film is striking with stunning photography and merry sets - even at the end of the charming Elvis number, a long, gentle, frustrating man who only stunning Helen Mirren and his pants, adds a spark to this sad work, in general, this movie is a great comic a document that has accelerated his death and death.
