When discussing suicide, murder, power and tension, such a topic is not discussed. Sometimes it is interesting. <br /> <br /> The development is like a tea drinking ceremony. Visuals are not stunning, they are good enough to make eye strain easier. A good movie to watch after eating before dinner - very shocking, ovucuxciting nothing. The style of the movie sitcom. <br /> <br /> Woody liked me - excellent performance. We had to deal with the shortage of the field and did a great job. While the rest is predictable, it is severe. Better than all television shows and can be watched.
