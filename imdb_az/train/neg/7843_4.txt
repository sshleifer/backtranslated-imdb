<br /> <br /> This is a weak one: almost every aspect of the spectacular "Man Fire Horse" has no interest or warmth, and does not look the same to each other. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In this film the tribe is lost and abandoned, lost their homeland, attacked paradise on a modern day and they live in pernicious suffering and poverty. Maybe this is the point: the first movie took a lot of time to the place we wanted. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the broken Hindus in a troubled world, and White Man is a hero and savior who reflects all the ideas of the film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the first man has been learned by the white man, and he has discovered that true civilization is more than Western materialism. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
