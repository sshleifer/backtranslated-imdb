I finished a marathon of this series and was suffering from this progress. From the heroicity of historical elements, in the next episodes, O'Herlihy's terrifying emphasis is on the show. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> If you are looking for a good quality WW2 world wide I can offer season 1, but then avoiding something goes down as a step from a soap opera with linearity and sensitivity to a bad story going on. <br /> <br /> Old B & W is the best of any kind of entertainment added to Colditz and can not even hope for it.
