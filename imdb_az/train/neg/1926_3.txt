When I was forced to watch it for at least 10 occasions by my children for each of the last 2 Christmases, I feel that I have enough qualified Dr Seuss to decide on this version of the classic fairy tale ... well. First, the animated film, like Chuck Jones, will be difficult for anyone after a special classic move, but this pressure is too heavy and inconvenient and positively regulated. I think there are a few inspirational sticks, but in general, the film is considered to be at the same time talking about Milad's commercialization. Jim Carrey is usually above the top, but it is totally contrary to the character of Grinch. It was slowly burned, as Boris Karloff characterized; methodical and neat. Carrey has no way of madness, and that's just the obvious mistake. Actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Kristin Baranski are completely frustrated here. Why, Universal, why? That is, I understand that Tony Hopkin will take any role (most, like the host, Michael Kain), but it should be opened under "Never Found in Film". It's a good twist for the Cat in the Hat, the gentle that makes Universal prepping for Christmas. I feel as if I'm with me the same thing: skip it or read a book or watch a special TV. It will never come back, it's 2 hours.
