Joe Don's opening line said everything about this movie. It is on the island of Malta (the island of miserable people) and Joe Don Baker is watching an Italian mobster. Joe Don's character is called Geronimo (Heronimo is proclaimed) and all his work in this film is to hit people and arrest more. Everyone in the movie hates him as everyone hates Gregory Clark. I liked the form of Greydon earlier, "Angel's Revenge", because she was shirne for the thriteen old boys. Do not shoot any movies!
