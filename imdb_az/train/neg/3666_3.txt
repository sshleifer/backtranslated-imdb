This is a mixed film. It's hard to watch a movie and it does not mean just one thing. Wolfman's anger was created in Spain, and I think that if any movie is dubbed from one language to another, it will not be translated as it was originally intended. Maybe it's part of the problem, but I can take into account all the problems with this film. The Dubbing is pretty bad and the sounds are not very well suited to the characters. The scenes are awesome, and there is a strange and irrelevant character that makes the viewer less and less confused. What I like about this film is Wolfman himself and his scenes. If they could now put it somewhere and give it a meaning, something could have happened. Do not waste your time on this.
