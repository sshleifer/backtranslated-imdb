After seeing credits that I know and promoting in this movie (Russ Conway), I did not expect this movie anymore, and I was not disappointed. A man plans to kill a new spouse by convincing other people that he is crazy and self-conscious. Her husband does not know that she uses a plastic-looking skull, but rather a woman's dream, the first dead spouse has revenge on her mind and uses a real skull. Finally, a simple area that is twisted. If you need a night's sleep and sleep, it will help you to fall asleep.
