One of our group really hated this movie. We were ready to forgive if the character we love is Joi (writers / producers could not do anything about it). The script was weak, the script was sub-par. What really made us worry: 1. When two children realized that they were together with Natalie, they just came up to this foolish (and ultimately unfair) competition - not because they were rivals because they really wanted Natalie. 2. Although Natalie suddenly likes one of the children and is now ready to marry, even though he can not choose between two boys before reuniting? (and he did not provide any information that he was a really good man, the writers turned a coin and then left it at a few favorable moments). 3. Blair is thinking about how he does not want his children, and then he wants to have her husband give birth, and she is happy to talk to her, and happily agrees with her.
