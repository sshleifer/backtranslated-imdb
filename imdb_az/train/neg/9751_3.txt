The only reason why this film is less than 3 stars is because of a film like Manos: Fate Hands. One of the biggest killings of this film is dull and terrible and ruthless English. The premiere of this film is a promising perspective, with all the teleporting notion, but the direction they go with is completely uninteresting. It was a film about financing more research and community than laser prediction. The actors were wooden, unusual and boring. Just as there was love between two scholars - something interesting. Because I did not have chemistry, I could not understand what the attraction was. Neither did I understand that the man looking at her husband decided to kill anyone she met. At least I now know that before I cut off my research costs, they should give everyone a fair hearing, and kill something else with a funny hand.
