Veteran sleazeball Bruno Mattei reflects Joel Schumacher's 8MM, which is new to erotic tension. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> After her daughter was kidnapped her mother entered the dark world of underground pornography while the independent customers had to pay well, the traffickers belonged to an international organization of direct snuff films. Her search for her daughter leads to prostitution, not to Europe. She lies with several children to get her clues. <br /> <br /> Finally, when a mysterious doctor contacts Hades's engagement partner, he is in great danger. <br /> <br /> It is not good to talk about it. The point is that the film is not sleazy or unclear, as the filmmaker is expecting from the film director. SNUFF TRAP (for the first time in Russia!) It is neither glorious, nor is it a fact of nudity and sex to pay attention to the audience. The area is not specific, except perhaps the most striking places in various parts of Europe. It is extremely disappointing. Except for Anita Auer, who plays Doctor Heather, acting is not really remarkable: He looks and acts very diligently. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, SNUFF TRAP addresses only Bruno Mattei collectors. But still, I like to see the fashionable: the Thriller for GLI OCCHI DENTRO for the first time since 1994.
