I waited for this movie to play a great deal. This film will be described more closely as a "Christmas Box" based on Richard Paul Evans' book. I have sent many emails to my friends and family, hoping they will understand a small part of my "new" life. After seeing this movie, I was very disappointed. In November 2003, just like a mother who lost only one child and knew of the pain, I really hoped that this movie would illuminate parents who think "I think" that this film understands the sadness that a parent has lost. This movie was a very light film and Diane Keaton's calm was a slap in front of parents who buried a child. It was very realistic to stop it from the start. After the film, I had a few calls, not everyone was the same: "It was out of the reach and as soon as I got off the road, it showed me that the songs on the radio were coming back, and the life of the bull, obviously, the director and Keaton never lost his child, I would not want the movie to be dismissed.
