In the meetings and performances, I saw little enough of Richard and Leon was poor enough to access music bio pics in the 50s and 60s to find out that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was as correct as David Ruffin in these temptations, but in this film Little Richard was completely unsuccessful to grasp the essence. <br /> <br /> Actor Miguel Nunez, who plays Little Richard, "Why have the love of the fool?" it was a more appropriate choice by pulling the musician's powerful but effeminate persona. <br /> <br /> If the speeches are unbelievable, the movie will also be there. And that is what happens here. Completely impeccable or kidnapped LR's focus on homosexuality and voyeurism. <br /> <br /> <strong> "The Temptations" is a band that runs with the band, just as it does when it raises its wings and wagons. <br /> <br /> Starting with Robert Townsend, "The Hollywood Shuffle"? He is a talented, funny man, but he did not give anything to the first effort.
