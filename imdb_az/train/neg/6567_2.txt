I gave the best hope to this film. I usually love war music. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball have done well with their roles; However, the writers gave them a dull dialogue. There is no real increase in the interests of love between them; there was suddenly there. I did not think of music; The best number was the part I heard Spike Jones with "Der Fuhrer's Face". A complete number of Spike Jones is less than his great comedy comedy; Even the things that are quite appropriate with the monkey. Bert Lahr's comic sketches have come to an end. Lucille Ball was pretty cool and there were a few players who spent more time on the screen.
