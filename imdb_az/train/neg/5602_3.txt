"Pandemonium" is a shockingly frightening movie shock than comic. Believe me what I say, I love comedy. Especially comedy defects. "Aircraft", "Naked Gun" trilogy, "Beacon burning", "High Anxiety" and "Spaceballs" are my favorite comedies. "Pandemonium" is not about these films. Most of the scenes in the movie sat in silent silence because the whole movie was not funny. The film has a few laughs, but when you are watching a comedy, you are going to laugh a few times, and all this goes for it. Geez, "Scream" did not laugh more at this movie and it was more of a scary movie. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (four)
