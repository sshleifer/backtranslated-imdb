Unfortunately, when I was disturbed, the hate of the "The Witch" (Russian name) in the horrible Russian cinema gallery will take place. Nikolai Gogol is based on the classic "Vy" story in Russia. Here is the word "reasonable" because it does not know the story. Instead, you know less about Gogol, better. <br /> <br /> This is a unique production because we are very glad to receive stories from other cultures and adapt them to their own culture. The place of the American reactions of foreign films is a major example, but later Stursh Kurosava's Seven Samurai turned beautiful to the Holy Prophet, and Kurosawa Shakespeare transferred Macbeth to Japan to make a powerful throne, while King Lear was a rival Ran. But with The Witch, we transferred a Russian classical fairy tale to the American land of the Russians. The film was shot in English in Estonia with dubbing in English and synchronized lip movements. <br /> <br /> As a result, colorful Ukraine is a rooted cause for a lost event, but a small US city has been removed from an obsolete horror book. Xum Brutus's failure, instead of a journalist who frequently recalls Miss Boobs contests, who want to win the Pullitzer award and write about events like the X-Files. (The Pullitzer Prize was given for this type of writing, and now it is modest.) As a stupid Russian scientist, journalist is named after Ivan Berkhoff. It is more likely to be hackneyed, clichéd and general than this movie because it should give it John Smith name. <br /> <br /> Berkhoff goes to a city named Castleville, stuck in a dirty road, strangled until it finds a crooked house and is not fond of an old source. All of this is accompanied by the most powerful violence and people with good radio notification to stay inside and get out of the water. Should I note that there is a very heavy rainfall? After a horrific scene of a few laughs, the story finds a dressed journalist like a priest who is wrong for a priest, and the local sheriff tells his daughter that she was killed after a brutal assault, three nights. At this point the motion starts approximately. Those who have time to kill do so. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this movie? Everything is done from dialogue and from top to bottom. The Russian-language dialogue was originally written in English, and it was composed of clips and platitudes taken from American films only. The act was clearly spoken in English, as the time of their speeches was unusual and followed Russian dubbing. The player, on the other hand, is very strange and not just because players find it difficult to speak, but because there is nothing close to their facial expressions. In most cases, they are just empty or wish. The only exception is Arnis Lizitis, a sheriff starring a beautiful Estonian actor Lembit Ulfsak and a wheelchair living in the state of Castleville. Oh, and of course, there is a natural cock on the camera! I know that actors complain of dogs and cats being defeated, but Nikolaev is a sad expression of the overall quality of the movie when he meets a cock. <br /> <br /> There was not a moment of fear in the film, and there was no original moment in the film. Please note that this comment comes from those who are more inexperienced than horror. The film is packed with standard movements used in the film, from the beginning of the genre. At a critical moment, the cameraman's lover stands on a kerosene lamp. The lamp switches off immediately. He had seen a few scary movies. A high mistake comes at another time, the character is dropped from the bathtub and works in the camera. There is something visible like pattern! <br /> <br /> In Russia, those who love it should be presented as a mystical tension. I was thrilled. Designed from start to finish. The whole population of the small town, especially as they knew they were living in a poisoned film, were not sure if they were zombies. That's why some have acted as zombies. <br /> <br /> The creators of the film say that they believe in faith. Such horrible actions, foolish moments, and yes, clichés are not worthy of finding faith. The film is very good and completely fake, just worth the exhibit at the Honeymoon Museum.
