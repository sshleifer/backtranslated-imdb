I love the time, I like my action, but watching a movie that looks like I'm looking at a coke glass gives me headache. If I played computer games that are stupid and out of focus, I would upgrade my computer. This could have been the director's appearance, but it did not hurt your eyes and you want to leave it in 10 minutes. If I did not take this movie with me, I got out of it. In short, it is not a movie, though "Brothers Band" completed it. They gave a similar look to the WWII shooting, with only a touch of touch, but it was still pleasant to watch. Movies, real people, and real people with realities are needed; Use CGI when it's appropriate, not for the entire movie.
