What was this heck. Some of them read Stephen King and Sartre at the same time. We are getting a mixed exit warehouse with cheap fears. There were moments of horrifying music, CGI, or anyone else who was in trouble. <br /> <br /> Such strange narrative problems are lazy. Even David Lynch's work is similar to his work and works far beyond his exciting shows and movies. And, unfortunately, this is only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> The player was tempted and limited about it. I think it touches the feelings of our youth and we all have only the fears, but the characters do not like to be interested in their victories. The final scene makes all things uncertain.
