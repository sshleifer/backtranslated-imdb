This is a great appeal to a relatively well-defined group (I'm not partial). I went to a glance without knowing what the film was waiting for - at last I found disappointment. Very intolerable (often obviously "twisted") The history of the Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea. An epic epic like this should really provide more of the audience at the end. As a result, such pictures refer to the human condition - this picture did not give any new light to its more meaningful aspects.
