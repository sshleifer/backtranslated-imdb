The Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi channel I've ever seen (though it's now called "Syfy"). But from now on, I've seen one or two others, and I told you that they were foolish, but it really cuts the barrel down. The CGI is weak, the value is bad, the scenario is ridiculous, and the end is unexpected and comes out of the way (you know Dragon Fighter, you know, I did not want to put spoiler in my eyes). Moreover, there was this music melody used in every dangerous sequence. It was really stupid; they stole again and again. And this is definitely not the original; I know somewhere before (I just do not remember). This is something to avoid.
