I watched this movie a long time ago (aprox 10 years or more) and then liked it. Today I also remembered and decided to watch again. It was a pleasant second time around. Because the actor is 'reminder', conspiracy is unreasonable, groundless, and predictable. <br /> <br /> Operation ... I'm sure these players do not have an extension to play these characters. Evidence ... There is no way in Hell that women have dropped to the 2nd level with the first robbery. (note: Why TT did not know where he was going to be, even if the money had been loaded on the court's deadline, and he would not have any logical answer!) Ding, Ding ... has a crook!). Black women say that black women in black can often be stolen by "blackbirds" or a large amount of money, telling them not to steal and use their intelligence or other resources. In her husband's death, everybody's death (bar Jada) plays a lot, but does not grieve (you think, 'They were too stupid, they have a right to die). <br /> <br /> I do not believe the price of this movie is more than 5.
