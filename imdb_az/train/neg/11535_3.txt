Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, controlled, career choosing Danny Dyer, a working class oik for a fun night. After a stupid accident in the village, they are a brutal attack. <br /> <br /> I thought the Straightheads was terrible, after one of the attackers recovered after they recovered. <br /> <br /> I thought the Straightheads was awful. Torture, cruel, intolerable and unpleasant. If I did not like the word very much, I would call the "Straightheads" video as ugly. Of course, in the dark days of the 1980s, it was a film that was not directly related to budget freedom. Frankly, I do not know how the Straightheads movie theater is. <br /> <br /> I'm not prude. I'm not against sex and violence in movies, but they have to marry a movie with a) good plot or b) good character, or c) with both. What was Straightheads? There is no progress in the field or the heroes, and is not very clear and unreadable. Fortunately, "Straightheads" went fast anywhere. It was just 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It was a shame, because here in the last 3 years there was a mix of interesting film sequentially interesting. How often I say that, but it would be good if it was done in a good way. What a shame. I like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they did not hide anything in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good English revenge movie, rent or buy Shane Meadows "Dead Man Shoes". This is a small work. Last weekend, I did not see his "English" cost. Ce sera sera ...
