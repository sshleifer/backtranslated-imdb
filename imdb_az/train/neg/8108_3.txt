After reading a book that contained a lot of meaning for me, the film did not give me a sense of transmitting the book. This was a book I liked Kaufman because he was successfully transformed into something else. Or it's just bad. Most importantly, where is lightness? On the first stage, most music has been drowned by dialogue and feeling, which continues through the film. The creators think that with the mild music playing with the singer's film, it illuminated the story, but here it was completely unsuccessful. Instead, music gives everything that the film feels like events are dramatizing because everything really gets worse. <br /> <br /> An example of this adaptation failure sometimes makes the storyline more dramatic. In the film, we see France passing through Thomas in paradise to see Sabina. <br /> <br /> The introduction of this chance meeting in the book places more emphasis on Thomas's story. <br /> <br /> There are many other examples that have changed the story, for the worst, but it's not just a movie because it's Kundera's style. Do all the generous reviewers on this site write more books and movies than just writing about the movie? For a long time, a film is not shot. For those who have not yet read the book I recommend reading it. Here's what I have to say for you, who will end up writing down warnings for your time and probably staying here.
