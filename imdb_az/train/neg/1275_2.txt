This is a terrible film. All three stories are not necessary by the psychiatrist's hypnotist line, and all stories are bad. First, there are some things about wild worms and some ladies, but the issue of hypnosis is for this. Secondly, bad Bill Paxton can not be seen by anyone like a numerous guest room. The latter, unfortunately, is the best thing to do, which makes it better than other wastes.
