Sometimes it's a bad movie to appreciate the good ones. Yes, that's my opinion. <br /> <br /> Everyone in this battle will be in a bad movie category, because Shu Qi's performance was terrible. <br /> <br /> Martial Angel, his girlfriend Chi Lam (Julian Cheung), two years ago. However, his past returns to pursue Chi Lam's pursuit as it was abducted for the ribbon of a security program belonging to Cat. To save him, he calls his ex-friends from days of his own children's homes to save the days, and other six slender women ... <br /> <br /> I could say these words with joy, but this is a cheese story. In fact, the entire script and the direction were not of any quality. The majority of the dialogue was meaningless and merged with a delicate substance as rice paper in the water. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> If I summed it up, pull out the movie Jackie Chan, remove the comedy, take the choreography, throw the budget and have Martial Angels: a piece of work that is not an illusion. <br /> <br /> Mind, I have to give credit to the place where the loan is, and Shu Qi was probably the only person who did not get hurt from the terrible action. Okay, I can not say that she is perfect - because she has nothing to do - but she managed to dig some of her characters. <br /> <br /> <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < The scenes and dialogue were totally unnatural and unbelievable, they did not try to clean the edges and clean the blue mask mask, make a camera with multiple endurance in battlefield scenes, poor and unusual camera angles <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a very culinary idea. Probably, the budget exploded very eagerly for seven babies on the same silver screen. <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Charlie's Angels, this is not it. In fact, while the sisters could do that for themselves, none of them really seemed to be here. <br /> <br /> Do not forget the sad thing.
