I guess this movie is based on a real story .... Two young girls who beat a grown man for 48hrs. I do not see where the terror is played ... There are some "strange" and "surreal" sequences in the movie, and two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh good) are playing two psycho-man's ... a pretty good job (although some of them are over a hill), the movie is not good, and it's not horrible, it's really historic! I would like to say that this is dropping to 70 ... If you love such things, it's really not bad ... do you know that?
