This movie creates, writes, controls, and produces creepy. But this is really half an observable. <br /> <br /> The character of The Barney Drum is just a real comic relief in the film and gets tired after about 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many Canadian-backed players said they could be found on television commercials. Not everyone else was aware of that. And of course Sly Stallone is a less talented brother ..... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Trivia: It is almost entirely drawn in and around Claremont, the small Ont village. (about 20 miles from Toronto Torontos), many local underground passages / towns and buildings. I think Drive's scene was shot in "Oshawa Drive" before it was demolished now.
