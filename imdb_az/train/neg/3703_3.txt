I did not expect much from this movie, but boy and boy, I did not expect the movie to be bad. Chris Rock does not make a good move here, you can not feel the reality of the artist, I think the movie would have been better if drama or romance scenes were a part of the film, and more / better humor. The film is as bad as it is for filmmakers to do it. In the "change" they do not show a smile. This is a very bad movie! I gave three of her because she gave me some smile, but I never laughed at it!
