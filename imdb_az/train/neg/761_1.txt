Absolute trash. The reason for this is that it is terrible, not because it goes beyond the formula, but because the plot is simply miserable. <br /> <br /> The verbal star did nothing to solve the case - nor did anyone really exist - this is a recurring police case. Generally tiring. <br /> <br /> You hoped for a twinkle and you had a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> As you can see, there was much potential to have a kidnapped brother. Will LT's personal presence finally cease? <br /> <br /> It was a stranger who did all the obvious signs. However, a genius, such as Lt C, constantly chatted with her husband, and slowly uncovered a fraudster who was dealing with a tape recorder playing in the showroom, a masked bride surprised the bride, hides her body, and then gave her gentle clues. It would be good. It was a waste of time.
