While some post-graduate students are unlikely to read these comments, I would like to give some tips from the viewer's perspective (free!). If you want to seriously make an exotic adventure movie, do so. If you want to make a parody of exotic adventure movies, go ahead. Do not try to do both at the same time, it does not work. For example, a brown "comic relief" character looks like it was a movie that was killed and cut off, and a monkey shake a tree and leave a coconut at the top of a cannabis, just what it was like an IDEA. This is a dull, tangled, cheap, racist ... picture. A few clever moments and a few glimpses from Kathy Shower are nervous (it's a very prissy way here) that is a tough one. There is a reason for everyone to forget about the existence of this film. (* 1/2)
