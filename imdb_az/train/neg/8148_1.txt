Do you miss anything here? This "adaptation" has everything that Brookmyres has in his first novel. <br /> <br /> Everything except prisons is a part of laughs, black humor, political intrigues, character, structure and sense. <br /> <br /> It will end. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > Three hours of adaptation and they seemed to push for up to 90 minutes. (Even if it lasted for 90 minutes). Please do not write Brookmyres books (especially the "Land of the Blind").
