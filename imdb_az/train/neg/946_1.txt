Why is this show so popular? That's why people are. One of the worst sitcoms I have ever had. <br /> <br /> Because this is so popular, I've tried to track it many times and will not be able to do it through an episode. <br /> In short, the actor is terrific. Everyone is in love with the point where he is teasing to watch. They speak unnatural sounds, use unnatural tones, and have a natural body language. <br /> <br /> For something else, FUNNY IS NOT. Areas are boring. They are creative, not smart or FUNNY. Should a sitcom be funny? <br /> <br /> Finally, what about seventy? <br /> <br /> According to Eynulla Fatullayev, she is valid for the 70s, as it did for the 50s of the "Caucasian days". What has happened with EN and Ashton Kutcher? Who carried that lonely dweeb? Now he is filming? <br /> <br /> If people think that this is a good quality television, it's bothering me.
