For nearly 40 years, the writer Jack London has enjoyed as much adventure and event as possible. This 90-minute movie resembles a biography of a person's life, but it's definitely edited, and remains a very mature story for a contemplative and contemporary retelling. Here Michael O'Shea describes London in one of his first roles and his performance is both solid and sympathetic. It's not a problem here. Young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, his future wife, Charmie, in London, her biography is the basis of this film. The life of London is divided into a number of episodes where the film is skipped lightly. There are short stories like a oyster pirate in London, a sealer at the Bering Sea, a gold scout in Yukon and a correspondent in the Russian-Japanese War ... The colorful events, of course, are deeply treating. And Alfred Santellin (in 1939, directed Susan's first film, "Our Leading Citizen") is the best spot to be spotless. It's hard to make things worse with a very poor quality DVD, an old-fashioned print source and a hissy sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental for me was one of the DVD's additions: a catalog of all Alpha video films, hundreds of hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie posters. Come on, these movies are better than Jack London.
