I saw the DVD (known as KORRUPS in this format), and the title on the cover was as great as Harvey Keitel's character as Frankin played "BAD LIEUTENANT". "This mighty and powerful police regret". What's important is that it was an old Italian movie. How old is Theo? When a character plays a music CD, it puts a huge plastic pancake on it, puts it in a rotating oven causing a kind of mechanical arm to touch a pancake thing and causing it to be heard. I'm talking about being an old movie. It was a DVD that was made 20 years ago. It is also a film with poor production values, as well as many other Italian films reflecting American films. Except for Keitel, Johnny Rotten's performance is not terrific; cinematography is static with impressive picture and sound quality following my fourth generation pirate copy (though I do not know) is a bad DVD or a very bad movie) and the worst Ennio Morricone account. <br /> <br /> KORRUPT can not convince a person who has accidentally interfered with an interference. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, KORRUPT understands all this. There is no great psychological tension at all, but my interests were caught and Keitel, as always, had a good performance as a fierce silence police. The rest of the film, unfortunately, did not meet its high standards
