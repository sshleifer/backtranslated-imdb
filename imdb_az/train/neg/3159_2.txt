Apologies, I have already written my thoughts on this movie, but today was the first day I looked at one of the other analyzes. There are many people who agree with me, but there are some people who really love this movie. I do not want to write bad comments or criticize other people's opinions, but I just want to warn everyone who is discussing whether to see this movie or not. This is not a good movie. I really love movies and watch just one thing, but this movie dropped me on an unusual short list of films I was watching and was happy to quit half. If you are really incredibly attractive, watch the trailer ... it's a mistake I do, because the whole movie is actually on the trader ... there is no surprise after that, it's a little shocking to talk about it. I love Aliasda Michael Vartan and I hate to criticize him, but it is my duty to stop other people who are wasting their lives in such a movie!
