Really terrifying, ambitious, endless film. Director Bellocchio appears to be deceived by his actress Detmers's pretty face and figure, and who blame her? But perhaps, maybe, he had to draw a little more attention to attracting his attention to a film. I hate it when it comes to being a "movie of art" to become more "respectable" than a sex film. Frequently, sometimes the hot sex scenes are the only reason for this film's existence. Whether it's worth staying in the rest of the painting or not is a matter of taste. (*)
