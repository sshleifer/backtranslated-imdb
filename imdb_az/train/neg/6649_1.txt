OK, honestly anyone who says that this movie is Great or Good is either delusional or director, writer and producer knows and tries to increase the votes in this movie. I watched the film because one friend was busy with this job, and it was terrible. I am an actress and have worked in industry for some time in big movies and even independently, and this film has torn me. The reason I'm tough is that the film is clearly different on the subject of "Rats and Men" and they should argue that this story is so horrific. Hollywood's a classic book and film "Mice and Men" is an industry that appears to be a Hollywood creative bankruptcy that makes me very wrong to shoot and destroy with a new spin. Actors, emphasis, dialogue, and directions were amateurs and their writing was upset. I do not want to say that an existing story is better or better than the original to justify a new spin. I did not like this movie.
