In short, this film is completely worthless. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​making a film in the sense that one of the early 1900s could think of the future. But it is an interesting idea, but the absence of a mandatory story or symbol prevents us from cursing, so flip the idea. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the entire film was filmed with actors in front of green screens, and we were sorry. But as a graphic man, it was an open stick to hide the problem of a sharp edge problem that was too soft to hide with green screening. Color is basically not affected by the reduction of visual quality. And I do not understand why nobody thinks that something in this movie is going to create a basis for any reason. If anything, the funny retrograd graphics have really dropped the bar down to the bad graphics - they do not measure up to the ancient Jurassic Park graphics. The robots were very simple, straightforward, and very inexpensive. <br /> <br /> There were some strange prehistoric animals in this island, but it was not explained in any way. Actually, I do not believe that I just did not go out of this movie. Relationships between Polly and Joe are incomparable, and the film is based on confidence and deception. Why is there Morris Paley? We are not sure Joe is hero in any way - I fly an airplane and a personal (Polly) means to get rid of personal reasons. Yes, there is a great hero for you. Dex has very little screen, so why should we care about Joe, who wants to rescue him? <br /> <br /> Why did Bai Ling cause the character? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Joe seizes stop robots? They were looking for vials and did not find them. (2) Why Dex will be seized in hell, but not killed (but did not know the vials and the bad guys did not know that Polly's vials were connected with Joe and hence Dex?) Polly shows that they "do not know anything about Totenkopf," but still has some secret source containing files that have a fairly full FBI style. (4) An empty space on the map depicted by Nepal - if they knew everything about this mysterious sphere, then why is hell at this point empty? (5) At some point, Polly and Joe have to leave their clothes (burnt) - New clothes, like Joe's old clothes, are given, but Polly is forced to wear a very stunning look. <br /> <br /> <strong> Poland <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <div> <div style = "text-align: justify ; "> <br/> And acting? Were we to be surprised by many bad English accents? Which characters are frustrating? Ling Bai's dialogue is the best in the entire movie (no single line). Dialogue was not camping and did not even go up to cheese level. Its just bad and boring. These people are not heroes or attractive; <br /> <br /> I do not believe that this movie will have an average rating above. <br /> <br /> <strong> IMDb. IMHO must compete with Batman Forever at all times.
