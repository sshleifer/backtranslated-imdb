is that something? Power Rangers vs. Freddy? This was originally viewed as a movie and was good, but heroes have become childhood in their dreams from the superpower. This shift must be evaluated at the PG or PG-13 instead of RG. I was planning to see a lot of competent materials, but it was 1/3 of the movie. The rest are for small children. Christianity is now paying much attention. I know Freddie is a devil, but there are many religions with different ways to fight the demons. Why Should All Be Christianity? It is full of Orientalism and white men / Western dominance. Do not watch, show small children who love power guards.
