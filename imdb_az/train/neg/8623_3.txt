This movie is about a police officer (Ching Wan Lau) trying to catch a super clever thief (Ekin Cheng) who blackmailed an insurance company led by Kelly Lin. Basically, any plan that stealing to the police knows them in advance. This movie, surrounded by beautiful film makers, a beautiful actress and a good camera layout for Hong Kong scenes, is not really a substance. It's all flash and the flash gets dull at a time. I lost all the interests of one third of the film, and there is no indisputable quality outside of cinematography, except for a good look. Imagine seeing this movie if you can just do it for free. Also, I'm going to stop watching the 20-minute movie, because it's the end of it: BORING. 6/10
