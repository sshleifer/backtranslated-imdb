This has been one of the worst movies ever. The field is as follows. For 10 minutes or more, drive through areas that look like jungle. Bo go somewhere and strip. Drive a little more through the jungle. Give another excuse. Return to the back. Oh wait! There is a guy looking for a Tarzan! Strip, Bo - strip. Kill the Safari people. Tarzan man has a battlefield. Bo keeps. Bo strips. Run your credit. Run your credit, run it.
