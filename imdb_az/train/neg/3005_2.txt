Slaughter High is specifically your emblematic 80s slasher flick. A geeky boy who leaves a player's hands burns angrily. A few years later the geeky man returned and began to kill people who were causing harm to him. Now the story can be interesting and entertaining, but what makes this sad movie in the 1980s different? <br /> <br /> The player's excitement is not as bad as he can really doubt. Even though every character in the film does not help to make it flawed and difficult. Lead, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is their greatest torment, and it is undoubtedly something that needs to be shared with compassion and roots. Undoubtedly, the geeky person is almost geeky and I think that even the stereotypical geeks themselves are frenzied and think only what geeky thinks. <br /> <br /> Has unwanted laughter potential. The shortage of Munro's ability to operate is quite clear and diminishes it with the rest of the horrible shot. But at least in the mid-30s, the film is a fun thing to do when working as a teenager to create Munro as a teenager. And then when life comes and Munro plays around her real age, the rest are not like the cast adults. All this is accompanied by a thundering heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and a "noisy" sound with a noisy theme song. As they say, Slaughter High is not really a very good flick, but a bad cat is worth the fun. Perhaps it is important for hardcore slasher fans, but I do not expect dilemma, tension or any credibility. Terrible !!!
