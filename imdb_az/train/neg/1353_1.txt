What is this? strange duplicate motifs (snails, glamorous temples, sweets and open racist music) that are not filled with any story or plot or character development. All of this struck me as a conscious "strange show" and I do not want to just say unusual castings. Hunter S. Thompson, or William S. Burroughs, has a feeling of a bad pickup that goes beyond the level of any drug. The only movie I can compare is Eraserhead (at least my favorite movie of all time), which was more regrettable, but what happened again? total loss of time. It's one thing to look at the inner work of a consciousness who knows the internal work of another's brain, and even somebody's chemical change, but still something else strange to me strange things.
