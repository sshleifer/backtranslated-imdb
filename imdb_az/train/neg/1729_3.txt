... and how did they drive you out? The Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD movies made with tireless desire to insure "noise" with no note actors, shameful script, angry direction and tired comedy. This film presents a paleontologist with a description of a sea dinosaur under the crater lake ... meteor falls from the sky, and the diversity of claymation, the irrigation dinosaur, begins to insult and eat the people around the crater lake. The whole issue is that Steve attracts the attention of our local sheriff. Most of the film - animal dish when it does not reflect the remaining blood pools - are spent after the bumbling antique managing Arnie and Mitch's two men's rental. As we look at a business sign, lines are too bad to win, Mitch, telling Arni, "You wrote incorrectly, B-A-T-E was written." There were very few laughs here. Then we got them drunk and imagined a tree trunk to be a dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy Wait! The dinosaur looks counterfeit, but the movie is in a bad mood. And at least the lake is beautiful.
