Stephen Feinberber, a proctologist and film writer, died at the beginning of 2006. Steve spoke in Portland in 1993 and said he was a writer in Hollywood last year. , mainly in television advertising. He asked me not to see the "Tunnel Vision", but it was too late, I've already seen! In fact, I first saw it a few years before its release. At that time I did not think it was a bad movie. Nevertheless, I felt as though I was an adult. Yes, a little patience, but also dated. Steve agreed that it was not a very good movie. He said he was proud of the Proctologist sketch.
