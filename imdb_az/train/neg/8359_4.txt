Despite a few minutes of heavy rainfall, one encounter with a drunken and an organ mill with a gypsy and monkey, and a sanitary stay, this Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle silent comedy Buster Keaton and Al St. John has a pretty funny sequence of Arbuckle's dragging the drum with Buster, the last one in his "favorite" scenes, since he has been a few times since we saw the great smile of Face Face and the Face of the Big Stone, but just enjoyable in the right way! In addition, many scenes may seem cut off, perhaps for cut-to-use. If you are still complementary to an Arbuckle or Keaton, Good Night, Nurse! certainly worth a visit.
