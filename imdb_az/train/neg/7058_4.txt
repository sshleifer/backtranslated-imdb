I was looking forward to a photographic film about the Kolumbin school massacre similar to Gus Van Santin ELEPHANT, and of course, a TV student instructed a negative impact on a sociopathic rebellion against the system, but this is a very boring movie, <br /> <br /> This story is about a Chicago high school student Maddox who decides to return to what he has accepted as an authoritarian regime. The biggest problem is that the actor's main character and the Blake Shields player are unable to frustrate any script deficiency. Maddox has a bad character of Hitler, Saddam and Bin Laden, but he is nothing but a sly aggressive teenager, and it is impossible to believe that every student can go to the rally. Your subtext means a manipulative authoritarian mode is just a deviation to replace it with another manipulation mode, meaning NEW PORT SOUTH means a completely unsatisfactory drama that does not need to go off
