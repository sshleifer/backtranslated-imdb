I was honestly thinking that Humble BJ (Director Bert Gordon, not a murdered rapper) was active in the 1980s! I have always done the horror of the horrors of the horror of the "Foreigners' Empire", but before my dirty little hands, the old and dusty VHS copy of The Coming is completely dark and invariably more or less pleasant surprise Witch movie! What started as an atmospheric fairy tale of the late Dark Ages takes a ridiculous turn when a villager of 1692 has been harassed by a girl from Salum, Massachusetts to the present day and to a girl in the history museum. As you can see, this girl is a reincarnation of Ann Putman, a generous evil girl in 1692, and is accused of over a dozen members of the community who have been executed in the state. The man who attacked Loreen had lost his wife and daughter and wanted his revenge. But who is the only innocent pupil of poor and three-year-old Loreen? or she? "The Time Machine" takes a while for a good measure, as a mixture between "Extinguishers", "Exorcist" and "Witchfinder General." Go, Bert! The area becomes sillier and more illogical with every new twist, but at the same time, it does not go weak at all, just like in most of the modern magic films like The Dunwich Horror and The Devonsville Terror. The film is back and forth between events and flashbacks that took place in 1692; it keeps a very entertaining and fast pace. Ann Putman is a pretty characteristic character reminiscent of Abigail Williams's character on the more popular scene, "The Crucible" (also described in Kinona Winona Ryder in 1996). There are several cool death signals, such as a cemetery teacher or a library journalist, committed by an endangering spirit of respect for Ann Putman and possibly Satan himself. The film is close to the finish and is usually absurd, but in general, there is a good lover's entertainment. Of course, you can say the least about Bert I Gordon that he has been building direct leadership skills over the years.
