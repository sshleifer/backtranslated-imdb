Everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers for example. Ten years ago, his doctor did not change the SNL days. He does the same conscious conscious slogans and the same sounds. His cat is painless. He works hard. He was not a strange type A comedian, he should have been. The rest of the film is bad. The clutches are incredibly ugly --- and apparently millions of dollars in loss. (Carton cuts for backgrounds would be more illogical than building a whole neighborhood and main street). Alec Balwin tries to make a funny Great Santini impression, but is invisible and silent. Even mistaken Paris Hilton has an inneless strawberry moment - this is Dr. The Seuss story keeps the mind in mind. Do not waste your time in this movie, from the nation. Not even an interesting train crash. (I hope to launch Horton Hears with Robin Williams), and then we have a spasite comedy trilogy that plays the leading role of the worst Seuss movie.
