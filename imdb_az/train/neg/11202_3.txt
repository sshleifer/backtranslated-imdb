In the past days of the Catholic Church, a guilty man was to blame for the sins of one who did not die by the ritual. Often these people, for example, denied that the church would be liberated and that they would enter paradise. The sinners were seen as blasphemy. A little bit more about sexual intercourse with a supernatural mojo, where the concept can go, and the "Order", "X-Files" paranormal investigation combining Stigmata's anti-authoritarianism and the darkness of the "Thorn Birds" melange <br /> <br /> Alex (Heath Ledger) is a cunning priest, one of the last members of the Carolingians Order, seeking semi-knowledge, the priests fighting the devil. When Alex's teacher was found dead in a strange situation, Bishop Driscoll (Peter Weller) sent Alex to investigate. Labeling fellow Carolingian Thomas (Mark Addy) and Mara (Shannyn Sossman) who were subjected to one of Alex's exorcisms a year ago. These three are mixed with a person who claims to be inquisitive and strange Catholic bidet, fatal prophecies, Satan intervention, and the latest Sin-Eater (Benno Furmann). <br /> <br /> Writing and directing by Brian Helgeland (working on the same principles as "skateboard" and "cute" A Knight's Tale), the film is a weird and difficult to classify. At one point, he wants to be a few things - supernatural tension, religious revolution, dramatic television pilot - and sometimes it succeeds. This slow pace or the majority of actors, sometimes with glowing explosions, helps to avoid being seen as falling asleep. Especially, Ledger has a particularly stunning scene of hopelessness in another monochromatic performance. Sossman has been featured in all films in the film (especially the "Admission Rules"). <br /> <br /> The miserable is moving forward between a few different stories, leading you to surprise the main array of red breads. The big holes in the narrative can often be lost in the scenes, which can be confusing to most, but this is one of the manuscripts of the film. The structure of the film is united by the fact that it will not be a truly clear antagonist until the end of the film - to cast and think the audience at a time when most films will clarify everything. it is a history of deep-rooted and sin-ling on Carolingians, but also explained in the dry exposition). At the beginning of the film, character relationships and history are disclosed. <br /> <br /> Combine it with special shooting and special effects, and there is an extraordinary tension in many old worlds that reminded you of the early 70s and early 80s. <br /> <br /> Here is also a brief note of the subtle and organic account of the combination of exotic vocals in the style of minimalist orchestration and Lisa Gerrard by David Thorn. <br /> <br /> An embarrassment, shortcomings, and sometimes sleepy speeches can often be damaging to the film, but for some reason, the "Order" can be watched. Many people will be quitting for the strange sensitivities of the film, and some may even be encouraged to be forced to involve themselves in understanding the high functions of their brains. Still, the film's transparency prevents DVDs from being critical or commercially successful, and I am sure that it will be equipped with lots of deleted scenes. Recommended movie for people who just want to watch. 10 to 6.
