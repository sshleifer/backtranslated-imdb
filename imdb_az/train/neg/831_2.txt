It's alive! <br /> <br /> The true story: A Dutch television station has recently announced plans to stage a new reality show. Not a competition. The main participant in this show would be a woman who caused a terrible thing to die, and she would donate a kidney to a fortunate man with a successful kidney failure. For reality. <br /> <br /> The country and the international press are terrifying, immoral, like the flies on a grass on this side of the story, this is world-coming-and-like. <br /> <br /> For months, tensions have been stretched to the extent that the government has been questioning whether or not this demonstration has taken place. <br /> <br /> The show was alive in the air and moving toward the end. Until the time when the country began to arrive, the Prime Minister spelled out the speeches, writing every newspaper and breathing everyone in the country. And the network pushed. It's right on a new TV set. And they did it. <br /> <br /> This show was a show and we all died a while later, but a woman who had chosen the right candidate for survival looked at the illness. <br /> <br /> And then, at the last moment of the show, it appeared to be partly a pawn. The woman was not ill, but all the candidates. The kidney was not auctioned. All discussions for a fantastic summit during the presentation, advertisement and the months were a presentation to pay attention to the problem of major problems in organ donors. <br /> <br /> In some cases, the man who established this network died of kidney disease. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> if. <br /> Spoiler * As I said, they will receive it through the FCC. I believe that it will be held on the basis of a free expression through the US Supreme Court. <br /> <br /> Some people have thrown themselves into the air. <br /> <br /> Behold, these things have been done before. Instead, Man Run with Arnold. At least half good came to an end. <br /> Spoiler * It's a blatantly filthy part of the movie, along with a ridiculous finish. So, after he pulls out, he begins to retreat, do you think that the public will go public after leaving the theater? Because there was some kind of justice. Do not take my word for it, but I would say: leave it alone, and instead follow a test sample, you get better quality.
