S.I.C.K. it really kills me incredibly. There was nothing to speak about. The best part of all production was the artwork on the lid of the box. The budget of this movie was sufficient. The film was the bottom sesame street. The manufacturer looks like a rally for underground movie boots. The curtain used in this film was stolen from the clothing store. The latter was predictable that the last 5 minutes should be fun and laugh fast. If there's a book for this movie, I'm sure it's better. I will not pay for it anyway. I took the sincere scenes that they valued all the movies. just joke.
