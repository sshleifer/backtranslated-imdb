William Cooke and Paul Talbot share this fun low-budget movie, film director / writer who has camped in the woods with fear magazines about three boys. Legs and legs raised by legs and school pupils ... A settlement town named Ralph (Gunnar Hansen ... Leatherface's fame) nourishes the town and has four remedial measures against the heat and fire temperature <br /> <br /> The story is the old retread named "The Hook", two teenage teens lover striped by a killer demented with a hook on one hand. Another story has several tokens in need of several wild endings. They run to a guy who knows a guy who has a great learning experience. Their skin begins to turn gray and green, before they are bruised and fallen, as in a few bags of smoke. One of the best stories is the unhappy man who did not wait for his mother to die and was returning home for Christmas, fearing to tell his brother and brother about the devil Klaus. The fourth campfire is a predatory sailor who has fallen face on an empty treasure chest and has ended up fighting the sea by the zombie. <br /> <br /> Without a huge budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets a point of conflict and could be really bad. Maybe a little dark but maybe fun to watch something other than the sailor's fairy tales. Imagine that the player is not worthy. Cast members include Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
