If it looks like garbage and looks like garbage, it should be debris. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. Tony Scott's weakening style, Domino Harvey's life embarrasses an astonishing and lying story as a bounty hunter. The story is totally unbreakable and confusing to watch. Some aspects of the site were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. As you can see, all action scenes resemble one another with weak plot points and terrible movements. Keira Knightley is completely naked though. This is a one-sided film. If you want to see her naked you just have to stretch up the film up to a half and up to a half and you'll catch a lot of nipples. No doubt, nobody can see this movie. </ 3
