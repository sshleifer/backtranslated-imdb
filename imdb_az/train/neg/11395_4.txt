It's not exactly a new story line, but it's a romantic comedy concept. A young man (John Cusack) and a gorgeous dead gorgeous woman (Kate Beckinsale) are lucky enough to be surprised if they are in touch with each other. Still, it is strange that it is still in a spiritual mate. In some places it is a little fun but love with viva. Being romantic I have to be almost whipped. My favorite scene was Cusack and the snow started to fall. The finals are almost sweet, but most worthy. This is not Cusack's deep roles, but will be unbearable by Beckinsale in Hell. Outstanding support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon. John Corbett plays the worst part I've ever seen. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is very interesting and funny. Follow this with the spirit of the soul.
