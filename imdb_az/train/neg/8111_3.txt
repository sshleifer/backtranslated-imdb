Another great movie by Costa Gavras. A great introduction to the situation is the participation of Latin America and the United States in Latin American politics. Facts can or may not be true, but the fact is that the US is deeply involved in the impacts and support of the Latin American dictatorship. <br /> <br /> However, the film's spirit is a propaganda of the typical left / communist Cold War era. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his films are always biased. For example, when representing Tupamaros's extremist activity as a positive thing, he presents the US actions as cruel and inhuman. <br /> <br /> It was a blessing from the United States to Uruguay and Latin American countries. was involved. Europe is full of poor European Eastern European whores. Because of what happened in many Eastern European countries, I did not hear poor Uruguay or Chilean girls who sincerely sacrificed themselves. The US was fighting a dirty war and defeated us with the monster of the blessed Soviet communism. It is unpleasant to endanger the things we do in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you need to play dirty. It is an idealistic world as to believe in Costa-Gavras and Matamoros. Matamoros When we come to power in Uruguay, we will have another Ukrainian in Latin America. <br /> <br /> All these are following the left and old left ideology of the film in the past and try to make it idealistic and morally. is correct.
