<br /> <br /> <strong> Sundance is an example of an hourly showcase for Sundance that this poor pretext is an incorrect example with most indie film artists on the agenda. <br /> <br /> First, there's something like cinematography. <br /> <br /> A woman with a spouse does not point out that she draws a true 16mm camera, drawing a line. <br /> <br /> I should not think that we did not get a camera from a director. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, films should be about real people. There is nothing real in this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> > <br /> <br /> Past but this is not a good post or good leadership. <br /> <br /> Some of the things on the left are a bunch of bad movies going to Sundance. It's hard to believe one of the best films ever presented ... <br /> Anyway, Sundance has fooled me of my respect for the brand.
