Seriously, what is this? Hooper made Texas classic films like the Chainsaw Massacre, and then this god made a terrible film, what happened? Few cracks? This film talked about a friend named Sam (player, Firestarter, who?), Who was able to set things up to fire, the player was trash and special effects resembled something like 70, which was very trash. Van Damme, Derailed's not the worst movie ever, and what happened? he began shining blue, turned into a bright blue blob, his girlfriend sucked in fire and the movie ended. WHAT IS IT? HUH? <br /> <br /> When I ended up, you hoped the DVD would encourage you to spontaneously burn me out of my pain. <br /> <br /> SEARCH THIS FILM. <br /> <br /> NOT AGAINST AGAIN, OBEY, Thank you later.
