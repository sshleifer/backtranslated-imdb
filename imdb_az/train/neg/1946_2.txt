<br /> <br /> <strong> I feel good about commenting on Scooby's historical and current version of Scooby's mother as the mother of two young children who grew up or said many reincarnation with Scooby's. <br /> <br /> We have not seen any episodes before Shaggy and Scooby, so we get a clue that we can use as a lightweight, Saturday morning morning cartoon nothing. But essentially this is the problem with its existing format, ie the "old" Scooby and the gang will not have longevity. I am convinced that it can be successful in returning money, but I am convinced that long-term old and young purchases are in great danger. <br /> <br /> My 6 year old son was really upset when he saw the new version and said that he seemed very brave without asking and why was not it the last series (wherever you are). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Garbage Doo was an anomaly, but more than that. We hope you get a hint by referring to the producers.
