Carrie Fisher said that for a number of reasons this film was a serious cocaine problem at some point in his life, and that many did not remember it because they did this movie. Why I explain why this film is to be explained, but does not explain why a work or crew did not do anything; I do not believe everyone has a coke problem. This must be one of the worst movies ever made and tells something. Sin is not "directed" by Tim Kincaid or "writer" Buddy Giovinazzo because this picture has not been written or directed by anyone. As you can see, they just came together, because there is nothing related, consistency, design, structure, meaning, intelligence, or anything else. Not surprisingly, there were a number of real professionals who were involved in this spark. Co-star Robert Joy worked well in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks were both industry veterans and Marks, and it's not a bad thing. It is not clear why they came into this cartilage of beard. Tim Kincaid, the alleged "director," made quite a few fantastic and horrible movies, and when I saw many of them, one of us could say that he was not good at all. This is the worst thing you ever saw, and that's a great success. Everything is absolutely EVERYTHING, the best 12 degrees about this movie. Cinematography is terrifying, the player laughs, "special effects" "Plan from 9 Outsourced" looks like "Spiderman", the story is tall, derivative and stupid. Do not spend your time watching the video cover, do not rent it. Full, totally annoying, general dud.
