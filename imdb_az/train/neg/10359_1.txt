The series "Shaking Time" is my favorite series from childhood. I've read it and read it more than once in the last 35 years. With all the advantages and disadvantages, the heroes are close and dear. This adaptation was far from my favorite, magical, moral story. <br /> <br /> It would be a big mistake to say that I'm disappointed with this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not read a book, I think it will shoot the movie. The player is passive, the special effects made for the television movie are good and the story is interesting. <br /> <br /> I found this movie on Wikipedia's Wikipedia page: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said about the movie:" If you love books, I, like another reviewer, I think it is necessary to read again to dispel my opinion.
