Sugar and Spice are one of the worst films in 2001. Pass the Heathers Movie and Bring Him and runs unsuccessfully. When I saw last January, I was very surprised by the movie I talked to my husband during the last half an hour on my phone. I heard a DVD cut by a director, maybe I'll check it out, but it's the PG-13 trash film *** *** and the worst kind of thing. Maybe it would be good to have T & A in the movie. But the naked are naked and the player is strange. Worse than a Troma film.
