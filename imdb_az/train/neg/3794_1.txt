The recent show of the US television screens has reached a fiery pitch since the first episode of the "Bachelor". Since the unsuspecting audience, countless clones and changes have been made, including the "The Bachelorette", "Joe Millionaire", "For Love or Money" and "America's Getting Married". She wants to earn money from this trend and at the same time trying to find and exploit a new demographic, Bravo has described the world as a disastrous "Rich Flower". <br /> <br /> In some cases, on the one hand, on the one hand, many people are denied direct access to a show, up to the bridge. but there is a twist. Half of men are really straight. This is not a big deal, but it begins after you hear the payback of the evil scenario: if at the end of the show, a gay man chooses a mask with a flat person, the flat man earns a cash donation. Just like equally painful "Sheep Eye for Flat Qatar" (like the other Bravo Program), this show is an example of stereotypes of amoka, something more than homosexual, or at least a few gifts, a backpack and a backpack. However, even worse, straight guys play these stereotypes with cash, which produces enough hair gel in a man's hair, wearing a pair of dresses in Abercrombie & Fitch, burn all body hair, fat and breath! It is the same as the ghosts of white gentlemen, and like me, who are real gay, and who betray those who do not wear and act like that - almost gay, have no change or chance for individual people, only act as real people They can not, just like stereotypes, of course, the bank's bank he's skeptical about every kind of diversity. <br /> <br /> Instead of accepting it as dynamic individuals who can reflect and change the majority of gay people, Hollywood has again taken a stereotype and has continued with the bank. Following this show, I feel really ugly because it shows any gay person who sees this unusual parade of pornographic masked soft-core pornography. 10 to 1.
