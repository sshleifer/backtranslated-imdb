I saw bad movies in my life, but it was so bad that in reality I was angry at the theater. I wanted my money back. I ask the director to return the movie ticket, of course, I will not be back (or even can not answer), but that's important. 1-10 at a scale, give this movie -42. Why did the "Jeep" (Chevy Blazer?) Escape without hitting a bat? Instead of breaking the bum's skull, they first hit the jeep with Chevy Blazer ????? The plot was thin, the film was filled with clear stickers, and some of it did not make any sense.
