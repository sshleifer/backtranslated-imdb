My account for this crap: 1/10 1 for tech only. Everything else is too bad. <br /> <br /> A movie that does not mean anything. Certainly, creating a good script for movies or television is almost impossible. <br /> <br /> Although it is easy to understand that politicians can not tell the truth, it is one of the largest liars in the planet. It's hard to figure out how the movies are so sad. <br /> <br /> We have to believe that we can lead people to moronsuz. Perhaps 99% of films needed to be convinced that they were unhappy. Because they are foolish, funny, and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> When we look at the cost of the Oscars, we better understand that we continue to make movies more funny than others. <br /> Sometimes it's such a nonsense. But it's not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you want to listen to this sound, press the Super Fast Forward button (at least 20X).
