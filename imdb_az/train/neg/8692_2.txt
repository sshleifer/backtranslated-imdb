I think Elisabeth Rohm is not very good, though it works hard. I think that would be something that could get this price because of the budget. <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm very much interested in seeing Myron Natwick's performance very well. <br /> <br /> He was the most convincing and undoubtedly the most attractive to watch. When it's not on the screen, it's dead. It was shot in the Vancouver. He gave my heart, but I am convinced that he is a sort of real life, a merry-looking man. <br /> <br /> I will follow something with me, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. He was surprised about the Law and Order. Perhaps a very nice person, but an actress.
