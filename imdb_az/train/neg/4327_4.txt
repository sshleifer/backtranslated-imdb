Some entertaining humor, some straightforward, some worthwhile, some are strange. <br /> <br /> This movie is just shot and runs, guaranteed to entertain more than 12 year old boys from anywhere. <br /> <br /> Children in the film are unfair. This may be a problem when you run a family comedy. Beverly D'Angelo climbs up to give a fun stuff and tells it to human performance in the midst of this mediocrity.
