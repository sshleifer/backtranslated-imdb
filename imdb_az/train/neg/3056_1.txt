Before I saw this, I had seen many bad Christmas movies. But once I saw "Jingle All the Way" better than The Godfather. "Santa Claus" Santa is a jodly movie about helping some kids, but it almost feels Satan's. Santa's brave ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho. The plot of the massacre is very strange and is compatible with all its performances and dialogues. Santa lives above the North Pole in the world, and children all over the world are preparing for Christmas. But there is an enemy named Santa Pitch, or Satan. Pitch is trying to destroy Santana's Christmas by naughty boys and creates provocations like chimney movements and hot dogs. When Pitch Santa attacks a dog, Santa's assistant Pedro and Merlin are a magician to buy Santa from this pickle. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie, as it is obviously bad, is very strange. The devil is very dancing and he really looks more joyful than Santa. Santa is talking about presenting gifts to all boys and girls, but only 5 children in Mexico deliver their home. The North Reindeer is burning toys and I am amazed at the fact that the gay laughs, bringing tears to the eyes of the child ... It's scared. Everything is horrible. During the first 10 minutes, Santa only reads the orchestra and children are reading it. Perhaps one of the stunning scenes is laughing about it while Santa dances around Pitch and Pitch pain at butt with a mini-ball. In my opinion, parents are better off telling their little ones about where their babies are. <br /> <br /> My rating is BOMB / ****. 85 minutes.
