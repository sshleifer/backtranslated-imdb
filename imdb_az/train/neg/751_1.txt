Despite the film's preparation, I believe everyone will be indifferent to this mentality. Like the "Movies" of Edward Wood films of the 1960s and 1970s, this movie has spent a lot of energy rewriting scripts on realistic filmmakers, rearranging their movies, and finally watching the right. This film is also a worthy evidence for the studio's pre-screening process. <br /> <br /> <strong> Mr. Hines, when he had to endure honest reactions from an impartial audience, he might have dropped 75% or walking / walking / moving scenes and that the film was more tolerant of 90 it would take a minute. <br /> <br / Movie students should see this movie as an example of "quite good" as they can think seriously. Each performance, every line of dialogue, every digital effect, every filter effect, really implies that every frame of the video is simply a matter of being mediocre. A beginner filmmaker may occasionally say, "I've achieved at least one thing" or "It's just a success to finish it." <br /> <br /> This film will help you understand how bad a film can be. <br /> <br /> Even if you've written the worst movie you've ever seen, you might be criticized too. <br /> <br /> Initial writers can learn from this film how important the writers are and maybe they understand the writer's necessity. Also, beginners can learn the importance of a good scenario and respect some degree of difficulty in writing a story that makes viewers feel emotional about the story. <br /> <br /> Writers and directors who watch the worst movie films of the week think, "I can do better than that." You can get an idea of ​​this movie, even if it's really hard to produce a good result. <br /> <br /> This movie can serve as an educational tool for filmmakers. Especially this is the current post-Lucas and those who are crafting in the post-Spilberg environment. Filmmakers with such a reason greet you for their special effects. The War of the Worlds clearly shows that everyone can not take it. Some may not approach someone.
