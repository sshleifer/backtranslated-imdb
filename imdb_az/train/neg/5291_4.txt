STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday night ** Sunday night * Monday morning Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal history, Valerie who wants to marry (Kathy Burke ), is a habit of paranoid and domestic violence, but it ends as a runaway escape. His mother Janet (Laila Morse) tells Rai's son Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his growing drug addiction to the rails. <br /> <br /> The Britons like to be unhappy and watch the films entertaining them. Movies like Mouth, like Nil, highlight these. Jeremy Kyle will be ready to eat three types of dreams, including a crazy family fragment that is assassinated by conspiracy, poverty, welding, and narcotics. In fact, a tales of self-destructive men are separated into three generations, each copying one another, breaking up a family, and trying to take it somewhere, although women are strong enough. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, it is better than today. <br /> <br /> I would also like to point out that the truth about the performances and the leading stars Winstone and Burke deliver some great players. When Winstone saw her losing with her husband, and when she did not want her to see her child after a few more coca-dropped paranoia during a phone call, f and c reveal a typical arsenal of words. At the same time, at a special moment, we see that Burke is skillful. <br /> <br /> Well, it's nothing but the real life of this desperate life, one day after the day, as there is no 'plot' to follow. Most of them (including Baftas) were awarded this award, but it was really terrible for me. There is no right to criticize it, and I know what I know about it, but, unfortunately, I found it. **
