Soul Survivors finds the right place in the right place, as a relative who gives an endless gift, but with a bad execution. Stephen Carpenter's writing / orientation effort borrows from other good movies, such as Jacob's Ladder and Able Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). I will not leave the apartment for those who do not see any of these films; According to Mammadyarov, his current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and former boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley) friends and Annabel (acerbic Eliza Dushku) are in a car crash after being persecuted by two killings (?) in transparent masks. He escapes from the accident, but while attending a college, the tragedy and death of the hospital re-emerge and disappear, leaving it in a state of total turmoil: who died? Who is alive? <br /> <br /> Soul Survivors have a bad view, there, seen, gore filled, blood splattered, flicking on the body of teenage stack teen. True, there are scenes of killer-stalking-victim (abundant, repetitive, and foolish), but at least unfortunate, he tries to build ideas through more ideas than clicks. <br /> <br /> A fearsome admirer who accepts a copy will have no idea. there is a film that is more disturbed by the creation of a miserable facade of more reality than delivering a body number. The credit goes to the Volunteer, because a young man is trying to create something in the fray of horror; created a very bad psychological tension. Sagemiller, at the same time, deserves to be a force in the center of action, really develops his character and creates feelings like Cassie's charm. <br /> <br /> Cinema artists are better than trying something different, but the film ends with a mixed bag and a failed test. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 4
