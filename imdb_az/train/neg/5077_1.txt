Anyone who sees "Medusa Touch" in a post deleted from another IMDb user should be warned about a scene reminiscent of terror attacks on NYC on September 11, 2001. But I hope everyone who reads this will review this warning. (Producer Elliott Kastner produced "Harper" and "The Long Goodbye", jointly producing Arnon Milchan Oscar for "LA Confidential" and Oscar for screenwriter John Briley "Gandhi") and the international cast, Medusa Touch, heavyweight, I found it as a source of indifferent laughter. It was a weak, scary, and motionless mess. In the 1970s, he tried to use a telecinetic alarm scenario. The film is a lot of failures. Please consider "Carrie" and underrated "The Fury" (both run by Brian DePalma). It was two fun and exciting work that involved the same subject.
