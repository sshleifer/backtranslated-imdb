I could name a lot of funny movies. There are comedies that go out to be funny, and they are. Some movies, like Gymkata, try to be serious, but they try to be funny. Ladies is a movie that is trying to make people hopelessly funny, but not less funny if there were not a lot of chickens in the midst of a nuclear genocide breakdown. <br /> <br /> I do not think I'm laughing at anything in this movie than a giggle. It's not a simple thing. It's not funny, boring, stupid, believing, villainous, mind-bogglingly bad, not funny. <br /> <br /> I do not pay particular attention to this character from Tim Meadows or SNL, but I've been looking forward to it better. <br /> <br /> The film is a complete logic or a healthy idea. While writing, the scriptwriter resembled a piece of paper on the head and could not see what keys it hit. They explain the "origin" of the Ladies Man, but still function as early as the 70's, they can not motivate strange fashions. Shortly after trying to hang himself, the film tries to get humor from a person who is happy with porn. Is this a comedy? <br /> <br /> I love to think that I have a very humorous feeling (often like writing a comedy). But maybe I'm not bright enough for this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, <br /> <br /> In the end, I stuck in my chair and resembled my breath, and although the film was already there, I would probably have committed suicide. This movie can not be as bad as the Battlefield Earth, but the first movie that I saw was close. <br /> <br />
