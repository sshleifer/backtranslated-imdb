I really did not try to make a serious horror or even a motion movie when Concorde / New Horizons performed at Carnosaur 3. I hope the movie is simple from beginning to end. In C3, even humor is funny because it's bad. Absolutely 'very bad' is a high water mark in this good genre. If you enjoy the worst of the worst, it is for you.
