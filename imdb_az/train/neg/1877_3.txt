I did not see Henry Fool, but after watching "Fay Grim", I'm not sure what I want. Maybe Hartley aims to be the "anti-tension" director --- he sure has achieved with yawner. According to the official statement --- the woman finds that her husband's dead manuscript has materials that can pose a threat to national security. I was expecting a geopolitical drama. Instead, it shows that an unresponsive structure, a closed dialogue, an entertaining character, a solid field, and a frequent "tone" Hartley have changed at any given moment for his mood. For a long time, you can hang a frustrating, challenging tracking structure (for example, "Duplicity") because I understand that the empty ends will come together. If they are not or do not, but they have left questions (such as "dual"), the sharp writing and acting are of interest. But halfway through the "Fay Grim" I reached a deadly reality - I did not know what was happening and did not care about me. Too bad, because I liked Parker Posey, was here to work with an absurd part. He was indifferent to his desire to turn his spouse and negligent abroad into a strong international player with a psycho-mania capable of managing a cluttered mother with terrorists. There is also bad casting. Jeff Goldblum may be very good, but the CIA is not capable of dealing with bankruptcy as an operative. She is almost uncomfortable with her role as I look at her. His CIA sidekick is worse; he seems to be a refugee from the American Idol quarter-finals (really young CIA agents, have large spots on hair on nails?). Then there is a question about the age of the characters. Goldblum was in "Fay Grim" 54; Thomas Jay Ryan, 44, was Henry Fool. However, the main points of the story were Nicaragua served as CIA agents in the 1970s. The character of Goldblum would be in the 20s; Henry Fool would be a teenager. Hartley "quirky" or lazy? A large number of issues ...
