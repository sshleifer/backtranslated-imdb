This is not the worst movie, but I personally think that because the original buzz was originally the first in theaters (1) The first buzz was as positive as my darling insisted on seeing it, and we were actually going to buy tickets, and (2) only a "serious" movie that started snickering at some point and just remember where the movie was laughing on the rest of the road. <br /> <br /> For the first time in a few years <br /> <br /> The dramatic tension in this film is "dramatic tension" between Bo's. terrible behavior and terrible direction of her husband. Snake fight should be one of the most inadequate "action" series in the film. However, this is one of the worst films that can be worth the look of unwanted humor levels. The worst movie I've ever seen.
