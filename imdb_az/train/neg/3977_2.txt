The same twin sisters, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, have grown fame on both comets like "Two Kinds", I've never seen anything, but I thought what to expect, but even worse. Basically, Hunter's sister, Charlie (Maryam Kate) and Leyla (Ashley), are for the Roma Summer Practice Program, but are often dismissed for a number of challenges before they start their work. But the man who owns the company, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them back their jobs and gradually proves themselves useful assets and talent (fashion) and helps the company to miss a single person. Also Leslie Danon played Derek Lee Nixon as Jamille, Ilenia Lazzarin like Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Paolo Paolo, Michelangelo Tommaso, and Matt Patres like Enrico Tortoni. You can say that the film is straightforward, the camera does not work perfectly, and you will not be able to admire the Roman space anytime. In fact, the background is a good thing to just watch, twins were two of the most hateful people around, and I knew before they even looked at me (not even so nice). terrible trash film. Very weak!
