This movie is heart and funny. Land does not even have meaning. Some scholars working on the fringe of science can open a door to another dimension (perhaps hell), and if the daughter is confident in her or something, then one day she does not go back for any apparent reason, and now she has big breasts and she wears an exclusive material ( The main character is a boy who wants to get married to his girlfriend, but he is wearing his obviously interested in his new girlfriend and runs to this witch (they want witches or something) and the bad definitions begin to read again, as the evil demon only comes to the place where the bikini can stand as his girlfriend and lover of love. For no reason, there are top-notch scenes and my dear one says that a man is a well-known wrestler, but his part is absolutely useless, obviously he did something to put him alone, because maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this delicate movie. On the contrary, topless girls do not get hurt there too. The extra features on the DVD were much more complicated than the rest of the film, and I thought it could help explain what it was, but in fact, it just made matters worse. Who are these people, and what are they doing? Basically it's a go-camping-to-make-out-after-fight-a-monster movie, but many things (like other sizes and book vendors) have lots to do with this confusing. I did not like the movie, but it was just as great as five dollars. Although I'm just too stupid, I do not advise watching it, I do not think of a good part of the movie.
