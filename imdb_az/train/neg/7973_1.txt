I'm going to many movies, often bringing my 5 year old son, and I'm so glad I did not bring him so much. There are many references to sex and skin of a wave, but this is not the main reason I take it. Trailers lead you to believe it is a light hearted comedy; Nevertheless, virtually all funny moments are in the foreground. I did not expect to get something interesting, funny or serious; But a story about the plot was drifted, and I was nearly asleep. I understand that dogs can be a big company, but not all the story owners are guessing that it is a weak dog-bearing dog. If a person causes such damage, he will forbid him. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jennifer Aniston or Owen Wilson is the loss of their talent. The best way to summarize this movie is to get a pair of dog dogs, the dog is in love with dogs, the dog is dying, a sad couple. Last.
