I do not understand why all the remnants of the Causcusus period refused to give up. We can clearly see how they are shaken by the censorship of the Communist censor, which forbids many things to show in their films. They now imagine a great deal of freedom that they use, such as defect, urine, vomit, blasphemy, and any other species that can be imagined. THIS IS THE SINEMA, FRIENDS AND AGAINST! This is simply a visual disorder. Do not forget about strawberry Chien Andalou, David Lynch, and other filmmakers who work with Formen and Neorealism and Ugly Aesthetics. These people have embraced their work - you were not good! All of us have Daneliucs, Nicolaescus, Saizescus, Muresans, Marinescus, Margineanus and old old timers and leave us alone! Failure to see a number of Romanian MOVIES on the screen is enough for your immature terror! You are not a director, ONLY!
