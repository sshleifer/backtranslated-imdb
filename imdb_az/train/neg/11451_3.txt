Alright, comrades, a serious movie, watching all kinds of movies, as good as bad, and putting me on the test. I will not hear the words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The player was bad. Always beautiful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. Indeed, I asked myself why I was disturbed to see this rotten naked film? Why did I spend my time and money on something I suspect? The answer is, of course, I think that I'm a film belt and that's why it's not necessary to avoid other ways. I would spend the time telling you exactly what the mistake with this amateur film was, it was almost politely, subpaar, that the quality of the actor was. It is a serious film buff to take responsibility for watching this movie. Otherwise. stay home, do not waste time, read a book, do your homework, or make yourself a good sandwich.
