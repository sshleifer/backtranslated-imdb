Do you remember a movie that you enjoyed in the past as an adult? When I came back to school, it came to me ... Class of National Lamp Class. The film has a great opportunity for laughs, but in a surprising way, it sells a devil, a strange collection of heroes, and a woman who can shoot a flame from her mouth, as she sees a woman who looks like a vampire, and a smart killer dressed as a woman and wearing sackcloth in her head. You have a classmate who believes that you are the best of sliced ​​bread (as we have seen in the film, cowardice and jokes), a few people who could not even know their classmates, and Gary knew that there was someone (and no one knew could not remember his name ... this is a joke that loves me). There are a lot of women who want to know a snow and a blind woman and chef (who know him from the "zone" and "get out of the way") who owns a roaring pantry while calling dogs. those who want to put food on their plates with their hands! The film is actually a spark that is trying to revenge (or at least try) classmates for a stick they are against (they are set up to sleep with their alien siblings!). The film is watching the characters while looking for a killer who plays the old lyceum dark, bustle corridors. A psychologist who was a little strange to them was informed about the killer. There are a few good gags that work on the film (very early), but the film slowly deteriorates every minute. The real problem of the film really does not know where to go. The film is a very strange thing with an inaccessible direction ... it really does not have any direction. Casting is quite enthusiastic, but the material prepared for making fun is not of any interest. It's an unforgettable curio for fans of early 80's comedy stories (this is one right).
