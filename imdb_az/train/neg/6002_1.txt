"Sundown: Vampire's Returning" is a trash. The player is strange, the atmosphere is unusual and the characters are uninteresting. The only scary thing about this piece of evil is something that most of the IMDb users have given 10. This is really terrible. No screaming, no violence, nothing. Bruce Cambell ("Evil Dead", "Intruder") is completely frustrated, and the game supporting it is also scary. not a basic society, a charming, terrifying admirer of horror, or dark birds will not use this crap. I hate it especially for fear comedies, and I prefer watching serious fright movies like Cannibal Holocaust or Left Home on the Left. In fact, a film of fear was a foolish, very frightening, bloody and unsettling mind, which, in general, ruined the entire concept. It's not a scare, it's not terrible, it's not funny as a comedy, do not waste your precious time.
