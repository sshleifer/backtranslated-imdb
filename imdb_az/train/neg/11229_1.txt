They forced me to watch it at school, and that was terrible. Movie is obsolete. Episodes have been combined with science fiction to make the story more exciting, because they are actually transformed into others. The teachers talked about treatment in this regard, but it was really a painful, boring experience. I've read that very few people are actors, but most of them acknowledge that they are real lives in the movie. These are the accounts for those who are very active. Also, very often the story becomes mildly treacherous and sensitive. I do not want some lines to say and give me more meaning. Although it was written as educational, funny, suspense, and hip, it ended drilling, dry, rooted, and old. I hope that nobody takes the time to watch this movie, because it would be good to see him.
