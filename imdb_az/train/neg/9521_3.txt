This movie has played a lot of games in HBO or Cinemax in recent days. This is because people think they are people who want to compare Leonardo DiCaprio / Tom Hanks with the same name. The only reason to see this is for Matt Mattani, attractive. Yum! I said Matt was a little less than a thread to read. If she was a woman, she'd bring her to a high school student! (Only me or my daughter Shelley seems to be Duvall?) Oh yeah, plot - who cares? Typical teen highjinx played by adults.
