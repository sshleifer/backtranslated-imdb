... not a precise call discount. In general, the film "DinoCroc" was better. Of course, in this film, Matt Borlenghi played a complete naked bag that consumed all the movie he had cried about his younger brother, DinoCroc. However, special effects at DinoCroc were even better, the landlines were better and the move was even better. Here are some problems with "Blood Surf" - 1) The killer seems to be a model of a crocodile with a jaw that can be withdrawn. 2) The plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co entered a fierce island with a group of vulgar Filipinos who attempted to force themselves to the group's group. It was a total loss of 15 minutes. And 3) There is not enough croc time. Blood Surf has some qualities - actresses are incredibly attractive and Matt Borlenghi is eaten by the croc towards the end of the film. But if you are in death, and just have enough time to watch a film of Matt Borlenghi / Killer Crocodile, skip this one and turn on "DinoCroc" instead.
