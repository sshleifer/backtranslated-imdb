Valentine's Day (1995) was run by Darrell Roodt and was written for Ronald Harwood (adapted to Alan Pato's novel since 1946). <br /> <br /> The story of the film's previous apartheid South African and black man and white man's story. Stephen Kumolo, a devout but loyal speaker, should immediately get a letter from Johannesburg; then he finds that his son killed a man. Rich farmer / landowner James Harris (Richard Harris) sets out to suggest that his son was a fighter for black rights, killed by Kumole's son. <br /> <br /> I do not see it because I can not compare it to the 1951 film of the same name. Or I did not see the music of "Lost Stars" in 1974; Both are better than this. But Cry Freedom, I saw on the other side; this film has a more immediate atmosphere, in fact it tries to say something where the film is, there is no idea where the beloved Country goes. Very "unpleasant". I refuse to compare the film with novels (except for the novel I love from a movie), the novels and films are two different media, and there is no reason to transfer or compare them directly. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, this film exploded. Yes, I think it's not bad - on-ten - but that was not good. Both potential and very talented actors draw some of the most wooden performances I've ever seen in film history (but the film is written by the writer Ronald Harwood), which was written by Julia, the pianist. Among other things, the novels and themes of the novel are almost completely lost in the third movie transition; the film has a tense of moment, race, or durability. Music does not help. Painlessly inappropriate and boring pastoral orchestral tracks help this movie to fall. <br /> <br /> Last and bright words of Alan Pato's novel are displayed in recent moments. <br /> <br /> <strong> movie. Very bad, they just seem to get away from the movie. I do not know what Nelson Mandela saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
