I always indulge in films written by a breed openly. <br /> <br /> In some cases, he is not something that is not true, but will not make enough research to find out that we are lying to the trick. <br /> <br /> I remember that in the bathroom where Jackie told the scene, his teammates Diane were pregnant. No form, shape, or shape would have made any difference to a girl getting a pregnancy at a high school. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that this movie did not get very serious and it's not a bad thing, but come!
