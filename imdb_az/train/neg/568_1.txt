Today's "SciFi" channel is "Debuted" and almost almost all I've taped today can watch this night after work "I'm silent". I had great hopes, now I'm breaking the closets looking for a rope length to hang myself. Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could say something nice, such as "It's fun to have fun with this movie", but this movie does not give me anything to work with. I know you do not need to post spoiler postings in advance, but I'm going to go anyway "This movie sucks" I said there! Let the movie students know what they need to do to show this flick! My nine-year-old brother could have made a better movie. The only good thing about this movie is the sound and / or the noise. OH! I found a stainless C-clamp in the old toolbox. I'll put it on my left thumb and hold the pain until I forget the memory of my eyes. I just can bend over this VHS, but instead, I think I'll burn it in a wooden hole. I can bathe with soap, but I'm afraid I will not be clean again. Christmas is coming. Take this movie and give it to those who hate it. -Mike
