In addition to sex scenes that restricted to child pornography (I could have been more edited or presented more in nature than in the graphics, I liked this movie as a half-precious recipe, which contained no ingredients for how to place a piece of product on a finished product From the beginning, there is no character development and story development ... Unfortunately, this monotonous drive is often attacked directly with the plant and we're going to learn more about Ahh-OK ... Finally, this scene will continue HOW ... or ... Who is this feature ... or maybe we finally intend to know and appreciate this character more ... or to attract more and more involvement in these relationships ... " no success! Instead, I repeatedly repeatedly duplicated a few times Finding any mini-plan just in the root, just a mini-plot (and filthy submission) was just a mockery, so I was up to the end of the last, usually IFC had a better choice and they were 2-1 / 2 stars (another mystery). The heroes are not like some degrees or they are not anything to do with them or humanity ... It would have been so good with a little more effort. I was shot in Santa Cruz and I'm interested if someone is a movie school project. I wish I could have looked at it better, but honestly, it was an hour's frustration and disappointment.
