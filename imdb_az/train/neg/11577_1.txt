Director wants to be Tarantino, screenwriters want to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah wants to be Black Unger Faye Dunaway, wants to be late Coburn Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to become Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler wants to be Moore Faye Dunaway (old version), Cameron Diaz , Joanna Going is not asking, she tries to successfully break through. Eric Stoltz and James Spader are trying to hide their embarrassment with these embarrassing things. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a beautiful lullaby lobby, a art deco church by Bruce Goff, and a lovely, established settlement by Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, do not watch this movie. It does not do justice to the earth.
