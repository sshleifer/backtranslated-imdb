My comments on this movie have been dropped twice, and I find it extremely insulting to make this movie worthwhile for other people. Please be tolerant of other people's opinions. <br /> <br /> It is not enough for the Nietzschein case to justify writing. <br /> <br /> I think it's a very bad movie for several reasons. <br /> Subject: One should be very careful about filming a philosophy that is not understood even by the masses and passionate debate among peers. The philosophers agree that it is a great idea of ​​Nitsen. So, filming about his life-long life-style must be extremely careful or predominant. Wisdom begins with knowing that you do not know. The film itself is a consideration, but the film is not a dream character, but today, and tomorrow, is the life of a person who has a great influence on the world. If someone tells a story about a tomato, I can express my own thoughts about myself, and also talk about the chosen topic, tomatoes. Producers are responsible for filming real facts. Scenario: One of the first things I mentioned was ridiculous accents. Why? It draws attention to what will happen; Nietzsche and his truths. It does not help to put everything in proper geographical terms or time! Come on, properly English or better; German language! <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; Nietzschei is not an actor describing it. <br /> 4th, facts are set out. <br /> <br /> And its celluloid waste.
