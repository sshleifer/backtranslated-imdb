I do not think it can deteriorate further. Bring incorrect actors, fake legs, and three stupid stories, and what do you get? <br /> <br /> The first film shoots immediately show poor video quality and, like an actor, especially a 25-year-old grandmother, usually finishes the grandmother's horn on the ear. Moreover, the man is good, but the woman is devious. "You look great!" NOTE! This wizard was the best of all three things I had said, but it was not affected by the fact that it was a bad costume. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> In the next one, there are two lesbians, completely falls into his ridiculous situation. All "I want to be a salvation" "How do you do it to me?" It was not sincere. Now he wants you to go on it! <br /> <br /> The third person does not have any meaning ... about forty-five minutes of running and digging story make up this story and all the passage. is still not interesting. Do not bump! <br /> <br /> Music, yes, bad ... did not even hear some parts, it was foolish. The effects of animals were foolish, like rats or pigs. Lion sounds did not work? Do not suppose, use good movies. Yes, i = f enjoy the good B-rates for you. Since I'm a hardcore werewolf fan, I bought this movie and buy any werewolf movie and then watch it once, but to me. If you choose the good ones, do not lose money. I beg you!
