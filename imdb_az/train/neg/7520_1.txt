This film proves that it can not judge a movie with an awesome piece of art on DVD. Also, show that you need to learn more about a movie before buying it (or get it for someone in Christmas). At the beginning of this film, it looks really hopeful. Well, until you meet the symbols. Pumpkin Jack (Street Old Boy) brings a colleague of his colleague to the jail for a year in a penal house (where the film takes place). Then there are some drinking, fighting and gentle porn porn. <br /> <br /> As a result, the film's action is more than an hour. <br /> <br /> Generally, the end of Hallow was unexpected, impossible, and was reminiscent of soft gentle pornies. This movie is watched with a group of friends who do nothing better, like a good movie to be careful about. And for the first time, the predictions about the order of the dead are really entertaining.
