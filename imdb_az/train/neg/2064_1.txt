My dear. Chevy Chase and SNL have a new level of network sketch format, which makes it harder at every level. Fortunately Chevy is in such a difficult situation and can not be blamed for happiness. This is serious, very bad. While the US release (1974) is intended to be a political commentary, it is neither fun nor harsh. Sketches have been for a long time, and any satiric effects they may have are lost as they reach the vulnerability. This is regarded as Chevy's debut film and I agree to say everything he has done since then. Avoid though, though.
