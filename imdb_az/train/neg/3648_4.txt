A couple without a child (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) goes to the doctor (James Karen) to get the drug. But Adams slowly warns that there is something wrong with the baby ... <br /> <br /> A very interesting idea completely fulfills with an epilogue - the main idea is complete, but screaming, ending. I saw every "twist" coming. Direct poverty - he has no idea how to make a major scene. Production values ​​- to be beautiful - is bad. It's terrible. And gore scenes are very unpleasant (I started pregnant woman stabbing in the stomach). <br /> <br /> It is quite clear when it is not clear how it ends. <br /> <br /> Some good actions make it a bit tougher. Adams, Hayenga, and Karen are all good at watching me, but it's about me. This film was released in 1991 and is still unknown - it's easy to see why. I'll give it 4.
