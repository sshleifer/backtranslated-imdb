Several times in the theater I saw the movie trailer and got excited. As it was in the 1990s, it seemed like a classic move. He reminded me of a fugitive film, a cat, and a mouse running between Douglas and Sutherland. However, The Sentinel is the most delusional activity tension of all time. As you can see, many people say this is a TV movie. Not accurate. First, there are better television movies in this genre. Secondly, television movies can be very entertaining, but this is a reflection of a good time. Everything is not outstanding and the sound of the movie is unforgettable. This is not a motion picture, but two scenarios of action are a follow-up and a conflict. Also they are not great action scenes, but worse than those movie scenes that are so tasty as the movie. The bond between Douglas and Bassinger was unnecessary. Moreover, the assassination plot of the president is the most clich√© story in this genre, but insist on it. And it's not like it should be a cat and mouse movie. Douglas is now very old, yet has the potential to act in an action tension. Michael Douglas, for example, can not be like Tommy Lee Jones. Sutherland is a mistaken choice, because you feel like Jack Bauer and you're filming in some way, it's one of the reasons you regard movies as a television movie, Eva Longoria Parker is a strange choice, of course, very passive or straightforward in this movie because it's a soap opera actress. The film did not have a second for me, so it could not take for a while.
