When I was released in the theater I saw the film as a child and it was so bad that it became a joke of the family. If the rating was zero, this movie would have taken him. Dinosaurs were terrible. This story was ridiculous. Actually, the actor is not in the actor's name. If I remember the name of the film very well, my family still speaks of how the BAD really is.
