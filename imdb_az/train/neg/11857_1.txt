The worst movie draw! Check out the Real movie review, which looks good in this movie. Check out Rotten Tomato on the web for some of the best independent reviews in this movie. Comments on this site, of course, are some of the nations with some financial interests in this film. Positive comments are very deceptive. I see how bad the negative comments against this film are and how the positive comments sound as an Academy Award speech. Do not waste your effort! !!!!!! This movie is delayed! I will not believe in a similar film. Why does Hollywood lose time on this lane? This movie is not in any attempt. I'm asking myself that this kind of garbage will actually leave money. I went to the blockade, and the servant told us not to lose our time or money. I did not listen and lost my time and money. Please do not make the same mistake! It's really the worst movie!
