This movie was just terrible, the first movie was not a good thing, so if it's not enough for the first 5 movies to add, it's ridiculous foolish, why not just make it into a sequel to James Bond? , I will tell you that the films like this are really good, and these films are only sad, I do not understand, this is a cross between genres, for horror and genre, my 1 year old brother is horrified at such a funny attempt, at least one saliva in front of people who are afraid of the so-called fear film. More than these films.
