This is perhaps one of the giant killer animal films I've ever seen. This is a typical basis of an improper lab experiment and a giant crocodile with rapidly increasing chemicals. The monster should look just like a multi-dimensional crocodile, a very big Tyranosaurous looks too much like a dinosaur with the back legs. Everything about this movie is unoriginal and it will be deleted every minute from the "cliche". Why are there two drunk redneck hunters after different darkness? Of course, if a life is in danger, there is always a guy and a girl who shares a naked, open love love. Much more is told by me and I feel like I'm spending time with this writing ...
