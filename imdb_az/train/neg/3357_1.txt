Those who react to this new "adaptation" of the original version of the original 1963 movie (genuine original), I suspect: the book or the original film will not think about it ... or never exposed, and that Hollywood's "special effects" "Those who are the biggest advocates against the first and last word" <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> This is not a true fit of the book. From the articles I read, it was supposed that this movie covered other aspects of the book, for the first time there was nothing around. And it seemed acceptable, if no movie is STAND length, then you can not cover a book for the word! (And even then) However, in this movie, nothing has ever happened in any of the words or even any of the movies shown. He reminded the black man that he decided to kill SHINING in the original movie version. I also did not like it. What does the film's press release mean? "We had a very basic idea from Shirley Jackson's book, we kept the same names in the house, and many (at least all of them) kept the names of the leading characters, but then we decided to write our story and, first of all CHANGELING , SHINING and RHOSTs and have decided to throw a bit. "<br /> <br /> 2. They have brushes with their paranormal to investigate a home that they seemed to be" born "completely, a parapsychologist invited to a carefully selected guest they have completely lost the subject. Instead, this "doctor" was taking his house with false pretenses to learn about "insomnia" (he actually invited them to frighten them with death, and then reacted to their fears ... like laboratory rats, did not say anything, part ... beautiful man). This doctor, who does not own the same name, was different from the original film's specialists as the night of the day. In contrast to the statement used to promote both films, "some homes only become worse", this house is not bad, but it has deteriorated due to the events happening there ... and this time Nel poppy mystery (CHANGELING's colors). The only problem was that the so-called mystery was not so explicit that I was convinced that it remained a mystery to the majority of viewers ... but then there was no secret, not in the book. It was bad at the start of the house. <br /> <br /> The first victim of the "victim" has been killed. 4. The way to describe the character of Luka was absolutely funny. One day in the day to inherit her home (and her "history" was a real skeptic) had to be a debonair playboy ... and this was just a bumping nerd, she voiced a winey who sleep, and was a compulsive liar. <br /> <br /> 5. The film was almost excited to go to fancy flights, which allowed her to think about the original scenes (Nel's scene with his sister's family and Mrs. Dudley's small opening speech ...). MUCH more than these movies. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> I missed Nel's story through the whole movie. The work was like a gothic novel as the story was first described in the eyes of Nel, and we always needed his thoughts. Completely unique appearance was completely lost in the new version. Nel also tried to do more than one heroin. The original Nel was not a bad man, but he was a bitter man (he could have been 11 years old after betraying a woman and a brother) and she wanted to persuade her and lost her. It was very good to be true. <br /> <br /> This was much more apparent than the cast of the film, which GHOST was once more watching. <br /> <br /> 7. Changed the history of the house and it was very torture. There is no Abigail Crain (Hugh's daughter, the legendary legend in her original version), there is no "companion" and no children's home. There was no 'Grace' (the original doctor's wife), and Hugh Crain's spouses died in a totally different way. These changes have changed the way of life. I do not know if the producers of this film should be glad, Shirley Jackson is no longer walking around the globe ... It should be GREAT (if I am going to procrastinate!) Thought about the points I thought were trifled <br /> <br /> Finally, film "for the" home "!):" This "movie" should be burned and the place should be salted! "The most favorite movie of all time remains. This is not a competition.
