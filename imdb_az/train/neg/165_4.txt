Although it is early to say how the array will develop, we can say that the pilot is less than I think it would be. However, there is still a potential for the series. Of course, when I first saw Voyager, I thought it was a potential, but it was disappointing. My gut says that it will not be as bad as Enterprise Voyager. <br /> <br /> As for the Pilot impressions ... <br /> <br /> The Pilot has some good ideas and topics that are good. I liked my initiative. She was interested in show credits, exploration and a suitable theme song. <br /> <br /> It was a big mistake for a story to have a "great sense of humor" when it was short for me. The episode's plot is more of an "overall" track story, with subplot and subtext in "intelligence" and "first step towards space." It would be challenging to separate the Enterprise, TOS and TNG periods if you would like to make references to this first deep space mission. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "color: red;"> Instead of isolated phrases for intelligence, It could have been. Get something less nostalgic and philosophical (oh, for a television show that will make us think THERE once again). Encourage us to experience the thrill of the "wind" and to be "in the sea," with salvation and many weapons. <br /> <br /> We could not collect more weapons. <br /> <br /> We felt that more people were the first trainees in a school built. New guys in the block, unlike entering an unknown universe. Unfortunately, the Klingons have come to our door instead of finding us. This meeting could have been more historic and more sociological. How are two different societies interconnected? <br /> <br /> Show him! <br /> <br /> Unlike the first bold steps I have to think of as "Akward crew and limited technology". I wanted to see something new and fresh. The series promises to have a new understanding, but so far I have not seen this new, big concept. <br /> <br /> I think that the series has potential and I will come back again. There are some interesting characters. Bakula is very nice. Blalock has the potential. <br /> <br /> Before the April 11 Apollo Kirk was first seen in the world, the general theme is most interesting. If future episodes can bring justice to this great and beautiful subject, there will be a new legendary show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> :-)
