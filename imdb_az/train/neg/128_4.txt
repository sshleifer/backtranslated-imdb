This sensational film was just a curiosity for once-thinking policy and free love and sexual freedom images. Now, in many countries, this very boring little movie was banned by governments and seized. Taking into account the socialist way of Sweden, the 'radicalism' of its policy is once controversial, naive, and nearly four decades seems almost common. Sex scenes, the subject of sensational immorality at the same time, appear pretty modest in a contemporary context. Nevertheless, the film, which reflects many controversies and influences, and its accompanying documentary films, are still described as an early donor of about 60 young people's revolts. Part of the film still captures: self-awareness about the 'fourth wall'. Filmmakers have been filming for a while. This satirical toy is still giggling.
