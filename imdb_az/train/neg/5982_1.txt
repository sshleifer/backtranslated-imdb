I'm sorry to say that, but Thunderbirds do not even come up with a big pop up, and never give any celestial noise. At one stage, I seriously took the floor to quit, and I was hopeful that the film could improve. I was disappointed, could not get better, if possible. If I had not gone to see the movie as a "verbal", I was still released. They had an excellent opportunity to make a big franchise, and they completely lost the opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingley must be embarrassed to give good titles to this movie and to Jonathan Fraquet, what can I say, shame and embarrassment, not to be far from the truth. I saw this movie in the previous release, I was looking forward to the original shows that I looked at in the most exciting way, in the sixties. It would be a negative thing to say I was disappointed. The last thing I would say about the movie was that the puppets were less on board than the actors in the movie.
