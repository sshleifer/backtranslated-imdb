This charming horrible movie. It gives little meaning to start translating into a somewhat strange internal logic. Would not it have been that if it did not continue to fall under the wrong paths, it could not have dropped its uncertainty. The film is a straight forward, "Man Manchester" flick (all of these 1950's 'THE INCREDIBLE INVEST ING MAN' movies) or a terrible big business conspiracy theory movie or mystical next story, or what? Make your choice. Only a mess. Grotesquely putting flapping over the top and flipping all the destinations, leaving empty spaces all over the place. Tobe Hooper took the David Lynch pill. Unfortunately, it did not do enough.
