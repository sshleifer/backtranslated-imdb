It could have been prepared for hell, but most probably the worst movie I've ever seen, it would be a good thing about the whole DVD !!! People took the time to do so much, and still spent money, I'm just glad to rent. Perhaps the true admirer of this film is likely to be loyal to any CGI or to the Gothic caregiver, and I hope Alex Chandon is a good film for lighting and SFX He learned a lesson, the future, that is, he is still in the job. <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing note for the recipients, DO NOT USE !!!!!
