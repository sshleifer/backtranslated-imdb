Okay, a slasher movie. <br /> <br /> Your stereotypical teenagers will go home. We have seen many FTB agents for a while. "So what's the secret ... punks?" I took four different cameras and took the stage, which means there is no sense. "Hey guy, I'm fixing sprinklers" (he was my favorite part of my movie)) Suddenly there is a preacher connected to a couch watching a home movie, there he is killed. <br /> <br /> Do not go anywhere, no police. Suddenly she is in a church in a bridal dress. I swear I'm the most slim slasher I've ever seen.
