When I read "Satan and Daniel Webster" in 2001, I had great hopes when I heard I was a kid and I found it very interesting. The story that did not give me much of a change made some changes. In the story Daniel Webster became a famous advocate from New Hampshire in the story. The film has an editor. When Jabez Stone was attacked by Satan (who was a man in the movie but was a woman in the film), a lawyer would be more meaningful because the spirits of both of them are in one place. As an editor, Daniel Webster does not seem likely to have this ability. <br /> <br /> The act was worthy of everyone except Alec Baldwin and Dan Aykroyd. These are the two actors I want, they have done a very bad job in this movie. They were thinking they were acting in the comedy, but the film was more serious than a comedy. This may be partly due to the fact that the film will be filmed with a special vision and that someone else will be edited. Given this fact, it was strange that all these were related to each other. <BR> <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Hopefully, I was surprised to see that the SNL players in the movie were at a fair level. Later, I would have been more motivated to become a comedy. <br /> <br /> I was not terribly terrible, but it was not very good. If I take back an hour and a half, I would like it. The latter was particularly disappointing. As with the true story, Daniel Webster defeated the devil in trial. Jabez begins again at the beginning of the film ... as if we are just going to the stage with Jabez, then the movie ends suddenly. In fact, they looked at the reality that Jabez repeated the first scene and finally called it. There is no indication that Jabez has the benefit of any information or experience that we have obtained, so why does not he repeat the mistakes he repeats, and maybe it's repeated in an infinite loop? It was extremely disappointing and did not make much sense. Except Baldwin and Aykroyd, everyone is given a decent piece of action, and this is the only thing that is completely and exclusively protected from the general excuse sandwich.
