In my opinion, Largo vinopu ​​was a famous Belgian comic, explaining some kind of adventures of James Bond without a playboy, spy life (no read)! When I was forced to choose a movie for a 5 year old child, I bought it because it was a great admirer of James Bond! <br /> <br /> However, after the opening credit, there are serious doubts: American films are a wonderful start, where no action and torri sex scene offers? Then, is the story complicated by financial actions? <br /> <br /> So, I thought he lost children. <br /> <br /> But in a strange situation, it was captured by Largo and was more James Bond! <br /> <br /> Did Tomer Sisle have a great interpretation? Largo has a tough relationship with his father? There are many box stories that your friends are bad guys, bad guys friends? Exotic places of Honk-Kong, Yougoslavia? <br /> <br /> I do not know, but really cares about Largo ("Will it stay?") and we were delighted at the moment.
