This is the least scary movie I've ever seen. Blob is the biggest secret of a film that manages to eat. Blob moves slowly, zimmerframe can save it from an o.a.p. Blob has a great deal of chance and a typical horror movie is facing a woman. Instead, it stays for half an hour to eat. If you had not seen this movie, I would highly recommend it, it should be taken seriously.
