The writer / director of this film knows nothing about the film. I think that DP was closed on this project and replaced with monkey because every vision was too dark or hotter than the sun. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, and the heroes were of one size. Nobody said that this movie was for the fans of the film but for the fans of the film, but one of them (of course, the writer / director) deceived. No poker admirer in this world likes this movie. Even your money hates this project. Entering a casino and playing with a few hands does not give you the experience of writing poker. Keep your work day. And if he plays poker then he must be hurt'n.
