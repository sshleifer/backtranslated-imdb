... never. This is under. I'm not joking. Theater should warn of some kind. <br /> <br /> I have no words to describe the hell of this movie. The weakening of this folly is not even fun. This film is definitely aimed at some slow turtles in the sand. This incident stretched like Mr Fantastic after the 10-minute bugs Bunny cartoon was explicitly stolen. <br /> <br /> I remember when Wayans was funny. I blamed the poop for pushing the pressure on production of Hollywood's production product. <br /> <br /> I did not like everything about this movie. <br /> <br /> I did not like everything in this movie. . I'm not gonna spoil anything, but it's a chicken wrapped around a small part of baby's Margot Wayans. The thing I wanted was not over. <br /> <br /> I've given this star a star, but it's less worth it. I do not think six minutes of writing a script is worth the star. <br /> <br /> According to some information, Razzie will not be beaten if you stop paying to see this ignorance. Seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film. Avoid all kinds of pricing. You have been warned.
