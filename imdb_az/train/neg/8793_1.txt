As you decide to read this movie or read your thoughts, I suggest these four words: Do not waste your time! The film, Chungking Express, was shot shortly, quickly collided and entirely designed by a true Hong Kong Burger King. I can not remember to watch a movie with an assortment of such a dimensional characters trying to look for ways through this spectacular command! From a philosophical point of view, ridiculous dialogue (the man goes to the underwater house and says, "The tears will dry out with a tissue, but only the time to burn the water"). The same character is also made of towels, soaps, stuffed animals, dirty laundry and so on. It is seen through deep, meaningful communication. Silent, browsing, handmade camera work was another annoying feature that I could do without. If it is not enough to sprinkle on our popcorn, we hear the 60s California Dreaming by Mamas and Papas. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing America to this loss through Rolling Thunder Productions, although she did not realize why she had a talent for my life. He said, "I am very glad that he likes this movie." Many people will consensus in the future to make them happy with more valuable discoveries in the future.
