The director says he loves terror movies in Behind-the-Scenes. He loves them, dedicating the film to Dario Argento, as well as to famous directors like George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. Basically, dedicating this movie to these great directors is to give your mother something for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was casting. EVENTS HAVING. Also, do not dispose of a misunderstanding, a 40-year-old man, for a 18-year-old fever. True, she has been in high school for 22 years. People's reaction to their beloved ones is a fun thing because they have broken their hearts. Or, when a man, a boy, stabbed his ear with an ear (get haha) and his girlfriend goes, "Oh .. my God?" The fear itself is very characteristic. <br /> <br /> This movie has a redeeming factor ... oh wait, there is nothing. <br /> <br /> If you just want to watch this movie just watch the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD. It covers everything and really has a strange song.
