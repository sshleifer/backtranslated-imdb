I watched this show and was not just funny. It could have been the first episode. Recently, ABC has played a lot of stupid shows and is now downstairs as a station. In this show, all characters are pretty bad actors, but if it were good jokes and scripts were terrifying and would still bring down the show. I believe this show will be abolished, but if you see that ABC is so terrifying for the performance you play, they can simply keep these figures on average.
