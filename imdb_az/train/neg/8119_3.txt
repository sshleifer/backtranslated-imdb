First of all, this movie really did not hold me. It was not a bad movie, but a movie I said was "Yes, it was not something special". Perhaps there were drama and things, but it just caught me, but it was more than half a dozen. As I said earlier, he fled in a very cheap way. The quality of the movie (images) remained low, and reminded me of a cheaper film than a well-respected British film director. Camera angles and shots were very amateurish in my opinion. There were no close shots or similar effects to extract really interesting images. I have not seen many English films and I have not been surprised by that, and they have become something like camera work, colors, and so on. The "game" tried to be better, hip and smart (see Lola Rennt in this regard), but it did not succeed. In general, nothing (at least, I'm scared) and just a little indifferent film, which, unfortunately, does not spend more than two hours.
