<br /> <br /> If you do not see this movie, you will not read * spoliers. <br /> <br /> The upcoming Phantasm II has ended; Tall Man, Mike kidnaps his son, Reggie and Tim's new baby spend most of the movie they are trying to get back and Tall Man does not end up as a slave of the Red Planet. It is really ridiculous: the thrillers of the brilliant pink skin were just for funny relief and I was so angry that I could not see Black Karate Chower (Tall Man), its character. It means it will be delayed and eventually becoming a hero, Timin's character, but ... does not work that much. Until the end of this story, Liz has been killed by the crusaders who have been killed, Mike's skull is implanted in a silver coin, Reggie fields, and Dwarf Tim, and there's no one left to stop Tall Man. <br /> <br /> It was shot in 1993 and did not go up to 95, and this was the last time it was in the finals, and it was disappointing and anticlimactic this was a fitting and fitting end to this strange little series. But the fourth changes this end and adds new, but even worse jokes, even worse and more unusual ends ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
