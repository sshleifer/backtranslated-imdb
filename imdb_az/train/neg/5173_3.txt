When I saw it in the shop, I thought it looked really good and original. Wolfs Creek faces chain-like massacres like Texas, and I understand only three cents (about $ 6). To be honest, I do not even think that it is worth it. <br /> <br /> The administrators seemed like 'butcher brethren' a very terrible or strange slasher horror. It did not mean that all the characters would be dimmed, but you could not imagine how far it would take, but the gory sadistic clock and fifteen minutes ended with a clich√© to try to pay attention to the characters they later added to the useless monologue <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Talking about the events in the Caucasus <br /> <br /> Generally, it's an illogical hour. I felt like a two-hour movie, but in fact it was only about 75 minutes. Do not worry if you want a crafty movie. If you want a slasher movie - do not worry - the movie moves slowly down to nothing.
