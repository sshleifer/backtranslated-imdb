There people will be greener there! This is the only explanation I can offer to the Deaths House. And the whole film is just a part of the fear. You will be away from everlasting movies. I seriously wanted to stop this work and turn the TV into a Paint Drying channel, but in my word I suffered everything. <br /> <br /> As a matter of fact, here's the main story of the story. The seventh group is paid $ 1000 for a few bizarre old fishermen to take them after they miss the main fishermen who are desperate to go to an island in the Pacific Northwest for the "Rave of the Century" (about 8 people and un-raving music). To be worthy of all the dough we must be so rave! The fisherman keeps in mind that the island is known as the Island of the Dead (know that these dead are HOUSE) and that all of them are convicted. <br /> <br /> The first mistakes are here. Why will a small rave (Century be my foot!) To be held on some distant island? Why does anyone pay a lot of money to earn money by the will? <br /> <br /> After their arrival, the rave (which consists of a small tent consisting of about 2 tents) and a port-a-john collapsed, there is blood everywhere and no one is around. What will the rational thinker do? Of course, avoid their lives. But it's clear, obviously blind people decide to look at them. Soon they will find an old closed house 50 times inside as well as outside. A half hour wrapped around the forest, looks like an excuse to kill some smaller characters, and comes back home again with more tedium. <br /> <br /> We shouted this strange catastrophe, turned into a strange dialogue, a charming action, a god-jumbo expedition, and clips from the popular arcade games. same name Why I do not know anything is accepted as a good idea with film artists. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> last. Resident Evil looks like cinema glory. Hell, even Double Dragon, is worth the Oscar for this track. JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who is still perfect with his dignity. He simply took his money and fled, but he did his best with terrible writing and carried it a little bit. The rest of the others are scared. <br /> <br /> Additionally, if you cut off intentional and senseless nudity, I see no reason why this film will be shown on Saturday morning. There is no fear in the least. Caribbean pirates are worse than skeletons in this movie. And why did all these bad guys come from? There were a few people on the island. I think it justifies the reason they choose to reuse the images repeatedly. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, the zombie has been killed several times. <br /> Who punishes this scandalous destruction of Celaloid? No one except Uwe Boll, Director. Control over the movie is inaccurate. Instead, you can see what actors should do and do not know the zombies really did not. Players were always in the midst of long sentences, and after seeing the next card, they continued to talk because the player resembled their cards. <br /> <br /> In addition, the film is shot as a two-part mini-series. I've seen better television production. And do not start editing me. The film is thousands of nonsensical shots and thousands of nude puzzles with meaningless camera pans. It did not give any real skills or talent. How can this really mean that these inadequate bad guys will be pulled out and that George A. Romero will not be able to get anyone to call him? The House of the Dead is a series of irony in a lazy attempt to become "post-modern" for Romero, but it only irritates that he thinks he is in the same league as the REAL zombie film. The value of the 1.85: 1 anamorphic picture looks great, and the Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is clean but very unimpressive and serves more than just the most commonly used ADR. DVD comes with additions, but why torture yourself? Does this research not give enough warning? Stay away from! I tell you, everyone is condemned! He was sentenced! He ran away!
