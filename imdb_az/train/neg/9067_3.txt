Jason Segelin (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared) liked most of this movie, though he was one of the worst films I recently ever known (Loser and Dr. T are also listed on this list). <br /> <br /> Yes, although the movie was very good, some funny moments did not laugh. The stage is not bad - deception artists are faced with the game when they deceive their way through the college and discover someone by their suggestion. The problem is that not all the heroes were so difficult, none of them interested me. The invader (played by talented Jason Schwartzman) was such a psychopath that he was not ridiculous to watch him - he was not particularly funny or attractive, he really is very dangerous and does not have fun to watch. It was difficult to edit the film - it continued to cross between fantasy and reality and often identified what. Only two or three of the bag deceits were really shown, and they were forced to believe that they were cunning artists - their schemes were prepared for a better movie. The story of the so-called love story was absurd and incredible, in fact it was foolish and poorly written and directed. I can talk about the film's lack, but you get the idea. $ 4 does not have the cost of gas to rent from the rent or movie shop!
