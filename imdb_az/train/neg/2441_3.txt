I thought that "intensive care" was pretty bad and very unwelcome and funny. But at least I'm not as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> But the classic moment of all time: Peter (Koen Wauters) was stabbed and stabbed by the killer. It creates a corner of the corridor. Amy (Nada van Nie) knees next to him and says, "Poor Peter, can I give you some help?" She asks. <br /> <br /> This film was shot in Dutch and English. In order to deduce expenses, all the tiles are from the United States, the silhouette of the Manhattan fund in the news studio. If you're a Dutchman and watch the original version of the Dutch, it's funny.
