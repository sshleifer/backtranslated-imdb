<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Previous 8 different 1994-1997 I explained that Spider-Man animated films were made with video cameras, so why did not I go to the stomach for the first time? <br /> The 1967 Spider-Man cartoon was the best and still the best. (I'm not going to get into the awesome psychedelic version - give me traditional betrayers.) <br /> <br /> It's bad to act on new products, and read a report with no feeling or insatiable. Paul Soles, where are you now? This guy was the best voice acting for Spider-man. No one is approaching. Watching Hidden Wars, a great idea for a cartoon mini-series, made me weak. Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi. Red Skull and Doc Ock, on a scene, Ock is heavier in Russia, while Red Skull is no German accent! The old Marvel Comic Hero series of 1966 had a better sound effect. Iron Man sang like a iron mask, Captain America sounded stunning, not as some young children. Paul Frees is the best thing in the 1960's. Former voice actors were pioneers and never look like them. Do you hear Mel Blanc's son? <br /> <br /> It is said that such actions are OK, therefore they have all the fancy shades and are adorned with beautiful paints. If the more motion is bad, sometimes you can say more with less action. Sometimes they become robots when they allow the computer to miss the movements. I really do not think any of these animators will know what's going on. <br /> <br /> Stories are badly written and some of their lines to their heroes are horrible. Why, for example, when the heroes fight each other, do they struggle with each other? It was a bare pretext, in secret wars, which caused discord. I see the hero as dark, unknown, and mysterious - like Punisher, but why Thing and Iron Man can not hold their patience with each other, then Torch combines. This is not the next comic but the heroes tend to pull each other for a few seconds, because "everyone" wants to see these things. There is a good reason to fight, and maybe you can pull it off, but there are some reasons why "Hey, what are you doing here" and "Do not tell me what to do." Another written scene is Harry Osborn's Wedding on his own to destroy Peter's wedding. All these scenarios were terrible. <br /> <br /> Last, but at least, another critic, Juvenile, calls for Violence, which means no punches. In secret wars, Lizard carefully threw Thing's accusation. But evil devils punish evil men in a block. He must simply step back and lift the heavy things and make the bad man feel unhappy. Of course, these cartoons are not for adults, but for children under the age of 12. So they can not punch, because the mother does not believe in such violence. But it can shatter everything, it's in cartoons. As a child came up with a fashionable fashion, I saw cartoons to wash one another. What's a fist to cut? Is there really less violence in the world? Because he shot the sunny and insidious new cartoons? When I'm watching new products, I think it's the most offensive. <br /> <br /> Kids, enjoying any of these animated cartoons, have seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 rating
