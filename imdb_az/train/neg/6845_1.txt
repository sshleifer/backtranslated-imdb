"I went to the movies, did not see Beat Street, it was not a bad one, but kinda 'tidy' Krush Groove was a flick, I did not cry, but I hit the Rappin Line. <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian>. This movie is a serious (80s-only f * cking terrible) wack. As an emcee, Mario Van Peebles is a player hell. As an actor, Mario Van Peebles is the hell of a champion. <br /> <br /> Any movie that calls itself "Rappin" has reached the highest standard of this genre. So why did the 6 year old spread through the corridors, even with standards such as knee-high Webster? Because it is weak. Even the weakest is B.E.T. or the Comedy Center will be touched with a 10-meter gold chain. <br /> <br /> Blondie's "Rapture" is the def poetry next to this bit of Dr Suess. So avoid this movie, do not be a boobie! <br />
