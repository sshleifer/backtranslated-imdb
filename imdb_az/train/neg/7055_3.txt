"JAWANI DIWANI" is just a sad film. I agree with the last person to say, "I missed your joy." lol <br /> <br /> These jokes were just terrible. The performance was moderate. Much is wrong in the movie. Emrah is worthy of a good thing. All CELINA JAITLEY was exposed. Hrishitta bhatt was OK. Emrah Hashemi also had a lot. <br /> <br /> MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate man who wants to be famous. So she uses RADHA and loves her because her father is a music director and can help her become famous (because her father is obedient to everything). One day, MANN and friends will go to GOA to get some fun. He is faced with ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and is completely out of sight and tries to flirt with BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> That night, ROMA can not open its door, MANN decides to help her. Seeing that he could not, ROMA asked for help. Though he went, MANN decided to open the door and go inside and sits in his bed BLA BLA BLA. ROME comes and they have a night stand. But one night ROMA fell in love with her. This morning, they will see the underground dress (MAHESH) they all saw. This belt loves ROMA and can not stop what it does. She commands her to marry and obeys the command of MANN and Merry's ROMA, with a sense of fear. Then the news of the marriage ends in the newspaper. MANN sees ROMA as it likes it after making a music video together. Now you are trapped between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> The film is horrible. "WHAT IS THE TRUE NEIGHBORS" song, the remix version is better. It's great at "DIAMOND DIAMOND". Title track is also awesome. GUYS, WATCHING THIS FILM.
