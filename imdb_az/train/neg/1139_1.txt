Please, I have not seen the movie since I discovered it in 2007, and my city is smaller and does not carry it. But I really want to say something about it. In fact, I'm researching the university with the leading role player Richard Maurice Bucke and I would like to emphasize that the person with the main character is actually different! Hollywood's ideas and artistic licenses give the real Dr. Bucke completely approved hysterectomy to treat females in women and would not use something liberal as represented in the film. I think it's funny to see some of the film critics who write for the legitimate newspapers that say that the film has some of its historical works! The only truth I see is friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman. Please, do not waste your time with the horror film that real women now are in the hands of this doctor, who is now credited by the film industry.
