This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The story was boring, the dialogue was defective and a moving hammock. This movie is a film school homework project, but I'm not sure, but it's certainly a game. It is not particularly successful as a central manifestation of what he is trying to do himself alone. Horizontal cameras are a cheap and unoriginal method to hide cuts.
