When a movie gets a sound, one usually just does not like it and is dissatisfied because it does not have a low rating and therefore it simply decides to drag it instead of giving it a low rating. <br /> <br /> Bonesetter is a perfect example of the 0/10 movie. Nothing is right and does not give any chance because it does not really do anything. There is a bad D & D novel that does not hold it together and has a complete lack of functioning. Obviously, no one in this project has made any serious effort, because the hard work of those who have never been completely understood is more. It's a real horrible film.
