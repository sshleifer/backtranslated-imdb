Just joke! This was one of the worst films I've ever seen! Unfortunately, it was very pleasant. Dude, and I leased it for that purpose, because it was bad. Sweet old horror hair is always good for some laughs. The area was stunk, dubbing some sounds, the quality was horrendous. But I am sure that the explosion is following him!
