This 1970 film was not well advanced, but it was not good when released. Nevertheless, the idea of ​​fatalistic youth love was perhaps a great success because of the Vietnam War's appeal to satirical viewers with constant television broadcasts. Oliver Barrett IV, who has been acquainted with Jennifer Cavelli, an antagonist who is proud of the field worker class, and falling Oliver Barrett IV, is a pure driver, since he belongs to the privileged Harvard hockey player. Her old schoolteacher naturally does not accept Jenny, and in a typical rebellion movement, meaning that the young couple marry in respectful ceremonies at one of the hippie eras. He puts his dream job in New York, but he suddenly gets sick and dies from terminal illness. There is a curtain of contemporary filmmaking techniques released by director Arthur Hiller, but none of them can keep the old, stubborn story. <br /> <br /> Both Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw have begun to star together with this movie, like Oliver and Jenny, but for this reason, their depth or complexity is a must-have character. At least O'Neal, the boy, is sincere in his approach to hell, but MacGraw is so busy and smirky that Oliver is hard to see what he's doing on the edge of his sarcastic façade. John Marley (Jenny's plainspoken baker's father, Phil, two years ago before discovering the start-up racer two years ago) is as good as Phil Philip, like Barrett paterfamilias, which looks like Ray Milland. The familiar Frances Lai music has become almost parody for years. The print quality on the DVD is good, though it's just an exhilarating explanation by Hiller. The most exciting bit of trivia, the writer Erich Segal (based on whose film) Oliver thought of as a mixture between two Harvard roommates? Vice President Al Gore and actor Tommy Lee Jones, a little actor in the film, act as one of Oliver's hospices.
