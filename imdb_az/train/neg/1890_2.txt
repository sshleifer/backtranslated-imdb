I'm not convinced that the director is trying to shoot a documentary or film with the theme I found in this topic. A mixture of these two genres does not just work and leaves nothing in the middle of nowhere. This is more documentary because the director chooses the vast majority of events in our daily lives. If it is meant to be a drama / drama, it is very boring and monotonous. In either case, what is the moral or message that the director wants to convey to the audience? Are there people who abuse others around us? Are there many naked lunatics around us? So what is ..........?
