OK ..... This carnosaur series is third. Give stars with dinosaur puppets! At the beginning of the film, you will not see the cause of Dino when the corpses are counted. Only you can see the look of Dino's eye in the clever way to hide the bad dolls! In the first 16 minutes after the initial film, Scott Walentine entered a team squad like Rance, a team of special forces, and after a while after a large box Dino ramps the body parts and dead body begins to find the team fails and a velociraptor scream, quite creepy you can hear it! then a black girl went forward and now found a blooper! This is a predatory hand opening and cutting your face, but if you can stop when the predator comes out, you can see a man with a puppet in his hand! WTF! The story is simple. 1. Despite some terrorist attacks, some trucks cause. 2. There are ten tone raptor in dead errors and a giant t-rex. What happened to T-Rex there? 3. Rance and some nerds will kill dinosaurs! Unfortunately, some stupid blonde girl wanted her to have one of them. (4. Holy Cheses, there are wheels on the job of predators!) 5. Dino is now on a quiet boat. There was something strange about the T-Rex HES neck 7. LAST. If you want a good laugh, the movie is good.
