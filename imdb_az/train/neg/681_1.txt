<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Therefore, for a few days now, Bread is a stranger sent to Earth to find just one penny and It is a "Starlight" half-breed, partly man and partly foreigner. As you can see, the Earth is in an awkward state. Something is wrong with the genetics of humanity, and for decades the world will become a polluted desert. Repeating only half the DNA of the genus, a benevolent alien race can save the planet. Do not ask what the film is like, because the film gives an impression of the destruction of people in the world. You would think that the earth could only be saved by the extinction of pollutants! In any case, a half-breed, living in a small South-East town and his mother is a red-headed Caucasian and his father, Willie Nelson, is native American Billy Wirth from his mother's line. Was this Bomber Carmen Electra a type of malarkey betraying the bomb as 'The Chosen One'? In the Chong boat, Wirth is the result of dragging his motorcycle into the lake, breaking up only his girlfriend. Before telling the word of the call, "Chirag" discloses his secret to Wirth, not surprised for a moment and spreads word to the Wirth family. Chong, with Wirth's mother, seemed to have lost his marbles for several years. And Wirth's father was a stranger who abandoned him. Of course, it is a standard wildfire that is easily chosen by Wirth to come to Earth, so that Wirth's DNA can be used to turn humanity into slaves. (Huh?) Its ridiculous attempts to use Telepathic powers and capture Wirth make the most of the screen and are the worst scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, several days before a few days, the above-mentioned scenes, with cunning alien. But the effect is like the movie. The opening scene connects Chong with his superiority on his spaceship, which connects Chong's with a flowing pink, not a person we can not see. They use telepathy rather than spoken words, so we get subtitles. Trouble, both Chong and his subtitles are similar to each other, and there is no indication of what the director is talking about. Shipbuilding, this side of Ed Wood's film is the worst hit out of Hollywood. Now, when I'm dealing with a low-budget movie, I've been hit by it. The most attack was the simplest: a fake night sky. The stars in the sky are very fake, they say the voice of dialogue. Traditionally, it's moments when Chong is coming from Pleiades, and we take a shot of seven stars. Well, seven stars take half of the night sky, but any stargazer is a star cluster between the Pleiades' Perseus and the Toros horoscopes, and the cluster is no longer in the sky. These effects are only bad for the jaw to slide down and down every moment. Be careful, because Willie Nelson will go through the finals when paying attention to a person and giving the results. . . <br /> Sarkozy, the star is brilliant; This is the last star to see tonight; I wish I'd like it; <br /> <br /> Zantara's account is 10 to 1.
