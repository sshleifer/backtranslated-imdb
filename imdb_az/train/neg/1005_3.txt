There is nothing to do with the film when it's going outdoors under the Greek summer night! Edison started singing well with singers - Morgan Freeman and Morgan Freeman, a good start ... (In a movie there is a good start to catching the audience, filling the middle part of a little boring movie, giving less information about the character and less acting, the third part of the movie is really a good thing, you can remember the movie ...) Thirty police officers (throwing weapons in a building) can throw a guy behind a car, failing to shoot at a single one (but 3) and then the guy takes off the shooter (in order to kill the rest 3), the sky full of stars is a great way to have fun with such a movie!
