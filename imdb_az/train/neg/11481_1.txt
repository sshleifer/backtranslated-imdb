If they could get Ed Asneri, why did not they buy other actors instead of those who went to the same church with their producers? And why the protagonist has never dropped the character of the smart old ancestor in danger. This prevented the old boy from being brutally damaged, and the young boy would feel guilty along with his disability for a lifetime. Why I think that the main character is giving up money, and why the old man works like a dog, even if he volunteers for extra work. D-bag is a bad guy, because he is a long-time boyfriend, why a soldier is better. There is jealousy, good reason to keep him away from his homeland and to manage a maneuvering guardian. Not all symbols intended to be approved, but everyone is a "bad person". How did one wine broker and a vodka worker meet?
