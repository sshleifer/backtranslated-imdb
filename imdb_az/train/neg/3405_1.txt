I do not believe how much this movie is read. It's like watching the police academy, except for people who do not have anything to talk about ... and wait, there's a stupid robot that needs to be sidekick. I can understand the cessation of disbelief, but it is absolutely true. Not just any movie about this movie. It goes like a head of staff at a large medical station, like watching a person who acts as a doctor, throwing off non-medical words around him. People now wear clothes that are not suitable for the space program. I feel like I'm watching a "b" movie in a valley.
