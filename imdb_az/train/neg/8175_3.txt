<br /> <br /> This film is a good mood and captures 80 good tails with good performance. <br /> <br /> But ..... I've been waiting for the scenario to leave the mills, as well as the strange, except for a few comedy moments. This character is totally dramatic and incredible, and the screenwriter is probably full of right-wing clich√©s that they see as watching a panoramic documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is that there is no real story in this movie. <br /> <br /> It just does not happen, and in the end you do not worry about what is happening. <br />
