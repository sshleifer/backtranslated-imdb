At Walmart, I bought this DVD for $ 1. After seeing it, I can go back to the store and try to get my money back! The reason why I did not film 2 and 1 is that the story has only a few novel stories, though it does not go to the level where it is not really interesting. This film has all the points that are being prepared for the ultra-low budget, amateur player and the liberal dose of sex (for the film shot in the early 60's), made in the cinema market. In fact, perhaps, the only reason for the film is to give a quick sum of money and I'm surprised to know that somebody can use it in addition. The film is about a wacko physician who wants to transport a girlfriend's body to a donor's body that is not suspicious. Most potential donors are skanky strippers or a model. The only real purpose in the film is to remove most of the clothes. However, the film has a lot to watch for even the naughty bits, and the film is not horrific enough to be worthy of watching by the evil buffs.
