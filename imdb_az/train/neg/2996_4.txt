A sub-standard episode of a season that was born again. She deals with the subject of reincarnation and does not fly alone. I did not go to a great deal of reincarnation and could have been part of my episode. This refers to the Tooms case, which is a beautiful continuation of the previous episode. But there are positives. Failed because of what happened at the beginning of the episode. I think it's ridiculous to choose a reincarnation to a dead body of a dead man who is not completely involved. The girl waits for the eighth time before she gets revenge. The Mulder & Scully dialogue, a sensitive Mulder & Scully dialogue, has a serious deficiency. If you are reincarnated, maybe this episode is on your street. If not, at least you can learn what bradycardia is.
