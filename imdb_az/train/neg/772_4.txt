This movie is not as good as all of Christ's movies I have ever seen. And in this story I want to finish Pilate's Jesus, and I was thrilled that the Bible (in other films) is in a different position. This is not a very important issue: the doomsday. None of the other films throws this very important part: in many of these cases we all have faith. Paul writes, "If Christ is not raised from the dead, our faith will be wasted." In this film, an impressive sight for me saw the remains of the palms used when Jesus entered Jerusalem on the streets. <br /> <br /> Finally, Jesus is not a myth against a Jewish commentator. In fact, he was also a YEW. There are many documents (or relational and secular) proving the existence of this extraordinary man (or I have said that God was human) really changed humanity. I strongly recommend him (as a historian) to read about the most brilliant Jewish interpretation of the 1st century, Flavius ​​Iusepus. Century
