OMG is one of the worst films I have ever seen, and I am a student of iv. I do not understand why Angelina Jolie is in this movie. Does he need a dirty money? I love the AJ and I almost saw everything, because I was waiting for these two cats again. SOO was bad! even worse than bad, just bad. There were 1 or 2 funny little moments, but all 101 minutes was a bad disappointment. I can not say that AJ looks good because it was not good. Romeo and Juliet can not be the subject of the plot unless they expect to give up again. The whole apartment is disappointing. Maybe 12 can be a good movie, but I really do not recommend it.
