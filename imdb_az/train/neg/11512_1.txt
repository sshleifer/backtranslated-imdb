*** WARNING! CLAIMS HEREI DETACHED! *** <br /> <br /> If it were not stranded on a desert island, it looked semi-autobiographical about what could happen to Madonna. There is no problem for Madonna in this role and it shows. Madonna plays with Madonna and she can not even get that right. I know what you say, you say, "How do you know Madonna really is something you never saw?" True, I am not, but do we all remember "truth or dignity"? <br /> <br /> Kevin Costner knows this. <br /> <br /> In 2002, you thought Madonna had learned one way or another, which was a "crossover" silver screen. For goodness, did Madonna not see the "Glitter"? How did Mariah Carey show her in the movie world? Mariah touches Madonna's pens for beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characteristic, depth, and you call it! Everything we look at at Madonna's world from this perspective is only in her. <br /> <br /> If you say something to Madonna, it's a sequel. She has created a world of women's fashion for 20 years in MTV's love. Now she has been filming the role of women in the film and society for more than 20 years, and the qualities that she is working with, laughing at the most hated, terrible, defective and defective features known to be locked inside women. *** GREAT CLAIMS! If you do not want to know, do not read anything ... <br /> <br /> There is a good thing to say about this movie, and I really was surprised. They did not go for the Hollywood Ending, which is characterized by Madonna's character. When the typical, happy Hollywood ends, Madonna's character has died on the island and her patience, humble, charming husband is finally free to have a good, worthy woman with the opposite woman, and her husband dies, and both are happier then. <br /> <br /> But in this extremely difficult situation, she survived and once again this poor victim of her husband was once filled with a spouse and a devil, and her life would be a paradise. <br /> <br /> *** WANT GREAT
