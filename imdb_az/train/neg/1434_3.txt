James Bond in the desert? It is apparent that Pierce Brosnan was also shot before the release of Tommorrow Never Dies (1997) and Golden Eye (1995) as Bond. Without a doubt, the two potentials of the film are becoming worse by fighting Brosna's marginally more convincing performance, and Annie Galipeau (like Pony, Gray Owl's love interests), with a sophisticated written dialogue. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the two brothers are perfect. But the movie is not about the dark. This is about the nakedness of the Canadian wilderness. While photography is pretty good, there is no ground for the harsh realities in the desert. Annie Galipeau, like Pony, is unfortunately convincing that I really want him to believe. It was a relatively inexplicable twenty-year-old film in this movie, and it might have been a job, but Richard Attenborough was not that difficult at all. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it is something that belongs to her. But who in the wilderness mask and eyebrows are consistent? <br /> <br /> It is not just that, as Bond (sorry, Gray Owl) uses photos to browses forest tests and kissing relatives. <br /> <br /> The mountainous north-eastern forestry people just do not seem beautiful and stay calm while fighting for survival. Which brings me to another point: the movie does not reveal the period of 1930s. <strong> William Nicholson </ strong> </ div> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the comments he sent, but nevertheless I do not agree. There are many potentials, but it's misunderstood and even thought bad. If it were a religious film, it would have been panned, but because of its propagation of the curiosity, the film remains "critical" because it is "politically correct". Sorry, for all, I do not buy it. Amen.
