<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - The divan that follows the communiqu√© act resembles a paradise. While talking to paradise, the film is based on the 1978 film "Wait for Hell". It was a good movie, and that's good - a group of postgraduate writers can get decent materials and make it garbage. Directors Chris and Paul Weitz will not miss nearly every goal. From understanding to storytelling, "Earth" fails to fail; <br /> <br /> Kris Rock is a cowardly standup comedian in this film and in real life. When she goes on stage at an amateur night in the local theater, her manager (Frankie Faison) plays Lance Barton, who even feels sorry for her. Immediately after setting up the screenwriter's talent, the character is killed by a speeding truck. Death, played by Eugene Levy, made a mistake before Lance's rising. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> God's Chazth Palminter is very angry and decided to make a decision Lance, as long as the rest of his time, he only takes up his body 60-year-old white millionaire. The old man's name is Mr. Wellington, and his life has its own problems. His wife, Jennifer Coolidge, is in contact with his stolen assistant (Greg Germann). But that's good, because Mr. Lance was in love with a young black woman named Sontee (Regina King). However, there are areas where Wellington, Lance is trying to get a better body and has a mixed sense of Sontee. <br /> <br /> With Mr Wellington's financial hospital coverage. <br /> <br /> There are some good ideas for "to the ground", but they are a meaningless and unconvincing love story that is not full of works and recycled materials. It's the biggest problem we've ever got on the tape, Mr. Wellington. Chris Rock is an actor with popularity and promotions, so this film will not be anything; all the characters see the new Lance as Mr. Wellington, but we see him as Chris Rock. It is convenient for the love story; we believe that a young woman will fall for Lance, but in fact, she is, in fact, an old, gray-haired geezer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Just say, 'There is something about Mary.' In funny scenes, symbols are exposed to unusual experiences. Here Lans knows that an old man is in his body, and older people will not work normally. <br /> <br /> According to Lent, Lance was such that she could have potential. <br /> <br /> A problem with the concept: first of all, we know Mr. Wellington. We do not know what the body really is. To unlock everything, Chris Rock should be the center of attention here and the character is like Rock too. She reads daily jokes on a simple standup that gives you tedious and painful; his dialogue is clear, wooden and simple. I hated the humor of the movie. There are many flawless jokes and terrifying comic situations. <br /> <br /> Kristin Kris Kok is like watching that there is no character in the movie. <br /> <br /> Let's emphasize the advantages of "Down to Earth". Mark Addy does not do anything worse than the "Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas" here. Eugene Levy and Chazz Palmentari were not good at all, but they were in the mercy of the scalped script. Here are the good qualities I can mention right now, and if you give me a week to remember, I will not be able to come longer.
