The photography on the DVD was dark and I thought the screen was dead. I have not seen half the movie. Perhaps this is poorly prepared and interesting. I did not find a story about the Black Widow. I hope for a mystery or a tension, but the first few frames are not enough to care for. I leased the movie, especially for Willem Dafoe and dropped his talent. I do not believe that Giada Colagrande has been filming for a long time to develop a great movie. She can become an attractive and actor, but has taken on numerous responsibilities in this film. Although they are married in real life, there is no chemistry on the screen. Their attitude did not seem convincing. I do not understand why other characters are involved in trickery.
