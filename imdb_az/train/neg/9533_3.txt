A text prologue warns us not to allow us to go into our bad home, but I think that a more relevant word is "entropy." <br /> <br /> Simmily, Seymour Cassell, in San Diego, was alone in the San Francisco office in Tiburon and at his splendidly expensive home. Two girls (like Donna, Jackson and Colleen Camp, Sondra Locke) knock on their gates, asking directions. The rain falls and they are shaking like two pitiful catfishers, and they are not sure of the address they are looking for, and George, who has something and something else, invites them to invite them. pizza by fire. All three are roughly five minutes away from the bubble in the Corcun bath, with two explicit nudity during exposure, triple exposure, four exposure and dodecaquppa. They spend the night on a triple and the next morning they give her breakfast. But something was whipped up because Georgie's guests tore everything with their fingers and squeezed the kettle and poured it on the canvas and said, "Eat like anvils!" Says George and tells them to go out. In your dreams. <br /> <br /> Now do not take me wrong. Sondra Locke is an unusually young blonde with cobalt-blue eyes and Colleen Camp jumps around like a superball. It should be noted that when Locke arrived, they recorded the strongest desserts in Shelbyville, Tennessee and sprouted the first five or ten minutes since they could not help. /> <br /> However, the girls are like that, and the film is like that. The film is then immersed in naked green light. The mirror makeup opens the faces of the mirrors in the double mirror. They deliver a guy boy and then drown him to make sure. They burn a storm and windows and furniture. They are one of the scenes where two people sit between each other, eat licking and then jumping each other's bones. <br /> And Georgie? They connect Georgie first with Georgie to the kitchen with a kitchen (in McIlheny's Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet that does not contain anything you can not find in a small red bottle), put it on him, poured flour and milk, put him a psychotic trial on Tolstoy's half- slapped around, sneaked in suits, then went to him and his virtually destroying upper-middle class home and sent to a delivery showroom. <br /> <br /> As for the player, as someone told Georgie, "First of all, treat these girls politely, then act panic after closing." And to the girls, "First embarrass, do not want anyone to practice it, then be mad." And that's it. <br /> <br /> Photography and groundwork are just a porn movie taken in the 1970s. I am confident that overall skill is insufficient. San Francisco requires effort and talent to transform the ugly. The score gives us two Leitmotivs. Georgie's is some pop tune with lyrics about "getting free" and "giving." Jackson and Donna's "My Good Old Dad" is a charming pattern. <br /> <br /> I also confirm the moral lesson behind the story. First of all, you should not just give it a lot of fun. All very educated.
