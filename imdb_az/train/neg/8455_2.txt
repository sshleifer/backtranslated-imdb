"Arahan" does not have a positive effect on the Kung Fu genre. <br /> <br /> It is incorrect to compare the inspirational arguments and quality of this mixed-action movie, Stefen Cow. <br /> <br /> First of all, the battle scenes are nothing new. All the things presented here are better and better handled by Yimou Zhang, Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan. Fighting in smart Motion Pictures needs logic. <br /> <br /> There is no point in serving the strikes that have no harmful effects, as is the case with the Matrix. <br /> <br /> The seductive woman has attracted the leading So-Yi Yoon screen, but in fact has conquered the physical demands of the role groundlessly. Ziyi Zhang made it so easily "at the Flying Trench". Background of martial arts works well in Kung Fu films. Sending inexperienced actors in these skills is a serious mistake (see Aya Aya Ueto in "Asumi"), and if you are not a very talented director, "Arahan" is not Seung-wan Ryoo.
