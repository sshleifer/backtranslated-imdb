I know what the consciousness around it is ... It's a really bad movie ... it's nothing to me, a one-sided scene where everyone is in the party and plays a beautiful song. There is nothing in the film to succeed in watching the audience, there is nothing to think of as some people do not have. Different stories ... Anderson's "Magnolia" was a bigger attempt to rebuild, but it failed ... OK, light and easy to watch, but it's also movies. Maybe you can write a story before filming ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian films I've ever seen
