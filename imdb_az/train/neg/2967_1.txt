Yet, one of the Goddesses, which my country is most misunderstood, is "curled up" by the "western" who does not understand the esoteric symbolism of the Mother Goddess in dark forms, which takes the fearful form of Kali Mata to destroy our inner self and intimidate our self-esteem. but the events that are reflected in this film are simply absurd.It's an angry form to frustrate our inner self, our limitations, and ego, until she gets to another shape, she's angry, so in your heart, for your dancing, smashan he burns all his karma and he brings you to the truth and the truth, the darkness and the light that serves the true and the truth, and the mother is also the nature and the nature of the physical world, the cruel and destructive You can not grow up and die without death and destruction, and Kali represents the power of the universe's spiritual and spiritual development and destructive power for life. People who do not know anything for India or who do not know the Divine can buy one of our favorite goddesses and use it as a cheap prostitute to make a low-budget, unlucky horror movie. How dear Mommy describes as a horror that tears and tears the eyes over the eyelids! It is only terrible for those who are loyal to their devotion and who live with deception, greed, anger and other inner devils. It is clear to me that the writer of this film must have serious hell claims to see himself deluding the ego and Kali as terribly and terribly. When he succeeds, he turns into a magic, beautiful and young form, and is a great beauty to see that he is captivating the whole universe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kali Maa is an ancient mother, According to the Westerners, they use religions like me or the religions of the Caribbean Islands such as Santeria and Vodouun and other religions, which are really very positive, to divide the unheard of elements and to exaggerate the Western mentality. absolutely funny. <br /> <br /> Kali Maa is actually a caring, gentle mother, and we're tearing her tears, because she does not believe in anything, breathing, or belief. with beautiful legs and love. <br /> <br /> My mother is sometimes very angry to protect her customs from her and foreign forces. <br /> <br /> Many praise REAL Kali Maa, who showed God's way and accomplishment.
