I must believe in my instincts better: no expectations - no disappointment. Instead, I will face a similar masterpiece as Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and I was disappointed in the horror. Powhakatsi is nothing but my precious thought, a cheap attempt to earn money for the success of the predecessor of the predecessor, and - artistic - it happens with failure. A producer who collects materials from Koyaanisqatsi appears in a hurry, threw everything slowly into action, and under the name of Philip Glass's throng, some pop artists quickly dropped a series of similar background music. While Koyaanisqatsi is entertaining audiences with intelligent fast and slow motion changes, Powakkatsi is a long sequence of single images in slow motion (seeing them in VCR's fast preview mode means you want to say it). But I was most disappointed with Philip Glass's soundtrack. In the Casio calculator, this commercial voice recorder, which can be easily compiled on any 14-year-old day, is unlikely that I'm the same composer and I can not do it yet. Gorgeously designed romantic and perfectly synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All this, spend a great deal of time! My advice: Do not forget the traders! Again, look at Koyaanisqatsi!
