Despite being a good first season, this series has never come to the realization of its potential. The original Star Trek series was postponed by Rick Berman, the producer's chief producer, who felt artificially restricted and restricted to determining what would be the Star Trek series, as a prequel. this futuristic show is dramatically increasingly anaconic). The genuine showman Brannon Braga did not help with issues that were unsatisfactory and tedious repetition of the previous Trek episodes and careful franchise internal mythology (which was only painful because it was only for payment). To this end, I have not seen a lot of talented actors (except for Jolene Blaylock) for a very long time. All of this series has been produced by the audience (even a Trekker audience) in the bubbles outside the contemporary television landscape, with its dramatic desires and desires more demanding and complex. Unfortunately, Berman and Braga believed that Paramount was afraid of a high level of "franchise fatigue" and that they would not go to the main auditorium but were out of the way. <br /> <br /> Simply put, it's like a Battlestar: Galactica in a TeeVee universe. "and" Shield "powers should give the public a public" Star Trek ", which is a great way to measure and sharpen competition, simply and easily.
