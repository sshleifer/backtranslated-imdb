This film was unable to examine the humanity of animals who left me with an empty feeling. [Spoiler ahead] I'm not sure Dr D is a serious reason to abandon a huge buyout contract to really help her furry friends. Despite the fact that Babe (originally) focuses on animal humanity and anti-human beings, all the liveli animals in this film, grinder (more so, can understand their meaningless space). Without the rich behavior of Eddie Murphyin, this film would be a flop.
