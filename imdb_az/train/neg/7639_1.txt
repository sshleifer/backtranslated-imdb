I saw this movie at NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and thought it was pretty bad. The first and most striking thing was taken away; In addition to showing the capabilities of the filmmaker (except I believe he is a director), no story has been accompanied by a very slow motion and excessive arty that does not appear in a wise and aesthetic sense. It appeared that this film would emerge with an ambitious movie student. The main actor (Sam Levine) was, of course, very sweet, but a good mediocre actor; The remainder of the rest is so bad. The story itself was also predictable. I have to admit that most viewers enjoyed the movie; I was always laughable and nostalgic, but I did not like it.
