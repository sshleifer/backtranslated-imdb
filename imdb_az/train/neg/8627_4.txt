Although this is generally a cheerless jungle-adventure movie, there are some things - the parameters are pretty nice and the pacing of the adventure is good. <br /> <br /> Keith sets out with a sparkling drunk knight with a rich boy Van Hoffman and his beautiful spouse, Shushu, to accompany a hunting. expedition in the country of yamyam. He does not take anything seriously. The shower is decorated and Keith uses its wide range - it really does have to move too much. <br /> <br /> This film has nothing to draw attention to, or nothing in this movie. We move away from him. As it is produced for shivering, it succeeds without flaw. A good 2 AM cable programmer.
