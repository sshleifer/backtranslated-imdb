Darcy and her young daughter, Pamela, her mother's lover Peter went to the country where Peter left a doctor in the city to be a writer and to make a bed and breakfast. Despite this terrible story, Pamela learns from a girl in the city that once deformed witch lives in that house. She was called 'Gear Peri' because she had been kidnapped after receiving the latest baby tooth. This work in Hanno, 'Gear Peri' woke up. <br /> <br /> Pamela and her last baby look at the teeth, but if she faces the same fate waiting for Pamela <br /> <br /> Believe that you are a child of her paint it in a very generous way. Do not they just want to make happy childhood memories as nightmares? Another category included in the same category was "Darkness Falls (2003)". I can not compare it to what's inside the building, because I have not seen the latter, but I've read that they agree. For a slightly flat DVD movie, this DTV effort looks good and some promising images are covered by the traditional and traditional part of the book partition. <br /> <br /> Cory Strode and Cookie Rae Brown have a story or background on this 'Gear Fairy' character. something completely naked, really bending toward a slasher more than something supernatural. Silly is a good way to describe the ones in this poorly written story, but it really does not feel like a fairytale horror. Dialogs may seem very unnecessary and morally hounded. Actor is simply indispensable with soft characters, but director Chuck Bowman offers some inventive blood splatter and pretty bad zolts. This ridicule is a lack of nervousness, zero fears and a general tone. Its direction is very efficient and visually impressive, and its lighting to the atmosphere is a contradiction with its slick photography. The promising opening scene is creepy. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <makeup special effects goods <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> because it has a fairly frictional shock and a fairy look appearance. The figure of the Tooth Fairy can pose a danger to make-up in black dresses and shirts with speed. Being on the ground helps to create a more natural feeling and may be rich in the atmosphere. Children's actors may be quite annoying, but Nicole Muñoz was worthy of his own. Lochlyn Munro and Chandra West are somewhat solid, but very few in their performances like Peter and Darcey. The beautiful Carrie Anne Fleming is one of their guests. <br /> <br /> PJ Soles showed up in a small part as a false neighbor. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good idea of ​​a vote, not enough stuff, and pretty much a tutorial. Expected ridiculous, but at the same time very memorable.
