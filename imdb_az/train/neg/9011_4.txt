Pretty standard B-film products. Seriously, many people who watch the movie "Dragon Fighter" together with Dean Cain and who have made their first film know better than expecting real quality or even medium intelligence. B films are available for re-processing of popular formulas. If you give them a token analysis, we'll destroy the movie for you (and maybe writing a self-important, slanderous article on the IMDb). <br /> <br /> I loved Kristine Byers for women's fur. He was a ghit and I thought he was so attractive. It was a memorable B-movie view. Unfortunately, I do not see where he puts any movie ever since. I'll look again for her.
