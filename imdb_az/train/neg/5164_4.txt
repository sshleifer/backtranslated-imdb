The main area in this film is not bad. A lady makes her big and returns to the self-absorbing matter. However, despite the good moves by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the film is a mess. Joan Crawford is the fault of this place for the director or both, his job is simply scary. Instead of being a real person, it makes a beautiful personalization of a deer held in the lanterns. In other words, he looks at the space and expresses a "slogan I am sorry". After a few moments, it really made me anxious. Now, this is, of course, the only Crawford movie I do not like for her performance, just as she did more of her movie than JOHNNY GUITAR or later BERSERK in many films - My advice is to try different Crawford movies - of course, it was better.
