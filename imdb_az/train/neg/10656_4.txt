What can I say? Kemal Hasan's film is terrible. It works very well, but it's a terrible direction. In my opinion, director Gautham Menon should give up the directive. There are many tragedies throughout the film. At the same time, we can not believe how terrible crimes are. Lack of practicality in the film. Gautham just escapes stories. But both Kamal Hasan and Ciotika are really good. These bad guys look very ugly, although their performance is not bad. I do not think there is a movie coming in late afternoon like Padeyappa. You will not go to sleep watching this movie! Nevertheless, Harris Jayaraj has done a great job again, so I have given this movie from 4 to 10. The song "Partha Modail Nallae" is bone and calm. In addition, great cinematography. Generally, this is a bad, dirty film. Kamal Hasan, I think, should reject this movie.
