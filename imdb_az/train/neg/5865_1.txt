I can not say enough bad things about this train crash. This is one of the few films I have ever been attracted to. It was a bad start with the first pregnant man, but then tried to make it a parody. What was it to put all this in real pregnant women? This was the worst movie I've ever seen. If he had enough votes, it would be in the 100th part of the IMDB. If it were a zero that I could give you, I still feel that you are lending much.
