My brother took me and my sister to see this movie when he went to the theater in 1998, and we happily bought tickets, popcorns and soda and went to the audience and sat down to watch the movie. After the exercise, the audience did not agree with the resoluteness of remembering those who said that they did not like me, and I did not like it, and I thought it was very foolish and worthless. Eddie Murphy was hysterical in this regard, but not all but the whole movie was bad, rarely laughed at these parts, and I recalled that other people in the theater laughed almost hard. The animals I really thought were animals talking, because animals talk only in animated films, live action movies, they are absolutely awesome! <br /> <br /> Apart from Eddie Murphy's hysterical twist, it's not worth the look of this movie, and I said it's too stupid. <br /> <br /> I saw Eddie Murphy in a few films and thought he was the only comic part of that movie, and I did not see Eddie Murphy in the "great" movie, Pluto Nachin adventures. Unlike Eddie Murphy, this movie will not look like it's because it's nothing like it. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie a 10 star rating of 3 stars.
