It's hard to imagine that if everyone saw the shorts most of all, they could draw on these shortcuts, but I know that humor is very subjective. <br /> <br /> Since this year (1930), Stan and Babe have been made for 15 years, I've seen all of their voice shorts (the best things IMO) shorts and feature. They were quite popular and their director, Hal Roach, worked on them all the time. In addition, it was a trial for writers and Stan. It was almost a trial that did not work. As others have said, it is not strong. <br /> <br /> For me, the best part is Stanley, who deals with Stan, Agnes and Big Thelma Todd. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you wish to see the Blotto or the Brats in the most creative and fun way ever since then, a little later, the pants can be forgiven to get out. They did something like 108 movies completely. Very few (except for FOX) were obvious mistakes, but there are some. County Hospital, Me and Hood, Live Ghost, Fixer Uppers come to mind mostly those who are weak. But after that I find something else in my shorts. <br /> <br /> There is a record in my book. <br /> <br /> If you're happy with seeing all your shorts, then check everything out, but I think it's a memorable one for Stan. and Babe.
