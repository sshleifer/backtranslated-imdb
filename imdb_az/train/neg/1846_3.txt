I want to be honest with Kira's sex scene because of all the audience, but unfortunately I did not see most of them. All sex scenes were short, and all of the other B movies, along with all the strange and dark background music, were done quite a bit - not just like sex with two men. There is a final area - Kira's new lover is a murderer. Who is how shocking! Why do not we give this movie Oscar awards? If I were R-rated I would not imagine how bad the film would be (Mining is imported from the US, 18th degree). The result? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Let's leave, so my side can not be like a moron
