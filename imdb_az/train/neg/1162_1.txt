I went to see this movie thirty years ago at the college, because I liked Bruce Dern's Quiet Run and his family. So far (sad Jack Nicholson), I'm still the most terrible movie I've ever seen. Only one thing went unnoticed and then - just ended. The lights came and looked at everyone looking around in turmoil. Was a projectionist rocket cut? I never wanted to find it. I remember about the movie, it was a non-drama about some of the college basketball players and their coach who worried about it. The most delightful part of the film was followed by a mysterious audience. Fortunately, this was an exception for Jack, Bruce and Karen Black.
