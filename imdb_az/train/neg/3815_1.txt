The operation is bad too, ALL of the jokes are on the surface and the target audience is obviously too small, they are on the average under IQs. I understand that for children, but Malkom is on the average level, but still for adults humor and situations. <br /> <br /> What do you need to expect from a show booth by some comedian Bob Sagetin? <br /> <br /> It's a little less funny than hitting the poorest person in the United States who has stopped placing the most spectacular home videos. <br /> <br /> Parents, do not let your kids watch this show unless they want to save money. Lead your children to stupidity and enrich them.
