a person who writes, directs, and reviews this shocking piece piece should really consider the change of a caregiver. Yes, Rob Stefaniuk, I tell you! Seriously, who financed this crack? There are many talented writers who want to spend money better. I think this idea is great, but the player, the writing and the management are just terrible! These jokes are not very funny, I understand that they should take mickey. BUT does it with style, this movie shouts live sketches on Saturday night at 1995. Why I say why the studios give money to hackers such as Rob Stefaniuk - WHAT IS A PERSON OF THE COMMEMORATIVE TO BE CREATED IN THE NEW YEAR. DUH!
