I'm a great Porsche admirer and the car was the best star in this movie. <br /> <br /> 80-year-old baby boy, Haim, makes the dried medication soft and gentle as usual. It would not be meaningful to smaller characters / actors; You said all this was very average. <br /> <br /> This is a cool movie as a downhill journey through the 80's - some strange dresses, a good picture of the Colorado Foundation and a very elegant way of thinking. <br /> <br /> Generally, if you do not like more than 80 movies or love the old school Porsche (especially this beautiful look), you'll spend time watching this movie because watching malicious movies in life is too short.
