The nutcase is incredibly rich and its virgin status can be quite attractive. But she misses her disobedience to the remembrance of her late husband (in particular his adultery ... naked by her lover).

It's not really a big surprise to whom the murderer has been murdered after a few key characters have been killed, but there are few choices that can do it. Alan does not really create the nose of the throat because you can argue about how justified it is. Alan, behind the whole film, is not shocked, as I mentioned earlier, because if you're less distinct from certain conditions (or preferences), Alan's health is declining, and everything else is just amazing.
