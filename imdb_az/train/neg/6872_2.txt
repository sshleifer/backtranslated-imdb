This show was pretty good stories but bad dialogue. The main character was particularly annoying. <br /> <br /> This shows why the show was canceled, although the majority of UPN showed that it did not even exist until syndicated again. <br /> <br /> Most of the show and other movies and movies cause the idea that manufacturers do not have a real idea at the beginning. <br /> <br /> I have not commented on it enough. You have at least ten lines of text. <br /> <br /> Gnome was a beautiful character.
