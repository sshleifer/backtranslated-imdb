The film is almost laughable, as mothers of murderers who have been convicted by Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters. With a terrible statement after the trial, two women are sent to California to open up girls like Sirley Temple and open a song and dance studio. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, Reynolds made a mistake by taking Winters together with California. Winters are playing a deeper religious woman who is increasingly looking to go off her rocker. <br /> <br /> Women who live together to get worse are getting dangerous phone calls. <br /> <br /> Aqnes Moorehead, in one of his latest films, soon puts out a beautiful shimmery wig by one of his pupils, on the one hand. Sister Alma, a Winters loyal listener. <br /> <br /> The film is really owned by Shelley Winters. He was heavy and his weight seemed to work better. The winters have done well in roles that always try their nerves. <br /> <br /> Who is the last one, and in the piano that shouted, who can be completely unreasonable?
