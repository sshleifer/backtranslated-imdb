We want to have the worst "low-budget hits" to lend to this dinosaur genre. The film is too far away, you can eat yourself, answer the phone or whatever, and you know exactly what happens when you go back. Special effects, Lego bricks are as bad as you think, and the super fast is as bad as a cats dog as a supernormal dinosaur. The player is cooked. They spend too much, but still there is not enough character behind them to reach the characters and the scholars ... Yes, we know exactly what happens with the blond chick in the glasses. Created stereotypically for such films. If you want to watch this movie, I think you are not in serious mood as the blacksmith and the crew are open. If you really get into the dinosaurs and know everything about the world, watch it and break the screen - the facts are far from it.
