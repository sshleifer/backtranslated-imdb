"Spielberg loves the smell of emotions in the morning, but the story has a sense of honesty because nobody likes it." - Lucius Shepard <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Color Purple is deep in the South in the early 1900s and explains the story of two African American sisters Celie and Nettie. The film is opened with the girls playing in a paradise with a paradise gown, purple flower, which is immediately destroyed by the appearance of the ancestors of their ancestors. Is this a motivation? Was the innocence of men cut? <br /> <br /> Then the film begins with a series of short sequences. Celie has twice been impregnated by her stepfather, has taken a dirty warehouse, took her newborn child, and forcibly forced her to a local widow named Albert Johnson. All these horrific scenes are less screen-time and is replaced by pixie-powder cinematography, controversial symphonic honey, unusual comedy and extreme attractive camera work. The cumulative effect is like a jarring aesthetic combination to celebrate that a Disney cartoon and an aggression film, Stanley Kubrick, "The Color Purple" had forced him to turn it off ten minutes later. Ten minutes? <br /> <br /> The film often refers to "racism," "sexuality," and "black culture," but this is not true. Alice Walker, author of the movie, claims to be bisexual, but in fact is a secret lesbian. His book is a delightful fantasy, a woman's freedom and a self-discovering story. Walker, one of the ways to get out of this maze, celebrated some types of women's lesbian utopia, black brotherhood and women's independence. <br /> <br /> Spielberg's film Walker's story is a lens classifying American mythology. This is a film where Christianity's salvistic power overcomes the natural oppression of men. Albert is a film that he finds himself in a ridiculous situation, making him miserable comedy moments that make him look like a fool. A film from all racist slavery shows consists of weird men (always with laughter of Satan and toothy flowers), stereotypic fat mammies, jazz bands and gospel cherubs. <br /> <br /> These black people are natural films that easily and happily accept their social status. The black men are sexually explicit, and those who are ignorant are terrified. An absolutely invisible film about poorness and class issues (Albert lives in a big home) and black men are totally clever. This is not Old South, it's, "Gone With Wind", MGM Muscals, "Southern Songs", Warner Cartoons, "Halleluha!" and Disney movies. In other words, it's South as seen by a child raised in the '50s. That's why it is a racist thing that attacks people on one-sided ethnic stereotypes, and Ismail Reed, a black-haired man, is likened to a famous speaker's assassination. <br /> <br /> Of course, the typical Spielberg fashion movie ends with the healing of family ties. <br /> <br /> <strong> Despite the killing of a Caucasian man, she followed one another. black society. There is no idea that any of these characters live and how they interact with others in their society. Instead, Spielberg's camera is helpless to cope with the never-ending strangulation of the director, who plays every moment we have, to focus on something to do or wait a little bit (Celie's kitchen contraptions, "Home Alone" it seems that life is simply a passage. Couples with Quincy Jones's "ridiculous" white music and you have one of the finest films in the history of the film: An angry feminist tractor, drawn by a white Jew in the style of Disney and Griffith. <br /> <br /> Problematic is the lack of white characters. : The men in this film are not described as rude and are superior to women, because they are cruelly driven by a racist society, because they reduce their men, and they are, in fact, cruel in nature, and women are disobedient as Celie or disobedient because it's so stupid that men and women are just too busy to ruin them. "A good film would not be directed to the oppression of women just like the oppressed, but would have to say that black women who were accused had to perform the same tasks. <br /> <br / > < <div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> We're working here, and it's another thing to say until a delay in the movie is that she's got her husband He was beaten up and imprisoned by the hands after he did not respect. It is possible that the brothers should return to their African roots in order to restore their dignity, and the whites are their sins to justify crushing them. That is, respect each other in the poorest minority society and do not be afraid of dominant white culture. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Not to be confronted with numerous stereotypes and emotional sensitivity filled with sex and lesbianism, inappropriate music numbers, unusual visual pizazz, inappropriate comic business, empathic music, all of which are "Color Purple" is worthless.
