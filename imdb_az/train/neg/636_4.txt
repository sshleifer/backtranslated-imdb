Several farmers struggle for survival in a small village in China. Wang Lung (Paul Muni) receives his wife, O-Lan (Luis Rainer), who has become his slave. American stars, speaking with fraudulent accents, appear in leading roles, emphasizing old stereotypes and patriarchal ideology. A good spouse, a great many children and land are the best things for men. They look like property and investment. Since some extras are a large budget movie that combines, large sets are built and special effects are created, and filmmakers have not been able to hire less popular actors. Luiza Rainer won Oscar for this performance, the worst movie in this film. His unchanging face creates an obstacle between him and the audience. O-Lan should be sincere in the heart of the family and with the best of his kindness. On the other hand, Paul Muni showed a better performance, demonstrating his ability again. Another problem with the movie has come to an end. As you can see, Franklin did not know when to finish the pictures. This film may be dangerous if it is regarded as a true example of Chinese culture and traditions.
