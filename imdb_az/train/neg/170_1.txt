The audience, who longed for everything, including the title sequence (now this laughing), believed that this was a kinematic miracle, but they trusted the nation, one of the most unpleasantly worst movies you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> I'm talking about the events in the Caucasus. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; (female) air traffic controller, as in emotional talk about love, as he falls into a definite and fiery death.

Of course, one of the birds of metaphysics and the same air traffic controller is also washed off at the beach, as the bike rides on. <br /> <br /> Looks at unusual homo-erotic subtexts (plus, in fact, it should be referred to as eight-footed) Esquire is delivered to a skyscraper and queen-y is better covered by women than women), the most striking aspect of the film is how an evil caricature is touched, a challenge that has to do with national and racial stereotypes about a nation-wide nature and power of love.

The film is generally bad enough to be funny, and that's the best thing I can say.
