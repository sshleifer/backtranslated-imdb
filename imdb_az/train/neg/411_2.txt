I do not usually feel a lot of encouragement to comment on films that I do not like me, but I have to say something like this. This movie is terrible, illogical and stupid. Writing story has many flaws, even when it's time to get away from it, I have to not even feel it. The most disturbing point is that the film does not reveal anywhere that motivations for the nature of Bacon's character are due to a physiological response to a walking ride or condition. Effects are effective and in the past, Paul Verhoeven has done some good things (DVD cut Robocop's director is bigger). However, this movie is foolish and is generally not close to describing the point or technical aspect of the subject, and instead solves the expected activity without any benefit. <br /> In short, as many other reviews I say here (I'd like to read ...) - Stay away from this movie!
