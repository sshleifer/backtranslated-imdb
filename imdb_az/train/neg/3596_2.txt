To be as honest as possible, the Devil's Plaything (or blood or Vampire Ecstasy or Black Sisters's curse or ????) is a complete hole. Is there a good place behind the movie? the transformation of a dead body to a dead body of a vampire for a long time, with the help and support of a group of black dresses? but execution is terrible. The screen has great, long moments when nothing actually happens. Characters, there's nothing to do alone. There is no mystery, no tension and no care. Acting is simply subtle. Most gamers cover a group of naked dance women, as they look at the camera. They do so repeatedly. And the smaller areas there are designed to get these seductive women less naked, because they can participate in dance. Even though something like the Dead Orgy is not as dull as the dance or plot, it is approaching.
