First, I really enjoyed the previous movie of ISHII Katsuhito's "Samehada Otoko to Momojiri Onna" ("Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl"). Although Tarentino owed "Pulp Fiction", Ishchi's film was a story, and the whole film was full of energy. The scenes were especially drawn between ASANO Tadanobu and Gashuin Tatsuya. <br /> <br /> So I was expecting a lot of expectations and optimism. "Party 7". I was surprised to find out how spacious my husband and I really were and how dynamic and exciting. anime and a mix of live action were brilliant! Then the real movie began. <br /> <br /> The whole film is in three rooms. In fact, this side of the side door does not "start" and stays there, fearing the pockets of concern. <br /> One is a paradise of futuristic boatman (slightly borrowed from Shark Skin Man), the second is a travel agency's office, the third (and most commonly used) elegant hotel room. In that room, a cast of seven characters is gathered and ... there is almost nothing. Indeed. I'm begging for "talking". One of my favorites at all times is "Andre's Dinner". "Andre's Dinner" is more exciting and discusses only the lives of middle-aged men in the evening. Key Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn are interesting stories. The film "Part 7" is exactly like the whole film. "No, no!" "Yes!" "No, not really!" "Yeah, I'm really doing it!" "No, indeed, not really!" <br /> <br /> "Party 7 is an incredibly solid film, with the exception of the most exquisite areas that are not accompanied by any movements (such as the Shark Skin Man from Yakuza ...) There is no interesting dialogue Heroes do not care much about it, and Ishii has taken the memories of Tarentino's films and shot a film around them, but Tarentino's conversations always have their inner logic and minds (they say "They are Royale, Cheese!"). We can imagine that here is not the widow's dialogue. If I had not been for a short, hilarious attraction from the low performance of Gashuin (always striking) and strange ASANO Tadanobu, I'd give a star called "Party 7". It was really a way to go all the way.
