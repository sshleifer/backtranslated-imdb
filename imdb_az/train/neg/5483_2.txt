I only charge this movie for $ 4! The Alliance withdraws such a poor excuse for a film from Atlantis. However, critics from several Canadian newspapers, which are even more surprising, were well-evaluated by this film. I'm tired of the media because it's just a movie in Canada and low budget. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>) is very good. Film quality was poor, maybe very low budget expectations. The scenario was completely terrible. One of his strange characters is one of his strange characters, one of his clients sitting around a drug dealer whose only purpose is to drive a bicycle to the network and steal it so that it can accidentally destroy the SUV. Apparently, most of the gang members are killed in these activities (since Vancouver is a great drug that connects Toronto with, it does not know what he can do to get new ones). In any case, the story's story (half of the movie is unclear) plans to build a building for a drug dealer in Toronto to try to make homes more affordable. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > </ Globe and Mail and Georgia Correctly to provide such biased interpretations. <br /> <br /> A movie does not receive any special treatment because it is Canadian!
