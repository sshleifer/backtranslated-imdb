Even Bob Hope, accompanied by a brilliant actor, can save his bad writing experience in war comedy, as his patented time is not working. The Hollywood movie star, Don Bolton (Hope), and an attempt to escape military service at the Second World War erroneously followed her attempt at a healing attempt against her daughter Dorothy Lamour. Bolton's agent, Lynne Overman and his assistant Eddie Bracken, are involved in various exercises with three of them, Malibu, California, training exercises on hills. Paramount was nicely funded for this effort, some of the top specialists worked, but generally directed by David Butler, which should be included in the missing comedy element. To create an opportunity for heroism by Bolton, a link to the end of the film has been born with a poor stunt work and camera impression. Strangely, Lynne Overmana is best given the line and as if the hero of this hero is very good to them. Dorothy Lamour looks nice and beautiful, and Clarence Kolb is unique in his voice on the screen or on the radio, but it's a delight to see and hear a movie that can do little to curse the film as it is a mistake in the team assignment.
