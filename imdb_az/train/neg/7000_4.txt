Hollywood is looking at the barefoot, glamorous and profitable quests and moral values, and therefore attempts to explore moral life are subtle and often foolish (better to go farther) to explore morality in Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman's films ). "Strange cargo" is no exception. The adventure film, love story and this unique hybrid of the religious example diminishes many concepts that they try to communicate. Verne (Clark Gable's most exquisitely sensitive and self-affiliated) and Julie (Joan Crawford, Tough Dames Queen, spells every word in an attempt to become) is the best laugh seemed to work. M-G-M is a fighter ego-fitting business, Star System Patron Saint before sending a much more penal servitude? BUT. . Here are well-supported speeches and visually imprisoned moments: a shady prison barracks; fleeing by the moonlight, or against painting clouds; The wind winds along the Julie seafront; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) for the freedom of Verne as the storm builds; An unusual controversial gay prison romance between two convicts. . First, Paul Lucas has dignity and independent performance as Hessler, who appreciates the Cambreau tradition. At the very moment of film's capture, Hessler leaves Cambreau and stands at the edge of the cabin. Listen to the wind through the jungle, face a shadow of fear and self-doubt. Then he goes out at night. At the moment, Hessler acquires the power of uncertainty, depth and existence where none of the other symbols can achieve. Does the film show its deep sympathy with Hessler?
