Suicide is linked to the death of young children. Hopper is a man who has to investigate crimes. The film seems to have some difficulties with her daughter. At the end, a serial killer was captured. This is so. But before you know who is committed, you have to see some of the horrible actions of all actors. It's incredible how bad the actors, including Hopper, are. I resemble it, but I lost most of my time. Do not just watch the movie. I warned you.
