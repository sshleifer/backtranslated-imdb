Village family drama - perhaps noded to "Ordinary People" - a young boy's anxiety disrupted his shot after a deadly injury to his elder brother. Regardless of the sad topic (directed by Christopher Cain, a brutal glow treat), there is a number of dynamics worth exploring this sad story. Unfortunately, the insecurities of the isolated farming environment and adult characters make the movie a great experience. In connection with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Wilford Brimley, the film is about a small proportion of the "Natural". Too bad, this project really did not take the necessary talent behind the camera and took a memorable picture. * From 1/2
