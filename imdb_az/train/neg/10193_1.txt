With this film, Byelel manages the film with the victory of the film while expressing his film, his works are 'objectivity'. Obviously not. For one reason, 'many scenes shot with pure luck' are obvious structures (if this poor goat accidentally 'crashes', you really see gun smoke on the right hand side of the screen!). According to one another, it concealed one important information: The Hurdes people were for a reason simply mentioned in the film. That is, goitre is a disorder caused by iodine deficiency (salt). This goitre is the cause of their cretinism, and Bunuel only took the time to do his research (heck, if he does not have 'cretinism' in a medical dictionary found in 'goitre'), these people (still with suspicion). Instead, with his film, he judges them constantly, speaks repeatedly as "sparks", dramatizes actions, creates scenes to create spectacles, all of which is unacceptable to all the strongest objectivity of a documentary worker. Bujel speaks in this film every time and does not give a promise to the people he is filming. He speaks to them and even gives them to the courts. This piece is weak in its roots, its ideology, and this is a real shame, considered a great film.
