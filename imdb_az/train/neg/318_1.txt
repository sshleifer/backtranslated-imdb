I stole this movie when I was in the first class at college. I tried to watch it three times, and the latter because they wanted to see friends. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but it's so funny that we should be funny." Wrong! After a dream boxing match / insulting fight, I can not watch myself, a man who is burned in a good chain causes your opponent's physical pain. I think the terrible comedy that hurt you is ridiculous, but after watching it you will know its truth. This movie is not worth the price paid for it. I watched a tune of Steven segal and even saw Crossroads twice ... but it was still unable to watch it.
