After seeing this movie, my first question was, "Why is the title LIAM?" The goal is to tell a story from the perspective of the boy, but it has not been done well. Of course, in the scene of the boy there was a formal use of camera angles, but very important activity occurred beyond his theory. Melodrama is known as "a dramatic or other literary work": a stereotype character, an inflated emotion and language that can not have a "basic" character (obviously a child is silent, weak) characterized by the use of morality and conflict, "LIAM corresponds to this definition of T. The viewer is struck by the typical stereotypes of the fire and sparkling Catholic Church in the sad school marmalade, and the well-fed prophet has collected money from the parishioners. <br /> <br /> Most of the films Theresa washed her toilet after her mother said, "My daughter will hunt another woman's toilet." If it is good, I'm an admirer of English realism., I think, is not Liam. <br /> <br />
