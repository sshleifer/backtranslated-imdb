Moon litter. This was the worst movie I've ever seen. All speeches are beautiful, but there is no plot. Truly! There is no plot! Many clowns talk about it and this is your movie. Ug ... The character of Robert Duvall is strange, and the same people repeatedly ask the same screams. This gives him the same repetition. It seems to me that if this movie were six, people should love it. Good performances with famous and well-respected actors, but the true full-time job is to evaporate. Well, maybe it's a little cheating, because the steam from a fresh pile sounds like a little bit, and EVERYTHING HAPPENS THIS movie! The sack
