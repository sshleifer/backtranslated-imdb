This movie is not funny. This is not fun. It does not include a second of originality or intelligence, nor does it make you less interested in characters or situations. As it has been added, a movie like a child in the last class. Apparently, a group of 14 or 15-year-olds who had never really met or had no connection to a real girl wrote a film based on the false fantasies of sitting in a group and being one of the elders. This movie is dull, surprisingly foolish, sometimes offensive and disgusting. Most, one or two moments laugh. It also appears that the 85-minute working time is twice.
