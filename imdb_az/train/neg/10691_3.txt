I do not want to rent it myself. I'm afraid to rent something that has not always been heard (I do not remember this in theaters). Great cast ... this scales blew. In 30 minutes, I did not watch him. It's fun to watch the first few minutes, but incredible. Only then does it deteriorate. Writers of this film can do some research on future projects while making their films a little bit better. Or you can simply try to write something that is a little believer. I can give 3 (one word) and 3 for writing it, so that you can get very good players to agree to accept this movie despite having read 2 movies. My God, this film is silent.
