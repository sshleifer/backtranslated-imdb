Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. When did Hollywood make a successful movie attacking the Republicans? Why not? Dixie chicks do not. These Lefties have their own elite bubble interacting among themselves; <br /> <br /> The best Hollywood production is not partisan and is rarely political. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I thought Cusseyn could shoot a better movie. <br /> <br /> It was not Gulistan.
