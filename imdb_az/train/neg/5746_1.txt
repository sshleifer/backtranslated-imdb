About the worst movie in my distribution! I love zombie movies and saw on the rack I used, why did not I think? Oh my god zombie movies and fans shame for the genre! Who should have filmed this movie and go to the movie school! There are a lot of spiders and time consuming movies, and there is something about the dignity of this movie. I know what to do to make movies, and I am sure that I spent a lot of money and time to set up the Meat Market, but none of the money and time was good. You need actors, scripts, true cameras, and some books on how to make independent films. I do not know how to release a DVD, but whoever is doing this is really a good friend or beat his head wall. Gore films are not of good quality, but poor! I was really angry because I was in the shops and could not get my money back. Please stop posting this movie here. I know I'm tough, there are only 10 lines, and I'm trying to get it to the point.
