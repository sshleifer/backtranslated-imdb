Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) lives alive for the young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole), who recently lost her mother. However, Rosalie has long run away from her mother and will visit the grave late at night (to be in a cemetery behind the house) ... "<br /> <br /> The cemetery is really healing with a terrible sequence ... then it falls apart, the story is gentle and there is a ton of stuffing to make the movie 85 minutes long. (The Cole is easy to be the worst.) I hate some of the WORST changes I've seen in a genuine movie scene (and sound) cut off without any relatives or reasons, there is a terrible (and open) post-production sound. <br /> <br /> For bleeding and violence, do not forget, there is very little and there is something quite fake, and I have not seen such fake blood - it looks like a ketchup! - a forgotten drive movie. You can skip this one.
