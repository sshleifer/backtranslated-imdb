There were only two things that interest me in this film: Owen Wilson's death and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> This was basically a women's show. Catherine Zeta Jones was there to provide eye candy. Liam Neeson was completely wasted in this movie. Like Jones, there was no role. The film was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). He was the only one who played a real role in this terrible script by David Self. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ em> </ strong> <br /> <strong> Speed ​​and Twister have done a great job. it really worked here. Perhaps the catastrophe was restored rapidly. Speed ​​2: Cruise Control. He must thank the Wild Wild West for the successful stars, otherwise, this is the worst picture of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid any costs.
