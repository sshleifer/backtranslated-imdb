<br /> <br /> This movie is really awesome, and the eye-opener that I play is just about everything that's wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Writer / producer / producer / lead actor, etc. family idea, religious, homophobia, hate crimes, and any other issue that affects a gay man at that time, but tries to turn every issue into such a weakly thought-provoking film. therefore, there can not be any justice. <br /> <br /> The scenario is weak, the cast is very ordinary, but dialogue and behavior are only poor. The homosexual brother is played by the most populous actor and there is no chemistry between two leading actors (I think he's more passionate in a maize strawberry advertisement). <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see this train is not the creator. <br /> <br /> Underlined that this player was tough and that the dialogue was forced (a scene that nourished the brother's detector lines). I pushed any other garbage to distribute, and if I think about it, I have some tips - DO NOT.
