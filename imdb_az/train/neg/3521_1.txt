<br /> <br /> We're still not too happy to see this movie again. <br /> <br /> I saw some of the opera movies, and even loved most of them, but it's over. <br /> <br /> There is the worst male actress, Sly Stallone, who plays only the lead role, but the movie has been stupid since early (why not spending money on airplanes) is easier to be hell than ever) less than one shoe. <br /> <br /> Besides, there is no realistic plot on the plot, and a three-year-old child can predict what will happen in the future. Sly is a set of cliches (action genre) that is even worse than other films (watching that movie as a comedy, not as a movie in Rambo III). A) B) Sadness C) It's something else. <br /> <br /> There are two factors that make this movie look like some people. TIPS are obvious, but then ... you'll see better on July 4th. LANDSCAPES is spectacular, but then ... There are documents about the Alps and Himalayas, so it's possible to see better places, not to spend time whilst blowing. <br /> <br /> Go, have hundreds, or even thousands of good action movies.
