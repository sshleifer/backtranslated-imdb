To be honest, I did not follow all of my original "dreams", but the scenes I saw clearly revealed that the first breath was a great movie. so great, had to do seven awful sequels. they started with "Howling II: Your Brother is a Werewolf". When I was a new old film that Atari was back when I was back, some time ago I took this movie from my uncle's VHS. I just watched last night and it was just strange that I was not really BAD. I'm just out and pretty worried (but kinda hot), Christopher lee, about a dead karen stab like a vampire, and everything else that goes three ways with Sybil Danning's shadow minions two. , this movie is like a kind of complex creature, like Dracula and The Lost Boys ... Christopher Lee (who plays Dracula himself), who says about Werewolves, all over the other vampire films, gargle in the heart, the creator of the night should die at night, and WWII is living TRANSYLVANIA) . It came from Annie McEnroe, but not for the worst player. At one point in the film, I was shaded to break my throat. Because this damn throat always meant SOMETHING. In any case, the plot is pretty silly and clich√©d, so there is no real point to tell you, you can only read about Wikipedia. By the way, what really makes me frustrated with this movie is, in fact, the original of all seven albums (Howling IV (1988) is original or in other words, based on the same novel). do not see this movie. no real horror, hardly any werewolves and just horrible special fx. 3/10
