I recently watched this movie with the 30th Gothenburg Film Festival and was one of the worst films ever to be honest. Do not get me wrong, there are funny and funny bad movies (for example, "Manos", "Fate of Fate") and then bad movies. (This is the last category). Cinematography is incredible and not a good way. The cameraman felt as if everything was in the spotlight (except for a static strike), lighting was something between a "working bulb" and "no". Actors are as bad as soap actors, but they are not as bad as the porno player, and each line has impressed them as a total surprise. Only paid feature was the masked murderer's appearance, the classic view la Jason Vorhees "Friday 13th." The land was very weak and the worsening of the end became even worse. I would only recommend this movie to anyone who needs an example of a horror movie or an insomnia that needs sleep.
