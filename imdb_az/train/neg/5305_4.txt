The Oscars came up with this intense, attractive, quick collective ensemble of films focusing on movie theaters to win the audience and win the Best Picture at the great show. There is a very popular and well-known game based on them. The real dramatist was actually a writer and director of the film adaptation; like a double-edged sword. On the other hand, who translates the game better than the original writer? On the other hand, who should not see the mistakes and shortcomings of the game and compare it with the writer himself? Suspicion, excellent functioning and very tense and durable mixes; a frustrating ending, unnecessary dialogue, doubtful management, and, of course, no significant answers. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a growing trend among high caliber films, and it does not answer all the questions. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the last 20 pages are missing, like losing applause, playing a soccer match and arcade game while playing in the fourth quarter, and not going to see what's next to 50 kopecks. Undoubtedly, the Country's No Old Men for the Previous Best Picture frustrationfest, really does not end; does not provide us with significant answers and will not be sufficient to understand what we have done. Yes, it was intention, but it is not a test of humanity but a police. I'm not paying for a job that's been done, paying for a start, mid, and last, and praying that I'll fall asleep during the three moves. <br /> <br /> This little drama has been forced to become the "writers" of the film for about a year, in connection with the recent events. a fianc√© (Meryl Streep) who is very convinced that his beloved (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is making sexual advances against a child going to church; The first African-American boy in the Catholic Church. The church really tears it off or not, if it does not commit major sins. As some guys started to behave differently, the settlement rises and tells a young teacher (Amy Adams). <br /> <br /> The government is appointed after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, who for a long time shakes the people and questioning humanity and their belief in each other. <br /> <br /> The strongest points of suspicion come to the ensemble of actors, and it is also an emotional tension that is slowly set and never boils. Streep looks Oscar-worthy in his role in every role, and here it does not differ as his rigidity and cold behavior puts a blanket of fear with all the students and some staff in the church. Hoffman is still as superior as a priest, and he is doubtful about the success of a charming personality and friendly aura. It is difficult to avoid the seemingly hypocritical person, especially when you love him and think about him; but Hoffman steps up to the board with one of the best actresses of our generation and is fantastic. At these two claims, fireworks can fly without seeing a start. However, let's not forget about their excellent works by Amy Adams (Enchanted) and Viola Davis (Law Ad Order). The suspension casting ensemble is the best in 2008. <br /> <br /> However, as we mentioned before, the writing and management of this movie, especially when the third movement is falling. Questions open, but are not responded. Characters are opened, but it does not bring any improvements to the field. Children behave differently, but why not really find out what to do. There are unusual angles in the camera work, and why is there no real reason? John Patrick Shanley, the writer of the game, was the previous film director in the repertoire: Joe Versus the Volcano. Whether it's a great arrogance or stupidity, we have not seen the overlapping sequences of random conversations, and we will speak with boldness that Mr Shane has had a two-hour coffee discussion and a sugar-like sugar. /> <br /> Bottom Line: An irritating stupid trend like a camera job captured in motion films in a lack of endlessness. Whether it's a great talent or a decent cinematography or a good story, it does not matter whether we use sound or music well; There is an unanswered question that has been sown on a movie that's over 100 minutes long! The translation from the game to the film is good and quite accurate, because we have the original pants behind the project, but the game has made mistakes and stupid hiccups. When deciding to add just a few minutes of this decade, and finally decided to finish it, she saw the share of high-profile and high-profile films that could have been very high for me: Sideways, Cast Away, No Country for Old Men /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> News flash: Please note, or at least, the credits begin to start suddenly, and empty space (Wall-E's exciting rear gates) and mental discomfort instead of looking at empty space as if you were feeling confused. You have a start, middle and end! As a critic, my films are incomplete, but not full. Surely, I feel unquenchable, so it gets a degree of inadequacy. <br /> <br /> No one should break this stupid trend.
