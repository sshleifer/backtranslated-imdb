Not only does the characters get all the mistakes, not only the sounds of the sound, but the writers are not only content with gold, but only pictures are really, but mostly created for ages 1-6. The only episode I've seen from this show, who loved me, was the "A Mattter Family", because he loved Robin's character. Sometimes Batman is a generic copy of The Animated Series. For example: In BTAS, Bruce Harvey is friendly with Dent, yeah? On two episodes, he is transforming into two new tragedies. "In the show" Bruce is friendly with this Ethan man and Transforms with the murder of ClayFace, on the story of two episodes. It was just a small example (even that could not be true), in short, this is the worst attempt at the Batman series. And that's something.
