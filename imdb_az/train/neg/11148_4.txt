This is the best example of a low budget, winning a good storyline. <br /> <br /> Find a better script and budget, as Samaire Armstrong (who works at OC I know better). <br /> <br /> Special effects were very bad, and the worst computer was created, and the worm was lost for the first time on the screen. And Sameir Armstrong (alert!) Changing a werewolf was even done with a bad GCIF figure decline before the change began (Final Fantasy's people, but also Pixar made it laughable, Think of a figure like a nude Barbie) Doll). <br /> <br /> The excitement was interesting, although the blood donation in the worms is nothing new. As is the balance between the wicked, (perhaps) it is not bad, and the possible end of a human line must be combined with two lines. The underlying logo of the book on "Warming Lenses", which had affected some of the other wizards for some time, was effective, but could have been wider to explain what had happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Make a better post and direction, and I'll go back in time.
