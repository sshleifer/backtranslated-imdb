Film and playback are not bad, and Jay Hernandez does a good job of playing Calito Brigante but he forgets that the movie is supposed to be a prequel for a hit movie. The prequel manufacturers did not look for the original Carlito's Way or at least did not care about sustainability. This film is a prequel that the original film has to date for some of us and should finish this movie at the place where the original begins or at least until this movie. One of Carlotto's original ex-spouses has no appearance in this movie, and they are not mentioned. Luis Guzman, the original Pachanga film, plays a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975 and the prequel dates back to 1969-70. Considering that this movie was held for less than 5 years, would not you expect Carlito to be one of the longtime friends? The original Carlito was released from prison at the start of the five years' imprisonment. This is only a few months between the end of the prequel and the start of the original! *** Semi-Spoilers *** We know from the very beginning of the original, Carlito spent 5 years in prison, so Prequel is insulting the original explorers when he gives us Hollywood's happiness. What happens with Gail? This is the lack of sustainability that ensures the release of the video.
