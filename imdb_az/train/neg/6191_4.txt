Along with every adaptation I could take on this movie, I also watched a series of academic studies, including preparations. Cinematography moves more like music. Unfortunately, all life was removed from the story. I have never seen such a terrible description of Mr. Rochester. All the most basic features went. Where is his mind? Where's her passion? Scott Rochester looks like St. John's Rochester foil than the novel's character. In fact, Scott plays a passionate St.John, though the actor who plays St.John in this adaptation, erases something or simply looks at the ceiling (always). I did not know what they were thinking. I would like to give this movie a little bit higher than fine music and cinema, but I have not seen it for a long time because of C.C.Soton's performance.
