<br /> <br /> I am 27 years old and I'm 16 years old, and I was 16 years old. delusional phobia and paranoid hallucinations. As the main character in the film, I was largely logical because I was thinking about getting away from the truth and knowing what was happening and what was not. In the end, I really succeeded in medicine, but I, of course, escaped madness, because I did not immediately admit the drug. <br /> <br /> Thus, the film has the right to say that it is a general fraud. The story of the main character (not bisexual loyalty, which is really important here), but not completely lost, along with the story, which is a sophisticated, sophisticated, sophisticated look of schizophrenia. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is not a disease, but a mind. A schizophrenic * is not a normal person's illness, it is something that is different from the early thoughts and feelings of the majority of people, but things like time, place, and human personality are not good things. He may be bent, feel, change, mutate, and maybe even not. To accomplish this, schizophrenic "normal" people have a rich and intuitive internal world where they can not expect, but it is trapped because it can not communicate with most people, and its world is worse and worse until the poor finish. <br /> <br /> This, ridiculous "treatment" is very different from what is described in the tearful sexual film. We must be frightened of violence. People other than the main character, for example, should look strange, strange, and absurd, like Lynch's "Eraserhead". Since schizophrenia is all this, it must be really effective, strange, common hallucinations. <br /> <br /> I said "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway" to watch, P.K. Follow Dick's "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik", "Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Black City", or "American McGee's Alice" on the PC and have an unclear idea of ​​what that is can be. . Do not watch the best movie of the month, similar situations, cleaned characters and visuals, foolproof plot tips. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is the most accurate film about schizophrenia, images, and internal consistency. It's fierce, weird, confused, and very scary. <br /> Details, this is not a pure game played for you. It will jump on your face and will not let you go: walls fall, people become strange enemy creatures, feel like you're back in time, you feel you are, everything is felt. .. weird, unnatural. Believe me, this is more than just a melodrama of soap
