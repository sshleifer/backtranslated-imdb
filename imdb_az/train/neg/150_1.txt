Dude, really !!!! There are children for the last 20 years, is it all horrors, horror? It's a joke, there's nothing wrong with having a budget, but it's a laugh. Look at the classics, Tod Browning's Freaks, Dracula and Frankenstein's victims, Undying Monster, Ernest Thesiger, Paul Wegener, The Golem, and The Ghost Train passengers can not compare it, it's a bad name, bad player, bad violin and so on. Gives it. Money and leisure time spent watching a lot of movies, like horror, all my time I really enjoyed, really silent, there is nothing else to say, do not try to follow such a thing, please
