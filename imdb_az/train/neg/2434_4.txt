The realistic film, of course, except that characters do not seem to be afraid. Billy Zane feels bad when trying to kill someone ... but it does not look. That's why I did not like the appearance of this movie. Tom Berenger is still playing a soldier. No good excitement, real sequences. Not always shooting, this is a great thing. Well filmed. I hate the helicopter, it just kills a terrorist, kills almost the whole set of sea ...
