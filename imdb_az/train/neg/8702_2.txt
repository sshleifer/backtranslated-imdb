This is one of the many ranks I've been experiencing in trouble! I did not expect it after seeing the first two, but I gave some water to these films, "Perhaps this time it was right." Nope - not even close. <br /> Where am I starting? Due to special effects ... In this film, a soldier fired at the Raptor, as in a corridor at some point in order to give an idea to SFX. Even though it is less than the second second of the screen, the viewer is a man with a tail that he can easily see. <br /> <br /> What a bad move? That is what you can say. I think there is a character from the south. But after six years of living in the south I have never heard of this conversation. Perhaps he has some sort of strange disability - it is impossible to speak normally. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, it has been for several years that this is quite a foundation - to escape the Raptors, hunt the guns. I do not see why dinosaurs always enter the nearest tunnels in this movie ... Do not they stay out to hunt their hunts? Well, at least in the film, it's probably a good sense that they can turn around. <br /> <br /> Other things - You say you are a building and you know that predators who fled to Him. Would you decide to spend some time to debate whether the Army or the Sea is better? And then you have a bush wrestling competition to solve? What do you think about the claim that you have to follow the predators - Divide into two groups? Have you ever watched a movie movie (Or at least one Scooby Doo episode)? In short, this is one of the iron films there. Do not lose it if you do not want to deny your way through a movie.
