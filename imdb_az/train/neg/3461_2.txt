Slasher films are often derived, reproduced and clearly inadequate. I was a fan of fears, but this movie was so bad that words did not spare me. Scenario is not serious, traps are ridiculous, moving is surprising. Only one whole round stinker, I spend my life time. This was the first of all a strange movie, the 15th edition, had all the entertainment value. <br /> <br /> Who is in this movie? First, the mask of a murderer was beautiful. <br /> <br /> Rescue yourself and avoid this terrible confusion.
