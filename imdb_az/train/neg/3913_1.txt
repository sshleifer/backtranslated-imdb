This movie is a good example of how to destroy a book 109 minutes. Except for the names of these characters, the film is very similar. A book full of powerful Latino characters and most part is represented by non-latino characters. The film has no character development and we have no reason to love or hate the characters. And erasing a complete generation is indispensable. Isabel Allende has written a powerful book and needs to read a book!
