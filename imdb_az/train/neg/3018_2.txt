What do you get when you are not interested and do not try to create an attractive visual style and blend a piece of clichés with direct pacing and a group of characters with more clichés and gentle weaknesses? and a really great budget? Why did you get one of the most unwatchable movies ever! <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; <br /> <br /> "Wow, look at all the blinking lights and grain film tissue, and prepare them in detail!" The guide works hard to get things done and visual styles that none of them have added to the movie and <br /> <br /> "I've heard a dialogue about 20,000 films in the past!" <br /> <br /> "I've seen this scene <br /> <br / > "This one too!" <br /> <br /> "Uh, this did not reveal this" characteristic "about half an hour ago? <br /> <br />" It was necessary to have this movie <br /> <br /> "What is this dialogue I do not believe it's so unusual. " <br /> <br /> "How much is this?" I did not know what was happening, but I did not feel motivated to try to understand it. <br /> <br /> "It's not over yet?" <br /> <br /> "I want my money back." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> "UGH" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If your home is burned and if the film is playing in the only room not lit with fire, you should think of it as a live burn. <br /> <br /> (I'm sorry, this is more than two hours I watched the movie, and did not like it very much.)
