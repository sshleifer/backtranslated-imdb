Gday Mates! just watched the movie Croc Hunter. it was good, but the show looks more real. it seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with funnier lines and more symbols. A few things: Steve explained with the annotations, such as hypodermic needles, by Fangs. yeeeowch! It hurts because you know for Reals. and they can not jump high? Hess seized them with tails and things. There were two MAHOR divisions in this movie. When Terri finds the child's joining, she has to "raise us as a baby". Woah! I would think that he would put the boy to bed. The Prophet (as well as Terri, who has been acknowledged by many in the film and Terry's ritual mating show, is known for his sexual content, is filmed in Queensland, Australia, and we're a koala, dingo, and Joey! /> Steve Dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> At the same time, if everyone is watching this, try and agree with me that the dog's dog with a dog's dog is a croc rifle. I would be crazy!
