This picnic, of course, is more than the share of memorable moments until it coincides with its predecessor. Once I've taken a video block with "Videodisc Cannon", I like Nimoy's face closely. As we get a tear from his left eye, we know that Nimoy is more than just a murder machine. The viewer can not help, but to be emotionally inaccessible, and we realize that his previous straightforward effect is only one front. Absolute glow! Sex scenes are beautiful, balanced, but not pornographic. After that, I felt I had a pretty good idea of ​​how to work with the Magnavision Videodisc Player. Very bad, they have not produced them for more than 25 years.
