Actors played a really good job of playing their role - especially the mother. However, in view of the development of the film, I saw that I was looking at their activities rather than because I was caring for the people at least. And sometimes, I was irritated with an irresponsible and disadvantageous attitude towards repeated parenting. The main enthusiasm of her daughter is the 17-year-old whip, which is the most common cause for men in the bedroom and dance of a nyphette. The boy is a person who does not trust himself, appears to be very hopeless for a relationship and friends - throws a delayed drug party in the film. Husband and wife are bored, but not their energies, but seek new partners (even though their spouse is "thrown off" like a gay man). I just felt that ALL characters needed to grow up and care for such obscene deer in difficult times. I believe that the author's attempt is to demonstrate the incomparable and indispensable merit of the capitalist system. However, these characters appear not to be typical for the middle western family.
