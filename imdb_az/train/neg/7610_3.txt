Generally, I do not like the movies directed by Sidney Pollack (except for "The Firm"), and I'm never a fan of Robert Redford. Probably, "Condor's Three Days" I thought was good thanks to their well-deserved comments. <br /> <br /> Although broad-screen cinematography is quite optimistic for the eye, Max von Sydow works as a wonderful Cetin professional killer, and I find the whole job quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> Paranoid atmosphere does not spread in the film, but everything does not have any logic. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is one of the happiest endings in the film. air suspended viewer. What can you say about absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway? I would like to watch more of Hitchcock's films consistently five times as they are sitting here.
