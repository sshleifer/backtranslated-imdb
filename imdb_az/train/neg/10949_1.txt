I'm going to the cinema to have fun. There is nothing entertaining about this movie. From the beginning, this woman's life is gray, and there is no delay in the flood reality. It is not a tempo without a mental change. I only stayed until the end, because I was convinced that everything would be better. They do not do it, and I am not alone, as we are talking about a lot of uncertainty about the film because they are close to the film. It's not a crime that describes honesty and social disorder, but giving disdain to the audience is not the way to get public opinion. It's a terrible movie.
