- Miner spoiler - <br /> <br /> I've seen some good Indie horror films like Hamiltons, The Boys Love Mandy Lane, and Cabin Fever; Unfortunately, I did not fall into this category in five of my eyes. The film is packed with an amusing player that resonates with a very strange scenario from beginning to end, the writer (s) "does not go out and will not go there" <br /> <br /> This movie has little character development and I'm not honest, . no matter how little information about pain and torture is reported, they are just some college girls who show no irreplaceable qualities. All their films are all painful and crying, and girls are discussing. When it comes to talking, the topics are completely random: boys are killed or killed by one of the daughters of the daughters (related issues while being persecuted by a psychotic killer). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know that the director was restricted to a digital camcorder that was almost entirely in the girl's car. I think it was an effort to engage the audience as close as possible, not to feel and experience what girls have done. But it's hard to explain what's happening in the scene of the action because it's a very horrible camera, smart picture, and too close to the action, and it's not just chaotic. <br /> <br /> The film has something to be subjective, but it's a motion that the viewer can not be deciphered because of poorer cinematography. <br /> <br /> We know that the film does not want to apologize for its extremely poor quality. There is no substitute for this movie: bad mobility, poor scripts, flawless camera work, and no story. When I was simplifying all this, I decided to give 1 to 10 of the movie because I was very disappointed; The desire of a meteor to crash on the ground brings me a sweet relief. 94 minutes stupid college girls cry, challenge, work purposely, and randomly chat. However, the girls have weakened their hands and you see how many times you are thrown into the front of a car fleeing.
