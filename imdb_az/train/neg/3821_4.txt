What is the most filmed movie? Gynecological nightmare of Cries and Whispers? Fassbinder's Pickle Psychodrates? Terrible black comedy on the left side of the last house? I'm sure that for a part of the public that loves the movie, they have a good boat for Buster Keaton, there's only one answer - one of his soundtracks. <br /> <br /> I know that my soul is getting tougher in this movie: the transformation of Keaton's complex and extensive physical art into a humdrum slapstick; a painful hesitation of this master filmmaker is that he does not have a lovely, funny voice, or that the dialogue is not funny; the studio does not seem to have taken him enough and, therefore, he tried to remember his lines before submitting it - Keaton seemed to be foolish, not his character; or is it an insult to see Keaton, who is attractive to sexually assimilated when he gives us some of the richest accounts of romantic disappointment in the movie? <br /> <br /> No, I know the worst thing - I have to watch Buster Keaton, the biggest comedy of the movie. <br /> <br /> MGM seems to have had an interesting idea to turn Keaton's voice into a Marks Brother. oral pedantry, sophisticated, exhausting 'clowning', shambolic slapstick, theater setting, victory over chaos and Thelma Todd. Keaton was not that funny and Groucho's harmful language and brilliant opportunism could not be Buster's socially humble professor, reads and predicts where he is doing it alone. <br /> <br /> Required tests such as Buster, 'M' Lang or Rene Clair were allowed; Chaplin did not try to bring back his tide. In a film like "General" - when talking with poetry - the loss is even more evident. <br /> <br /> Of course, on the slopes in the flat, the whole movie is not bad - there's a great blow when a camera bus takes Keaton leaf at a railway station; and, of course, the original is less livelier than what went ahead of them. There is almost a good thing about Keaton's way of slowing down a plot that needs all the zip codes she can get. <br /> <br /> Here is the loneliness, the emotional disaster, the negative effects of education, and so on. There is a film that fights to get out. The best way to evaluate this film is to persuade Professor TZ Post, not to mention the story of the real genius Buster Keaton, with a bad fate in the studio, in which he was kept in a detention jail that blends with the new technology. keeping a stoical grace. It looks like a masterpiece.
