This movie is not good but fun. The struggles are very bad, sometimes they try to shock you, breaking some bones, and even these two or three times, not necessarily a shokmovie. A weapon shot by a hero with a shotgun can go on an open field with 10 people who can buy guns, begin to retreat, and begin to hurt. <br /> <br /> The government is empty, the boy wakes up, lost his memory and starts fighting, because he is good. Five years later, memories come back, revenge gets blocked. <br /> <br /> Do not value your money, regardless of being drunk and bored.
