There are no spoilers at this point because everything is shown on the trailer. I will definitely support local films, though I try to balance in my theory, but I will not support this movie, but I can not help. Slow, boring and boundless. Even "almost beautiful and convincing moments" immediately dropped as a result of painful clich√©s and bad deeds. Vernetta Lopez and Wong Li Lin, I usually love, but only in this movie. The author felt like trying to make a melodramatic TV soap, but then moved away and decided to put it on the big screen. Years have come from a RA rating (saddened), but I have not changed my belief in local films. Better films will come, and similar movies will not be drawn.
