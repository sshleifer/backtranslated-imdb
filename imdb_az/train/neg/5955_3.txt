It is one of the weakest films in the MGM series, not just from the Trader Horn, but also from the first two films of the series (eg, the crocodile warfare recently used). <br /> <br /> After leaving Tarzan and his Mate, the best film of the series, he left a great deal. <br /> <br /> When his wife, Jane's cousin, comes to Jungle, we will go back to claim it. They talk about a relative who rescues the money from the relatives' money. Keeping a secret Genre and placing it in a large white hunter who wants to sell, takes the heads of the couples into the forest where they go into the woods Jungle Challenges (more scene scenes). After many conversations, Jane decides to return to civilization, and we have created a long kissing face of Tarzan and Jame. In the last half an hour, the plot is put into action to capture the Tarzan, and as a result, the plans are so exciting that everything is disturbing. <br /> <br /> A painful withdrawal is a clear evidence. troublesome production. the film was playing in the first half hour as an almost accurate repetition of some of the previous films. The middle third indicates signs of being able to extend things and eventually get a never-ending line. The last third film, where the style is being captured and the party is in danger, is finally the point where the movie comes to life (also shows graphic violence that reflects the necessity of re-filming). It 's a great surprise for me that this movie is a great surprise for the film here (after it' s finished) .I would hardly be able to explain it, and I say that Weissmuller and O'Sullivan are people like Tarzan and Jane keeps coming back. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> home). I really like the first or several hours of this movie, and spend a lot of time and energy. If you can come to the end, I strongly advise you to try the movie. Otherwise, I would skip all the movies and go to the next movie from the series.
