This, of course, is one of the worst films ever produced and released by the Hollywood studio. The area is simply stupid. Dialogue is written on clich√©s; for this you can complete a large number of sentences in the script. The player, especially Rod Cameron, was ridiculously wounded. "Choreography" is generous and generally not uniform. You can only regret the 23-year-old Yvonne dance guards who are sexually explicit; just bad choreography. At the beginning of the film, the ballet scene is particularly ridiculous. If you get into bad movies and some of the Hollywood Indians are laughing, this is for you. I got a color version of the VHS and became worse. When Yvonne's heavy makeup is colored, he always looks like a clown. And this is the best part of the film. What a way to start a career.
