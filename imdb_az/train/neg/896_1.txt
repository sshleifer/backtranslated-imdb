This movie is terrible. It is not very dangerous, it is extremely unpredictable. The film follows the lives of a small city family in the mid-60s. At school, a father runs an average life-threatening crisis. Just as you think about yourself, enter a great teacher from the great city, which makes the minds of the pupils bringing together your thoughts. The author does not agree with his teaching, but is beautiful. You can combine dots. Her teenage daughter (Winona Ryder wannabe Tara Frederick) is fed up with a small urban lifestyle and wants to live. Some get bad advice, depend on some bad boys, and it seems that family planning is not taught at his school. Shock! When the director, Paul Shapiro, finds that he is working on television, this movie is later playing as a larger version of a special episode of a particular or more secluded sitcom.
