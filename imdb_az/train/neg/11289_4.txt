Elizabeth Ward Gracen is probably only one of Bill Clinton's "bimbo eruptions" (they have tablets!) This is the most elegant element of the show. Indeed, the Highlander Series continues the tired formula - The hero faces the next death, the last time they come to an immortal, but there are some conflicts and there's a sword fight at the end of a cheap special effect sequence. <br /> <br /> After that, you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically, with typical unshaven 90 heroes, with the typical "Sexual Strain" storyline. (Seriously, you think that Hollywood sex tension is more exciting than sex). It was a joint Canadian / French production, so half the series is Vancouver, which imitates New York, and the other half is in Paris ... like Highlander.
