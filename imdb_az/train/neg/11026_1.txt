I read a book about Dillinger. This movie was a creepy mistake. There is a list of these names and everything else. His robbery and escape were well planned, and the second time - when the time came, they left all their money. Each of them had notes on the road. To return to him, and so on. Purvis did not see her in her restaurant, and Dillinger Dillinger paid her dinner after leaving. Purvis was murdered at night Dillinger, even SAW Dillinger, just his photos. Ways to kill network members were fictitious. Dillinger did not rob a bank himself, as in this film. If I had never read my book, perhaps I loved the movie. The player was a bit on top of the places. The move was delayed. According to the second thought, I would love to go to school, even though I had forbidden to read it.
