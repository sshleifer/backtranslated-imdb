First, some background; I am English and I live in London all my life. I've been to a lot of games in many places in The Den and London clubs. I get acquainted with the type of person involved in hooliganism, and I know how they behave and how they talk. We have to say that this is a bad, bad movie. The Green Street is one of the most unusual films I've ever seen. Most of the films I was surprised had been shameful. <br /> <br /> I have to write a mini review because I think we need to point out a few things. <br /> <br /> a) People just do not speak in London in real life; filmmakers took away all the consecutive things and drew it. Unfortunately, there are hooligan types, but what you see on Green Street looks like parody. b) The actor playing Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam), unfortunately, was called "English" or "Cockney" as Osama Bin Laden. I came from North from Newcastle and I was surprised that I could move straight to one of the other squads. How seriously do we get him! Why did not they divert this part of me to play a part of East London? I could say 'I got a job', hehe. c) Mr Frodo. I'm serious about how Ilyas Wud heard the two-dimensional people who really are bad hooligans. She was dead. It's as simple as that. Honestly (like the Brit) it was hard to watch this movie. I believe that this film will bomb in the UK. Americans know just how inaccurate it is (or care) because they can do a little better in the states. <br /> <br /> Do my American and foreign friends, do not believe in this nonsense. Yes, these firms exist, but all are very subsoil and bird, and very small scale. The film is just 2 of me because they actually shoot some films in London. Usually they try to get things done in Cardiff (Wales) or something and do not expect us to wait.
