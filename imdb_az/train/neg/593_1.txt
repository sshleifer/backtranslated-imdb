This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the most striking American nudity; Worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey, American dross par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and the producer get a great deal of relaxation medication and talking about the plot is actually a good idea. this is not. The Devil himself also had a great deal of effort (perhaps he could have written a better article). Like Robert Jones Exce Producer, our taxpayer's money (lottery money) should spend on this nonsense and report. Thought it would be a good idea to re-make Deathline who died on Earth ??? I ask you - camp like a Christmas Tree, Deathline ... "Ward the Doors" is a really bad English movie classic, we really do not need a reminder. And, of course, there is no need for a poor, second degree, poorly coded, poorly developed and bad trash. <br /> <br /> All this took us from the UK financial institution, which gave us Potato Men's Sex Life ... They stop my work. <br /> <br /> Do not pay any money to see this. It's a matter of absolute and heartfelt - a grace of favor for the producers, there's a great deal of cash for them .... <br /> <br /> I believe this movie is down, down. For me to support the film, Mgr says that my national backstage really thinks it's worth supporting. There's no hope for the British film industry when the show shows. Where are you Harvey Wienstein? Come back, forgive you!
