Full speed. An unfortunate manifestation of the ten-year-old, poisonous culture of ten years ago. In this film, the regrets of pedestrians for slavery are hand-handled with colonial subtexes (shake-rattling red rice). Forget about the history. Do not many Western slaves come from West Africa? An American driver easily jokes with a few people. Finally, David Hasslehoff could not have worsened. Just think what he would have on miniatures? (Most probably often impaled). The Miniseries were perfect and, of course, the DH carried its hands to something similar and made it mundane. (I think it's in its hands to create a fiasco).
