How it started, I liked it, especially for a 50-year-old movie. There were some pretty impressive images. Anne Francis, like the women who managed to flirt with "Altaira Morbius", film is too early to go through a terrible dialogue). <br /> <br /> After a long break in the 1990s, watching Francis again was fun, after an act of filmmaking, mostly an actress making television programs .... and still moving. <br /> <br /> I was also interested in seeing a young-looking Leslie Nielsen ("John J. Adams"), which I do not know for sure. Before this boredom, the movie was almost too heavy and I wanted to go to sleep. I appreciate them rebuilding this VHS tape on the stereo. but it was a weak effort. These "elites" have become one of the "very heavy" and "thought-provoking" films. This is nonsense. "The rest of the 50s fantasy films were so dumb" because it was only "smart"! <br /> <br /> Some early scenes seemed large on a large screen, the time of this article. Probably another review - this time at 2.35: 1 broadband transmission may change from this perspective.
