Some people are aiming to quit this movie because they question the Black people in the Ancient West, the people of Asia in the ancient West, or armed women in the West. Hold your hand and read the book. There were many Asian (Chinese), there were a few criminals, and everyone outside the tribal class was ready for weapons; the second amendment you know. As for the use of the modern language, none of these Westerners have reflected nostalgic information about the language used in the century. The Americans used different accents, used different ideas, spoke in a very different way, and used many unnamed words and phrases today. Do not blame history for inaccuracies. Be honest. Maybe you are worried about what you've seen.
