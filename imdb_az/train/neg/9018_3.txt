This is a form of science fiction B, and the director did not make any bones about it. About a dragon rebuilt by an academic team. Everything you have done is what you have seen many times before. This is a weak script, no real characters. In fact, this stereotype is full of characters and situations. In an attempt to deceive us, the director is attacking this movie and filming it, but it is not a matter of memorizing it for a while. It is best to eat, to clean, to work. Kind of funny entertainment. Entertainment is in the entertainment spot, but of course, it's not something you're with friends to watch if you're drunk and not care. 3.2 The massive rating is probably fair. I do not know that most of these people are unhappy, but I'm surprised that some of the writers think that this is great. It really did not even try to make me a memorable movie.
