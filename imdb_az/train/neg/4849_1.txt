I rented today ... I've heard very good reviews in advance. HELP! VAY !! What is this film's steam? Does anyone know the director's address? Can I get my five dollars back? Finally, Stop-loss came from the number one film "The Worst Thriller War". I do not think there's any good Iraq war movie to be fair, but it was really bad. <br /> <br /> I will not enter into any technical mistakes, but have other faces about the details of each of the other GWOT veterans. The director did not consult the lowest E-technical thing, but he could make the film a realist ... maybe. Perhaps, the writer should be given a "credit" for this film's expense. He has formulated the form of this film, some of which have not been met by the limitations of truth. What is the purpose of this film except me? Is there a message? Seriously though ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I'm really amazed at all the positive reviews. It's hard to see this movie as a veterinarian for all the misinterpretations, but in spite of everything, the land sucks, the characters are countless (at least say) and the best player. Probably, this film is likely to have a breakdown of explosive rules because it's the biggest bomb I've ever seen.
