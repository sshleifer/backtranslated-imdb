Back in Scotland (again), Lassie (again) is a trial for his life. Because the faithful dog lies in his grave, he must be killed according to the law. At the same time, Lassi also explains that he does not have a "legal" right to the "old Scottish law." If there are no owners after three days, the dogs should be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (like John Traill) rejects Lassie's claim and indicates that Lassie was accepted by Donald Crisp (John "Jock" Gray). <br /> <br /> Although based on this fascinating, original story ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Call to Lassie" revisits the situation of several previous Lassie; and it does not improve them. Comparatively, this is open and unexciting; and "The Sun Comes Up" (1949). Geraldine Brooks (like Susan Brown) and many other singers may be tempting, but that does not raise anything. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from this "beautiful life") among the prominent children supporting Lassi; Later, he will grow up to marry "Dark Shadows" praising "Lara Parker".
