So what is this? Unfortunately, this is really a single question, because there is no doubt. For those not familiar with the show, Muhammad Mahammadali Muhammad Cavemen is based on the number one Neanderthals and their current struggles in America and the characters displayed on a number of television commercials by Geico Insurance. <br /> <br /> I had to think a little about it, but then a line coming out of the advertisement - "We are not so different from you" provided the key to the show's deed. <br /> <br /> Cavenders / Neanderthal it's a different kind of humanity, but the show's headlines are exactly the same as those of us who are troublesome. <br /> A writer is a soulless, hacking, comedian from California - this show had a lot of potential and <br /> <br /> For example, it may be ridiculous to have a regular pupil and furniture store secretary, such as underground utility workers and cave parks as trainers. Why not go to the hunt for licensing? <br /> <br /> One more tough aspect of this show is an attempt to portray the cavemen as being exposed to an episode that they want to play. the number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities. Slow! It has been carried out many times before and for a long time. As we have already noted, Neanderthals are indeed a different species, so they must use racist stereotypes as metaphors, both should not be explained and not associated with the sign. <br /> <br /> Why am I wrong about anyone who does not want to receive answers? <br /> <br /> I would like to enjoy this show and apologize for being unsuccessful since then. <br /> <br /> Michael J.
