Despite the powerful production numbers and beautiful dresses, this movie is a work to watch. The crime-mystery is a tool for closing musical pieces, but not often involving involvement, it makes the procedures very surprising. Many of the money spent on them is quite clear, though numbers are getting worse and bad pictures are taken. Of course, it's a pre-coded movie because girls often wear very little clothes and even have a song that sings the definition of marihuana! While Carl Brisson is good to see in the music, but as Victor McLaglen, as Police Lieutenant, you may want to throw a towel while enjoying it for a few moments for clues. the next number moves to the fastest. Pain the release of his cartridges despite being blocked in the movie!
