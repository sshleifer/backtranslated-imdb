This is a decent attempt, but the screenwriter appears to be somewhat dark in the darkness to fully cool the zombie movie. No, CGI bugs and software companies are not. In fact, I'm not sure if there is a software company - I have not seen the subtitles, so I did not have to guess what you were talking about. Anyway, it was my point - rather than zombie or more, rather than reviving some of your time's tricks. 20-minute 2/3 newsletters, bugs, some kids shout about something. And worse (more boring) issues are happening on the screen. I understand that it is very popular for extra-budgetary films, but then there were many impressive effects (good, good), why the director (or screenwriter, whatever) chose to pay attention to the start of the epidemic - For a while, who will not worry anyway.
