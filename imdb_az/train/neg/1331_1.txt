The Etiquette Course is worse than the typical weekly "bad men's corporate capitalist" movie. This film is less pleasing than a toothache. Jay Leno can move. In fact, he plays a good role in his film, The Silverbears. This film is less characteristic of Leno's character, a sacred space than Morita's character, a sacred fool.
