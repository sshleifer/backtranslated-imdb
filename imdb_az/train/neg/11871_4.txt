Gregory Peck's player was as perfect as expected, and cinematography was so striking when he played directly with the melodramatic "moment". But the rest of the film was hot for me and it was hard to watch. I tried to love it, but for the last thirty minutes I was moving fast. I feel that I spent some good hours. If I was not for Grigori Peck, I would not have been for fifteen minutes. 4/10.
