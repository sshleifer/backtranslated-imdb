So, Steve Irwin. We must admire only a person who wants to make crocs, snakes, lizards, tones taken from the aforementioned reptiles from the mouth and sludge, not just daily, but a full-fledged tea. <br /> <br /> This movie does not fall into my parallel cinema category - only movies for people have been filmed in the film. they have dug their teeth, have a migraine, or have no movie experience and, therefore, as a quiet mediocrity (now lives in good Disney movies). This is very noisy. Well, Steve is very noisy. She is very happy at all times and is a knife "teenager" (now you can even hear "this movie is STUPID") or Tylenol with codeine. I say I would applaud his excitement, but if it were, I would have a room full of warmth and it would not have happened yet. <br /> <br /> That's why it's very important for me. Bad guys were so bad, one minute I thought I was shopping at a consumer electronics superstore. But the movie was full of animals, Steve and Terry, so I looked. This area is actually a lot more to throw another croc into a truck (if you can say it). My expectations were low and that was the case. <br /> <br /> I hope that Steve and Terry (acting on their acting skills) will continue to have a bit of a movie. real estate and more furry animals. I do not believe we can see Steve anymore. I hope Terry and his children are going to join the Australian Zoo and at least the discovery channel. If Irvin is not a member of the family, I can not imagine seeing a crocodile, telling me how good the crocun is. Crikey!
