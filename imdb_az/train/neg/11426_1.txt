Heather Graham could not play a credible lesbian when his life was dependent on him. Who are the film makers? I saw ABSOLUTE WORST, the most unrealistic movie I remember. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad to me that I had to sign up for IMDb and make sure that this "movie" rating is down. <br /> <br /> I'm a Heather Graham, kissing a drunken chick. Indeed, I HOURS my crazy "WHAT WAS I DO?" I'm going to keep going around my room asking .. Jesus heather, get it and grow ... and I want the same forward feeling for stupid manufacturers ... I'm not in this movie, even if it's an excuse for a story instead of a movie, maybe it would be more appropriate to focus on a character whose land is mentally unstable. .. They resemble your "Lezgi" character ... because I know for the first time that I'm in a sexual relationship, and when I came in the next morning, jumped into the skies with excitement in the middle of the south ... honestly <br /> <br /> ALL TRACK! and I draw your attention to the many flaws and terrible fools for this bare whistle, but I have not even thought about it. If you are a smart person, you hate this movie, and if you are not a smart person, it's so simple.
