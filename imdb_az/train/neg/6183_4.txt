In 2005, George W. Bush began his career as president of the United States; North Korea has announced that it has nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Blue Into appeared. The existence of this film is not as bad as the other things that happened in that year, but the film itself was sad and maybe the worst since then. Now, there is another president of the United States in 2009, another Pope has a new Korean nuclear weapon ... and film into Blue 2: Reef better than the original ... but it's the same: "cut your fingers off it is better than cutting your head. "This is a really bad movie that has made me very bored and uninteresting. Blue 2's Tower: The Reef is designed by actors who are totally obstructed by any credibility and dramatic gravity, but are perfect for showing their bodies. Chris Carmack, David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring empty and boring speeches. Former director Stephen Herek (Critters and Billiards and Ted's Perfect Adventure), but can not even create tension, emotion, or entertainment at a minimal level. The characters of this film are not only bad, but they are also obedient. Cinematography from this movie is also bare and looks prepared by a technical group that presents presentation videos for Hawaiian hotels. In Blue 2: Reef is a horrible movie that is better than the original movie, as I said before. Evaluate this bad movie all the time.
