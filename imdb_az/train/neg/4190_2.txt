A few months ago I saw this city in Greendale as the only reason to see it in this city. Another local in the neighborhood conveyed an email to a recurring demonstration because the first was sold and people turned away. <br /> <br /> If you are not a Neil Young fan or you live in Greendale, you know the next real name), skip this movie. For the director of the film is mainly ego trip. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> ">"> <br /> <br /> I do it about 1 , I'll give 5/10, but it's just for the sight of the locals who turn into a movie. It was not worth the $ 6. <br /> <br /> A woman with a spouse is a very good movie for me.
