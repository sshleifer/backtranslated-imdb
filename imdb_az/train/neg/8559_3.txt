"It's like money and something like making a drama like pornographic scenes, as well as throwing it on like fine things and hesitating as an exciting and making us more money." - Ellen, the lost quote. <br /> <br /> "Kissing, kissing, like, mouth and kissing" is like the traditional unique works. Looking at Ellen's feathered guns and Chris as a drummer, my whole movie-viewing experience was like the height of our experience and products. But before I begin breaking new US 20th Air Newspaper notes with my likes, look me like a vignette like this for a short time: <br /> <br /> 1. Chris follows the sex organs. And it's not just: After the end of the un-Catholic job of the camera (the elegant way by Ellen and Patrick), the audience gives Chris's greasy white-trash stomach full screen shot - it was really exciting. In all honesty I can say that I have not seen such a grace. Chris, you have to make more scene in your future movies because it's a clear thing to do, as long as it is a brilliant, brilliant man, Lars von Trier and his Idiots 95. After a fast night *** then a hairy, greasy, white belly: Can you please ask for more than any movie? No need to say, sit down all day and watch the Chris ejaculate (even when I'm straight) ... This kind of poem moves. Such elegance, style. In total, the divine inspiration began to draw this sequence - plus a solid Zen philosophy. <br /> <br /> Even Barbra Streisand could not get even more spiritually. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's feathers, thick weapons. Ellen and Patrick, who have been drawn quite insufficiently by both of our directors, have created confusion about the proper identification of this gender. There were several scenes that we could see in a section of an object (a foot, arm or foot), but it was still a guessing game: is the body part of a man or a woman? Naturally, Chris and his fellow artists, Ellen, Patrick and Whatsername, cast their goals out of their goals because their bodies were ideal for this gender-based confusion. Sometimes it was difficult to find someone to see a woman or a man. Patrick is very gentle and prone to hair, hairless and pristine, and Ellen and the other girl are more flattering with their thick legs and arms. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> 3. Bright - a way to keep in touch with the theme of the role of sex in particular: so totally original and mind-blowing. Ellen behaves like a man, always wants sex, and his past Patrick wants to talk like a girl. Spifing. <br /> 4. Ellen's Leftist Looks for a Wife. "He should love The Simpsons, and I'm very glad that the creators of this film decided to break the long tradition offered by clever left-wingers, and Ellen is such a refreshing and realistic change that he and his liberal spouses can talk about in less than 80 minutes, the number really is extraordinary (3,849, must be accurate). <br /> <br /> <strong> 5. Fingerprinting There are many things to do with foot fetishists, so it's a very liberal, high-priced tool to reach sex minorities, because shoes and foot fetishists are offered in a modern cinema small, as one of CARES- it's nice to see that it's in. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather KLOTLMAS, offers more than it does, and this is a modest one for simple people dealing with idle relationships when engaging in meaningless conversations. it's not a small movie, no more than that, it's all about the light that directs all the foolish creatures, but it's a good guide for the pseudo-artistic wannabes's illegal life taken from the movie school and good at ambitious festivals like Sundance and Cannes, hopefully good plan to attack our emotions and earn them a bit of an exposure and hence a little more real money for a change, and then Sean Penn and George Clooney will help the planet's thinking and solve all political problems facing the world. Is it better than porno at the beginning? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen explicitly indicate the camera in recent loans, who is the two cameras in front of both? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < / STRONG> to the list.
