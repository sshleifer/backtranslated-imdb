I thought the whole joke of the movie would see some rich white man acting like Chris Rock, and then Chris Rock reacted to the reaction of the people. Instead, you just see Chris Rock himself and people who do not understand it. Perhaps there are scenes in the film that he uses in his two movies. It should have been better.
