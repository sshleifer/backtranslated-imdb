This production does not have a story line. Acting embarrassing. This promising Dutch television star, Sophie Hilbrand, should not add this movie to the CV. I think he's been flawless and personally involved in a professional regret; about the way he showed himself in this film. This film has many unnecessary nudity, strange sex scenes and rude language. It also shows a misconception of the Netherlands (like most films). Do not be afraid to watch this movie: a shameful record for Hilbrand, who proves that it is better to waste time, loss of money and on the screen.
