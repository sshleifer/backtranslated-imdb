Believe me, as it is difficult for me, in the last few years, with all the terrible reality that it should still be the best place for the worst person. I'm still wondering if there is an oral verbality made by the SCTV network. If Andy Kaufmann was still alive, I'm sure he was behind me. Can the rock band be stoop to INXS at a level lower than this embarrassing thing? The gradation is simple and moronic. Audition refuses to be a new lead singer of INXS to replace a group karaoke, Michael Hutchence (suicide bomber in 1997). Eight years later, there is no hit, the band is extremely intensely moving, choosing a group of unlucky wannabes to become a new lead singer for a group of 20 years ahead. So all of these terrifying singers (American Idol thought to be a part of their teeth) just made each classic (and predictable) rock song that creates a heartwarming impression. Then, they cut off the members of the INXS group who seriously discussed the essence of each of these candidates. <br /> <br /> You can see better (and more original) rock performers with any nightclub in any city around the world. <br /> <br /> Every reality show has all its creations. Lame reality attendees, lunar interviews, lame host / emcee, "collect" performances and "shoot a participant laugh at the end of the show". Are these demonstrations more predictable? Undoubtedly, the presentation of a part of the group; Finally, he gave hope that he could revive his lost belly before he was buried in accusations. Michael Hutchence had to take part in his grave, if they were proud to live. INXS is not a big group, but I did not know it was a pitiful thing. If INXS has any representative who tells you what rock and roll is, this show will prove rock and roll are dead once and for all.
