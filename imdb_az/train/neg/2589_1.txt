In short, I will soon promise to those who spend little time in their hands. There are very good examples of why this film is perfectly suited for this description. So you just have to take a 2 minute screenshots to see that you are totally stupid and have nothing negative. Want a totally naked woman in the first 10 minutes? You got it! The reason he sees is so illogical, though, that it really defines the voice for the rest of the young pink piece. What can be said about the fraudulent minds of the 12-year-old boys who watched the garbage tracks by watching this joke seeing the public waiting for their actual payment! <br /> <br /> Over the years, I have seen a decline in a movie franchise, but the American Pie, the Beta House, should be one of the worst offenders, despite the medium nature of the original film, Events that take place in this movie are not unusual as long as the discontinuity of the film is a long way from watching it (we talk about Star War types of fighting, what you need to convince yourself is Jar Jar) <br /> <br /> Artistic literature is subtle and vice versa, events that occur during the transition period show another pair of hearts and create another luxurious joke. There is no legendary talent to talk, and we all have a nice guy trying to make us laugh. And how unsuccessful ohhh !! Every rope fades and something I laughed was that the screenwriters did not know the public. <br /> <br /> <strong> is a relative who lives in the Caucasus. <P style = "text-align: justify; The heroes have to perform a number of tasks before being accepted as members of the Beta House, but they are mostly met with short assemblies that indicate that they will fulfill their responsibilities, but It's a very lazy way of telling a story, but it also misses the opportunity to be funny (Imagine that it's the Oz Wizard, which is out of place for all important events, and we can see that Dorothy has been once more conquered the Scarecrow, and "Gee was a great adventure after we were convinced) Lazy. Busy. LAZY !!!! <br /> <br /> There is little or nothing to tell women's characters. All they do is naked for whatever reason, and most of the film is used as a visual props. Only the T & A seekers braindeads will not be disappointed, but for this reason alone you are ashamed. If you purchase this on a DVD you will help to collapse society. Congratulations.
