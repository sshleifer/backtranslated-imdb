Oh, how's an arrogant here; Considering that your brain is spending time with neutral degradation, it is a movie that is surprised and dragged into other things; Worst and racist character stereotypes since D.W. Griffith refers to the Chinese character as a 'yellow man' in red flowers; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> </ span> Prizzi's Honor is a film that ends the post-modern disaster everywhere possible. The film is a scattered and meaningless catastrophe led by John Huston; Kathleen Turner and Jack Nicholson are crying on a phone that is similar to each other or facing a main character and looks at everyone who fills the hollows or fills up as dumb style or supporting characters. Prizzi's Honor is a genre of neo-nuir, comedy, romance, action, gangster and general genocide? It is enough to push it through a story of a kind of twin with the director and player; some kind of a good scene; There is no kind of intelligence in a scenario or something else, but what? <br /> <br /> I'm going to give you some examples of how a movie's horror show is flawless. First, the film thinks it's a love story and estimates it one hour: My time. Charlie Partanna (Nicholson) is a murderer who kills people for a New York-based family, and has even bruised his character more than an international cunning on a continental shelf. He meets and falls with another conspirator, Irene Walker (Turner). It hits him but plays like a poor excuse for a plot, it seems, is not all right. I read the plot of this movie: "A professional man and a hit woman are in love, only to discover that they are hired to kill each other." Yes, yes, that's true, but it does not take about twenty minutes until the actual unit ends! Nicholson plays like a person with explosives at 60 IQ: walks around; As you can see, he speaks loudly about what he sees; He speaks as if he is drunk or has a worse problem, and he will not feel like a conspirator. <br /> <br /> So, with a maternal character, it's not enough to show that this guy is a hard-working, best-looking, international hit man. lonely and non-realistic, we're going through a script. The first half-hour half-life is merely a kinematic dead zone to offer poor conventions: Partane is repeatedly asked on the phone or repeating things that are: "Do I marry her, I love her, what is love, what should I do?" can not act as a good humor. She always looked at each other as she looked on the phone: a girl named Maerose Prizzi (Huston), directed by John's daughter; He did not give any purpose to the plot and laughs laughing, as he and his father had slept with Partanna and loved him. He was thinking of me, should that be funny? Do I Need to Laugh? The film feels like an intelligent mafia, the scene of the wedding (scenes of the legend), and scenes that resulted in drumming, gangsters, cops and assassins. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < "text-align: justify; right, love and romance? Maybe the movie will begin: I was very wrong: there is an event in which many guys are constantly abruptly and very deliberately speaking, a guy who leaves our office: filming, everything is short-sighted, and is then performed in a difficult and inconvenient manner that facilitates the appearance of cheese - we do not see them coming to dramatic music, and maybe have to be safe to go to the lift, perhaps when they are hovered at their chosen place and the casual woman is lifted up and taken care of by the citizens Needless to say, the scene is not corrected: some lag, some dramas: "I shoot, but not?" Maybe very slow motion, Prizzi's Honor, monotonous and unobtrusive, continues until the film's oblivion. Cameras are a projection of windows; the lights are reflected on the side of the car and blinking when the "dead" showers are nudged. Prizzi's Honor would not be a comedy for any filmmaker, because I did not laugh with her, it was an embarrassing and terrifying movie. This is another matter. The film is replicated, drawn and colorless in its own vision and originality - there is no Honor here.
