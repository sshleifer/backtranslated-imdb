"Sir" John Gielgood was forced to become a star in the confusion of such a film. <br /> <br /> One of these films, I guess, is to deceive this "art" ..... garbage. <br /> <br /> In this work Giegud writes Shakespeare's "The Tempest," and if the camera shoots, it goes away to the naked people. One of them is in a small children's swimming pool. Wow, this is not a cunning thing and a real "art"? This is just an example. The majority of the story is meaningless and can not be traced, and so Liberal critics are afraid to say "they can not understand" and thus give high marks to keep their fake ego. Do You Want Shakespeare? Read his books.
