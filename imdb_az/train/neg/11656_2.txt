Scary Movie 2 was a big disappointment. Simply referring to movies such as "Mission Impossible 2" does not bring a comedy. The film goes well with white people and uses James Woods and Andy Richter in a good way. Unfortunately, the movie is back there. The player is strange. Tori Text view and completely out of the reach. The film looks hacked to each other and surprisingly slow paced. There are many gags in the theater that are funny for everyone, those snails in progressive films, joints, and the previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie. Fortunately, the film comes to an end in a shocking unfunny end of 83 minutes. (I'm shocked that the end does not even try to end humor) I do not want to say anything else that putting Miramax was a little disappointing to get more money behind young people. Generally a very bad movie.
