I'm honest, I will not be able to watch the second movie that started this movie. Just how bad it is! Something like mixing is more complicated. I would like to say that sit there and wait for something to happen, in fact, something that makes the whole film meaningful. At the end of the film, I was curious about the fact that I actually missed the first hour of the story, or that I accidentally went out of the movie and did not leave any parts that adhere to my plot. actually one was) together! The main thing about this movie is that my mother's daughter (if she really is one of the main girls) was in some kind of alternative reality, almost at this point, what is hell? he woke up suddenly and was at a zaky institute, chained to a bed by doctors or something, and then he sped me up to cut my wrist, turned back, and did not give any simple meaning that he began to eat by some random vampires! I do not want to send e-mails to my artists and do not waste my time, I'm wasting 2 hours of my life looking at this stream! I am interested in knowing that cinematographers really know what it is all about! I thought only one would have a movie lasting 4 hours, but it seemed to make all the bits that could be logical! Along with the other person who wrote the other, I was royalty with this movie and it was just that. I'm just really grateful that I did not actually buy a movie, how many times I saw it in a local pound shop. I thought the film was a full spark of a steam film trash, but I must be honest, that Â£ 1 has made a lot of money to spend on this movie! When to spend a simple time and a good razor blade, I want to say that OD'ed is less painful than watching this movie!
