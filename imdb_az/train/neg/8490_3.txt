It was a nice attempt at something, but it is very ambitious and boring to go beyond most budget peaks. The use of virtual bands is almost working, but at some points it is in poor condition. They used the small budget I thought well. I just wish the story and most of the players were better. There are a lot of things you can do for them, and it would be good if they actually hit these marks, but they are not. Awesome and incredible story. Bad DVD transmission too. It's not important for me to watch a movie in a single apartment. I have to close it. It was very boring. I can make slow movies. But make them attractive on the one hand. Visual, storyteller, moving, and so on. Perhaps the next attempt of the filmmaker will be better.
