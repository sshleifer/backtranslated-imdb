<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I started this site and started voting for films since I have never given the rating of any movie. Even dance with Barbie "Dance!" There is a program. 2. There is a reason for this. <br /> <br /> If you watch what I think of a really bad movie, I have to stop myself and ask myself the following questions: "Is this movie really bad as a monster with the terrible spirit of Theodore Rex?" "<br />" Do not make a Blade Runner with Barney in the role of Harrison Ford, saying, "I'm a comrade." and it is a good idea to spend time and money to actually shoot movies and movies. In addition, I would like to know what kind of market is going to sell if it's not going to shoot a video. This is a rare monster: a very violent film for children and a very insanely stupid movie for adults. I asked, "What did they think?" <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is only to disclose this monster if you are only one of the five or six hurricane fans. Or if you want to see the worst Insane movie of all time, or you really want to punish yourself.
