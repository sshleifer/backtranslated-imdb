In the 1980s, T. Rama Rao made some very nice films, but it looks like a filmmaker who grew up with changing periods, styles and fashion. It looks like the style of making the same old film. <br /> <br /> Players are not bad or not good. Anil Kapoor generally reassures two of his father's and son's role, but the defective scenario often seems funny and depressing. The competition is good, but then - it's always good, and it's not something like that here. He does what he does best, but he does it all the time. As a result, nothing is great. <br /> <br /> This film is melodramatic, sometimes stupid. Raveena is not normal, normal, bad, not good. Maybe it's a delayed movie? Well, it would be even lower than the standard. The scenario is horrible, the film is over-exploded, and the story is not going anywhere. <br /> <br /> It looks like a film shot in the early 1990s, but the script is even older, the style is so in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> The main role players.
