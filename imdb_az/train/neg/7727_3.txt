I'm commenting on these miniseries from the perspective of a man reading the first novel. And from this point of view, I can honestly say that, although unpleasant, we can see why it has not been spread yet again. More precisely, there are serious problems with this mini: <br /> 1) quite destructed. Actors performing younger generations were older than 15-20 years old. Ali McGraw (45 then) was playing Natalie Jastrow. He was Jan-Michael Vincent (then 39) about 22-year-old Byron Henry. Other Henry's children and Pamela Tudsbury <br /> <br /> Many people in the Caucasus live in the life of Ali McGraw sometimes making this mini unwatchable. I've seen more convincing performances in Lissabon. <br /> <br /> 3) The director was poor. To be fair to Ali McGraw, it was probably a bad move and character development. Hitler's imagery has long passed. Her character is charismatic, sometimes charming, but always looking and acting as a stylized genius Herman Wouk novel, as a painted cartoonist. Some of the other characters are stereotyped (Berel Jastrow), for which Wouk does not earn the character they create. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very written. Hockey music, an ambitious story (called a junior high school history film), and the mini part of the entire soap opera has sometimes been funny. Also, Byron and Natalie are often made of costumes and are made just as in 1979, but not in 1979. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The television version of the American classics will come out more. old movies and unique ones are sometimes weak, but this is probably a situation where a creative and inspirational filmmaker can produce a very striking, memorable and critically acclaimed film. I did not see anything to be lengthy (15 hours) or longer to make the reconstruction true, and most of the current American views would attract the majority of the public, not to fly.
