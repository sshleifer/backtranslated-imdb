This movie looked good - good casting, evergreen theme and explosive landing. He went down there. Why is it taken with a camera camera? It is shaking, the rulers, parts, and just blends the viewer. Really bad choice. If this is not enough, you will receive the worst-edited audience-in-memory - you do not want to enjoy it anyway. And then all is the worst sin. After reaching the exhaustion point of any incredible and incredible scenarios of viewers, what is the reason for their intention to repay loans without ending the loan? How will you succeed in giving excitement without exciting? Doh! He had the great promise of this movie and began to make a face plant in the mud. Make an effort. The intense effort of the writer and director.
