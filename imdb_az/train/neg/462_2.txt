It should be downloaded as one of the worst films of all time. Terrible motion, terrible script ... and they were good points! Someone definitely missed it! These jokes were very much anticipated if you could call them. Pamela Anderson still relies on her body to realize that her toy is like plastic! I wanted to give it a chance, I hope it did not usually want to improve! If there were a choice between this book and the book, I suggest you sit down for a good read! I love Denise Richards, so it's a movie, but why left it in this movie?
