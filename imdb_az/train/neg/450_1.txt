It's painful to watch this show ... <br /> <br /> It's clear that creators have no clue from this show, always changing "work places", beloved ones and shooting. Amanda Bynes appears to want to give something ... but there was no idea, and it came with an unhappy show. They cast him as a teenager covering more than twenty-thirty, and many times in the comedy, they made him an adult in unsuccessful attempts. <br /> <br /> Recently, they understand the need for "clicks" and try to make people of the last 20 years as teenagers. <br /> <br /> This show is out of my control of how the four seasons survived. In any case, ABC now has a "family" show and decided that it was put on the ABC Family Day afternoon.
