I'm a great admirer of Italian films from fans and I will not hesitate to list the wonderful Barbara Bouchet list of my favorite actresses all the time, so I went to this movie with little hope. However, it soon becomes clear that this is a very insignificant film that will not go anywhere. Obviously, nobody will expect this much, but when you think that it's really delicate, it's more intense, and none of the characters are interesting. The title shows that the film works on "confusion"; in this case stealing, women and smuggling products. Basically, this film has a whole area. The film has a real "seventies style" for it, and all of this is a good idea to be very carefree. Sometimes the director tried to look at the points, such as Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson, although it seems to be good at this point. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on the screen always takes pleasure and here it is; The best thing about the movie and it's the best part of the movie, sequentially hanging on a naked car. In general, Rogue is surprised by the people who love seventh styles, but unfortunately, there is nothing else to offer.
