What a horrible movie! For some reason, scientific laboratories and police stations are always bad, dirty, consistently inspired and have an incorrect squadron inside. Probably, these people who work with complicated scientific projects will not think about how to survive in the hands of CGI Dragon. Spoiler: An unusual scientist who has cloned a Dragon "leering" and "worst horror" in basic action skills. Despite the fact that the lab was engaged in this kind of work, other scientists were shocked, because, of course, they dropped off their trousers and trousers. The rest of the story refers to the FIRST Small Indians, who were hunted and killed by the crew, as they attempted to form a way to escape and / or defeat the Dragon. The CGI Dragon Vitality is a dark gray that looks like a popular color for most of the cheap CGI special effects. A difficult cartoon looks better and dark gray tones make it difficult to see any interesting details on the body of the Dragon. As you can see, all this is a gray blob. Acting is less than scary. These scientists act as children who do not agree with something, and this is the way Drago runs away, hiding, and so on. It makes it easier for them to kill in different attempts. Dean Cain is better than the cast of unknown actors in this movie. He climbs to the level he supports. This movie is really strange. The player is bad. The story is mute. CGI is very cheap and amateur. There is nothing fancy about this movie, it's not a good time to look at work or other things.
