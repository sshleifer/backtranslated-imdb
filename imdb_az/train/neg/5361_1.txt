The first time I went out in 1970 and hated, hated, saw this movie! It's the fastest growing movie I've ever seen in my life. You do not know where Leigh finds inspiration, but these are one of the movies you want to shake the characters to open their mouths and communicate. The title tells all this because there is no saving moment in this movie, only long and long silences can not express people's (perhaps) feelings. If you want to watch something that will drive you to drink, this is for you. If you have something better within two hours, then put a toaster on a fork: the experience will get more and more tastier than ever! Yes, Leigh has come up with many really worthwhile things in his career, but this is a miss.
