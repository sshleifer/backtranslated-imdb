This has never been the most groundless animated movie experience, but of course, it can not be as exciting as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a canticle of the Spirit (Matt Damon, who provided the first human narration) and traveled across the borders of the former West. She was born freely among all the other horses in the beautiful village, then abducted to be used as a horse, trying to throw those trying to ride it. But when she ran along with her daughter, Little Dragon (Daniel Studi), two are friends, oh, and she clearly has something for Little Creek's horse rider. Finally, after a few runs, after being captured by the Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and after a great leap on a stream, Little Creek allows the Spirit to go, and he also throws his horse, and they are home to their villages and other horses. Also, Chopper Bernet is a member of the Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBauu Murphy / Chief of Railroad, John Rubano as Soldier, Matthew Levin as Bill McGonagle and Joe. I was expecting horses to speak in this movie, but it seems more like Dumbo and Bryan Adams's songs are not the most attractive, but it's not a terrible movie. He was nominated for the Best Animated Feature Oscar award and became the Golden Globe nominee for Bryan Adams's best song for "I'm Here". Okay!
