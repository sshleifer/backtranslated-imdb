<br /> <br /> I have not seen anyone watching this movie yet. <br /> <br /> Saddened. In fact, I did not follow his end. It was like a dull soap or a really good watch (all the soap is crap). The actor was poor and his story was bad. 10/10 does not know what it is about. The scenario was terrible. 2 People were in a fierce conversation with direct threats, and you asked the good guy to wait for something really good and out of it. He says, "If you do it, I will hurt you" Hahahahaha. If the comedy is yours, wait. Please do not watch this movie ... because this is CRAP! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Summary: <br /> <br /> Tracking! Of course, this is my idea.
