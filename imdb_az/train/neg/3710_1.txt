The king has long lived! Caddy Shack Two, The Merchandise Family and Troop Beverly Hills, for the past three years, have been locked in for the worst movie characters they have ever seen. But there is a new king ..... yep ..... welcome the whole new king .... "towards the world". For example, some things like Tiny Tim are good, they are good. Some day, this can be regarded as a culprit for the movie "Rocky Horror Picture Show". So look it .... .... this is good for me. Go see it. I welcome the new king!
