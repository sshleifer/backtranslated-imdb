<br /> <br /> This film is absolutely terrible but nevertheless it can be happy, but this humor is completely inadequate. <br /> I do not think that a 2 year old man will agree with the ridiculous ridicule of filmmakers trying to hit the story. However, on the positive side, some terrifying beliefs provide a lot of humor in the twisted plot. For example, "Wow, Lady Hogbottom, has a giant rocket hidden in the back yard!" <br /> <br /> In some cases, a number of issues related to this issue will be discussed. Most of the children's roles are cute, but not very convincing. On the other hand, Annie is terribly terrible. Adults do not take their roles seriously, but this is a very good thing. If they tried to be convincing, the film would have been worse. <br /> <br /> After the film's total disintegration, it's just a few minutes since it's almost unhappy. The scene where Lady Hogbottom's son fled with the servant is not surprisingly hilarious, although they are annoyed when they are caught by the police. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie really made me physically painful. Nevertheless, there were several distributive parts that were almost excruciated before the bleeding began. Looking at only the best parts, the movie will be around 5; Unfortunately, the rest of the film is worth the trouble. So I'll give it 3. <br /> <br /> This is pretty generous, I want to say.
