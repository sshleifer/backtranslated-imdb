It was the first half of the film, or so much. Ingrid Bergman and Mel Ferrer were lovely to watch romantic romance and I wanted to see them inevitable. However, the move left the house of Ingrick's fiancé completely separated. Instead of romance and charm, we see many duplicate parallel characters that are destroying the film. The fiancee's son and his military attaché did not pay attention to the servant, as was a subpot of an old Love Boat episode. How can the attraction and elegance of the first part of the film lead to doping? This film will NOT know that RENUU is connected to the game's NOTES because the actions of the film are very similar to the property of the country (as in the other film) directly. I'm not a big fan of GAME RULES, but ELENA AND ME I appreciated the art and nuances of the original film.
