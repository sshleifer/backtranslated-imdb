As noted, this formula was shot several times, and finally Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" became "Got Mail" with Ryan. In some versions this is my least favorite. <br /> <br /> I think that the Star Horizma stage studio will not cut it down completely. <br /> <br /> In this film, chemistry never boils between two fuss. I do not have a true spark. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of the old pockets daily, pleasant, but gentle. And if the results are won, the rest of the film can only follow. Judy, in particular, creates disappointment. It looks like it is not necked! He does not know if he has a problem or pain, but it looks like a turtle that wants to bend his head, everything is fun and everything. I could not understand how hot John Johnson was about. I would arrange a bee line for this lovely violin player. And Van was not good either. <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm going to follow one of my spouse's head. I love this movie. But there are more entertaining romantic comedies that they offer you more than a root sweets.
