"Nacho Libre" (2006) Directed by: Jared Hess Player: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Hector Jimenez and Darius Rose <br /> MPAA Rating: "PG-13" (some but also for humor, including gross moves and dialogue) <br /> <br /> What you will do about it (I know some people who do not want to end it) I always thought Napoleon Dynamite was an entertaining movie - the most brilliant brick in the wall , but still a funny movie. Jack Black is also a very funny person - sometimes heartbreaking, yes and massively practically overrated by adolescent audiences, but funny. Rarely have I been a Jack Black comedy that did not enjoy me a bit. So, I was so happy to hear Jared Hess, a writer and director of Napoleon Dynamite, and Jack Black would prepare a movie about a Spanish friar that turned into a wrestler to rescue an orphanage. The area of ​​my subordination seemed a little subtle. Unfortunately, my order was the collapse of the entire film. This area would have worked perfectly if it were designed as a skate on a show like "Saturday Night Live" or even a "Mad TV". <br /> <br /> Nacho grew up in a Mexican monastery, and the Lord became a pious man. Unfortunately, the plot is very kind to work about one and a half hours, and this is a joke comedy. Nacho (Black), now sensing his departure from the monastery, now decides to pursue his dreams to become a genius, a professional wrestler. After reaching the lowest level of monastery's finances, Nacho decides to take part in the wrestling tournament to earn money and give good food to the monastery's orphanage. This area is very sweet and caring. Jack Black looks like a perfect movie. Look what she did with Rock school. Yes, in my hate, this is exactly the destruction of the film and the heart is completely humorous. Yet, the way to show that Hollywood's young audiences only understand fart jokes and foolish humor is perhaps a common idea of ​​these young people, because most of them enjoyed this movie. By looking at a obese woman, like a mouse, of course, people will laugh, but I do not expect you to get a reward for your film. A 7-year-old can make the same joke. <br /> <br /> Nacho Libre's performance is really good. Jack Black once again proves that he can always discover exciting, even the most bizarre, worthless lines on paper. Unfortunately, this movie is not enough for him. That's why he did not do anything, and some of his jokes were for him. I have never seen and heard Mom de la Reguera before, but now I can say that she is not one of the most talented, but one of the most beautiful women with my eyesight. He just clicked on the role and worked fine. Héctor Jiménez, playing Nacho's bumping partner Esqueleto, laughing at me constantly. He did a great job and was very impressed when he collaborated with Jack Black. Darius Gul, an orphan named Chancho, did not draw too many lines, but what can I say, I just loved him. He was beautiful. The rest of the castle did their job. <br /> <br /> Nacho Libre does not just work. Its area extends very subtly. His heart is incomplete with moronic humor and jokes of jokes that do not work. I rarely laughed, and if I were busy with me, Jack Black or another player. And it takes me to the brilliant side of Nacho Libre: yes, do not cast. This cast was just good, because they did not have a better word deficiency. They were all alike, with the perfect chemistry, and gave as much as possible in the straight line. Jared Hesse has complimented me for the entire film "Napoleon Dynamite", and then I was surprised to find myself with Nacho Libre often. There was something missing here and I realized what it was all about. I know that "Nacho Libre" is not a good movie and is still worthless for its filming. There is a small reason to watch just to watch Jack Black's work. But if you are not an admirer of Jack Black, then do not try to avoid this movie. I love black, but I did it with this film and this research. <br /> <br /> Last thought: Yikes! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;
