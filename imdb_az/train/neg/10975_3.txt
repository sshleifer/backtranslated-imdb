This movie gives a blow - right now. There are several scenic carriers inside this mustache, but nobody can take back the smooth surface. Colin Farrel looks like "12 Monkeys" like Brad Pitt and moves in the same way. Normally, I hate Colin, because she is not a fairy, but she's fine in this movie. There were two lines in this movie - one on the front of a moving vehicle, one on a mustache woman. Let's not have any idea what this movie wants or what it wants to go. Artistic lines look like each other on some levels, but are not worthy of being included in a single script. Everything is weak and meaningless, and then there are some random OK scenes. But in general - never hesitate to talk about Irish highlighting, and it's all saved by anyone who has been singing as a successful Charms elf, like the American fetish, a really bad movie movie.
