A police officer (Robert Forster) was attacked by a husband in a murdered town and killed his son after he dared to oppose a thief in a petrol station. After being released for a corrupt court judge, he himself was sentenced to 30 days in prison for disrespecting the court, and decided to take matters into his own hands by joining a group of vigilants under the direction of grizzled-looking Fred Williamson. These types of Robin Hood correct criminals who do not want the law to be pursued and try to follow the oppressors with their help. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing but a big bag. The simple thing is to kill a two-year-old boy on a very ill screen. Otherwise, this is an ordinary job for the genre, for example, many cars involving many posturing men, such as pursuit, footsteps and shooting. It would even be possible to fight against the shower attracted by anyone from prison. Before they did the last scenes, they fled in money? In this regard, I note that it is in very poor condition. <br /> <br /> For viewing: The file under the "Forgotten Splurge". Forward ..
