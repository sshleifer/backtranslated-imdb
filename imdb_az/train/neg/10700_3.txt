The film is characterized by Sir Christopher Strong (MP - member of the parliament - Colin Clive) and Amelia Earhart, played by Katherine Hepburn. Until he saw, he was a very loyal husband, but when he encountered striking but exciting Hepburnu, he could not help himself, and they fell in love. You can say because they look up to space and talk about their unrequited love, which is extremely foolish. Undoubtedly, this is a very strange, practical and practically impossible movie to watch. Part of the problem, films that were adultery during Pre-Code days were very common. Even if you accept this morality as a suspicious topic, sound the joy of dialogue as a 19th-century romantic novel ... and that's a really bad thing. It's a difficult time to spend a great deal of time (after all, Clive's wife was a wonderful lady and did not hurt it) as characters that are difficult and challenging. The only interesting aspect of this film is the wearing of a suit costume in a moth suit of Hepburn! You must see it to believe - and it looks like one of the buggies (a dark, but suitable reference).
