My girlfriend is going to Blockbuster and have no habit of choosing movies that nobody has ever heard. Of course, sometimes it has caused some fun discoveries. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is possible to say that they will last for an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> He brought home "Caterpillar advice". It was excited because the box said it was funny. <br /> <br /> This film was a sturdy workout. One of these films is that if you are not an ambitious and neat person who loves watching movies about yourself, you will hate every single character in the movie. Until the application of a beautiful character. <br /> <br /> The love of the ambitious character in prison is in such a way that he will be away from everyone in the real world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Emotional vapid, bark, ambitious artists love a group of people and succeed in their career. Then they are beautiful, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving (almost perfect guy). Then, as we fell in love, we are watching a strange woman annoyingly an ambitious artist (her 30s). So he strives to stay away from that beautiful, intelligent, emotional adult and stay married to a great, empty sex. He is insane and takes everything he can to take it. In the real world, he would be very successful. I, of course, wanted to escape from it, and even did not communicate with her! <br /> <br /> Although I loved her because she loved it, I never wanted her. (He did not have a girlfriend) He was not worth it. And why am I am so surprised that the director believed that a "almost perfect man" should be punished by winning a relationship with him? When we asked him to leave the "almost perfect man", we shouted to leave him. <br /> <br /> The heroine of the film is a very boring, childish and frustrated movie. <br /> <br /> Besides, Andy Dick was laughing to me a few times, but his character was also ambitious to the point of worry. As for other symbols, they were well-functioning, morally defective, and heartfelt. <br /> <br /> I can say that I was laughing at the comedy and the movie several times. Unfortunately, so many laughs did not happen until the last 10 minutes. But since I was laughing, I prayed for the film to last long. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch people who hate people who are envying people in the Caucasus, this is a movie for you.
