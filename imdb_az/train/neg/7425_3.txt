The Las Vegas casino heist movie, which is almost impossible to review and attract, is a tedious, emotional film. If you have something else, you see something better. In this movie, only two good things are connected to Stella Stevens, and the one that he hopes will be at least one of those over and over. In the mid 70's, many great shooting in Las Vegas (when there is still no cool place to visit) and the fashion of the day is good for giggling. Otherwise, a big yaw. The Rhino dvd has a very good widescreen, but even less than $ 10, my modest ideas are still not worth it.
