Peter Marshall (Joanne Dru's brother and later the numerous hosts of Hollywood squares) and Tommy Noonan's "new Lewis and Martin" are just frightened by this service comedy: several random reviews are posted on the gags, everyone meets you fast and no something does not work properly - There is a scene that has thrown grenade into Noonan angry officers and politicians; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marshall and Noonan double talks and they are engaged in breaking the debate and their time is perfect - obviously they were a good comedy pair. <br /> <br /> This is not enough for saving Turkey, sadly.
