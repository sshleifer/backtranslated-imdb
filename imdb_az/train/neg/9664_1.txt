The film based on this book is really terrible and a great disappointment. We are waiting for these actions for more than a month. Many filmmakers were hopeful about this. It also has a great meaning in newspapers and television. On April 29th, many people regretted that the film was really terrible. Why? Initially, the story was so monotonous. There are very vague scenes, sometimes it is difficult to understand what happened. Hulya Avshar's actresses, especially Vildan Atasever, did not fit in. He is acting better in comedy films, some drama in this movie could not be forfeited from his previous role. And finally the Movie is very short, only 66 minutes.
