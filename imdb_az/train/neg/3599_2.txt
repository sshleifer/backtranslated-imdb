Umm .. I was surprised that someone really appreciated this movie. <br /> <br /> Tori Spelling is a great actress, and this film proves the degree of his talent alone. "The structure of the film was weak ... I think it's like a dork that comes up with this concept, some trickiers, and if there's anything good about this movie, I would say that Tommy Chong's daughter is just his daughter ... and then there is a good look soap-opera, which looks good, but continues to help her dramatic skills. * Why IMDb requires at least 10 lines? How many ways can you just say "This movie sucks"?
