Some movies are good, they are good. This is obviously not one. Based on a true story, this movie was about the story as the chance of Pinocchio being a true boy. The player was strange, the route was weak and the road was too fast. <br /> <br /> Melissa Joan Hart did not hit me like a talented actress, but she was pretty low on every movie, anyway the budget. Like some of his other films, he multiplies his characters and speaks very quickly, accelerating his words and making them more dramatic. She really has a crew in front of her and she discovers that her character is talking with a camera that should deal with the audience. <br /> <br /> Probably, the film is down, so it could stand anywhere. <br /> <br /> Probably the best thing about the movie is finally nailed. But for such a bad film, I was not satisfied enough to drown my hatred. <br /> <br /> If your dad is worse than a dry toast in the film, look.
