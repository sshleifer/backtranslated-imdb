<strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Small Max has a great deal of cocaine addiction. The biggest Adam is a doctor. This film suggests that realism can be shown as far as possible. But not with it. This shows that cocaine is entertaining regardless of the situation. Most of the film is Max and its fragmentation paths. Finally, Adam can no longer stress from work and start to use it. <br /> <br /> This movie has almost no levels. <br /> <br /> I had no idea how this movie was run. <br /> <br /> <strong> If Cocaine really did it for you, you do not have rich and low-budget scenes, and the actions of his older brother Adam are terrible. <br /> <br /> To win and get awards, this is not a bud. Do not buy 'Basketball Diary' if you want a clear and true story movie about the extreme world of drugs. <br /> <br /> Try to avoid this movie, but you will enjoy it. Try it out and see for yourself ...
