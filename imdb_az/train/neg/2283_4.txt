And for the lowest classic horror actor Oscar - Dwight Frye goes. Seriously his name should be expressed in the same fear as Carloff, Lugosi and Price, and this film proves it. Her character, Herman, is one of two reasons why I can watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Dwight made a frustrating but terribly wrong behavior that hoped for a bigger role of a movie that caused so little concern. <br /> <br /> Another reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. When I'm in medical profession, I have to give myself a kudos to the expertise of the pseudo-hypochondrine. Although other "medical errors" have been a good example of a good physician physician, he has given a short giggle ... "Continue giving it to him" Unfortunately, these two outstanding performances slowly slow me down in this intolerable attempt. The plot can only be predicted by a few small bends. <br /> <br /> My suggestion - once to see Frye and Eburne at once - but only when waking up and with lots of caffeine.
