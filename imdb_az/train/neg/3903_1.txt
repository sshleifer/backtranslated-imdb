Emma is my favorite Jane Austen novel - Emma gives her a good sense despite her own flaws, so the readers can forgive and love her, and she is warm, fuzzy, romantic, with a warm, familiar, respectable but funny relationship with Mr Knightley. Mr Knightley is a perfect man, and Emma is as close to you as an independent, intelligent, trustworthy woman - only 21 she was convinced that she had grown up her flaws. Who does not want to be Emma? Who does not want to be explained by Mr. Knightley? This version of Emma does not understand what I love about Emma. I even did not manage to watch him. I did not see Emma's warm, generous side, focusing on love for the reader: Sabri and her father's warmth; he and Mrs. Weston are ready to put their friend's happiness on her own (sending Miss Taylors' marriage only to her husband at home). <br /> <br /> Mr. Woodhouse is strangely inaccurate, just strangely, old and running a little bit. <br /> <br /> This adaptation does not stimulate the relationship between Mr. Knightley and Emma. Their relationships are based on mutual respect and love: Mr. Knightley never makes sure that Emma's intelligence and real concern for others never let him. Emma looks at her, though she is hiding in this game and continues to use her decision. The low dressing on the show, completely overstepping the arguments between them, and did not allow the nature of the relationship to describe as I described above. <br /> <br /> Mr. Knightley is also not attractive enough to bring potential tension (or inspiration to any admirers of women) among the potential. <br /> <br /> It's really terrible. Anyone who truly loves Emma's novel will not be able to love him if he did not take it back after leaving me.
