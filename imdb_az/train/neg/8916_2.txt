I rented this DVD, looking for something else. When I saw the headline in my jacket, I could not believe my eyes. I read Yalom's book a year ago and liked it, but in fact I was impressed by Yalom's work. (I'm a clinical psychologist.) Maybe they watched a 30-minute movie and had to leave it. I do not know if I can get more. At the superficial level, the fault sheets, which interpret as others, are simply the best and worry-free and in bad condition. It is important to be serious, but it should be passionate and funny. Lou Salome's description is merely a reptile and brilliant Freud less than a school. I see that the spirit of the book is far too small to date. I hoped that I could recommend this film to students. Instead, I will send them to their book. Imagine that.
