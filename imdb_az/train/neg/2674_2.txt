Someone had the same idea: Let's Misty Mundae, letting Lara Croft's R-rated version, let's shoot two guns at the top without firearms. It was a really good idea. The problem is that people holding it did not have any script or budget to support it. Therefore, we get a "movie" that reaches the average length by replaying most parts (often slow motion) and it looks like it's totally shot inside a garage. Misty Mundae's appeal is still apparent: she has an incredibly sweet and natural gateway to a girl. However, two long-time partners in a lesbian scene shared with their counterparts are no longer in the league. When the "Mummy Raider" is presented as a Youtube video, I appreciate it, but it can not be more than 4/1 for a DVD movie, as it is meant for DVD consumption.
