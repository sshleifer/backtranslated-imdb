The screenwriter tried to recreate the weak Exorcist, but instead of filming, you put a few blogging-loving movies that did not contain any substance. but it is a coup that reflects something that does not care for anyone. When I saw this, I would like to leave the theater, but free movie tickets were expensive, so I had to endure the painful torture that you felt like you did forever. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Some people say that this movie is terrifying in cinemas, because "thoughtful" and "slowly-motionless-inactive" because it was a clever film. The story is pretty clever and thought-provoking. Eat Ledger about a beautiful boy H is a loving interest and a religious disobedient priest? It looks like an insufficient concept. Oh and there are some mumbo jumbo about "sin-eater" (the film will be titled first "guilty"). The concept of the Lame, however, took the "guilty" thing that made the film sad and delusive about how dark and intelligent it was. <br /> <br /> In some of these movies, many of these films are actually similar to each other. If you like horror movies with real depths, you can watch Rosemary's Baby, Tenant, Naked Blood, Society, Cannibal Holocaust, Pin, Exorcist, Omen, or Romero's Dead Trilogy. Silent dialogue is not equal to prospectors, but the main film fans (the same kind of people who think that a ridiculous film like Hulk is a kinematic masterpiece). If you want a merry neuroothing dull horror, you can watch the order. This movie looks like a church roller coaster ride.
