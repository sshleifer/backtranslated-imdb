I'm waiting for this movie for a long time. Especially, Juhi Chawla is in this business, he is a great actress. <br /> <br /> There are six stories in this movie. There's a new concept from Hollywood. That is not a new item. <br /> <br /> Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. She wants to become a celebrity and to be a friend of the journalist to show interest in journalists. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and she claims she is a lover. <br /> <br /> Priyanka Chopra is still a good actress. He bothered me when he screams. Salman khan can not play a comic role. <br /> <br /> <strong> Vinay is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). She is in the mid-age crisis and attracts a very young woman, she forgets what's happening in her life; <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor and Juhi are naturally-born actresses / actresses. They are great. But this story is kind to them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Shield (Akshaye Khanna) intends to marry Gia (Ayesha Takia), but she gets cold feet and blows the cake. <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). Accident and memory loss. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. She meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz), a white woman who is in love with a Hindu woman, but she wants to marry an Indian woman. Raju Staphanini should bring this person to life, but he loves it. <br /> <br /> I never loved Govinda movies. Very exciting, not funny. <br /> <br /> In this movie, I liked it very much, as it has grown in recent years. <br /> <br /> Yes, yes! There's Sohail Khan! Ram Dayal, who is married to Foolwati (Isha Koppikar). <br /> <br /> Sabail khan is not a great actor, but funny! <br /> <br /> Now there is a problem here. All these stories are not interesting. Make a story from six interesting exciting stories is all about exciting! <br /> <br /> Spouses have touched each other, but not important to symbols. <br /> <br /> My result; Priyanka can not move! Leave the women in the Bollywood industry. Sohail Khan should shoot more films, so this role was very small. Salman khan can not play a comic role, but the real serious films. Written as an actor in his life. Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham, have lost their role as the best actresses and actresses. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
