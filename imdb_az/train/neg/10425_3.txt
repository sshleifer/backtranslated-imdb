This movie is great, if you are clever - but it only tells many BAD stories. Stella is quite raw and will not learn better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded. What he learns better. Is this a realist? In any case, Stella is ashamed of her daughter's delicacy and dress, but can not understand that she should taste all this? I do not think so. Stella is a good woman and a very good mother. By giving himself, his daughter can be combined with a bunch of mustache snobs disgusting. Most of the things we see could have been normal times - those with a beer or two could dance using a pianist - but it could have been a kind of moral impoverishment. "My son can not live in this way!" Connect me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me something: Unwashed Labor class can not hope to aspire to Upper Classes heights. And this is just a burden of ants.
