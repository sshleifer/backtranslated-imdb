Let's serve this film as a death sentence since the 1990s. This hand class, known in some circles, such as Kyser Soze Syndrome, was now murdered by M. Night Shayamalan and even Ron Howard also used a variation of a BEAUTIFUL MIND. However, in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known as "Madonna" in some circles) uses the Soze motive in a more obsequious way. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (with a very suspicious hairstyle) stars are known as Jack Green (all are known as "Mr. Green"). Otherwise, maybe Gold Gold is an irrational spirit that can have a human being. I am not very clear, but of course I do not care. REVOLVER is one of the most well-known examples of kinematic dominance I've been experiencing for a long time. Witness to tough time structures, painful jumps, persistent internal monologues, and painful ambitious animation sequences. This "all-in-one and kitchen sink" sedate the style of directing Quentin Tarantino. The smoke and mirrors of the film originally lead me to believe that Ritchie has been compressed as if telling it as I watched it. <br /> <br /> The film is probably filled with single moments of shock, to Mr. Green. I would like to live, I always love Stratham as a character two steps ahead of everyone. Here, though, he struggles as a reader in an English Language Literature class. His foolishness coincides with his lack of limitation by his nemesis, Macha (Ray Liotta). A smorgasbord spoils, cries and smokes through the film, like a man like a starvation, Liotta broomless and leopard print speeds on the embarrassing screen. <br /> <br /> For REVOLVER there is no indisputable quality. This is a mere movie mistake from Ritchie, and may even carry the SWEPT AWAY's legendary reconstruction as its worst movie.
