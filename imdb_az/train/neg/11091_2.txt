Denzel is the only thing that's right in this movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps at one stage it was a better movie at the early stage. Someone decided to cut off some moves and plot at the start of the film and gave the most of the story line in the first 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This, first of all, blends you and then puts you off. Dramatization goes beyond stopping unbelievers. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there is a great sense of injustice and anger that such films can get to the audience. If you are looking for it, you can break it down.
