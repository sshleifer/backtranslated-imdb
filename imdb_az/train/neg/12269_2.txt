<br /> <br /> According to US President Barack Obama, I shoot this movie from the US Hollywood and I think it will be a big hit. Story is interesting and creepy. There is something about the city's edges, courageous police officers, earthquakes, sanitation and mysterious freshwater shortages, enough to be tempting. But this story should have a bit of meaning and will be about 40 minutes shorter. <br /> <br /> I'm the sixth sense in this movie <br /> <br /> It stops that only those who love this film in Japan should not see a horrible film.
