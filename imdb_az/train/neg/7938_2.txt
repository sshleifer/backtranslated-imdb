To get into her father's coffee table, the family facing some old roadside faces an old, curly old strange show run by an eccentric single-eyed man. <br /> <br /> The sixth horror of the Caucasian> Tod-Browning's favorite "Freaks" (1932), ranging from Alex Winter's funny "Freaked" (1993). Both classics (or soon "Freaked"). 'Side Sho', but will never happen. And no classic status. . . well, it will clarify the sad state of our genre. This film was going from a ridiculously bad opening song to a 17 year-old girl whose natural mother was obviously old. The writing was subpar, but it was not completely afraid. . . not just boring. Direction was poor and the effect of a rare heart was terribly unbelievable. The player was terrible and the cast was even worse. Everyone who believes in the age of these two camp ages has not met a young man for a long time. It was far from enough of violence and violence to avoid any other quality. . . and when it was a bit of violence, it did not do a good job. And honestly, I have not seen in any movie, I do not remember the scene of struggles that are one of the worst. Generally, this is a horrible movie that is easily remembered and poorly understood, which is worthy of being at the bottom of the dollar. <br /> <br /> Solution: 2.5 / 10.
