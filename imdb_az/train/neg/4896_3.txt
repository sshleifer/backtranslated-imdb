<br /> <br /> I'll start with what I love. <br /> <br /> I really liked songs, everything about them was great, clothing, music, lyrics (good to translate)), choreography, everything <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> <strong> There are so many things to do. Many silence (lots of excitement, but sometimes really moan), too much boredom (no matter how deep the film is, no matter boring!), Many scenes like porn (I really did get it , there was a porno film, but it really is really a lot) I really think it should be for watching movies and this is a 3 star for poems.
