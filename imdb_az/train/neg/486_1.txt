This flick was a blow to me. Sometimes little girls should be able to do anything but swimsuit models, house-makers, or mistresses, so they're still going to be as described. It's really sad to see an artist's work and his misinterpretation of his life fairly. The whole character of Artemisia and what it stands for is characterized by the character of Hollywood, a woman; there is a perverted, physically impeccable, desperate creature that does not show any of the characteristic features that have really changed its place in history. Sadder saw that much of the audience was studying in the area very badly to understand the incredible gap between the message and the reality delivered in the film. In fact, someone who has been tortured under torture does not justify me to describe myself as a person who is in love with the real aggressor. If there is nothing more important to say that the director should not hesitate to put his story on a real person.
