As you can see, the people behind the box did not worry about watching the so-called "film". They explained "dark choreography intrigue and violence". I saw no "intrigue". Instead, I saw an attempt in dialogue with a supposed kung fu film. I did not see any "violence". At least I did not see anything that could stop me from blasphemy, which could hurt a person with a "advanced" skin - but perhaps I have a very "plot". Additionally, as many of the movies (some of which occasionally appear in the kung fu film), I would say that this piece of paper is unwatchable. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> If I were not blind by choreography.
