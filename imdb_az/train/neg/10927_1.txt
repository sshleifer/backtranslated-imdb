The views were good for this movie, and the expectations were heavenly: huge budget, tons of celebrity faces, a very funny idea and the main actress who loved everyone. The final result is a disaster. Alice Trembling was a magical sign from a tricky journey into the fantasy world, all kinds of failures to entertain the audience (without a single laugh during the whole presentation), one-page slim story line without one spark and one dimensional symbol. The 90 minutes of the movie are sterile in some unusual ways, and some good actors, of course, do their best to come as professionals in a feature that can not seem to be a recurring idea on paper. The 'L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay' is a collage of comedy sketches, with very good ideas. Abstinence or boredom will follow you.
