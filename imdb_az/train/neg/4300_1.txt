Buford Beach Bunnies names B grade grade T & A movies as bad. As an admirer of the genre, I was afraid to make little effort to make use of the talents of young actresses. I particularly appeal to the absence of nudity and artificial sex scenes. What is the next generation of these sad teenagers who want to watch television late last night?
