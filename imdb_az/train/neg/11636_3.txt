I will not waste time writing a single article. Nevertheless, I would say that those who are overly frustrated with this film are also absolutely laughable. Johnnimacbest, you can not play this card and I'm writing a national patriotic card to watch this movie. the director has come to Germany, and every time he watches a camel in his wrist when it reaches a camera, it is a movie (but we played that card) in this country, but the world is full of controversy and the same thing you've heard before the GTA dispute. It's a comedy, laughs and hates, does not hate each other, its dark humor, and of course it's not the heart to get it, it's gone past, yes people lost, it's 7! years ago. You can still watch this movie and have good moral values. <br /> <br /> Of course, am I crazy and in need of the soul?
