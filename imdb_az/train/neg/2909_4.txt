A man following the Tom Hanks for the Irish people sees Jimmy Stewart as an unreliable serial attacker. I had a really hard time accepting it. I did not think Tom would be able to move, so I could look after my lab after the Maze and the Monster, but for some reason it was flat for me. Perhaps, because the film is a failure for me, because of the risk of sounding like a graphic novel and fanboy (such as a lower life form than a fan, a bath). Jude Law and the sixth part of the supplements made me feel cold and a little disappointed. Bonnie and Clyde Mendes were awaiting a great crime movie, we took the whole heart of the story and left nothing but bare bones. There is something like this flick, but cinematography is a breath that fills the screen with a beautiful look. As Paul Newman was as good as usual, I was really honored, but Tom was totally flattering as "angel of death."
