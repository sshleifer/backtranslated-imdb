The good guys at the Webster Library set up Logofoby as a "fear of words." I can be Logofobik. Since no combination of words frightens me as it is at the beginning of the movie, credits include the words "Production, Writing, and Director:" and it's the name of a single person. Think about it. There are carpenters, electricians, and founders, but very few jack-of-all-businesses. The most experienced managers like Speilberg and Scorsese do not even capture such films. But my theater was the words "Brian Helgeland wrote and shot" about the tracking of my report when I was thrown into an explosive creature inside my chair and Nolan Ryan's fastball. Wow! <br /> <br /> I knew Brian Helgild as a filmmaker. As a writer, over the last 10 years, his filmography was ridiculed as a stock market share of dotcom. Critical and Award-winning achievements such as Tritical Unpleasant Events (Assassins, The Postman, Conspiracy Theory) (LA Confidential, Mystic Tea). Did they look like an alternative? a good, bad one, so the last film BloodWork took a breath of knowing it was one of the toughest efforts in Clinton Eastwood's career and hoped the best. In retrospective I'm not extreme. <br /> <br /> Ordering stars are wondering about Bishop, a Roman priest, like Heath Ledger (Helgeland's A Knights Tale), Alex Bernier, a customer known as a Carolingians. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Prophet met Thomas <br /> <br /> Maror Sinclair is a sub-area called Shannyn Sossamon. He fled from an organization as a result of attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism. They have feelings for Alex Mara, and for some reason they are unaware of the audience, they travel together to Rome. <br /> <br /> Nary is a good night's sleep, and Alex, William Eden (Benno FÃ¼rmann), eats a century-old sin. As we have already said, eating a Sin is the eating of the sins of a dead person when it is not a church, and it allows them to enter heaven. Williams, as lucky, is tired of a healing life and is looking for Alex to miss his role and free his secular job. Alex is reluctant, but after Mara's new love Mara dies, Alex is at the Sin Yeyintin ceremony to rescue him and the transformation is completed. My father, Thomas, is looking for answers to many of his many requests, while opening the verdict of the Vatican and the other inspector. <br /> <br /> The order is not a terrible film, but it is very boring. It has nothing to do with funny effects and symbols. Even in the most dramatic scene - Alex, who is dying, dies in a faded and soft manner and leaves us without any emotional responses to the situation of couples. <br /> <br /> Mr. Helgeland, in the middle of this film, straight lines and scented salts could be used to avoid fading. But I'm happy to try it again. Share your vision with others, and help those who are more experienced to give you so narrow minded and non-self-serving areas. Until then, there is nothing to show you that you have more than just a failure. Two stars. <br /> <br />
