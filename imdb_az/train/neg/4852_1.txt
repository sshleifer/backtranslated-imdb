I saw this movie once and I thought about it. Then my colleagues said: "Look again, it is better". I did too. And the surprise for me was WORSE the second time! There is a keyword limit, so I'm gonna collect the ball here. <br /> <br /> The bomb scenes were all so stupid. Why would anyone in the world wait for the explosion to trigger ??? None of the characters here are remotely liked. <br /> <br /> - Whether or not he checks for the last time, a car can not explode in a weapon, nor a big fire. small fire extinguisher ... did 3/10 of the audience really watch the movie? The camera is strange, but I can tell you what happened. <br /> <br /> A few days left to meet me. The McManus Brothers ("The Boondock Saints") looked so foolish. First, why did a man plan a weapon of a man shot? In addition, why does it spend a lot of time in cleaning, reloading, targeting, and shooting bullets when chaos happens often? -SAS survive and fight backwards instead of RUNNING types ?????? Huh ????? Soldiers ... gay ... ??? <br /> <br /> I really liked myself, but I was concentrating on the amount of money I was not so laughable. Bigelow thinks that more action is better. It looks like it's a mistake - the movie is packed with many moving scenes thrown here to avoid the lack of a central area. I know that Watchmen is 163 minutes long, but at least this film has not been shot. On the other hand, this film has been felt for a long time. <br /> <br /> The best thing was to Renner. But give yourself a blessing, just skip it and do not give it consciousness.
