A fashion designer walks around a cat and falls into the pool, hitting his head on something floating on the surface. With very unpleasant effects (this was a television movie), he left his body. The changing orange fog floats with a tunnel of rings, the black figures touch it (they appear in the apartment as mannequins). I thought I was watching the Jess Franco movie ... When her friends revived her, she grabbed a black arm, and she was forced to fight to stay idle. <br /> <br /> After a short while, she slipped into an unusual car rising to the climb behind her, remembering everything and having a bad purple before her. On Halloween, she decides to go with her husband to go to Mexico for a vacation. When he arrived, he was surprised that it was the Day of the Dead. <br /> <br /> The designer is encouraged to join a group of people close to death. All of them encountered the tunnel, but did not escape from black figures or recurring deaths. One of them is very worried. <br /> <br /> A doctor speaks to him who calls him "Walkers" (based on the name of the novel). They were supposed to die for some reason, and died for another reason. <br /> <br /> This was a very long time I looked at a 102-minute video. I can not imagine that there is actually a 192-minute version! <br /> <br /> Some televisions have been watching two or more nights, but better watching than one sitting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Floater had committed suicide: the child was chosen, killing people in revenge. Even the change was pretty much the same: the child was chosen and died, and then people took revenge outside the graveyard. And in fact, there is a common point with this movie that the child is applying astral projection and when it is drowned, it is squeezed out of his body. I do not know how to explain the story of Walkers, one of the dead of the night. <br /> <br /> I understand that there is nothing very similar to the fantasy novels. <br /> <br /> This is a fairly slow movie, and special effects and cinematography are really low budget and TV shortcomings. There are many character players that are easily recognizable here. It also feels too early, early in the 1980s to early 1989. I found him boring. I do not think that a lesser budgetary film, Sole Survivor (1983) (inspired by the 2000's latest target films), covering a similar topic. Far away from the dead of the night.
