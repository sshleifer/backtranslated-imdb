Okay, the story has no meaning, the lack of characters, the best dialogue is not related to the low film quality, it is committed to cinematography and only keeps a smooth mix, but Sam directed Peckinpah film. <br /> <br /> PeckinpahÄ± and this is a disappointment for anyone who appreciates his great work, even if a great player can not use the time that the audience has been minimally involved. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The director, San Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill and even Gig Young were disrespectful of their work, and watch the Great Peckinpah movies.
