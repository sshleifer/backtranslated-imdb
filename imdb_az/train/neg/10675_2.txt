Undoubtedly, when you are listed as incorrect star loans, you are not in a good time (credit is Cuba Gooding, JR). Some nice car tracks, shoot them, and act if you want them, because they are the best and absolutely incredible thing to do. Heroes, especially at the end of Gooding, are worse than motivations, when they are not in despair, they are ineffective. Now you can think that Andy Cheng should be a really nice person to get very good actors in this bad project (he can not have anything on it all).
