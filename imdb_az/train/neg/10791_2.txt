Horrible movie. If you have a Turkish movie, you should not see it in 2006, it should be a bath. When is the time lost? In addition to a few cheap laughs, this movie has nothing to do with it, it's crazy, nil. Dialogue is cheaper and sexual cliches are all these. The guide should watch more movies before heading. Red-headed women show examples of what the actress should not do. If you want to learn not to act, it is a perfect example of bad behavior. The only good thing I can say about the movie is wait, wait and say nothing good. I really did not like to write about it. Jeez!
