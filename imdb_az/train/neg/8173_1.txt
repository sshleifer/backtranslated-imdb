One of the most dull slashers. If so, you can say that. Even if it's completely like a porn movie, I can not watch it. It's really unbearable when you're watching a small group in the forest. For teenagers, such films have been made, so who really did it because they were preparing this dream fest? My favorite part of this film is the art of lid, and this is the only reason I have chosen to look for this movie, part of the Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack .. and when you see these other 50 films, you will realize that it does not belong to anywhere. So if you have a mood for a good slasher in the woods, I suggest just before Dawn and Just Terror.
