Trustworthy! This is one of the worst SRK movies and one of the worst Bollywood movies I've ever seen! I did not like the novel, but this movie became worse! Very bad music, worse actors (apart from the SRK, of course, even if it can not save the movie) and is not very significant. The director makes all this amazing, God knows ... Perhaps he is all very surprised and trying to look valid. <br /> <br /> There are a few hours in the Caucasus, do not watch this movie! (We ask for it!) Wish, you'll find something else to watch!
