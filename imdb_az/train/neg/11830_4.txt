It's probably a little old for this 13-year-old movie, probably like me. About this pampered rat who lives in a palace. Then a sewer mouse puts it in the toilet! She ends up in this rats city and responds to this girl who has a girl who wants a feverish frog. He does something in this ship, which he sends after all these two rats. Take the ship and rush the city plan to move! This is about the cool part of the movie. They make all the sound effects. They read, sounds, make her awesome, and make her pretty funny. OK bottom line, this is designed for 7 year olds. Other wise, see a great movie to see a great family member. I did not really think of WAllace and Gromit as the animation was actually a real dreamworks art. I think they have a little fun on it. The film was worth the effort, though it was worth 9.50 dollars.
