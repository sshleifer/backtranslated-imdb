I thought I'd let it once. Pokemon fans today suffer in America. Why? Because we trust Kids WB and 4Kids Entertainment to provide our favorite albums and movies. If the series goes, they are doing a great job of bringing Japanese entertainment and magic to the television. What is their problem when it comes to movies? Right now, I've seen all Pokemon movies in Japan, and I'll see the fourth one. They are beautiful films. All of them are pleasant and entertaining. And after seeing Pokemon 2000 in theaters, we can help these American producers read Japanese stories. Apparently, they seem to read something and say "great courageous letters" include "empty morality here." <br /> <br /> It looks like it uses the same dubbing methods used in MSB. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, I have to talk about Pikachu's rescue adventure, and my first love did not come up with this story, and the Pokédex story, which caused Pikachu's vacation, no Natsu Yasumi and Pikachu Tankentai did not understand why they did not go to Exeggcute's Tokapi until the end of the story, instead of going through a delicate, feminine voice. It's likely that fans are not just parents, but then they have a theme song, but I could not help but only my eyes The Japanese song was "Tankentai wo Tsukurou" and was performed by Japanese children, and was fun and enjoyable. This one: heartburn. One of my favorite parts is now a dance to Kireihana. Beautiful music, entertaining to watch. Changed with Bellossom. The music sucked for one, but there were all the pokemon conversations during the music, which was nervous, annoying and just unnecessary. Oh, then there are those who think that Poliwhirl is a Poliwrath. Children working with this icon will always learn at least what they are. Basically, with little potential, this little regrettable dubby could not save. <br /> <br /> When I received the Nintendo Power issue, the warning signs would be clear to me. For some unfounded reasons, I had some faith in the 4Kids and the WB. My thoughts were good, they enjoyed the first movie, but the second topic differs according to the topic, so they should do good. Nintendo Power says, "Probably, the trailers do not pay attention to the warnings I've come across in the theater, and I hope that this will not turn into a moral conquest, like MSB at the end of the English version, <br /> <br /> It's a big mistake. <br /> <br /> It's a big mistake. <br /> <br /> It's a big mistake. When I was sitting, I was really curious about stomach cramps that watched a movie in Japan, and I heard explanations saying that it was good because it was morally thinner, and we can see a point that they did not duplicate it and repeatedly repeated it in the MSB. But in this movie d First, the legend we are reading is a bit read: "The world is turning into Ash." Ahhhh, Ash was chosen, no matter what. In the Japanese version, Archicus residents needed a Pokemon trainer to perform their traditional ceremonies. This time he was chosen. Lugia was a bigger loss. Lugia was one of the best-selling characters of the movie Pokémon ... the movie was about Lugia. In this case Lugia Ash is forced to take the back seat. At the scene where they returned to their motherland, Lugia and Ash discuss the terms of Luggin's existence, and Ash makes all the difference. <br /> <br /> In this category, Ash was not really a different "man" because he was a great helper on the way. <br /> <br /> Many other things,. Furura's flute song is sweet and sweet as in Japan. He said Jirarudan started his collection with "Mew card"? Ugh. Even worse, Misty's anger was initially a concern that Moltres and Zapdos had been captured. Why did not you put Pokéballs when you held them? It draws you to show them. "The Pokemon, which is very different from thinking about it, is a collection of seals, so if you have a real redeeming value, it's coming from Team Rocket, some pretty comical lines, not really laughing at me, but more giggle and pain in the stomach it's the last American poker movie I've officially seen, and I imported a third one and I'm very pleased that I would not want to see another Japanese movie as the first two, and I'll import it to the fourth. WB and 4Kids: You left me last time.
