I only regret this movie because it tries to be valuable. I am proud of a great movie and I'm not biased against the "men" movies. Legally blond was a beautiful movie. On the other hand, the Rule of Georgia was the worst-case scenario, weak, poorly written, and unscientific. Until the end of the film, I was not interested in anyone's lie or that something was resolved. <br /> <br /> The most important thing in the film is a good HIKAYA. This story is weak and will never develop (because the story is deep, the story is not good). A good story is dynamic. A dynamic character is a major change in character and it depends on the change throughout the movie. Rule in Georgia, character changes were sharp and uneven. Secondly, there were many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. It's a hard job to get a really good dynamic character and it takes time (just a few hours in a movie). Almost practiced dynamic characters will pay less attention to personal change. Even though I have never seen a weak story and poor dynamic characters, I can not say I liked everyone. Each character was a mess. When you create a beautiful comedy, it's better to write America's beauty. Georgia was a terrible mother, her daughter was a terrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a terrible pretext for someone (no one has denied her dignity, because everyone is condescending and we are responsible for our actions). "Dudley Do Right" The Mormon boy had to have the courage to disobey his religious and commitment ... and Simon, I'm serious about what kind of man was abducted to a 17-year-old girl by a single actor or a politician. If you want to remind yourself that this film is not a good movie structure, it's worth watching!
