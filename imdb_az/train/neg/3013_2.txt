Starting with long-term launch shooting at the China factory, Manufactured Landscapes seeks to exert a destructive effect on industrialization and traditional societies. His droning thinks that industrial development in China and elsewhere is not a revolution in any industrial revolution in Europe or America, and that Karl Marx has never visited any British museum. So far, the Asian driver may have a connection with industrialization and wealth, and never before mentioned hunger and terror were ever mentioned. <br /> At the same time there is an effort to present Edvard Burty≈Ñski's photographs. industrial wastes are somehow "beautiful". Most of the film is a slide show of these pictures. They were well-prepared, the size of the museum and a few exhibitions. But for me, it can look good if only one photo is well presented. Industry wastes are still industrial waste. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> and presents a bitter despair. As a two-hour lesson by Noam Chomsky. Perhaps the US (and Canadian) is worth the show as it is wrong with the Left.
