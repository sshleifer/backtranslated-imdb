I give this movie ONE because it's a really horrible movie. DVD's sound trail is very bad, in fact it hurts my ears. But the vision, though different, shows something really fancy in Italian society. In fact, I will not look at something shocking, but the different events are completely unusual. So, for a small value, I can give it to each other. Otherwise, it's not simply a standard for people who love video, photography, actors / actresses, and people who love foreign movies. The main character, Rosta, has a full range of emotions, but exaggerated by the point of being incredible. Most of the children in the film are 3/4 and they are genuine and the film tells about the life of Italy.
