Jack Frost is not a hot-hearted family movie about a father coming back from the dead as no child, a snowman. Some acidic fluid is morphed on a sadistic assassin called Jack Frost, and a killer snowman. Since I take a copy of this movie, I like to go back and laugh. Killer snowman? Yes, it sounds like the perfect comedy / horror movie! <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> one night and a government tanker carrying a new DNA fluid. Jack runs to kill by the acid and morphs he just made a murderer snowman. He returned to the small town of Snowmonton, which was captured by the Sheriff for a short time. Here he is now ready to kill again as a snowman with cold forces. It can be mixed with water, strikes the ice age, and develops killer teeth. The only question is, who can stop frost? This movie is under the typical B-Movie line. Movies start from cheese, but when burned by Jack acid, it quickly falls under the cheese limit and becomes flat. It's very horrible to act for someone! There are a whole lot of actors here that can not move, move, but do not have a meaningless character or for a few extra dollars. Only Scott MacDonald is a good actor Jackni. It looks like young Richard Kiel, who unites with Frankenstein. Unfortunately, his appearance is only reduced to three minutes and we are seeing all the new snowman forms and wise creek. Moreover, his minds are funny. <br /> <br /> His wife, there are so many killer throughout history. A killer in a hockey mask, a killer with a racer gloves, a chain clever moron, a quick St. Bernard, but now we stoop for a mixed killer snow man? Come on! And the way the symbols are applied is terrible. First, I wanted Jack to kill his sheriff son, so he could give his father an antifreeze, so he would not be frozen. All the characters are silent and meaningless, and deaths are animated films. <br /> <br /> A woman with Christmas lights drowned and her head crashed into a decoration box, and a girl died in the shower (the place where she had been in this stage). <br /> <br /> This horrific film is a special effect. The first great special effect we have is Jackin DNA, which is involved in snow and snow. Probably this 60th art design model looks like PU! Jack also looks fake. Rubber snow looks like a man with a skin covered. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I thought I would be happy, but not! It does not try to be funny and actually tries to be scary. Jack Frost reaches 10 to 4, at least it made me laugh at this horror. Do not even worry about this trash can. Jack Frost = D +
