The story behind LOST MISSILE is not bad at all, but, unfortunately, the story is a little boring in the middle, and poor special effects, as well as stage scenes, submerge this movie into a sub-par level. /> <br /> The film begins with a rocket launcher. When it comes to hitting the ground because it's in a panic, the Soviets manage to bend the object. This is definitely not good, but it has a trail of a ship that destroys everything in the way of an unprecedented unmanned artist and that the ship is now in a low orbit of the planet. In other words, with every passage, after a death - one who can potentially kill us! So, we can keep us on the flight to the best US scholars (very young and challenging, Robert Loggia), and especially to New York, to plan and rescue us! Unfortunately, they will not be able to save Ottawa (I have never been there, so I can not say whether there is a great loss), but because of the good old American knowledge they can destroy the warrior! <br /> <br /> So, as you can see, the idea of ​​the story is not bad and is not genuine. However, many older clips of warplanes and children surrounding radar fields are a bit old and look like padding. Generally, a film that looks like extreme fans of the genre is a worthwhile, yet challenging, inspirational film - all at the risk of it.
