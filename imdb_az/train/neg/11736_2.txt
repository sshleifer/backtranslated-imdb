A week before Iowa, I saw an ambitious student taking a movie and was unable to decide whether they wanted art or violence. It can be a movie prepared by Iowa. In Iowa, we can see elements of films that are better - Spun and Naturally-born Killers. Nevertheless, along with artillery, these films were also characterized by good character development and related stories. Iowa. This movie is an unfortunate ending. I have to admit that I agree with that. This movie is bad from start to finish and is not worse or better in any part. The actors did their best. Roseanna is better than Arquette. He demonstrates that he is very talented, very funny and very sexy. But why should he show this ball on the ball?
