In the same title, Michael Keaton kiddie comedy in 1998, was definitely sentenced for heart, special effects, but in comparison to what Screaming Mad George did for this frightening comedy, they were choking a positive mind. The killer snowman is made of strofoam and the guns appear as big oven mites. Probably they were. The city's physician is particularly memorable in a small but exciting role, but other (worse) movies and Paul Keithin remain in this parody.
