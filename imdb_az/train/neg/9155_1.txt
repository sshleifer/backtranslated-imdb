This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was like a "homework" for the movie class. When the TRYING message is sent, the sign disappears completely. The characters are exaggerated, pessimistic and have come to a field ... it's ridiculous. The stroke of the lid thought that I could have a decent film, co-actor handsome and in this regard. The Moral Of This Movie: EVERYTHING AGAINST THIS THEME! Save your time, money, and energy, and create your own home movie and you're better off than me. It was painful to watch, and I'm surprised that everyone would spend the money to do and spread!
