Seeing all negative thoughts for this movie, I thought it would be another comedy that was not entirely intended. I watched the first two scenes of battle, listened to a terrific general dialogue by Lungren and other Eastern actors, and I saw the movie very scary. Then, when Brandon Lee gets into this story and starts flying into a liners, the plot falls, writers of script begin to drink and welcome, even though the movie turns into the most enjoyable movie EVER. <br /> <br /> Together with Lungren, "Wild" and others, Van Damm's films, Seagal films, and Stallone's non-Rocky films have denied this. This film is one of the worst in this film (see if Tia Carrere's face is on any scene with Dolph), with the worst dialogue (Brandon Lee's worst trail in a film about Dolph). and the worst outfit in the movie (Dolph is fully dressed in Japanese). "Tango and Cash" is facing "Commando" in an hour and fifteen-minute joke film, "Friday 13" (ignorant nudity and Lungren's performance, much like Jason Voorhees). <br /> <br /> Good (not horrific) performances tell the bad man (still looks full of performance) and Carrere (somehow 5 lines without laughing in some way). <br /> <br /> Brendon Lee is just Lungren's sidekick and this is a really terrible job. <br /> <br /> A horrible, horrible movie. Do not be afraid and pull it. But watch out for yourself, since the underwater shots are twice as subtle as the underwater shots. When talking about underwater shooting, look at the barefoot battlefield after the worst battle-scene ends. <br /> <br /> In this film there are every version of the bad fight scene for those who have short spots and nudity burns. <br /> <br /> A BAD BAD FIL !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
