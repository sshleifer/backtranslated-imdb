... and this is a movie. Imagine if there is a negative future life, the damned spirits are associated with a very worryful divan, and are forced to watch this movie for a whole period of eternity. Of course, maybe not bad, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen next to Manos, Hands, ... I've seen so many bad movies, I believe in you. <br /> <br /> This is just a fragile B movie, the worst movie (or the worst?) is the moronic duality relief that comedy for the really unpleasant thing about this movie. Now, a little comedy is a good thing, but most of the film focuses on the adventures of these two morons, not for the "heroes" of this film, but for those who are less of them than these films! <br /> <br /> To be fair, Crown International is actually adding bad music and destroying the movie by editing a poor job. But honestly, this was probably a bad movie for beginner, so the Crown really did not hurt much. <br /> <br /> This should really be the bottom 100 list. I wish this to my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> In fact, this is my B-movie. It was bad, but despite the star rating I still liked it.
