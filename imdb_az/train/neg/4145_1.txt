Okay, I was watching this movie twice, and I studied it heavily in the white, and I asked several people's opinions. Even in the film, I actually read Sheridan Lafanu's Classical "Carmilla" book. I feel that it's best to look at this movie in a game to play while watching it. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in one of the castles in Siberia and lives with her father, De Lafontaine. They live happily and peacefully. One day, they received a letter from the "Girl" from a man who had revenge for his daughter's murder. He claims the supernatural powers he is working on and explains that he will soon visit them. Meanwhile, the chance to deal with a strange woman has resulted in Lafontaines who have been searching for Carmilla for several months. Soon, Laura begins to drown in strange dreams and begins to fall into a strange disease. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "I have invented this game, There is even a charming name and it would be a mad, but I can not worry about it. <br /> <br /> <strong> "This movie does not make any sense" is called the game. <br /> <br /> Do not know if you are watching the movie, try to go to a full field that tells you what happened. <br /> <br /> Why vampires can travel throughout the day? <br /> <br /> Why are there all the lesbians? <br /> <br /> Why does a girl say Bob? <br /> <br /> Why do zombies who are killing look like an accepted part of life? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why Travis Fontaine did not slow down while flew his car and fled to the zombie, but when he faced a woman with an open colony on the back <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why the head vampire suddenly Does she start to dress like her sister? <br /> <br /> Why is there no vampire? Zombie? <br /> <br /> What is the importance of the necklace? what is it prepared? Why kills vampires? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vampires vs Zombies there was no place, but here was a pretty good effort. <br /> <br /> In fact there are vampires fighting with the Zombies. Everyone in the movie knows exactly what is happening, but it seems very reluctant to comment on the subject. And in some ways it is based on the 19th-century classic horror novel. How? Why? What is hell?
