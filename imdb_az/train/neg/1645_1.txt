I watched this movie last night and wanted to alert everyone who wants to see this movie. In a word - do not. The scriptwriter is something written by Quentin Tarantino / Eddie Murphy, that is, every word is full of cursing. As with the "Good Will Hunting", I'm not too careful to worry, it helps to focus more on the characters. This came from the audience with an attempt to blow or laugh. The three symbols of the lead are all a little bit sharp in their unique stereotypes, wall-stroke, coffeehouse and the "Me-Not-Gay-Just-In-Touch-My-Feminine-Side". Do not come to any curse on them. They are all indifferent, indifferent victims who want to lose. For those who dare, there are some funny moments in this movie, the very first and last. The toilet / vibrator scene is funny by the patient, "Uh, yeah". Indeed, I would only recommend this film to my worst enemy.
