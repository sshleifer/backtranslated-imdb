John Huston's wise blood was a fierce mistake that I could imagine in Flannery O'Connor's book. This is a film rebellion in my speech (and "You made it perfect"!), Which is a terrifying performance on music that is more appropriate to the Rockford Files episode. At first I did not see it with any bad attitude and I was actually looking forward to a good experience. But it's unusual for the southern heroes to ridicule the ridiculous southern shooting of the lil'ts and their beliefs accidentally. Until the end of the world, which was totally deprived of any character, O'Connor's book was shining and resonating everywhere. The actors reflecting the "South" police are eating outdated hot dogs on NYC streets and referring to the phrase "Godfather". Ned Beatty's performance was a live and dead description of Hoover Shoates, a preacher of the Church of Christendom, who was a listener and a businessman looking for dollars. O'Connor's mighty book is very well-known for its creepy, religious deficiency, and shatter the seemingly endless faith of Faith. Mr. Huston's film is an embarrassing mask of the writer's intentions, as I understand the vast majority of me and his fans, so I can be brave. Although you accept that I do not know exactly what the author wants to preach, there is enough love to make him and his works an admirer. Dear Huston, if I had seen the Wonderful Blood, he threw it away. For Flannery and for me, forgive you, John Huston. Remember ... it will take a while.
