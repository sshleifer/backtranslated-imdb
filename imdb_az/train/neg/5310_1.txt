I do not know what other reviews are talking about. This is not necessarily a bimbo movie, but in fact, I do not think it's a decent-looking girl. No, it's just cheesy and poor, Ed Wood is a scientific shock. And bad. I can not even tell you how bad it is. I saw cables at night and was shocked. The release of this film is an insult to all of us. Actors were either producer or mentally delayed, the special effects were a joke, and the pace was insanely slow. Despite all of this, music prefers all these. A monkey can record a better topic with the toy xylophone. Do not rent this, but if you see it on the cable, look. You will be surprised how bad a movie will be.
