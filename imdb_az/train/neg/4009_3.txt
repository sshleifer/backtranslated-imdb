Man, I really find it hard to believe that Alan Alan was something with this mess. Upon seeing the first two episodes so far, I can say that I'm sure this show will be on the list I need to see. <br /> <br /> <strong> Like character Sookie, led by Anna Paquin, it's just terrible. I remember many things that I see better, perhaps writing. It is not really entertaining to look at or look, it's ugly that there are moments to be honest. The actor who plays Bill's is only better if his character is nothing but a tree and a lie. Other actors do their best, but it's hard work with clich√© symbols that are hard to accentuate. Tara is an absolute punishment to watch, Rutina Wesley definitely emphasizes. It resembles nails on an airplane. Almost Nelson Ellis is a terrible thing, and it's hard to understand how sometimes it is talking. Both his character and Tara seem to me a little racist. I do not know why, in a HBO with a character, "why" I say that is not a wire, but a bit strange. <br /> <br /> Sookie's doddering grandmother is part of a ghostly cast of his sex-addicted brother and William Sanderson as a sheriff. <br /> <br /> This story, at this point, has no real concern about the target audience. Dark Shadow-sy romance products. From this point of view, it raises the camp factor to something like the old Dark Shadows episodes. Sometimes it seemed strange for me that I should just assume that it was intended. Unlike Buffy, he did not skimp on the camp skillfully. The naked eye is the extreme eye and graphic sex of the show. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> As with many other HBO demonstrations, I am not against these two after good deeds, but here at least, rough sex scenes stem from Jason Stackhouse and remain above the top. /> I liked the order of the opening title about the only nice thing that really could really think about this confusion. HBO has failed a couple of times with their recent chances, hoping they will cancel it after the first season and try to get something better in the air.
