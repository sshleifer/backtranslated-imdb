Ulli Lommel's 'The Boogey Man' film produced in 1980 is not a classic, but an eye-catching low-budget bell. Subsequently, in 1983, 'Boogey Man II' eventually resulted in a loss of time, but at least a little less serious when it is fun. Now I left the door open for a second time and I did not think that at least one of them would see. One day, while I was watching videos in a shopping mall, I was in a movie called "Boogey Man's Return". I knew it was happy to earn a couple of dollars for previous movies ... I should get to know better. Although the opening title is "Boogey Man 3", it's not the sequel to these two superficial films I mentioned above. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is a laugh. Is there anything good about this cow tree? Let's see ... it's images from the Boogey Man and hope ... It's short of mercy. Yes, that's it. <br /> <br /> Uses: What to start? Decisions, Decisions. Above all, this film is a common hole. It goes from one scene without anything interesting and scary. The player is the best. "Actors" are probably the most probable friends of the director, who had no experience before, and possibly none of them. The field is not available and the article is written in writing. This direction is simply horrible. The director tries to move around the camera, trembling with the lights, and trying to make filters look all the excitement of the movie but does not add anything. It's hard and hard to hear music tracks. Original gardens are botched. Suzanne's love character is Natalie, Lacey was chosen! And the events described at the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978. Moreover, if this happens at 3, why not know what happened in the II? Finally, this does not add anything new or exciting to the series or genre. <br /> <br /> Recent ideas: People who are behind this time and money are to be ashamed of themselves. This is something the film's first film and if it were an original movie. Instead, it should have been a continuation of a movie without a masterpiece, but it's more interesting and fun. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> My rating: 1/5
