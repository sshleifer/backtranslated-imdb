I did not see such an incredible rating in the IMDb, but I went to see it because I was a fan of the Bible related material. The first thing that bothered me was the Indiana Jones wannabe movie, but did not see Jones movies like Casper Van Dien (but he should). I believe he did his best, but the script just stunk. The music worked well in the style of Jones. Great job, but it seemed like a great job for such a movie, it was not worthy of all the great music as part of a video. Robert Wagner gave his best player ability, did a good job, but in a way the script brought everything down. "Jokes" is an old school, somewhere 20 years old; They only brought a smile on my face. There are some really bad camera angels, SFX looks at home and non-real. Kevin VanHook was probably a good idea about the story (in my opinion, but I like these stories), but things just did not work at the end. Maybe you should put your head again on a piece of paper. When I saw that this movie was one of the "low-budget movies", I hoped to at least "hear" a good story, but sometimes the movies were just ghosting.
