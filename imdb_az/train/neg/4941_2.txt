I really did not see the first 50 of my Geico ads, and even found them a little cheerful and fun, but it's serious! Are these people the best of all? This show works! It's so soft and like watching the episode "Bureau" with a hidden character like a caveman (I know many will hate me, but "Office" does not do it to me). Okay, I'm getting it: we're trying to keep our nose clean and have an unhappy cartridge that hates her. psycho-intellect that really has only a working intelligence; and just dopey, who does not want to be accepted, but WHAT! I've worked with these people and found them to be in my life as I did on television ... Why would I want to spend the weekend week 1/336 more than this kind of thing? Please call your parents and ask them if you've been thinking about it, so you can overcome it by believing it's fun.
