Seriously, I love these old movies and their simplicity, but for the first time last night I watched and easily entered the sixth time of all times. Should it be about love story or zombies? This film was so bad that I can do after the end of mercy, how laugh it would be if it were so ridiculous. Thankfully, I'm not too sure to open a movie without seeing anything, or I can not be proud to follow this one at a meeting! I think I can say something positive about my life, so I will accept the most positive thing in this film, and it's too short for a full length movie.
