I gave Timecop a perfect 10, this is 1 <br /> This story is very boring and has nothing to do with the original Timecop. He scraped up many things from Timecop and instead put new stupid things. This story is held in 2060 (though I remember it properly), but for some reason timetraveling is more dangerous: mixed: And the scene of the action is nothing to be happy, most of them ... only the first one ... and many activities There are no scenes, and all are pretty short. At some point in the story, the main character travels about five times in a matter of minutes ... do not expect anything, twice ... <br /> In short, it's not worth spending time watching this movie
