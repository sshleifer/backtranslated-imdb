Shock! <br /> <br /> In 1965, I saw Juri Gagarin alive. She was sincere, surprising and kind, she was comfortable and looked like a well educated and intellectual person. I saw a clown in this movie! Actor looks like dummy with impressive gestures and mimicry. It made an animated! The real Gagarin was someone else! Do not believe in this movie! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in movies like "Fire of Taming" and "Apollo 13" and Chertok and Korolev: "Wonders", "Rockets and People" and Facts. <br /> <br /> The film is a tedious display of well-known historical truths in Russia. <br /> <br /> <strong> Shooting of Space Race is very interesting. There are not many interesting facts about space projects. Some facts and data have been incorrectly erased. For example, in 1945, Korolev was already a prisoner (released in 1944) and in 1940 was no longer in prison in Kolyma, but in a special prison design office. Corolev was designer of the prison design bureau and did not bury the dead prisoners. But in the film, Korolev worked as a hero since 1940 (there is a shoulder strap on the jail). IMHO, the authors of the film, have no deep knowledge of this part of history, and they can not make exciting films.
