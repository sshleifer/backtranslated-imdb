I liked the beginning of this movie, but it caused me to hunt for it, but soon I find that the problem I encountered will occur in the first 20-30 minutes (couples will go behind the mirror and there is no real twist good), but the final imagination does not even have a big meaning (as is the film with uncertainty and fear, if it's a bad idol on the edge of the mirror?) <br /> Undoubtedly, the mirror scene was the first to appear and robbery was also terribly creepy, but in the end a movie or a more attractive article was found in the search for a film, the atmosphere of the atmosphere and the fact that it was not really cut off for 80-90 minutes on a scary sound design.
