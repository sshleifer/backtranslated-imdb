What is an insult to Olivia D'Abo because the protagonist of the film, Robin, Keanu Reeves appears to be so great in the film's boxing art (and at least in recent times, just to look Reeves in the box)? he was a star. I understand that, after having forgotten it for a long time, School will sell it privately, but at least it will give women some credit. <br /> <br /> However, this should be one of the worst teenage sport themed movies I've ever seen, and it just works hard to add just about any teenage and sports movie clips to classroom fights. teenagers gymnasts young romantic. As Flashdance's amateur alternative, we are trying to deliver ourselves (with music in one of the warehouse dance scenes, or even the famous "Maniac" by Michael Sembello, popular for Flashdance)? Composer dances and competitors talking about the competition and sports traditions among composers' competitors and competitors are skeptical about the team's successes and abilities. We did it at Trashin (a vert ramp joust) and Rad (dance in BMX dancing, though not for competition, but for fun). In fact, this film is packed with an unreal, terribly full of fear, like a homo erotic rolling on Robin's team-friendly Liberation Army dress. <br /> Nevertheless, a young girl coming from a very weak background about the film. Perhaps he lives with the sick mother, his depressed sister, and his careless (and somewhat offensive) stepfather to overcome a massive need to squeeze out the audience as far as possible. Of course, homelife is not so attractive. Add a talent for a mixed, gymnastic, but add a few obstacles to joining the team (including his arrogant, delicate teammates and coaches, including a coach who is in doubt as to its superior competitiveness). And of course, he can not forget that he has no eyes for one of the nice guy preppies who are acquainted with one of his humble teammates, nor can he forget to have a steady boyfriend (though Keannu Tommy is later included in the picture). Is this child more miserable? <br /> <br /> Therefore, a mess of success is coming to embarrass itself in long painful, unnecessary, and clich√© quest to prove to everyone worth it. <br /> <br /> However, it is not difficult to note that the movie is the biggest disgrace to this film, a terrifying player and dialogue. (I like how the gym coaches seem to be in the middle of the dance floor to shoot dance fans). <br /> <br /> Imagine finding and watching this movie, especially for those who can, for the most part, today, because it's a nostalgic factor. You can be glad to do this, but it's an incredible compulsory drama. So Caveat Emptour.
