It's hard to believe that Henry Fool is the sequel. It is difficult to believe that the same filmmaker and actors have been involved in both films. Henry Fool is updated, witty, funny though, Fay Grim is slow, boring and does not go anywhere. Where did the mind go? <br /> <br /> For over 10 years, since Henry Fool has seen, most of his dialog boxes and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fay Grim is painful to watch. This is not the fault of the good (Parker Posey) or the great (Jeff Goldblum) actors - responsibility lies completely with evidence, dialogue, and even shootings (low budget excuse). A great disappointment. <br /> <br /> I'm not sorry, I could not pay attention to the plot, I was very bored, so I was disappointed ... If you talk about using Henry Fool more ... the two films are completely <br /> /> <br /> <strong> </ font> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now with Henry Taliban in some sort of prison? !!
