I love this movie as a kid, but when I see it again after 20+ years, it really sucks. It could have been the beginning of the Academy in the 1980s, but today there is nothing to offer! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes are better than today's cooking. There is no T & A. <br /> <br /> Some time ago there was no joke except for the DVDs we had heard many times over. <br /> <br /> I was reminded to buy DVDs recently. Yes, I'm out of the way! The soundtrack was only 2-3 well-known hits (others did not compile a smash record) and often sound-overs were terrible. The only thing I was interested in was that the lines of the character were what they said before. Yep, I've been watching this movie long ago! <br /> <br /> One reason I wrote this article is to give me two cents for why this movie should not be forgotten. :(
