I believe that Joe Don Baker will do something for something. It was very good to start with the concept of the film. There are so many bad things in this movie, and I do not know where to start. The player is strange. Cinematography is at least marginal. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is very scary. There is one reason why this film is understood in Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I write and I do not believe 9 people think this "movie" is beautiful. They should love two go-go dancers. Wichita's stinker on the film was blocked and it would be the last justice ever to see anyone again! 1 out of 10 rating is better than it deserves.
