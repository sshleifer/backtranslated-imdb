My expectations for this movie, which made an effort to earn cash on the Hostel / Saw buzz was down (really downstairs!) And it was still disappointing at every level. Acting is not so bad, not even funny, but a cunning line and only fear that I was watching it spent 1 minute and 21 minutes! I was surprised to note that 34 people rated a 10-star rating. I can only doubt that 33 of them Cast and Team. 34. Perhaps the director's mother? - but sure, it would be difficult to go higher than 2! DVD attachments create one-hour "features". What kind of question arises, "Why?" (although it serves to show what you do not do!). Avoid all costs.
