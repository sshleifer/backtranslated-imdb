With an exciting premise of the Dissapointing action movie: the young Mafia killer (Chandler) needs to show his boss that he is a good man for a service, so a professional Killer, a famous Killer in California, Beluschi). The first and most important task is to kill a young woman (Lee), all of which is strange. But is there an easy target? The film is based on this basic idea, but the result is only bad routine; Even the stranger does not save the movie. Good performance by Chandler. I give it 4 (four).
