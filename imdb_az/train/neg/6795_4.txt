Comeback begins to appear promising with a ghostly death scene by a killer mask. The mask itself is also very cool and looks like one used in the 1990s film Nenne. Since then, the film is mostly boring. We get a little more death, which is good, but it's enough. The cause of death is very good, because it is bare and bloody. The story behind the movie is really interesting, and it would be good if it were not for the most part. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to be dependent on someone you are an immortal collector - it's not enough to make a middle slasher flick.
