I did not like this movie very much. It was not really funny, and in some cases it was just a clear idiot. Rob Schneider is an absolutely talented individual and when his player was good, he just seemed to be a real waste for him. Perhaps there were some parts that were somewhat humorous in a good and beautiful way, but that's about it. The only thing that actually attracted my attention was the fact that it was very beautiful women and that it was nothing more than just watching a movie, but in this case there was only one nook and even the smallest payment event. <br /> <br /> The last question: Theaters: So glad I did not earn a lot of money. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;">
