The film had some disadvantages. Perhaps it is my taste. The writer / director heartily tried to make us feel the inner conflict of the ALL characters. Once, not several times, all the time. <br /> <br /> Not a movie, it's a television business. <br /> <br /> The location of the train station was well chosen and I was very pleased with Sascha Horler's pregnancy as a pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I just realized that Justine Clarke's performance could come to an end. The director's reaction to the things that are being exposed to violence is similar to that of the filmmaker trying to sound the subject of the film with the words of the protagonist. I also do not believe that the director can make an amazing contribution to the wonderful Daniela Farinacci. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the clash of pop music in all sequences. In particular, pop music is a lazy device where a movie is filmed from a diet or emotionally disturbed by the lyrics. <br /> <br /> So, the Australian warmth and authenticity have a chic quality about a film that looks like a local affair. Creates a warmth and sun atmosphere. Especially with the use of beautiful animation sequences that are full of passion and hand-made charm, full of savagery. <br /> <br /> I am interested in why the dialogue works so well. "Who knows, there is a God, what will we do like a boy sitting in heaven" or whatever the line. <br /> <br /> Probably one of the more embarrassing moments when she returned home with a group of relatives from her home saying to her husband, "I have not smoked it." <br /> <br /> A non-smoker trade? TAC ad with a tasteful animation? I had to leave the movie in a 50-minute classroom - it was a lot.
