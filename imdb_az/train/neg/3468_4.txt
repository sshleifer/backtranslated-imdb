A student film director, B grade grade actress (delectably diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!), To finish a horror film called his mother (terribly boring Kylie Minogue!) Said he was 12 years old. Any Aussie horror fan is, at least, an area of ​​interest, as it knows that the women's leaders of the genre are unfortunately unlucky. There is a curse on the film because Molly should kill some psychological killer on the original set. But he must disclose it because he came back. Unfortunately, there is still a curse and people begin to die on the "set". Cut is the attempt of Aussie in modern "slasher", but unfortunately, it does not bring anything new and interesting. In fact, half of Wes Craven's 90s filmography is destroyed. Many movie-world titles like "Scream" (except for Aussie's dropping - Jane Campion ... how funny it is) and many "New Grief" with "It's a Reality or This is a Movie". Correction is bad, music is nervous, the effects are laugh, almost everything is bad about it. Fortunately, there may be a sense of humor in the film: a well-dressed girl in a movie shoot tells the owner of the house where she is filming: "Do not ask your home that it was your home, it was ours." "This does not mean anything to me, you seem to live! "Yes! And Molly's ridiculous liner was enough to not regret this rental. "Do you have any diet kinks here?" (walking on a film's professor's car) and "Is anyone aware that I can get any tofu?" (first of all, confusion on the set) and "Where is my hell?" (oh wait, I think for her.)
