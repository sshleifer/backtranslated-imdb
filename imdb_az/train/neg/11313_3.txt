<br /> <br /> A few years later, Sibberberg had done a great deal on that subject (with a little help from Wagner). <br /> <br /> Maybe this is a film that has been played on a smaller soundtrack without comparing it with the Siberian movie, so be surprised. In fact, do I remember that there are currently horses in the cyberberry movie? <br /> <br /> As far as I know, the German version is pure magic, and it looks like some college production, documented in the film for archival purposes. <br /> <br /> music ... la musique ... is not even considered a credit here about IMDb ... but someone is based on "12-14 centuries" or something ... great help to good film not inauthentic and cheesy, comme le danmage mon cher <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For Ã‡utzpah, but ... For this movie, more coins needed more dollars. CHEAPO does not seem to be a medieval manuscript seen! BON MARCHE !! oh and yeah, just ending up very arbitrarily by going to the Parsifal church and interjecting this cheesy passion game ... blah!
