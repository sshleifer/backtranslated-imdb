When Mary saw Louise Parker filming this epic novel, she was interested in me. If he was an admirer of the book, he was playing Tony, Roz or Charis, but much more, I was wondering how to turn this head-y, almost psychological (but psychological trilogy) novel to a film available for those who did not read the novel, but at least moderate. The book is a complex reflection of society, women, and modern life, and I was eager to see how it used three different narratives that led to the story's creation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and you can think of changing the protagonist from the 3 women to an unchanged old police station, to be in the story without a true motive? Roz made it easy for Tony and Charis to get acquainted with Zenia and use this boy because they are stuck with a large portion of the book. Nevertheless, the story was mooddied and cut off everything that was beautiful about this character, although there was no one to communicate with the audience. In the film these women are not men, but characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zenia, They attempted to prepare the Law and Order or CSI episodes of this complex book. <br /> <br /> It turns out that Mary Louise Parker played Zenia, and that was wrong. Zenia Catherine Zeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie or even a Scarlett Johnasson type. She is a woman who does not love men and women are a woman who is interested and threatened by women, but "keep your enemies closer". And even closer, it is completely original and reliable, even though you are better guided. <br /> <br /> In the film, even if he won, he still is still beautiful and still rich, and there are always people there. He did not take Zenia Charis's man (a blonde American draft draft used Charis first), but instead of taking August, she tried to be a legitimate guardian (and, apparently, she was the rest of the Leicester lover), kissing in a coffee shop). Zenia killed chickens before leaving for August, but did not make any sense because all the structures were removed. Everyone who wrote the screenplay kept the books in the stands to provide the people we read, but I think that if I did not read books, I would have to film all the films, if I had been worried about staying with him. <br /> <br /> Roz's husband died after coming to Zenia's painting (Zenia Roz's job and his life was strange, so Roz hated her) and she decided to kill Zenia Roz's years and years. And, according to Tony and the West, they are forever ... Even Zenia and the West (in the book) are painted in black and all that Toni is always in a similar way (and bad, slut) to his intelligence and popularity. a person who respects him. Tony's character was wrong in this movie ... he seemed a little psychologically and like any secret person sitting behind a compromise, he was different from the kind of careful, soft recurring teacher he had in the book. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the main aim of Zenia is that intelligent women are bad, beautiful women are bad, bad women are bad, and rockers are women who teach yoga. it is as terrifying as in this book, and then three women are convinced of these old cops (which, of course, is in response to Zenia and has something to do with it, Barbados or something ridiculous to hide Zenia's body, of course , Zenia writes) (one of the three women in the film pushes or fits together on the balcony) To do so ...) Then Zenia was able to process all of Roz's money. <br /> <br /> Until the end of the film, I've been paying more than half of my ads on space ads that have been spiraled since the time I was there. <br /> <br /> If you are filming this movie, maybe I want it because I've read the book and saw the movie, and I'm just ridiculous in the movie. That was terrible. Making a movie from that book is a tremendous task, but if you intend to do your job, you need to begin with the book's worthlessness. . <br /> <br /> Does Oxygen really have no fluffy books that can be at least half a good TV movie?
