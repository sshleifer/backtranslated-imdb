I really wanted to see this movie and for months we waited to pass through our Blockbuster Total Access account. <br /> <strong> <p> <p> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify; I will give a chance to any movie, though I do not want to leave the theater / <br /> <br /> So, it was very good, but it was about that, nothing will be explained: if we understand that Mathieu is depressed and that he has some sort of psychological environment, we do not have his "fall" but we do not see it happening or WHY is happening.When talking to Mathieu's doctor, Cedric has once deceived him, but that was not a big deal. flashbacks are expected to be seen, but nothing. <br /> <br /> I know that some of the movies are in the form of 'accept it as it is.' But this movie was honestly linked to me, Pierre, Cedric's old club, and anxiety when you start, end and we did not see her hair and Pierre had a good time to understand that she was in the same situation. The identity of the club and Matt are quite different when you find it. <br /> <br /> She expects you to know everything in the film and move it together with an indestructible, irreversible and mixed tempo. I can keep up with 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane' and other movies, flashbacks / flash-lefts and right but I'm not keeping CU style. 'Citizen Kane' at the end knows what's going on and you can find the answers to key secrets. CU is only dependent. There is a suit in the presentation of his "we will not tell you something damned, define yourself for you". <br /> <br /> As I said, a well-functioning book resembles the lost chapters and missing pages. I liked the characters, but the whole story was very disappointing.
