This should be one of the most appreciated Spanish films on history. The lack of its incapacity and complexity and the general political adjustment is really childish, with only good / bad characters. The world is not like this and good movies are mixed impulses, dilemmas, and so on. Show complex heroes with her. But most of all I hate this movie is Bola's friend's father. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: forty fores and craftsmen are not always bad, in fact, they can be better than looking for a taste (wow, that's philosophy ... or something). Thank you, Achero. I will offer you a Nobel Prize for Literature.
