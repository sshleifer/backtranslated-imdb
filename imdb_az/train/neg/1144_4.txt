Recap: Dr. Markov has developed a new theory of how energy can be developed for the world. He keeps his knowledge coded and confidential and desperately wants the Soviet Union. On the other hand, KGB wants hopelessly new technology. So they define a motion scheme. During the rescue efforts to free Markov, the KGB's steps are to sneak out on Markov's hiding place and to hide that he is in Sweden and working for the UN. As a reserve, the KGB stole Markov's outsider daughter. CIA now sends its best agents, a group of (Swedes) Ninjas team to capture KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter. <br /> <br /> Comments: The film is very ambitious but not in many areas. First, it's too dark, and it's probably hard to understand some scenes that hides places and bad influences. You do not see what's happening. First, though it is a ninja-movie, it is a complete battlefield. Certainly, there are some pretty poor quality, but mostly ninjas burn automatic weapons or explosion sets. The automatic weaponry also creates a problem as it seems to be an endless supply of ammunition. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In fact, some of them, and in particular the Swedish movie, are not good martial arts scenes. Some nice slow moving scenes and pretty much blood and snow. And a very exciting new weapon technology that blows the victim heart or brain. <br /> <br /> All you have to look at is B-movie. <br /> <br /> Because B-movie is absolute, there is no mistake. But you are expecting it and watching B-movie is fun. But remember, it's not just B-film for eighties. <br /> <br /> Some girls, for example, wearing "interesting" dresses, have a killer dose of eye shadow and makeup. <br /> <br /> In general, look for religious situation and enthusiasm. <br /> <br /> 4/10
