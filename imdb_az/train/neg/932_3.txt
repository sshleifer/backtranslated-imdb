I watched this film and hoped it would be better all the time. How big is it about a man who has no emotions? * yawn * Alex you do not see a show feeling for anyone other than his son. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know it's a reason for your son to lose himself (if you can say it), I get it. <br /> <br /> Characters are not developed, there is enough time to understand that there is no relationship. Sarah said they saw on stage that she would not fall in love, and how she would talk about her death in the next. There are many synopses in this movie. <br /> <br /> This one followed Boogie Nights and wrote this piece to imitate Little Bill. Even the "self-defeating" scene is that when Little Bill strikes his spouse, it looks like a face-to-face (or deficiency). I do not know, William H. Macy is good at describing a man without emotion - he has been there - did it - do you say Magnolia? <br /> <br /> This film is not just an emotion, there is no substance, a good post is developed characters and a plot. And, of course, I have no suggestion. :) <br /> A ~
