Mr. Ram Gopal is a great admirer of Varma, but I do not believe he is filming it. <br /> <br /> <strong> It does not leave a lasting impression on the viewer. Ram Gopal Varma does not succeed in creating chemistry among the characters. There is no friendship between Heero (Ajay Devgan) and Raj (Prashant raj). There are no scenes in which there are more than two people. Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal draw attention to the team that goes beyond the courtroom. Amitabh Bachchan did not make this movie. Ajay and Sushmita tried to do you the best but did not use it. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation is ineffective and quite senseless. Mohanlal has just done justice and has once again proved that the player is facial expression and body language. The rest of the pouring was lower than expected. <br /> <br /> In this film, the original shadow-free comedy has been adapted to the fall. <br /> <br /> Ram Gopal could have worked on Varma script, but because of the controversy surrounding the film, it's about creating Aag. But there is no fire.
