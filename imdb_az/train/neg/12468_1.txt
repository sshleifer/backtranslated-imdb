Simply put: the movie is boring. Cliché has cliché certified and story lines never come together. The director appears to be convinced of a movie or a documentary film. The main plot is very subtle (a CIA agent is ordered to kill the oil prince, captured and then informed the princess (why?)), And therefore some elements have been added to make the film more interesting. Thus, a child's death results in the father's "natural" response: he is indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why nobody knows. <br /> <br /> Some guys are suicidal terrorists and a boat exploding. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I was neither a toy nor an intellectual challenge. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not understand, and I was forced to learn or do something. It does not mean anything to me, but I can say about the worst movie in my life.
