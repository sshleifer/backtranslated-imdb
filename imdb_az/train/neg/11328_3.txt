For a while, I will give you an action / adventure movie, there was nothing to rest and nothing important. That's why Charlie has a copy of the Angels (2000) - not a good movie, but it makes me laugh and lets me relax for a while. <br /> <br /> From today, I will probably get the prints of The Princess Bride and several Monty Python for the same reason. <br /> Anyway, I leased this movie because I wanted to have fun without having to challenge it. For the most part I bought what I wanted. The scene was something along the lines of the weakened Xena episode, and Kathy Longun's players were very public theaters (not professional kick boxer and bad for amateur actresses). There were several high points in some of the Cyborgs. <br /> <br /> More and more movies are included in the movie, as most martial arts films. is in motion and the area that is not strong enough to move sequence is almost immediately deteriorating as a player. But more than Kathy Long's fight, the director spends more time behind her. At the end of the movie, I was seriously considering that I would watch Kathy Long for the second time to calculate the number of her sharp red trousers. Unfortunately, it's not just that meat that's been filmed for a second time to see the movie. If you are a tough kernel Zena fan who needs something to get away after a few hours - go to any grocery store and spend 50 cents on lease. <br /> <br /> There are some strong similarities between the show and this movie. <br /> <br /> We do not expect anything more than just a few hours of fun. <br /> <br /> Of course, you like Keti Longun's depth. You can purchase a copy.
