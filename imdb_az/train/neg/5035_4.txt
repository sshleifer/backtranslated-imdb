Melissa's sixteen year old is right around the corner and she only recognizes her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the children who had spent all their time in the wind were killed in the 80s slasher film. Come to these murders, until the local city sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his beautiful two shoes Marci (Dana Kimmell, 13th of june) who love her bored mystery. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the film, and the killings are less common to them, and thus make up the 80s of the Slasher brothers. Alesia does not hurt a big body (I feel it is necessary to emphasize that the actress is older than 18 and therefore I'm not outdated). Extremely low film, with less developed and unnecessary few points, some are a bit of a fused subject and a contrasting anti-climax finish. But good is bad (but). <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> <br /> <br /> <strong> br /> Code Red DVD Extras: Submitted by Aleisa Shirley and Intruder Director Scott Spiegel; The film's and cut-off version of the film; Voice chat with Star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; Interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; still gallery; the theater trailer for this movie; and Trailer for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals, and Balalaika Conspiracy
