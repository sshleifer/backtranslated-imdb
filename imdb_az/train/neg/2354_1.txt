Even I do not want to film this movie - it's a movie that can not win any award. The wrong scenario of the player was terrible. Here's a lot of people who are full of NRI audiences, but in fact they are hated by foreigners because of its indifference and "working" for the film. <br /> <br /> I think it's strange that many actors who are familiar with the English language work in a confident way in front of the camera at such a difficult time. I'm sure that many readers are talking about me - all this symptom English phrases are for a movie, cool dots for Hindi and regional dots. There are a few Indian movies that the British have seen quite genuinely - Cyrus was the last one. Although it was a great movie, it was a good movie, and the language did not seem to be "set". <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed of the fact that in 2005 P3 was given NFA. Only the semi-delicate parts of this trash were Conkana and some attractive background accounts. At the same time, you do not waste your time with this movie.
