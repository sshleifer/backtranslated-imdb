I did not expect a good movie like "The Fire Line" or "24" Episode, but this movie was prepared for television and did a good job. The fact that the good (upgrading) upgrade plot is very up-to-date and that the actors' bad scripts (which I really think are best) did not conceal that they were adding extra additions to their pseudo-sketches. While watching the movie, I felt I had seen most of this movie in a better (better) cinema. Here you have watched cars, great shots, romantics, land folds, and so on. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler ** When you see another woman talking to Cuban character, who is behind all of this, and all the instructions you give ("If you're too close to the President, I see it from the point of view") is a foolish voice. <br /> <br /> If I was (and maybe not) well, I would write this line again: <br /> <br /> The first lady ordered her to be killed because the patient and Cuba always check tired
