I watched the movie tonight in a free preview, and though I did not pay a single dime to see this movie, I was still fired. Ladies and gentlemen, time is money, and you see Benjamin where you live. The best player is torpedo; Kiefer Sutherland phones, Jack Bauer's most unidentified personality phones, and Michael Douglas, made a bad choice by leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones during his time to shoot Turkey. Eva Longoria is non-legal; it looks like he reads lines from a teleprompter. And if you can not spot the mole within the first 20 minutes, a world that has no TV and recycled story lines has just landed on that planet. If you really want to see the excitement of a good secret service, rent it in the Fire Bar. If you see and buy, you will start to fear the security of the President because the Hidden Service looks and functions as the major versions of 90210. In spite of your feelings about W, art does not imitate its life.
