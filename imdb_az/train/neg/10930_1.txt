This movie is a common dog. I find it hard to find something to laugh so that I feel as if I totally waste my money - and my time. In this movie, writing is very strange. <br /> <br /> Hale Storm is a shame that does not meet other standards. <br /> <br /> They kept the money to get D-list actors, like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman, it was true. Even Gary Coleman was not used properly for his role. <br /> <br /> This film is wondering what most of the area, including the subplot, is. After seeing this film, we were here with the impression that the producers were thinking of making humor like Napoleon Dynamite, where character and delivery lines are not. Unfortunately, this is not a movie line, a character, a delivery, or a humor. Instead I did not go to the dentist!
