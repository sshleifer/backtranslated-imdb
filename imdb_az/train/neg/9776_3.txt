I do not know much about filmmaking, but good movies should tell a story ... You have to start and finish the journey of your characters. <br /> <br /> In their last speech in Brooklyn, they may be, but not so badly, I'm not a happy end, it's not just an end. <br /> <br /> In 1952, the final outbreak of the cruel work in Brooklyn triggered a series of storytelling topics. Most often, it's the ones that are not the least likely to go along a movie screen. However, the Last Exit to Brooklyn can not produce any of these stories ... some of them explode into a strange stratosphere to smoke as if they were ending or to end a "artistic" end. <br /> Two cases <br /> <br /> A sad travesty character (a crucial character in the film) was shot and killed by a car. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Also, it's a good thing for him in the movie ... it's a good thing, everyone's memory is erased ... his friends, enemies, stupid, klueless and secret gay holiday leader, refusing to work, gay lover and slanderers in the neighborhood by those who are stomped by thugs. The stopping scene shows the streets of Brooklyn, and street lights are very similar to the Nazi death camps ... and the scene is dragged on and on ... and the camera body down. the working leader and the crucifix ..... ppppuuuullleeeeeez. <br /> <br /> According to some of the films, this film is a fragmentary piece, although it was shot in 1989 for the first time. Avoid this. If you are not warned, they really deserve the NC-17 rating for a large amount of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse ... they do not even allow adolescents to track.
