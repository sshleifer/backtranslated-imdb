Well, let's start by saying that I've seen this movie as part of a bargain. I got a great deal in 1997, and so I got into a movie shop. I asked what was the worst movie in the headquarters. Without hesitation he brought me to Lucky Stiff. When I promised to watch the whole movie, he said he had refused the rent for $ 1 (he said it would be wrong to pay more). <br /> <br /> This film is terrible. God is even terrible. I do not need to give detailed information, I need to read other analyzes. Images are meaningless. The player was strange. I know it should be a comedy, but the main character is foolish. You can try to watch it as something to laugh, but it is so bad that it is not even funny in such a way. Avoid!
