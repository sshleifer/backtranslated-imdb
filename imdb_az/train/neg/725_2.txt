This was a horrible movie! The subject is not to deliver. With my girlfriend, I was looking forward to seeing a film about the triumph of the human soul over oppression. What we saw was the brutal police brutality that lasted 2 hours. Previews and ads have not resulted in this! Moreover, for everything they play in the storyline, I remember that they were arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, previews say nothing about it! (not expecting it, but more of a problem). If I knew how hard this film was, I never saw it. Or at least I would have been prepared for that. It was a feed and transit ad campaign and I will never see this movie again!
