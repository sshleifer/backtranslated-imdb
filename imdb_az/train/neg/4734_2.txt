Do you like beautiful girls? Yes I am. What is bad about beautiful girls / women? There is nothing, why can I give only 2 stars out of 5, even if only received Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto "talents"? <br /> <br /> If I'd like to watch some amazing people, I've been watching MTV or why. This movie is a similar action film. So, according to the definition, there is no need for even a field? I'm not 100% satisfied, but let's say yes. So what do you need? 20 minutes of part 1 (I'm a bit inflated, but I feel more than 20 minutes)? It would be "no". But you know again that people watching a part of the party do not know what they have eaten this morning, so let them remind them ... Can you remind them twice? Just to be sure they will never forget ... at least until the arrival of the credits! <br /> <br /> So, do not forget about story, character development, real feelings, "do not forget" (or do not think that the protesting women are responsible for the action and / or struggle!) is it Yes movable scenes. Event scenes are not bad, and that's why I gave the movie 2 instead of 2 stars! I gave this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ... Give you better things, explain ...
