It's worse than this rating. A typical SciFi movie this afternoon: a terrible player, a bad, scrambled script and a shadowy direction. At the opening scene, which ended DeMille, this movie is terrible. In the opening scenes, Musa (in the DeMille film was Charlton Heston), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) are looking at a guy who sits in a box in the sand. The symbols representing the three symbols were terrifying and seemingly "likely" people. This is far away from civilization, when someone hurt, it is unpleasant and all shout for an emergency. The screenwriter does not forget that there are no obvious ambulances in the desert. Morena Baccarin has decided to shoot such a poor quality film.
