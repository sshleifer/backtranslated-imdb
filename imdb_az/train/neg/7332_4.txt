In spite of the film in 2001, the direction is home-style, 90 of the oldest and oldest years, several years ago. It was painful to watch cheesy cuts and effects. The scenario is worthy enough and several scenes were captured by me (as the taxi driver brought the night to the bridge). However, the story line was simply terrible, with the detective who killed her and killed her. The performance of Selma Blair, a married lover, seriously disturbed me. I sat down with everything, though it is rare for you to find a movie that you find on TV and decided to watch.
