I do not know why I would comment on this stupid reality show that watched a few episodes (although some cables were sold during the marathon, they sold 5 episodes or something, though I did not look at them). As I'm pregnant for four months, I will not go to work every single day. Perhaps I'm just bored today :-) <br /> <br /> I apologize for Britney, I really do. money and fame seem to have a very small sense of dignity. It depends on self-esteem. Federlinin married with Natwit (everyone can make mistakes) and before that, this terrific show of his daily life "shattered a camera when he felt himself, in front of someone or shower, as he stays there. it's not important for me, but when I'm divorced, I can not worry about what she's thinking about, and yes, I'm embarrassed, but I must be, though I'm living a very empty, neat life. I do not want to change my life.
