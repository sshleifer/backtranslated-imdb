In a miraculous way, this is really a great deal. That is bad. Very bad. But the original was very bad, but it's a bad life - bad life, it's bad - it's gentle - fun bad. True, this is a pretty surprising definition. The production values ​​are rotten on the board, the player moves, and the romero-wannabe satire will not consider the side that mocked her ecological fence. Domestic logic is the backdrop of heads behind the fridge, the incubation period, the zombie bullets, the zombies with the power of speech, or the need for a plot. Gore is a clear argument, but the frame is very compressive, which is annoying. Dialogue has been translated by the same computer that stops the instructional books and the size of the zombie infestation sounds like it does not conflict with any of the Romero's inventions. All this is covered with a horrible synth account. Absolute discharge.
