This movie is a good idea, it can be a mummified 2000 year old witch and can completely ruin it. Nora and Jim are off on the highway to Ireland. They remain with Nan and uncle. Amc found the 2000-year-old witch kept in the peat. She revives her and takes Nora's shape. He can not be killed by convention (unfortunately). But Nora is preparing a way to do this. <br /> <br /> This is a Gothic horror film made cheap. This is a widespread confusion. I have to ask everyone to get such a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid global spending
