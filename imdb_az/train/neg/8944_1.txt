I saw this movie in the Media class last year and have to say that it really hated it. I was 10 years old (and at age 15), so it could be something. But for English this year, in the 11th year, we also have to read Animal Farm by George Oruel. <br /> <br /> Well, in 1984, I think I'm the worst movie I've ever seen, but I think that George Oruel is one of the oldest people to live on this planet. I'm sorry for everyone who loves his job, but unfortunately I did not do it. The topics in the film were well illustrated, but the whole movie was built and incompatible with my standards. This is just my idea, and I'm sure that many other people were very pleased with this movie.
