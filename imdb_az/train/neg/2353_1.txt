Madhur gave us a strong film Chandni Bar in the past. His next film was one of the worst films of all time. As you can see, there are some high-level people in India. After seeing a scene from a man who starred another man for sexual reasons. I felt like the fall and fall of the DVD. I accidentally did. The cause of the film is child pornography and scenes of violence against women. I was shocked and almost shocked to see a movie showing naked children. The things that were very disturbing did not require the children to be completely naked. One of the rich children wants to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreigners, British men in this movie. I'm shocked to find out that this movie is part of India, but rather Super Flop in the UK, the US and Australia. I'm from England, and such things make me sick, not to be released in the UK.
