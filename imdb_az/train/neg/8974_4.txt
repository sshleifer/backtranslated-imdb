This movie, I would say it is a "movie", mostly about nothing, and mostly worked for the famous events of the time. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> I love seeing the Young Buddy. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> I did not recognize "Zero Mostel"! so if you say you are one of the "great generation", you will definitely enjoy it ... <br /> <br /> Film.
