An absolutely terrifying Mexican film, allegedly by Edgar Allan Poe, is a sneeze who wants to enter a shelter in the woods to write a story as it works, and so on. About ... Hero Gaston shelter head Dr. As Maillard's great show shows, we see all kinds of things in a dungeon like men who are thinking of being terrified for a long time and climb a hanging ladder on the side of a building like a comedic joke by the soldiers. And there is also a sight: a man dressed as a chicken, yes, a chicken, chewing gum around the place for this chicken feed. The scene was to become a movie comedy, but at least it was a low point for me, and it really was a rebellion when you thought you were growing up so that men and women grew up. Ah! This is really Dr. Tarr and the Legion of the Legion are the real horror. And this brings me to this important fact about the movie, which is one of the many films that have been subject to many changes, usually a serious problem. Yes, it is clear, but some have problems with distribution, and one of them is the same, there are more than one headline change that one can not buy more than once. This is absolutely garbage. There are so few things to do. The only singer deserves to see Claudio Brook as the head of the shelter. He is maniacally laughs, bellows commands, sashays with swords in his hands, and chicken proudly makes a great silver. I'm very tired to talk about a "soothing system" as a means of treating a mentally retarded patient. What a stranger to a bunch (Hey, like a movie with such a script deserves such a word). It will not be long to realize what's going on in the shelter, and it will not be more interesting. Cinematic Chicken Drill!
