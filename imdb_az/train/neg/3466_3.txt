There is a flick of flick at the beginning of the 80's, and there is a curse on anyone who wants to kill him. Years later, a group of filmmakers attempted to complete the film - inviting the film to a deadly curse. It's a great idea for a movie, but sadness is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly Australia has not won the world's best record of horror. 'Razorback' (1984), 'Holwing III' (1987), was exterminated and excluded, although it was half-American film. The comedy horror, "Body Melt" (1993), has been forgotten best. The 'kick' problem is to sell the 'Scream' (1996) to builders who want to create a clever horror, but does not know what the genre or work will be. And though this sounds weird about a spoon movie, but what really means "heart" is "heart". <br /> <br /> Follows the basic rules set by Scream, but does not want to play with the formula, instead of copying the card beforehand. <br /> <br /> Killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic traitors in the history of horror movies. Its infinite dam, unwittingly, appears to be a pseudo-chat sex Shakespeare. The cast does not look exactly like they are, and it looks like they can collect payment checks by waiting just for one shot. And we're deliberately trying to make the movie feel awkward; Looking for more 'Neighbors' or 'Heartbreak High' as ​​an episode. By the way, these attempts made in the MTV style of "research" at hyper cinema are just bare, dated and out of the reach. <br /> <br /> We still hope if Australia gets the chance to come back to horror) maybe we should take a leaf from the book Mad Max (1979). Instead of trying to copy the US, we should work in the genre.
