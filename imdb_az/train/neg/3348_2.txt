In 1963, the "Haunting" version was one of my favorite scandal movies, so I was awaiting the release of the remake that was released in 1999. It was very difficult for any follow-up to overturn its original work and even be equal. Unfortunately, my concerns were good: this movie is wrong. <br /> <br /> I do not know what people in this movie think about. Jan De Bont, shocked when driving the perfect "Speed", looks like a bad place (or even worse) than the worst-caseed goose with Twister and Speed ​​2: Cruise control. "Hey, Jan, stay in cinematography, will you? Liam Neeson, as a physician-practitioner-dream-dream psychologist, does not think it's really capable of becoming a bad thing, but he can not even write a nudge. weak story. Catherine Zeta Jones once again confirms (as in Entrapment) that she does not have the ability to rise above the material given to her. A great deal of women in the episode of the "X-Files" episode is missing here as Eleanor. And that yellow guy is better than any laughably strange figurines of children carved from the tree of the house, no matter who. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> The house is actually a postponement or a result of the manifestations of Eleanor's dangerous mental state. The sign of other great fear movies, such as The Changeling and The Blair Witch Project, is far from the imagination and there is no mood in the original. In this updated version, of course, buy tons of CGI ghosts, basically (in front of weak script / field) the movie is completely unbreakable. F / x is not so great as they are taken into consideration by ILM. Frozen breath seems particularly fake. The effects of the unexpected Peter Jackson film "The Frighteners" have been better than I've seen before. The children's carpets, which should look creepy, simply look foolish (especially when screaming) and CGI monsters are nothing to write home. <br /> <br /> Some silent scenes, such as when entering the bedroom of Eleanor, three other characters are thrown out, and none of them is surprised to find a great neat gin that comes out on the bed. Eleanor, the old lady of the house, the "seeing" scene hanging around the basements is particularly bad here. The latter, however, was talking about something that would mean betrayal, as a rule, in a dark shouting, and leaped over a furniture and began to flee in the painting of an old, bad boy, whom he had set up. home In fact, after a few moments in this scene, a few minutes later, Blond Guy is drifting through the dreams of the old man, and immediately shuts his head off the chimney. <br /> <br /> I think it's the only part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Recall that the original 1963 "The Haunting". 3/10 stars.
