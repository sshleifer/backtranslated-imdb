Eric Rohmer, as admirers of modern warfare amongst the sexes, "Spider and Duke (L'Anglaise et le duc)" was very eager to see how he would behave in men and women during the real war. French Revolution. <br /> <br /> The film gives a beautiful look, each scene is prepared as a picture circle, as a picture. As Rohmer's style, I talked a lot. <br /> <br /> Because Rohmer felt like a docudrama version of Scarlet Pimpernel, Rohmer suspended the scenario based on the actual women's writings. <br /> <br /> How to identify Robespierre and others that the French aristocrats have been violated by hairdressers? I sadly kept myself sorry: "Marat, we are poor and poor poor"; <br /> <br /> <strong> You could choose a fairy tale of Les Miz. <br /> <br /> My center is my betrayal, the Revolution of the city's home and country. At one point, the servant claims to be naked, but he is sure to give a convincing item. I just could not understand myself and the English sympathizers, but she kept her ex-boyfriend and boss alternately as well as the change of the political focus of the Revolution; I think that, as a character called The Scarlet Pimpernel, he needed more patience than his political deceit. Hey, the only reason you did not go home was to contact the Welsh Prince or someone, and his childhood disgrace. <br /> <br /> Generally, there is a change in the relationship between women and women in a revolutionary period, but I have not seen them here. Once I went to a Herbert Marcuse lecture ending with a long Q & A; The last question we had was acolytes, heck o gray hair, a great audience member, was "why revolutionaries are so ignorant?" He was thrown out and Marcuse did not want to respond seriously - but the only thing I remembered last night was the only thing. <br /> <br /> Rohmer also demonstrates that the counter-revolutionaries are both sad and didactic. <br /> <br /> (Originally written 8/11/2002)
