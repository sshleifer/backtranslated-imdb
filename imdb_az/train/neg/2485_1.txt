There's only one use for a film like Bulletproof: it reminds you how bad you can be. We often see films that we often describe as "terribly" or "very good", but then you encounter such a movie, and you see that not all movies are "good", so they are stinkingly bad as Bulletproof . It was the birthday gift of a person who spent less than two seconds through a local superstore DVD bargain bin (for giving me a gift) for a download. It could have been a serendipitous finding, but it did not happen: it's completely clich√©, so badly written, badly directed, and I'm moving so badly that I'm not surprised that everyone is not arrested and sent for 10 years. God, it's terrible. I suspected for about 30 seconds, but sometimes sometimes bad movies are too bad, because they're nice. This is not one of them. It's just bad. After 45 minutes, I stopped watching and threw it in the tomorrow morning.
