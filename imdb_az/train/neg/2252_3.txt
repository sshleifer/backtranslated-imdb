I have heard from several people that this movie brought tears in the theater. While I was watching for the first time, I was waiting for another romantic, tearful Barbra Streisand movie; It's like our way. I was, of course, wrong. Chemistry, Esther Hoffman and John Howard, among the two main characters, indicate that it is impossible to join the characters. There was nothing romantic in this regard. The character of the Streisand fell for a drug addict who could not write a note without trying to hit me on the fast progress button. At one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and forgives her in five minutes. There is nothing romantic about a dead rock star and a woman who can not really understand it. <br /> <br /> The parts of the film were drifting and I asked myself when it was over. <br /> <br /> John Howard's death was completely predictable. The film was completely clear to prevent its impeccable behavior early and when I died, I did not feel any emotionally. It was not a catastrophic accident, it was a search for him. I do not remember the movie, I was attracted by his ugly beard. <br /> <br /> Only part of this movie is Streisand's song. The reason why I was winning this movie with a curling film was "Watch / Watch Now". It was the only part of the film in 7 minutes, in fact I felt another sense of irritation and anger.
