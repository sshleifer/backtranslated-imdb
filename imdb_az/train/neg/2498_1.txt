Forgive me to tell you that it's obvious, but some movies are good and some are bad. Of course, there are strings from these two broad categories. The Godfather, Private Ryan-i Saving, and the Star Wars slot are a great addition to a good category. At the other end of the spectrum, there are just movies that are not worthy of being named. Sometimes it's really a sad movie. A movie that must show how a movie can be a terrifying movie. Very bad movie. Such a movie is Maiden Voyage. In short, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship stolen by a gang of evil criminals who demanded ransom from the owner of the planned bad-looking ship. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there is an American hero who is on the full board with a jawbone jacket and a sculptured jacket. <br /> <br /> This is a new derivation. Everything is bad about it. Movement, direction, and so-called plot are poor by breathing. In short, this is an insult to any unsuccessful audience. <br /> Yes, that's bad. <br /> <br /> I'm against a list of things that upset me about this movie. . <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">. You are in the company with a hero who holds a bomber. Sait hero throws you in the bomb and dives into the sea. What would you do? I know you, but I will throw a bomb, I can be in the sea. This guy does not exist. Our hero looks at us as he turns away, and then tries to arm the bomb with an unfortunate result. He said enough. Such a death would be worthy of a Darwin's website website and may be a consequence of the production team's life.
