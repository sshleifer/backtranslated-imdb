3-D, DUMB, DUMB, DUMB, which is also included in the "Unchangeable Man"! This complicated comedy looks better by comparing the 3-D effects of "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday 13th Part". You can not say that the film is too much in love. It was one of many films in 1983 for pop-off-the-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor were trapped in this confusion, but at least they did not kill their career. Tambor would continue to enter the HBO's box office, HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show" and Ron Howard's "How To Survive the Grysh Stall", and Guttenberg followed this flop with the Police Academy and Cocoon. What are these in the projects here? "The person who is not there". <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (four)
