As for horror films, I could not cope with blasphemy, despite the sub-par value of production, into a good source of fear. This movie is simply a good scandal to present. It can not even be used as a camp. Bad dialogue, bad behavior, bad intentions, killings were predicted and weakly staged, the music was frustrated, camera work was unsatisfied, and even suits were bad. I was obviously working, but I felt really bad for the actors involved in horrific dialogue and lack of dialogue. I also have any training. It is not ashamed to look at it, so it's a very boring, bigger endurance than the end of the "surprise" you earn. <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> This movie is full of time. If you watch this movie, do not miss "Build". The writer / director appears under the impression that the murderer is a courageous, brave act of a woman. (See.) She and the cast is about half an hour, as it's the age of this movie, "Citizen Kane." As a group of third-graders listens to the curtain behind their Christmas presentations. They really think they have created the substance. Sad, really? The only reason I call this movie "2" is that it considers it necessary to protect "1" for real oppression, such as Manos: Floating hands and Cosmic defeat. So, "American Nightmare" is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I would say that it's almost in the same place.
