WARNING: SUCCESSFUL USERS (We apologize for not taking care of you, but also for others). <br /> <br /> Starting with an unnecessary dramatic voice that is more boring to talk about the vote, it goes on with ridiculous and unnecessary drama. . <br /> <br /> We know that space travel is a risky business. Failures, radiation, stress-related symptoms, and so on. There is a complex system with many potentials, and unexpected things can happen in situations that are very unknown. They knew that things could be wrong. In fact things went wrong. This is called learning. <br /> <br /> Apollo 11 was not safe with today's standards, and there was great political pressure, but the overall performance of the mission on the mission was impressive. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Good duh. I'll do it. <br /> <br /> 2) NASA, the Appollo 11, is probably giving a green light, though it's likely to explode. <br /> <br /> 3) The release of the capsule will not work. <br /> <br /> 3) The release of the capsule will not work. Just like it's a chimpanzee when it's not. A survivor? This was the beginning of the test, and the missile exploded, the capsule was speeding up and down the parachute. <br /> <br /> 4) According to an interviewer, an explosion would have destroyed a fair portion of Florida. 5) Technology was primitive compared to today's standards. 5) Technology was primitive compared to today's standards. In fact, today, relatively early software and equipment are used, which should not be an accident. It's worse for the spacecraft because computers should be built from relatively large components that are not sensitive to radiation. (And the artist himself should be pilot at all times, so a complex steering system like B2 will not work.) What is the use of "computer screens" instead of "TV screens"? The same damn technology. <br /> <br /> 6) "If this object were not part of the rocket, only one thing could have happened." We see it going. In addition to the fact that the statement is incorrect, who says that he does not have a rocket? At least one friend clears something that if something flies and you do not know what it is, it is determined by an Unidentified Flying Object. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 7) In addition to the voice, some misquotes appear to be the body of the radiation folk actually in the passenger. <br /> <br /> 8) The images that I approached to death during an experimental flight of Neil Armstrong; I have not seen it before. I would say that any part of a clear technology can be wrong, especially if you have not been properly tested for knowing that it may be unprecedented. <br /> 9) The lander's trajectory inaccuracies diminished in the thickness of the month) have never been a life-threatening endemic. <br /> <br /> 10) The chain of incidents of "misery," "abduction," "usually leads to disaster, and I really did not know how to make it easier, this is a basic example of the used rhetoric. 11) As one of the astronauts wandering around as a charming child and thrown in a short time, this strange behavior can "emerge now." Like a picnic and a brilliant child, he was hopelessly frustrated. <br /> <br /> It was noted that all contact was lost during the re-entry process, a phenomenon of perfect nature and also known at that time, because it is impossible to replace it with modern technology. <br /> <br /> This courage is heavy, but it is so for many reasons. <br /> 13) The place has never lost its place, and the sound of this "fact" was the Appollo 11. Appollo 13 but two real disasters occurred during paving and re-entry, but at least we should compare the services compared to the Saturn missiles ... well, okay, just flat stupid. <br /> <br /> 14) What is hell with the UFO? There is no such thing as the context of the film. <br /> <br /> Even the purpose of the film is that it is directed to a particular audience for entertaining purposes (including people with no understanding of history, science, or rhetoric). <br /> <br /> It's a bit dark. The phrase "covered so far", "appeared to the public for the first time", but the film does not blame or offer anything or anything expected from a movie because it is emotionally over. In the good old tradition of Sensationalism, there are often fragmented fragments with interviewers and people who have nothing to do with the context or the NASA scholarship. Wow, astronauts were very excited before work? Fancy that. What does this movie have to do with one point? <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is either direct or inaccurate, as well as inaccurate entertainment. And believe me, I am a man from his horrible documentaries; this movie is not funny, witty, strange, nothing.
