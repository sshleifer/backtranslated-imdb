Here's a movie with a good cast and a nice looking job, but it's not there. Director Richard Brooks should be a little tired of this stage of the game; How good is the PROFESSIONALS! The rest of the horses and movements appeared in such a slow motion on slow moving parts. If this movie were anything, it would have to be sped-up. The horrible horse was convinced that there were terrible frauds and clear tire paths in these wildlife tracks - just lazy. horny job. Very bad. The actors did OK, but I saw them all good. Johnson is always a joy. I've seen this whistle 30 years ago; then disappointed and remained in the second look after 30 years.
