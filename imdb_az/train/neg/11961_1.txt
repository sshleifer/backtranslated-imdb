Everyone who could afford the cost of this chest should have examined their heads. Our beloved, heroine-addicted, party brutal wife who starts with any kind of stain on our bodies, spots taken from recurring beatings by our arrogant son. Now, she has all the breastfeeding strainer on the kitchen floor, Helen Keller gained in some way by placing the hands in the hands of her hands. We are married to a whore that has just started to patrol her daughter (she tells her that she is too quick to come) and ends with killing her female partner and then cuts her off. There is a child who has been raped by his classmates and coming home and eating his mother. You see, there are all circles. Deep, huh? Only a good moment in this terrible meeting of the touch is the time when the father killed his son's sufferers. This is a good thing for Turkey to shoot, because what would be the loss of another expensive movie. If the person who thinks the artists are interested in this hill is really serious, most people think that the artists are evidence. We saw this bad movie and then put it on "zero women, prosecutors". Oh, my God, it was a worse shake. What's happening in Japan these days? Patient, sick, sick.
