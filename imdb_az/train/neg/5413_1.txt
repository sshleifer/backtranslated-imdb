Inder Kumar came back with a comedy called PYAARE MOHAN, based on the Hollywood movie, which is better than the perfect success MASTI. <br /> <br /> Film HUM HAI KAMAAL KE (1994) <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > </ STRONG> <br /> <br /> We can not escape the horse, and now we have all kinds of comedies that cause our laughter. <br /> <br /> The film has started in a clich√© and some scenes do not have such an unpleasant moment. Even when the story does not move in this half, the comedy will also win. Bending is well-functioning and the second half is a motion movie for the blind boys and the snow to save their heroes and we have all the OTT discovery scenes and fighting scenes. Inder Kumar's management is bad Music is good, I love a song <br /> <br /> Vivek is terrifying in comedy scenes, his time is very bad and good at serious scenes For some reason he is doing comedy and breaks his career Fardeen Khan is better, but among the many wooden castles Esha and Amrita heroes Boman is worried about Iran Snehal Dabbi is good
