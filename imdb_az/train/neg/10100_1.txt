I usually support independent art and try to be versatile and tolerant ... I try to support everyone, because their efforts are worthwhile ... <br /> But this film is only avoiding all understanding and tolerance <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Think about the worst horror movie ever seen in your life. <br /> Think about some great, charming ART for the DVD box of this movie ... and a promising structure ... <br /> <br /> 3. voil√†! <br /> <br /> You have received ZOMBIE NATION. <br /> <br /> You just do it if you do not do anything better. ANYTHING is better.
