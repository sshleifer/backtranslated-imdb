It was very exciting to see a movie from my favorite book. It was Disney until I was too late. Many of the major parts of the story deceived me. Someone was filming a novel on the novel by the fourth grade pupil. Meq was good at school and did not wear either his father or his glasses. Mr. Murray (Meg's mother) was not described as any scientist; left his own kitchen laboratory and replaced the Internet. And that's just the beginning. Half of the film looks like anger at other people watching the movie I did not read. I wish I had more finger, so I could give four fingers. The only good thing I can say is that this movie is kinda good for a person who has not read a book.
