This may or may not be the worst movie made by Steve Mart√≠n, but of course it is far from his. Undoubtedly, he made that shit for this pay check. Such a horror, of course, there is nothing to enhance your reputation as a comedian. When people see a Steve Martin movie, they will not be bored with tears. It was upset that Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman would drag him along. I believe that talented people can not keep up with them because they do not want to see them in bad movies. If I'm going to call a movie for a comedy, then it should be funny. It was not. The US military is also embarrassed to be related to this pad. The Full Metal Jacket did not laugh at this notorious pretext for "service comedy". Of course, Phil Silvers rolled in his grave.
