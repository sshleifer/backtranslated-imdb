My original theory of this film was simply words written in 2000 times. <br /> <br /> Although this is a very clear criticism, my review should be a bit more descriptive. <br /> I'll start with a leading actress; In this film face expression does not change once, does not show fear, happiness, or depression. She looks at her body language skills, her eyes to the left and to the right, and she does not know. I guess I had too many botoxs, I got an emotionless shell. The absence of a face on the face of the film is accompanied by a painful exchange of love with the main actor who appears to be out of nowhere, and shows that they have fallen into a beach and love for a few hours each other. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus, the scene line and the field's inaccuracies. I've seen buffer ads that are more structured than this movie. <br /> <br /> This is no developmental character, they only believe that one thing is wrong and believes in a real person. <br /> <br /> While trying to achieve this goal, it would not be a bad idea to snake on an airplane, but I would not even laugh so much to make a serious move. Now there is a brain tumor that watches the movie and thinks of different ways I use to create something superior to the budget and cg team. If I take it on a DVD, I'll split the DVD, turn it on, and then drop it to the hydrochloric acid for a good size. THIS IS THE FILM!
