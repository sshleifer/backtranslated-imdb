The loss of my life, .... the director must be embarrassed. People do not care for me when they think they need to make worthy movies. He died in the end, made me laugh. I have to change the movie several times because I was ashamed to watch such bad moves. Hopefully, the guy who plays Heath will not start working again. Moreover, I hope the director will never take another movie, and his taxpayer has been dropped off for this crap. 10 to {.02}
