... but that does not just work and I'm surprised to see how much people think best. Under what? There are some tips here and there, but all the material is not self-interested and convincing. Lynch movies are generally of interest because they create a sense of confusion and are still entertaining when doing so. There are some visual implications, some subplots, symbols, ideas. But that is elegant and yes, it's meaningless. No matter what the study was, it was either "small" or too far away, or simply spoke in a superior way. Only investigating Lynchin DV should be treated like this because nothing else. 1/10
