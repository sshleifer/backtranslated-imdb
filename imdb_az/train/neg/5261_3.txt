I have read some of the other comments and have to agree with those who have not come to an end. I thought I would go very well ... until the end. It missed your mind and then leaped. In the last few minutes of the film, I do not think I go except exactly one thing. They ran out of money to come up with a good result. At first, people had a boy talking about the Territory No. 51 (after thinking about foreigners), and then after drowning, people brought something mysterious to each other. I thought the actors and the players were beautiful, it just left the scenario. Anyway, if you watch this movie, do not be frustrated at the end.
