Lillian Hellman is an exciting project that comes from the exciting Warner Bros., adapted by Dashiell Hammett with the help of Hellman. Paul Lucas was an anti-Nazi German underground leader who recaptured Broadway and won the Best Actor Oscars, fought against the Nazis, taking refuge in Mexico (Mexican border) by sliding his spouse and three children across Europe. She lives in Washington with her husband's wealthy mother and brother in Washington, but she is suspicious of those who live in a residential area and spends lots of time playing poker at the German embassy. It seems to be forever to find his attention to the drama, and what is the heart of the material (the world is suddenly changed to the Americans who are foolish, honest, direct refugees), a little patronizing - the audience is almost as though they are in the place of relatives. Lukas has several conversations in the third action he deserves for the Academy Award, but still seems to be less visible, penetrating, entering and exiting. As his wife, Bette Davis is working to make good use of his eyes wide, but does not give a lot of color. A spouse of Geraldine Fitzgerald's (and the striking composition of the party seems completely wrong), their children (both with distinct accents!) Are alternate humorous and bored. It was a pleasure here that we were to be kind to us because he could be a German during a WWII era, so he did not give him Nazi sympathy. In the first few minutes we get it; The rest of this delightful, carefree film is an exposition, a defense confrontation, and ultimately compassion. This should be a complicated mixture, but instead it is dry and inert. ** from ****
