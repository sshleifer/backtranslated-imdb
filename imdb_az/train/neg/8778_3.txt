"White noise" was one of the most talked about films. Because I think "Exorcist". As EVP, there was an easy way to become a truly frightening truth. Many films come with fear of people's minds. I said it might be a movie, but I did not. The film has made itself a low-level PG-13 scary movie. There is nothing compared to "The Ring" or "The Sixth Sense" in any way. No one really should be in the horror movie industry alone and only think that we need to do just one movie, but we are jumping and screaming for everything we need to do with a horror film. PG-13 I'm honest with the genre of horror because it turns into a genre. We need old days, blood and snow days, Freddy Kruger, Jason, and Mike Myers. Several films may have an idea of ​​this mentality, so it is not scary. Why are you trying to pull it? In this movie, some good jumps are nothing but the latest in film history without any resolution ... do not waste your money on this movie.
