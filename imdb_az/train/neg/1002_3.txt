I do not want to go too far, because I do not spend much time looking at this movie, but I have to give an alternative idea to help avoid film. The animation is scathing and the story varies between drilling / disgustingly extremely disturbing. The humor is completely lost to the audience, and yes - Ghost in Shell fans is not a fantastic action or something - it's an attempt at his slapstick comedy, and humor has not worked after just being translated. It was a common job to watch this movie, and it was a terrible way for me to take the film fest, given my excitement and how I was open to something - I did not expect a Ghost in Shell, but I was waiting for something entertaining and just did it did not know. Yaaawwnnn ... Instead, it is Kirin's Movie Traveler.
