I saw 'descent' last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and was a great disappointment. The excitement was potentially strong because Rosario Dawson was a prospect to see a smaller intimate film and a fan of the 70's "rape / revenge" flicks (not negative, I'm not!), I'm frustrated, I'm very excited to check out this movie. My result: Stay true to the classics! Yes, there is potential for the story but dialogue is straightforward, actors are unconvincing. Even Dawson is empty. Some say that the correct image of the college in the US, the purpose of the heroes' space, and the service of all jazz, make the whole film unusual. As Dawson is raped: it does not have serious intensity! I did not expect something "irreversible", but still, do not you feel compassion for her? I did not do that. It's not a minute, it's all the way down the road; I've read that photography is effective. Yes, that's really good, but nothing is weak. I have to admit that it's not good to go to the festival, so I missed something here, but at the end of the movie I could not help thinking, I feel like watching Argento's "Inferno." lol More seriously, the first scene in the club was beautiful, and it was a bitter feeling at the Lynch's Twin Peaks-Fire Walk watching a longer and dull version of the scene at the dirty bar near the American-Canadian border. It's me ... red and blue lighting, heavy bass, generally lakshiv / collapsed atmosphere ... No, I could not go into this movie. Very bad.
