15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the demonstrations sweeping young people, especially nations. When I was a 3 year old boy living in the Philippines, I would watch this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (there's Channel 2) this Saturday. When I went out in 1995, when I watched my dad and two uncle, it was all shock and fright for me. My grandparents sent me a box of "Powerboards" packed with the Power Rangers staff (including the easy-to-use megastore and Rangers stuffed toys). I even played video games and loved only one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was really sad. In any case, it was a show showing a negative interest in the robot series (especially anime mash series, "Gundam"). Now I am 18 years old, I would like to think that this show is now very beloved to me. To prove it, he made a trip down the memory stick and purchased two sets of DVD collections with the "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: Power Rangers Movie". It looked like me, "Uh, how scared, there was no other trash in my yard for me." For all of you, my generation, this is not a show you want to watch over and over again. For the rest of your life I say that I should leave it, but sometimes it's not a bad thing. Instead of "Power Rangers," I would give you the basis of Power Rangers, such as "Mobile Fighter G Gundam", "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (aka Ninja Robots) or "ORIGINAL Sentai". ""
