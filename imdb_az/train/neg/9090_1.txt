A propaganda film for the "cause" of the Palestinians. If you are expecting to be an impartial document on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we should look elsewhere. If anti-Semitism (or an anti-Zionist - if there is nothing wrong with defending a country's destruction), or not supporting the Palestinian targets (for example, mass killings, Israel's destruction) is a documentary for you. You have to have a fun evening at college campuses around the UK and the United States. But any intelligent and intellectually honest person will be angry with the many lies in this video. Indeed, those who are unaware of the situation are not afraid of this anti-Semitic pollution.
