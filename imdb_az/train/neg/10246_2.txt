The end of the world is a united film, which is surprising that it should belong to the total destruction of the earth. The main character is a sort of scientist, how confident I am. There are two jobs in a government (?) Protected by 4 security guards. His first job is watching the transfer from the ground and the ground (though it does not work at work, it looks more like a hobby). Work # 2 puts a protective suit and requires a dark room ... at least this is the best figure. As you can see, "plant" is not completely hidden, because the scientist brings his wife there. It depends on when they discover a message from outer space (they go to the dining path): The Great Earth Grim, recurring recurring. Something to say about it is that it is the first message ever sent from where it can not repel itself; his wife says he will be late for dinner. So they will go to the party (!!!). After a while, China sees a great earthquake. From there the movie goes ... no where! Yes, Christopher Lee is inside, but really does not help much. In addition, Lee gives an incredible performance on the lines of his appearance on Howling II. This movie is boring, but Christopher Lee has enough stupid elements who want to suffer once, like the Z-grade sci-fi. Moreover, there are many photographs of the earth's destruction.
