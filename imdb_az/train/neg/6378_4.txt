<br /> <br /> This movie was sometimes fun, and hell was sometimes even funny. <br /> <br /> The main message that I received from the film is that women are responsible for all the difficulties. Each time a woman is depicted in the film, she is lazy, lambasting poorly, or weak with no reason. <br /> <br /> But it's a comedy and part of an art, so it's just a source. <br /> <br /> They say that they meet with their spouse. </ Strong> The best movie is my foot.
