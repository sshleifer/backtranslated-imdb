Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedy. However, I feel I'm selling the first big budget to win. Foxx follows the love of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence, and Dave Chapple, who have been stereotyping their producers who think that black men who commit extreme murders are a comic concept (see Money Conversations, Blue Stick). <br /> <br /> I laughed several times and continued to play cheerful roles for all those comedians, but I like to see Marlon Wayans's dream in Rwiwu for Dream. Or Living Color Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans are moving on Spike Lee's satir Bamboozled speeches.
