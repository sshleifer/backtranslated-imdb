I took this movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival. I have not heard so much; it was just a tension that dashed heavily in a very low budget diagonally. I hope you catch the next big Brit-Flick. But I want to say that I was seriously disappointed. When the local people decide to take their own business and hunt them out, after killing and killing a farmer's daughter, "this is not a love laugh," she follows two criminals. <br /> <br /> The real problem is that this is another example of the style of the article in the British film. Camera angles and correction are entirely incompatible with the story, and it's exactly as the horrible use of slow motion that serves to show all things as an expensive home video. The film has anger and attempts to repeat the sad and gritty look of the movie to overlap (Cue a pathetic, compulsory drug scene and countless, meaningless camera zooms). <br /> <br /> We have seen these things several times and have improved 100 times, especially John Boorman's masterpiece "Escape". But in the last film, we really wanted to hunt and kill as soon as we were careful about the heroes in this movie. Even if enemies were scared or worthwhile, it would not have been so bad, but instead it was a stereotypical and strange nation. Again, an attack, overused clich√© comes to the fore. <br /> <br /> Are there some good people in our country who are filmmakers? <br /> <br /> "The song is not love" in defense has some good, thrilling moments, but I have difficulty watching this movie, but nothing more than a video, or a push to a very limited cinema. These dogs are not a patch that has been hunted down in the low budget last year in the movie "Dog Soldiers". Maybe the British Cinema would have been able to fight again, if the right money stopped going to the wrong people.
