OK, I love the idea of ​​this movie. I've been demographically ages and got acquainted with some stories. <br /> <br /> I think it's as hard as I can to get this movie out of the way, but nevertheless it looks semi-realistic in a different film. filmmakers are not that easy if they do not. <br /> <br /> Editing this movie is very scary! Maybe the worst thing I've ever seen in a movie! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> align: justify; "> God's fire, just terrible! <br /> <br /> I will not even be able to access these details, but sometimes occasional things will emerge and editing will show you the most painful movie experience. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4 castles and crew are not an excuse, I've seen short films on YouTube with more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I do not know what heck you think, but this movie is nothing more than masturbation. You should be ashamed of yourself! As a result, this movie will be packed with 3 or 4 bad sex scenes, which are really a lazy amateur porn movie, long and boring conversations and a disgusting masturbation scene. If that does not happen, avoid all of them!
