this is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. After an hour I refused to watch him and I regretted that hour. The player is strange and there is almost no space. My guess is that someone came up with a strange form and started a story around it. Mixing some ideas from movies such as Resident Evil and Strangers does not bring a movie like them. If it were a top Korean film, you would not be worried to see more Korean movie trailer ... <br /> By the way, these films have definitely a high rating, the film said it was promising. I think that every Korean who has internet for online gaming looks at this movie at 8.
