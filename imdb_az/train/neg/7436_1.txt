This movie spends time and money. All in one and a half hours, I continued to wait for the better and never. He was moving slowly, jumped around the field, was not intimidating and interesting, and really did not find anything. During the presentation, the credits were long and basically the rest of the film (long and drawn). Many parts of the site did not make any sense. I thought several times in the film that I was "out of the zone" because the plot mismatch was that my husband had the same problem and that I was "out of the zone", but it really was a movie. Actually, I have never sent a movie here and I am looking for films in the IMDb for many years. Here's what I took the time to write something, and you should not waste your time or money on this movie.
