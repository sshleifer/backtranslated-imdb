<br /> <br /> In the first film, the guy who conceals the gold receives your chance for the hopeless to find out what happened to Twitch in the original film and then returns to the real world. <br /> <br /> He told Twitch that the wrestler champion was transferred to another prison, which was hanging from the dark. <br /> <br /> Peace is planning to get out of prison for one month to start her daughter's life. <br /> <br /> Then something happens and someone is shot and the movie turns Die Hard into another prison. <br /> <br /> In some cases there are also refugees and internally displaced persons. <br /> <br /> Here's the rap music and poorly-adjusted battle scenes. <br /> <br /> If you were a great admirer of the original , this is not okay. <br /> <br /> If you do not, you have warned.
