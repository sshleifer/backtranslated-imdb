My husband and I have finished this movie and have come to the IMDb to agree with the reviewers who have found this film satisfactory. However, only one handful of 10-page reviews is negative. <br /> <br /> I feel that this movie is a great concept that is frightening and I would like to warn those who want to watch the movie in the future. <br /> <br /> I admit that I do not like my favorite movie, so my spiders are all negative. Still, I'm blaming myself not to be fond of film, but I often find more ideas than my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> Parisian je t'aime has been the most ambitious movie for many years. By using a "smart" concept and utilizing several few great talents on WAY to many short stories, the film ends in the worst of all worlds. Art for art is something artificial but only a 2-year-old thing to sleep. The director's 5-minute free-of-charge screen captures what makes the entertainment even more fun. Writer can not write and can not handle writers. (I would like to shoot for Clint Eastwood's superior, but he is a single player turn-on director (because it works rarely). <br /> <br /> What's going on in the screen is the confusion of short stories that give no sense to 5 minutes it does not finish and usually screams me in Paris Why do you say "Paris je t'aime" There are only a few stories that can be watched by Alfonso Cuaron, but everything will turn out to be something else.Coen brothers do not go short, but they do not have a scene with a pick guitar All directors have decided to do everything they want to do, and they have chosen Paris as a place to live in. We all love Paris like the current company, and we are actually blinded by SUCKS, in fact, I think the directors have names of each director , because the filmmakers have seen how bad this film is and decided to make sure that they were charged only for 5 minutes .. Seriously, it's a serious case. <br /> <br /> People, Natalie Portman is not a good actress. She is a pixie dream girl waiting for you to be. And Maggie Gyllenhaal, why?!? Do people make speeches from other films or simply regress? <br /> <br /> I'm looking at you Natalie Portman (Horticulture Condition, Closer), Elijah Wood (Sin City) and Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Tam Grace). <br /> <br /> For Nick Nolte, because you have been living for centuries or maybe even more attractive and more stylish than human beings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm just Ernst Hemingway, I think like Raymond Carver, F. Scott Fitzgerald and John Cheever. It's harder to write a complete novel, and we can do just that. You can talk about the same short films. <br /> <br /> If you keep Paris as your own story with your own lens and save it as a rock, I love all of this movie. The directors either did not care or were lazy. In both scenarios you have leased it when you read it. Thank you, for that you did not pay $ 10 for theaters.
