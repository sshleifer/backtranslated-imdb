This movie is terrible. CGI is a very cheap gray blob CGI. The crocodile looks like a big gray cloud. Finally, no effort is made or it does not seem to be alive. This is often seen on the stage with a photo CGI placed on the scene and almost on the screen to see the hand moving CGI smudge. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst examples of CGI's impacts, and I've been a witness and saw the films of the worst Sci-Fi channel. While waiting for big breaks, it's probably typically low-cost actors who work as waiters / waiters in local audiences. Perhaps the most funny scene in this film is that Cary is trying to attack Kate, one of the bad guys, and the giant crocodile jump from the smooth water to the second floor of the Villains headquarters and leap over the balcony. Kate and Croc (and Kate Crushing) it just flies off the water from the same angle. The laws of physics can not be applied to this film and special effects. At least there is an honor among the crocodiles.
