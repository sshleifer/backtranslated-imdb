Hahahaha !!!!!! Funny - it sums up this movie in one word. What was this shit, this "thing", so why would he kill me to use the movie?!? The author, writer and producer did not mean it was good, but he did not know because a scientist turned his son into a hammer shark and killed many people who invited the shark scientist to the island! Gooooooodddd !!!! I hate this movie so much that when I look at it, I laughed at all the serious parts because they were very poor and unprofessional ... and the shark was not even real, and it did not even appear. Although this "thing" has a relatively large budget compared to the low-budget films, I would say that this movie is all about laughing at all bad movements and stupid dialogues. Because if you are expecting a good movie, you will be very disappointed.
