For some reasons, different young couples from the Italian Alps left to see who could come to the camp first. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an old devil's gladiator, and takes the soul of Tyranus as he puts a helmet on his body. Later, the rest of the film hunts the surrounding people in the woods from their comrades and slogans move away from their hands to add some dishes to bring Demonicus back to life. The Digital Full Moon version has this stupid, meaningless, horrible action and voice, and Los Angeles National Forest replaces Italy poorly. However, largely because of the unwanted laughter, thanks to the concentrated lead performance. It does not matter if the heroine of a small-armored armor or hateful pawnbroker does not talk about demons and resurrections, to convince Kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and unusual lineage. Well, at least he is not as boring as the majority of the rest.
