I always liked Spike Lee's movies, but it took a total of 2 1/2 hours. I thought more about Sam's son and in 1977 I got a movie that did not have anything to do with serial murder. The night-dog dog laughed (you know all the movie artists are having trouble laughing). The entire film did not look very intricate and very interesting. Sex scenes are absolutely indestructible. I'm not against sex in movies, but it should be a point (not for XXX movies). All this, we were very disappointed in the effort of Spike Lee!
