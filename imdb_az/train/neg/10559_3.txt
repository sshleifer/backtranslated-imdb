'I do not understand. It does not matter! "Death in Death is a striking character towards the end of Smiles, and I know exactly how it feels when I sit just in the confusion of a film, with the film director Aristide Massacessi (a good old Joe who uses the real name for an old change D'amato) is an unusual blend of superstition, murder, and ambitious arti trash. <br /> <br /> <br> <br> Death Smiles is often very embarrassed at Murder, the same woman, but she is often frustrated. (Played by Ewa Aulin, who is equally bizarre by the name of "Death Egg"), is the only survivor of a workout accident on the edge of the estate of Walter and Eva von Ravensbrück. After comparing with the creepy Dr. Sturges (Klaus Kinski, the role of a throw), Mr. Lass begins to be in love with both Mr and Mrs Ravensbrück. <br /> <br /> "I thought so good, At the point we thought ourselves: "There were altitudes, descending, some bloodshed. strange and unbalanced women's nakedness' of all the ingredients of a great dirty Euro-terror; However, Massacessi's murder in the Giallo style is a very frustrating, completely astounding, ultimately an extremely boring reminder for the long-term and even Edgar Allan Poe's "Black Cat" elements. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be just a few fans on the IMDb, but if you take into account the choice, I'll watch the director's career later in his career; The unreasonable, logical, true Gothic horror in the 1970s is just my thing! Rounded up to 3 IMDbs, from 10 to 2.5 (for cheese smell and odor).
