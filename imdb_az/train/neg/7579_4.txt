The name "cult movie" is often given to movies that are often featured or is sold in more than one generation in a home movie format after being released for the first time. Superchick, which first appeared in 1973, now enters this category. In spite of Superwoman, Superchick is not a cartoon but a charming character. She is a very talented young lady, who has been accepted as one of the most glamorous openies for any girl in the 1970s and is also an airline fianc√©e who chooses a career choice that allows you to imitate a traditional matelot, which is known to every single port. Since Karate holds the status of a black belt, she is in a position to express her happiness over the existence of a bachelor's degree, and in no way can any of her admirers of her extensive sweep be seen. This film is a comedy that prevents an open Persians from being attracted to a shorter time. The appeal to feminists also grows with a peak he uses to prevent the heroine's abilities to miss a chance and to potentially unwittingly frustrate all other passengers on the plane. <br /> <br /> The Director has cleverly provided that this film will appeal to men and partners as well as to men, which is sprinkled with the eye. <br /> <br /> Superchick is a very easy job to watch the comedy that can be used by non-critical and unwanted ones. Probably, if they are re-watched over a year, they are likely to enjoy it. Despite his age, he can maintain his status as a cult film for a future period. However, it would be difficult for a dialogue and a moving movie to be given more than 4/10.
