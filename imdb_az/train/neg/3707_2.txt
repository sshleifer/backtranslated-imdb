This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen (worse than Dungeons and Dragons and Kevin Costner). <br /> <br /> Chris Rock was very disturbed throughout the film, and his supporting actors did not even seem to be trying to move. Chris Rock is a beautiful stand-up comedian, but he can not only transfer his talent to this movie, it's probably only two laughs in all the pictures. <br /> <br /> Avoid the film as a plague yet. <br /> <br /> Make something more constructive and more interesting than watching the airline or watching it dry on the brick wall. <br /> <br /> Because of Chrisin's efforts I give it 2/10! <br /> <br />
