In this movie, I regretted that I just felt bad and that the characters of the characters were not strong enough to carry a horrible attempt. The main idea of ​​the film was interesting, but unfortunately I was not really excited, really scared or shocked - there was a whole movie movie that I thought was terrible, but it did not even miss it. Until the end of the film, I liked Kate's character that he was supposed to be softened and a little more realistic until Jeremy Sheffield's character really was not for this movie, and I think that the director / writer, Kate, moved to a large number of characters used for any purpose, Jeremy's player was on the floor to say the least, and I felt uncomfortable watching chemistry poverty on the screen - or not. Such a shame. Dreamer.
