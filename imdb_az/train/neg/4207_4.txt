Ghost Town, Kate Barrett (Catherine Hickland) moves on a desert road isolated from the road, his car suddenly crashes and sounds when the horseshoes hear ... Riverton County Deputy Sheriff Langley (Frank Luz) Called to Kate's disappearance is missing reports. She finds her broken car and looks for it, unfortunately, her car is very damaged and has to walk. Langley is shocked to see Langley, a long time before, settled down by the spirits of the former inhabitants, and is governed by the evil Devlin (Jimmie F. Skaggs). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> me and I did not like it. The script developed by Duke Sandefur tries to blend horror and western genres that have no great impact. How many horrible hybrid hybrid movies are there? Yes, but what if I asked myself such a question, I would find all the answers in Ghost Town because it's not very good. These two genres do not mix well. There are many stereotypes, on the west side there is an innocent urban population fearing to confront a strange crowd who want to scare them, the main street crash, hall doors and whimsical upstairs saloons There are terrifying and terrible intelligent people, many ghosts, ancient curse, The corpses speak and kill some violence. I was so scared that, probably, there is not only a boring thing and two genres do not fit well. There are a few spaces on the field, why Devlin Kate stole? I know she looks like her ex-girlfriend, but what she knows and knows what to do with her? We never knew that this ghost town was full of spirits, and I kept them there and told them how they were turning to their souls. <br /> <br /> The Devlin says he will not be killed for Langley to kill him in just a few seconds after he dies. Why did the bullets not work in the first place? <br /> <br /> The Director of the Governor is disabled, has a nice fear film atmosphere with a few well-lit cobweb street sets and the standard Hollywood western city here is represented by a central street with wooden buildings on either side. I will not say that I'm scared, because there's no tension, and the film is dragged on the ground even though it's only 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> Military operations against the people living in the Caucasus continue. </ P> <p> The budget was pretty small here, it was well-prepared and inadequate if nothing else. The loan is a pretty good loan suit and suites. <br /> <br /> <strong> The Caucasus. Anyone looking for a western looking terror will be bored by the western elements, everyone will be disturbed by terrible horror elements. This is a bit different, but if it is desperate, it is a good bust or not a good thing to not see a gut.
