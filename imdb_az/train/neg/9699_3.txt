Though many other people think about the first movie, I really liked it. Together with this. <br /> <br /> Is it possible to sum up a few words in one word: This movie (and here's the word): CRAP! There is another problem in the snow: Judge Jester, his son's father, super, like Spliss, goes extremes, fights against white hair and sells many royal and yellow hair rows . <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < BR> <BR> In his confusion, Snow White is looking for help from Bubi (Otto Walkees), first find the other six chickens, and then try to find the royal family or at least try to find the name of Rumpelstiltskin. Although the entire field seems to have been written a weekend where writers are very drunk, to write a scenario that's under pressure from the studio. <br /> Yes, there is a good joke. Even the fan of the first part or the admirers of other actors is not really worth buying a DVD. Believe me. <br /> <br /> It is only the appearance of some actors that the movie is at least at least completely free from oblivion. That's why 3/10 action. Unfortunately, the scenario is so bad that actors or all of them are united, can not prepare a bad story. <br /> <br /> For example, at some point, even in our reality, unfortunately, they do nothing when they're here. Many great actors in this film include: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (Especially funny): RÃ¼diger Hoffman, mirror Helge Schneider and more Unfortunately, comedians can not bring these really dirty writings. <br /> <br /> Maybe some hardcore admirers are not a cure for regular movie shooters or currently DVD Renters or buyers are not worth the money. <br /> <br /> I even regret the rent of the movie.
