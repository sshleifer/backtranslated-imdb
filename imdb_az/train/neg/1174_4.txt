Erik Rohmer's "Ms. and Duke" is based on magazines of an English aristocrat who passed the French Revolution. But there is a stilted job with strange, painted backgrounds and stunning scratch tones. In most cases, the age of terror is almost completely excluded from the real act; seeing very few ordinary people in this film, seeing that chaos, poverty and terrorism are far removed from the pursued but corrupt aristocratic classes. As a result, it is often boring and uncertain about the forces that lead societal forces to the edge of the protest; is a thrilling film by a famous director.
