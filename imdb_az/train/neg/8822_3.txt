Depending on his personal situation, it may turn into a "Christmas Evil" as one of the most awesome and innovative psychological excitement or most frightening and frustrating holiday crocodiles. Of course, I do not really want to choose the latter, because I did not have to do any research, and just a Santa Clause costume anxiously awaiting people, and waited an unusually early 80 slasher. Wrong! The film actually deals with Harry Stadling's accusation; She is a discreet believer in Christmas, and is responsible for the Milad Family, which works in a garbage toy factory and presents a gift. When Harry's questions were all born to Santa? his father clearly in a suit ?? His mother is breathing his mother's naked feet at a young age. From then on, he was turned into a lot of social encroachment, ranging from a day to day, to the annoyance of his younger brother. I understand why some admirers of such an eccentric horror film, but really really so dull? Indeed, the film is a very distant and seemingly endless part of nothing. I can pardon the misery and excessive bloodshed, but this film does not even benefit from an uncomfortable atmosphere or an unexpected bumping (except for the final, I have to admit). Also, if this terrible hero would have been punishing fatal children, I'd have to take the concept seriously! He does not kill and kill juveniles. How should Santa handle a complicated and original Christmas thriller when he does not even kill a magic child? It would have made Christmas Evil a classic, but it is simply a forgetful and sad part.
