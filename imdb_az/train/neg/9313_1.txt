This was the worst low budget horror movie I ever seen. I am an open-minded person and always love a good movie movie. In fact, when I rent a movie, I'm looking at some good underrated horror movies. They are always good for a laugh, and I know that I've seen many. But this movie was terrible, and it was not worth it. I was thinking of leaving in the first five minutes ... probably I should have. There is nothing better about this, first of all, a camera suck3d for the camera. The presentation was foolish as it ended. Acting and special effects were terrible. Please, I beg you, do not watch this movie, you will absolutely hate it.
