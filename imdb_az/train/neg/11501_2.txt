A romantic and completely misleading appearance of unemployment, a "craftsman" from the middle class, with a relaxed upbringing ... It is clear that the writer did not directly hurt unemployment and, of course, had no personal experience. If you want to believe this totally funny story, unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers, no rage, no fear, no disappointment, and so on. There is no. All the characters live on the agenda of day and childhood jokes. They never look at the job, almost never refuse or suffer, and so on. They live. Fully living, just like summer vacations from school ... Smile. Especially, Ken Loach likes it, and so on.
