My darling is a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Honesty: very bad. Katherine Heigl can not move. Story: The story was okay, but it could have been more advanced. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <br /> The Prophet (saas) <br /> <br /> This is really a stupid movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br />
