If you've ever seen eighty-one slasher, there's no reason to do that. Authenticity is often not one of the strongest points of the slasher movie theater, and this is something that the film has not been seriously overlooked. I can not say much about pranks, so I'll do it in a short time. The movie was one of the 74 films included in the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was the only reason I could see it. The plot consists of many children staying in a dwelling during Christmas. When they're a slasher, someone has decided to start gathering them and this one leads to one of the most terrifying secrets seen in a slasher movie. It's really strange that this movie is on the Video Nasty list, because it's a few heroic scenes, but this movie should not be corruption or weakening to anyone, and many of these have been forbidden (for example, on Thursday, 13th day). But there are still banned films that are less strange than this (for example, the Witch from the sea). In any case, the result of the film is the best thing about it, although the viewer does not pay less attention to the fact that the attacker is at this point; this is pretty good. In general, this is a terrible and terrible slasher that will even be a good blow to blow fans.
