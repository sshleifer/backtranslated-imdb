The Choke, produced in the UK as streaming on the stream, has been a young man who has long been an unsuccessful part of every department: the story is almost non-existent, resulting in a film that makes up the majority of people around the dark building; except for two characters (which is quite unlikely to survive the film), everyone thoroughly rejects, that is, he will not care less when the audience is killed; Deaths are not as strange as it is (if a short pound of fisted sword is short-lived); <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> The biggest night club (an endlessly abandoned corridors and rooms where they have been chosen by an unprecedented striker, unlike what I have ever seen). For low budget efforts, production values ​​are good and cast seems to be quite a pretty enough actor, but it is reluctant to be really scattered (almost a slasher, so where is the graphic splatter?), A very terrible dialogue (in particular, sooner or later enough drummer), and after some people are advised to use sticky video techniques in an attempt to add some style, the film quickly gains.
