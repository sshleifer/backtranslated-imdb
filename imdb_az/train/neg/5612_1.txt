As a spiritual and non-Christian. I really thought that my faith would not fall, but what is the burden of those who see me? I thought the film would have great arguments, but did I get only one idea from atheists and Jews? All these streets are people who do not know their back. Where is the true theologians, the priests, and the belongings, so that he can get the arguments? Not a retired nuts who wrote and finished their studies in 1970. Personally, this DVD did not lose the value of time and that the facts were correct or not, or an anti-Christ told me. I ask you not to find God, because my ego and demons are better than Him. It is not surprising that the film is not surprising to help the atheists feel better about filming. But if you really want to show it to the world, protect us from the poor hearts of those who believe in Jesus, and then try to humiliate us with your worth, not the blows.
