I have been watching again recently and has a shorter version than 1999. I feel the same movie, but I would like to know the difference. <br /> <br /> Someone can come with Japanese and no pikachu short. Why can we vote twice for the same movie? <br /> <br /> Prof. Ivy was very boring. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> It was nice enough, but nothing was missing. <br /> <br /> Lugia is a collector who wants to seize (who does not plan to destroy the world after Lugia) and the ordinary characters they are trying to stop bring many disasters. <br /> <br /> The pokemon movies are a little better, deoxys (poke 7) is not good at all. 8 is almost here.
