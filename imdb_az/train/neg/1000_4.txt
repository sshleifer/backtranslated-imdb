The area intended for the challenge can be really a plot, there are two noteworthy events. Initially, at the end of each other. Together these events make up 5% of the total film time. Everything (and almost everything I mean) is mostly to fill the director's hopeless moments. I love disturbing movies, I love dark movies and do not worry about the strange scenes - but with 60 minutes of smell / dark (as if) scenes, you expect me to sit with NO storyline. Rosario Dawson, one of my most beloved actresses, has completely vanished here. In any case, I have noticed that the NC-17 version is also naked. <br /> <br /> If you want to shoot a few hours and watch the "Shot", instead of a nap - you will have more interesting dreams.
