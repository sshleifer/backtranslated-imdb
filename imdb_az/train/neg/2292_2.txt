Above all, I must admit Batman: The animated film is the best batman series. We watched him watch television. I did not realize that it was the fourth season. Actually, it was not. <br /> <br /> The BSU season ends in 3 and should be stopped there. <br /> <br /> Why should we mix with something good? Catwoman and Poison ivy now have a terrible gray face. Joker looks scared, looks at his appearance every time, looks more scary. According to Qafqazinfo, even if he looks like superman now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "The wings of the night need a haircut! Alfred owns only students with eyes, looks like more than 80 characters. <br /> <br /> I watched three episodes from Disc 1 on the series, and now I find that this version is more severe and graphic. <br /> <br /> If you are an admirer of Batman: The animated series, there is no seasonal season. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <BR> <BR/> <BR> <BR/> <BR> <BR/> <BR> <BR/> <
