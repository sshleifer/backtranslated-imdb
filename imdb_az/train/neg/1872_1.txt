WARNING WILL BE. This film is such a mess. This is a disaster. Do not waste time on this. I warned you! <br /> <br /> Acting, story, dialogue, music ... basically everything from top to bottom is absolutely boring and ridiculous. I wanted to shoot me (when the dialogue / action / story did not do, everyone was hacked). You'll feel like you're watching the comedy. Probably the problem is probably parts are not even funny. Operation, story, cinematography, everything you can feel, simply WAAAAY is very tough - but it's unsuccessful. Almost every stroke canted, but what? This movie feels like just a student film. <br /> <br /> If you're going to spend more money to shoot in this movie, they're not surprised to hit HD. <br /> <br /> If you are having fun easily or badly, write, correct, guide, clich√©s, everything that is forced on your face, oh and weakness? <br /> <br /> I love this movie. <br /> <br /> I was forced to watch it for a class. If I could do it, I'd close it up right away. If I can not say right now, I still HAVE this movie. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, since then, Independence Day has dropped in peace after accepting the roles of these disaster films.
