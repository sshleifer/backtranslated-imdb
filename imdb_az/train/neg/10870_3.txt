Bill (Buddy Rogers) is sent to New York by his uncle, Richard Tucker, to live his life of $ 25 million. His uncle, Jacqui (Kathryn Crawford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Pauline (Carole Lombard), have come to draw close to him and have not broken up for gold drilling workers.

Bill, Cleo, and another woman, Bill, offer more money to girls because they have agreed to run in New York for a 3-month period. In the end, love for Bill and some other .......... The picture quality and sound quality are poor in this movie. The story mixes with musical pieces, but the songs are bad, and Kathryn Crouford has a terrible sound. Rogers is not good. It is pleasant enough, but it only happens when playing drum or trombone. There is a very disturbing character playing the taxi driver (Roscoe Karns) and the film is simply elegant.
