Do not worry about losing your money in this movie. Do not even go to your car and think that you will see this movie before you go to other people. <br /> <br /> If you see a movie this weekend, look again at Batman. <br /> <br /> The scenario was terrible. Perfectly written in casual horror film format. The data is: a terrific place with limited space, different weapons, an interesting person who wants to uncover all the tips that honest police officers can not come together, and many innocent and overly interested, followers look for a girlfriend. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Combine together, add badly blended mixtures, and come to hell to put some freaks to make a little "spin" there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < can you say ??? I'm in the army. <br /> <br /> From 1 to 10, I would place it in decimals to make it possible for the lowest possible score.
