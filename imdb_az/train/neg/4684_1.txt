This film is an insult to all submarines. He was stupid. It was written by the monkeys. The player was absurd. If this is the case of most people navigating, I cry for defense. This movie was terrible. I say, "Go to the bottom of the sea" as seafaring goes. Gene Hackman really needed the rent to make this jealousy. Denzel should be high in Washington. It gives a small sense in the field. And the end. For rewarding a criminal offense? Hollywood only thought of this trash. If you had not grown up, I did not like it. And without all pro comments, I was not worried about writing.
