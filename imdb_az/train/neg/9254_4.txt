Resnais, wow! Hiroshima, who brought us to Mon Amour, challenged to give French music in vivid colors in the 1930s. Old, elegant inter-titles and opening noise were a nice touch. Then the camera sill (like an old hand crank) opens on a black and white poster. The camera (or, more precisely, above) suddenly shows the striking bright colors of a humorous table prepared for the tea party. <br /> <br /> Then music begins. It is a very unforgettable chorus that has nothing to do with the movie, which is a bit unhappy (and yes, I'm French, so it's impossible to blame subtitles). These characters have replaced more people who opened the door and entered a more memorable song. Then they will go and finally Audrey Tautou, and we've heard the 15-minute first remarkable dialogue. <br /> <br /> I do not know what Resnais is sure of when starting with spending time and music with such a yawning cacophony. But the impact on the viewer is to skittle on the screen and make it want to get out of the storm. <br /> <br /> This is not much better. Why will I say? No familiarity with any characters. We do not even see their face half the time (Resnais seems too intent to show expensive d√©cor to care for the true people in front of the camera). People come to the stage as confidence around a lamp, and we can not pay attention to any person or field. It was like pulling Brady Bunch's episode and taking her to a 2-hour movie. <br /> <br /> Military operations against the Azerbaijanis living in the Caucasus continue. But do you have enough to keep your focus for 2 hours? I do not. Maybe tomorrow I will watch. Aw, thank you whom I am. There are more important things to me. And I'm sure. Skip it.
