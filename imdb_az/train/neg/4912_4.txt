Reading the novel, I can not say how faithful this film is. The story is a typical mysterious material: the killer is aiming for a new marriage; the woman is in love with the investigator's partner and becomes a deadly disease. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera and it's exactly how it works. <br /> <br /> The first 2/3 killings can not be escaped, and 1/3 of the latter are short. <br /> <br /> Progressive is subjective, although actors are the sole responsibility: the scenario is strange. In the last 1/3 you can stop the movie as the film is really interesting, but the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahy has a lot in his element, but has nothing to do with television budgeting and network censors. While smoking in the club's toilet during a few "floor" cigarettes, it is limited to fast cutting and distortion lenses. Unfortunately, because of this made for television, it does not have the great composition details that it uses with a wider picture. <br /> <br /> Note to producers: Give this person an acceptable budget and an anomorphic lens when he hires him. <br /> <br /> It summarizes: this movie is bad for movies and television standards (see CSI instead). For some kind of movie, I have some great suggestions: Take a copy of Dario Argento's "Deep Red", the "Opera" and even the Tenebre. Each category is stronger.
