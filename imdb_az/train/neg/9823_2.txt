This film has an interesting discussion. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < There is an early line in the film: "You and I can look at a good man in spiritual terms, but both know that he will go to Heaven." <br /> <br /> I'm not a Christian, I was interested in discussions about the film, but the film did not have a purpose. it can be a powerful thing to do with the minds of the ignorant and uneducated. "As the nature of George Carl's birth says," Take a hook when it's young. "<br /> <br /> The basics are also very interesting, and from the 1890's on, the scientist, as long as the morality is meaningful, the godless morality y is it not a child stealing? Or do you say that you do not steal you so that God does not tell you? (child does not want to worry about stealing) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Writer, Carlisle, Help the book to be sold (to distribute to the world). However, opposing one of the scholars is on the one hand. He was opposed to the arguments of God's words in a very interesting debate about immoral morality in the film. To prove his point of view, he prepares a time machine (just to make the movie a good worker with me) and Carlisle sends 2002 to see where God is going to teach you the immoral morals. /> <br /> As you can see, he has his own thoughts and is changed for everything he has done, and after returning he returned himself (because he is not really spoiler, this is the Bible). <br /> <br /> As it's a movie, it's pretty slow and pretty weak. There is no need in this movie * anything, Carlisle produces two "bad guys" who want to try to figure out who is, even someone damaging, murder or something. What is the movie, showing Carlisle's ideas, attitude towards this "evil world" and returning to a new look? <br /> <br /> Some films have some points that confirm me that I am not a Christian, or at least "This is God, or not". At the end of the film I was very disturbed by three things. First, two "bad guys" Carlisle, just before that jump, Carlisle is merely a dignified act of his * only * .. his fraudulent Jesus as Jesus Christ, and his "wicked men" (even Christians are btw, quite bizarre), they think they just missed the surprise. Secondly, Carlisle finds a boy who does not steal the movie after returning (but does not remind God, children keep marbles and run away) and tells him it is wrong when stealing for God's command. <br /> <br /> As in the above-mentioned Carlin note, insulting children to religion is wrong in my book. And finally, epilogue. Another fright tactic. Carlisle asks the inventor how far he can get away and he does not know that epilogy is trying to knock it out of a distant future (starting at 2100) and fails to do so. He has reduced the age of 10 and still works and fade-out, 2030 or more. Throughout the film, Carlise reminds me of the end of the world because of the sin of the world and the loss of God ... fearful tactics are used for thousands of years .. you are thinking about it <br /> <br /> I am pleased to see this movie. Well, before I'm good at being good, I know one thing now. If you are not a Christian, it is worth the effort to confirm how happy you are to be ignorant as a nation in this film.
