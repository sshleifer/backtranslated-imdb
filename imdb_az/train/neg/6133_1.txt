Kurt Thomas is a gymnast who trains for a special game hunted by a group of ninjas like Jonathan Cabot, but since these ninjas are a gymnast especially Cabot, there is no chance! A hell of all the Gymkata is a bad movie, a cunning actor, a God-terrible comedy and a truly inappropriate orientation that adapts to human standards, but this movie is really laughable. I know, "I know that I'll fall asleep!" or "Yes, through you!" just add the typical value that Gymkata gains later. In addition, the only film that Wisely is a hero is a gymnast who finds everything to stir in the heat of the moment.
