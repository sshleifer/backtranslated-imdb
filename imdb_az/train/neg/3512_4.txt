I think this movie is very valuable here. There are some things to be amazed at for this; it is worthy of a credit to become a science-fiction (work) movie based on his story instead of special effects and action schemes for holding the day for something. Support is good, definite design and cinematography are good and ideas are quite interesting (although they are a little tired after many mid-Black City / Memento / Fight Club clones in recent years). <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < / STRONG> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; I think part of the story dictates that (wait a bit) part of the password, but I'm just a dull, anonymous The characteristic act of Jeremy Northam, who succeeded in conveying the hero's confusion and misfortune, was unsuccessful for him, but was unlucky for him, What can Lucy Liu do if he does not seem to be a personality as a spy movie maker? mma, I say telegraph was at least 45 minutes before the end of a surprise twitch, and the first hour and so on. After being satisfied with being an exciting, feature-oriented film, the last few scenes are suddenly turned into the worst Hollywood pope, with a huge explosion and special effects. <br /> <br /> The film's appearance at the end of McGuffin is weak, and in the end some of the key issues in the movie may have looked better on the characters. <br /> <br /> The film is not all bad, though. Slow pacing (though I think slowly that the average tolerance for movies is higher), it manages a certain low level tension within a maximum. And the director Vincenzo Natalie has a sense of paranoid not being disturbed by the fact that they are trying to explicitly point to the surface. But in the end, these elements are not enough to eliminate the defects in the film's actor and script. Perhaps there is a good movie covering the same topics and ideas, but this is not it.
