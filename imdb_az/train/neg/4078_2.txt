JESSICA: A ZERO STORY suggests a ghost story. This theme is horrific, but it is close to the comedy! <br /> <br /> A woman who was killed in a terrible way comes back from the dead. This is trying to pass this movie as a plot. There is really nothing more to do. <br /> <br /> This film consists of a series of scenes involving a number of bullets involving a person who contacted this woman before his death. <br /> <br /> Right from the opening scenes, this movie is a "flat" -DVD effort, "Unlike VAKANSIYA 2, it does not mean that the direction or creativity of the film is meaningless and, of course," flat-DVD "is a bad name The lack of directive is so weak that it can be fright or tension. <br /> <br /> They say that drama elements are controlled by hopelessness and are as unattainable as the worst soap opera. <br /> < No actor in the board can demonstrate the smallest potential of successful actors career. <br /> <br /> Many of the individual scenes have been for a long time with long stops between dialogue exchanges. <br /> <br /> <br / > It's the only reason I have rated this movie not more than 1. It's because some of the poor people are united with even worse, causing some unusual laughs. I am emphasizing the word "little." It's one of the "bad-dog-good" movies, like CAMP BLOOD or NAIL GUN MASSACRE If you want to laugh hysterically, watch these movies. If you would like to see a horror film about Ghosts, watch HELL HOUSE, THE CHANGELING, RINGU, THE EYE (THE KOREAN Korean version), REGISTRATION, LONG CANCER and LEGEND OF THE PHONE. <br /> <br /> I advise everyone who has won the happiness of not seeing JESSICA for a SITE STORY to continue the good work! Just do not forget this movie. Do not disagree!
