Gymkata is one of the worst films ever made. But bad movies are not bad. It's so terrifying, watching and laughing fun. Kurt Thomas does not have a profitable career that clearly operates. Go back to gymnastics. But forgotten scenes, a high bar with a pike, a stone pommel horse, or a five-minute discovery scene, can be forgotten from the village who are in slow motion. I do not think this is bad, but who can say. This is not art, but if you want a good lite and fluffy thing to do, please rent a game. Makes an entertaining evening.
