Dane is proud of being a good Danish filmmaker in recent years. However, it is a terrible shame that this increase in quality led to the loss of criticism from the majority of Danish film critics. In fact, I'm very worried that I will not react to Danish movies, and eventually I stopped watching them in theaters. <br /> <br /> I know that it is wrong to hold against this unfortunate development. a movie, so I must emphasize that "Villa Paranoia" will be a terrifying movie in any situation. Due to the sensitivity of critics, he began to apologize for the Danish movie only. Additionally, there was little or no time to wait until the DVD was released. <br /> <br /> Erik Clausen is a talented director for public realism in Copenhagen mode. Especially I am delighted by De Frigjorte (1993). As an actor, it is usually funny, but generally plays a part in all his films, part of his working classroom failure. doing something good for the community. <br /> <br /> This is a number one issue at Villa Paranoia; Clausen accepts himself as a chicken farmer, and it is such a defeat that he can not be trusted. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the film is worse that movie viewers must join and turn all the rules into explaining a story to understand what is happening. For example, the movie opens with a very sadistic attempt to visualize the low death experience, low budget effects, and bad camera work. After that, the character tells the best friend that suddenly he felt encouraged to throw himself off a bridge. This is the symptom of the entire film; There is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters, and Clausen co-ordinates the motto for motivation: instead of showing. So at one point, as you feel yourself, you have a character that speaks to a catatonic man in nature, because the script does not allow him to move his emotions; it is possible for the director to give incredible noise in order to convey sensual perceptions to the audience. Fortunately, at this point, do not leave a so-called story just about an hour ago when you are careful about any characters. <br /> <br /> Klausen's film, which has often been a problem, ended with a sad statement: Sardun Berezen, just another brother, claimed to be a Big Brother competitor, not worse than a lot of players in the castle. <br /> 2-out-of-10 rating.
