You just have to sit down with all this goddamn "movie" to know that I can not live so bad any more. Nedia Bjorlin - 10 (She is a beautiful and terrific actress) - 0, scripts - 0, fighting scenes - 0, male men - 0 (fled 8 meters). This is the criteria used for me to use two criteria. I lost my account, but I believe that there is no movie stereo in this movie. When his father killed the driver he had allegedly killed, he cemented the previous statement after moving forward. Moreover, he appears only for no reason. It was never before. What else can I say here? Watch it out when it's on TV for several years. At least some will be made for advertising.
