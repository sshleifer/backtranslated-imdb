And many people are homeless. . . <br /> <br /> This film is worse than white naked! <br /> <br /> This film is worse than white naked! Little Man has a false excuse to break a character midget like a baby. The story was written by six people. The idea will not be too bad yet, though this is not the original and the destruction of a cartoon episode. There are these funny moments, but some are on the road, and some are stupid. The player was very, very bad. That was the director. Everyone involved in this film should embarrass themselves. It is very racist and very offensive to compulsions. I do not want to show sympathy for them, but the filmmakers have fun! How does this really punish me? See the midgets that are like little babies. And for a character with a fruit acting as a baby abandoned to get the diamond of a particular family. This is an excuse to show something like that. This is not just worth it. Do not watch this movie. It spends a great deal of time and money.
