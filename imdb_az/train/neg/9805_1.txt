I have never understood the popularity of Shaban's Power Rangers show, which was the second-class version of the super-sentai series in Japan over the past three years! What's cool about the Japanese version, American version, characterization, special effects, and so on. Completely defeated with it. <br /> <br /> Of course, many children say that the guardians are the greatest, but it would be wrong. / <br /> <br /> I am confident that they speak Japanese, how well they will learn the super version from the US version. <br /> <br /> Power Rangers are absolutely terrific, try Super Sentai instead! If you're looking for a better show, try Voltron Third Dimension!
