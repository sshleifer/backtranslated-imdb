He convinced that there is no world ... <br /> <br /> This is a line that many people will remember. Of course, it is one of the suspects in the case of Kaiser Gold. I say Sose. <br /> <br /> I have something else: - No filmmaker, in fact, tried to convince the audience. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the most delicate pieces of films I have seen for a long time. It really has fantastic cinematography, excellent functioning and very smart premises. But the only way that this film is happening is to ruin itself. It is packed with a single blow, but also with smaller wrist pieces. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the comments here, surprise them that they find a way to explain this puree. In my brain, I can reasonably explain the existence of humanity with enough fuss. People have seen and read in many completely different ways, explaining the story. <br /> <br /> All of them are different from a story played by a poet playing a cunning way to play chess, playing a game like a chess game. But at the same time, this is a painful story with a very bad story. Besides, nothing is undefeated from the movies and books such as Fight Club, Kill Bill, Casino, The Usual Shuspects, Snatch, Magnolia and Shachnovelle. <br /> <br /> This movie is finally wrong There is something going on that story is full of drunken bum, and if it's a roller coaster, it's a short time after the film's filming, there's a lot of noise that can not be resolved if it's a cocktail, <br /> <br /> I do not write this story anywhere and I was not at Ritchy. <br /> <br /> First, whether you're in David Lynch or something, it was awesome to shoot. <br /> <br /> 1 / 10f or completely breaks your business (Ritchy: seek professional help) It could easily be a gem, instead of Sunday night is a piece of art designed for lying intellectuals to discuss in debate clubs. <br /> <br /> Protect your soul and miracle, avoid all expenses!
