She did not care about the film, the book was better. Does anyone know where they are going? *** This was my first visit to your site ... I just found the answer to my question. Now I look like a shirt, but I still think that I will present my comments. and yes, British Columbia's favorite *** Or why they took it to the Coastal setting of South Carolina? (This question stands) The place was important to the piece of the book and its modification was part of my disappointment with the movie. Oh, I've read at least ten lines. Here is another major problem with the film. Kim Bassinger was very unhappy and I was not the one I described in the book. I know that the book was a book and a movie; is not good at all. The characters in the book are more empathetic. Also the book fascinated rustic, almost primitive views of the monastery. While the castle was more visually affected by the film, it distorted the story and appeared in comparison with the symbols.
