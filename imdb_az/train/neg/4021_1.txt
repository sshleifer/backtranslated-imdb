This is probably the worst movie because Roger Corman's name is bad. When I lowered my budgets I understood, but today there is no excuse for birth! I distort the "B" and some of my favorite films are removed by the "regular audience", but if I take these words to my word, the Vampire Club is the worst I can imagine, the vampire with no fang, the musical score was completely gone , sound effects are not only effective, and ultimately, Mr. Savage does not seem to know that he is in a vampire movie in all the rocks, it's too bad Because everyone has a "bad" career. I do not know if I do not like a movie, I'm going to be hard at first for this reason.
