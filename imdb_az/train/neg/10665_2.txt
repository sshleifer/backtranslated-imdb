I started to transfer this thing for about three minutes, and we just stood in nakedness (why do bad movies always look so beautiful?). Within ten minutes, my job was over and I could get my money back from the rented store. People who write these films should be sanctioned by the MPAA. Come to the writers - bad guys get into the car with a good guy's remote-controlled bomb! This is the way of the days of the Ottoman Empire! In addition, in order to add an injury to the injury, the "twist" was ultimately shaped from any action movie that was written in the last 25 years. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynolds was good, but he should focus on real movies. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a waste of time - do not escape! Get away!
