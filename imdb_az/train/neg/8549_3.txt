Okay, so what kind of hell I'm watching now? "The Witches 'Mountain' has never been and should be one of the most inappropriate and argumentative Spanish exploits flicks at the same time, it's strange attractive. There is absolutely nothing here, and I doubt that it is a script for you to work, but in some ways I could not close it. Starting with a sequential sequence of an angry girl, who slams your head in a fuss, kills her mother's cats immediately. So, does this film think about children who have bad forces? There is no heck because after this intro, the girl and her evil are not just mentioned. Then you cut off a boy with the most striking red mustache you see, and with whom she and her lover break quite wrongly. When he asked to spend his holidays with him, he immediately asked the employer for any assignment. Great move. When the movie is finally being launched, it travels to an isolated mountain area to draw some peaks. She chose a new girl (Patty Shepard) and even before her topless copy! All kinds of strange events happen during the trip? you guessed it? no disclosure. The girl wakes up in the middle of the woods, loud music is playing everywhere, and someone even stealing a jeep! Really car jacking witches? Apparently, silent witches have a bucket of mountains and voodoo to border guards. When I explained the field, I approached, but was it good to let me go? Here's a great atmosphere! "Halloween Mountains" are sometimes creepy, frightening music and intriguing cinematography. All the supporting characters are just as wonderful and bright Patty Shepard plays a good hero. The type of European fear film that can be legendary, is that if someone is concerned only with writing a structured scenario.
