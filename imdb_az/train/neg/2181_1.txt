I watched this movie be one of the oldest B movies to watch. I'm wrong! This film was boring and focused on men who were looking for open-minded women. The story was so ridiculous and unbelievable that it completely lost my interests. Ed Wood seemed to be in the same genre as the film - at the bottom of the barrel.
