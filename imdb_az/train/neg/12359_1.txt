I really thought it was a terrible movie - I actually screamed on TV several times. One or both of homosexuals was in a bad state; There was no chemistry among them, and Richard Ruccolo seemed to want more than a dog kiss. The film covers long and torture, illumination of every violation and makeup, but enhances the cause of each other among any details. <br /> <br /> Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg are shining like symbols, but they are different. does not rent the movie. Protect your money.
