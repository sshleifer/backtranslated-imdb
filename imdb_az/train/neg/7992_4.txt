I remember this movie long ago on television. I recall that most of the film was attacked by anthrax-eaten by the hotel's occupiers. <br /> <br /> Recently I pulled into the television late at night. I'm sure this was a mistake, because such films usually disappear from the existence and never find it! Suzanne Somers plays the vacationer at Lakewood Manor (at the top of his career at Chrissy at Three Company). Construction workers build a swimming pool outside and worry about the ants' nest. Otherwise, I'm telling you that they are inclined to each other * NEST *! One of the workers is really attacked by ants. They divide their one-minute dresses and cover them in the next minute. At the next stage there is a skeleton in the dirt. <br /> <br /> If you think it's too far, Myrna Loy is a wheelchair-resident with a helicopter driven by Manor! <br /> <br /> The final scenes are depicted by Suzanne, Robert Foxworth, and the back of a third person sitting in a room! <br /> <br /> This film is mostly a movie. No "disaster" was filmed or a "big star". It was supposed to be a "large-scale" television activity at that time. <br /> <br /> If you want to capture Suzanne Somers in the best way, follow one episode of three companies. <br /> <br /> Myrna is doing everything to put bread on the table and pay bills. <br /> <br /> 0/10
