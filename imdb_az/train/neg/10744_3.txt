The first was mainly giant rats, but there were some horses and a huge chicken there. But this is just a giant rats cycle, a good giant rats and a really young boy. This is a grown-up guy and a scientist trying to help him, because he accidentally creates giant killer rats ... you know how. This movie has some killing and moments, but I find it to be the same with the original, but I choose a number of advantages in my giant creature films. Yes, that's not right ... I really like the "Empire of Mixtures", maybe I'm not just gigantic rodents. All this is really a strange one, it's a single turn of events in an imaginary sequence, though it's a lot of trouble. I can not just make this offer.
