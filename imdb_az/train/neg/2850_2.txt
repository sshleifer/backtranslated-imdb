If I realized that John Wayne was in this movie, I would not watch it. It resembles Japan, which is unlucky for Hollywood and embarrasses any thinker. But then, most of John Wayne's films are so. Fifty years ago, Hollywood believed that Americans loved everywhere in the world when the truth (and still) was somewhat different. The film belongs to the 19th century Japanese isolation. Maybe Hollywood needs to be insulated. To put it as short as possible, this movie is horrified by the cinqoist depression (sort a Madama Butterfly with bad music.)
