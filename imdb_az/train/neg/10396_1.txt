"My mistakes ..." (The DVD does not give anything, instead of a non-complicated controversial director, Chris Morris, "a short film including scenes," to make myself a filmmaker and a bit of dark and provocative humor. quoted). <br /> <br /> It's strange to watch the scene in the church (especially since we've been very well acquainted with Morris's attitude towards it, and I need to avoid this insipid (and frequent attack) twoddle piece. <br /> <br /> Pedophilia is known for its famous TV series, Brass Eye) and serves another purpose for shock. <br /> <br /> This movie will be called a comedy I'll never understand. <br /> <br /> The opponent's interpretation is in principle a new idea (I have been a runner-up, there is a very interesting and crucial perspective in the filmmaking process) but this is not a pity here. Instead, before we think that there are really big movies playing dogs, we get treatment for some public schoolchildren who come across dogs on the movie. <br /> <br /> It can be said that this film will not go somewhere. The audience is surprising and unsatisfactory, based on a high level of multitasking for its composition, character, and dialogue. <br /> <br /> In this film there are moments of fake Caucasian surrealism, but in the end it is impossible to convince him. For those who really want to shoot a very short film, I strongly recommend that Peter Kappaldi "Franz Kafka is a wonderful life".
