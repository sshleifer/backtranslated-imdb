WARNING: I advise anyone not to read this comment on the movie yet. <br /> <br /> Although Hamilton did not see them all, Hamilton was not convinced that he was having a sad fun. I am entertained! I thought this film sucked with fun at the end of the semi-filthy behavior, fraudulent assault scheme and much of the declining movie! People are not people, not humans, or wait for people to wait for them, wait for OH, NOT TELL YOU! Perhaps these guys are eaten, or are they humble, or what are these? Perhaps perhaps they just considered "people" or eating cannibals for a long time, that people, or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE! Well, if you think the Hamiltons are good, why, why, why, why, why it was so awesome? it just terrified me! A great BOOOOOOO The Hamiltons! See The Gravedancers, Dental and Nail, or Borderland for a game play !!!!!
