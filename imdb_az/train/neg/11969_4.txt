If you want to have fun, do not see this movie. Do not miss this movie if you want to see war heroes. Do not watch this movie if you want good play and a perfect scenario. If you like typical Hollywood war movies that end up in a timely fashion to prosecute the public about the grandeur and glory of war, you see THIS SOURCE. Otherwise, do not waste your time. I am always interested in war movies, because I think that if they do good, they will teach us something about paradoxical and worthless warfare. This film shows a bunch of fugitive cliff lines, the most advanced things, and protects the oppressed with the same strong and brutal protection given to the oppressed. This film is a shame to film the United States! Do you think that you are a human being from Europe, Africa, or another country, and what follows, is it really what the Americans really are? Does anyone hate us? Please, please, please, please do not take time to this paragraph; If necessary, wait and rent. 4/10
