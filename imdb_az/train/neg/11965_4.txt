Especially as a historical hazelnut interested in this historical event, I was very disappointed with the film. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ em> </ em> </ em> <br /> <br /> <strong> movie history. When I heard Eveytime started with the victorious background music, I knew I had to prepare a scenic scene with another trivial filler. Obviously, the producers used to "staging" heavily and decided to evaluate their money. <br /> <br /> Despite their outstanding performance, their dialogue was still boring and their symbols were not developed. When Peter Otoole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene, I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Their threats were so weak and meaningless that I do not believe these two Arabs are the same two major actors describing Lawrence and Alcatraz's Bird Man. <br /> <br /> There are worse epics, but this is not the best.
