This movie is bad, funny. In fact, the Mystery Science Theater 3000, a television show with three characters and a parody of bad movies, used to mock the movie. <br /> <br /> Please do not see the Hobgoblin when you are not ready to stop at the first stage. Actually, I do not see this movie. Please. At least not serious. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, a few days before, keep yourself cautious. Read the book. Laundry. Everything is more entertaining by looking at Hobgoblins.
