For my life I do not understand the admiration and loyalty of this completely unusual movie ... and therefore I think I have the qualities I have been saying .... I've been a former Special Operations Soldier for 14 years, a lifestyle ... it was unusual and clearly written by someone in the army who has little or no experience in life, struggle for survival, or command or team level. <br /> <br /> Three EOD children have gone through Baghdad themselves? Get the facts ... Do not have a team chain ????? Get the facts ... EOD cleaning buildings ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper skilled buck sergeant ???? Get it real .... Wait ... I hit a bad guy and killed him, and then two guys take me away without throwing another shot or injury? ???? Be real ... I just got punched by my wife, entering another civilian home, armed with a 9 mile, then to get to camp in the middle of Bagdad at night, I like a very talkative or confrontation in an Iraqi civilian carjack ???? Actually ... <br /> <br /> The military protocol has absolutely no basis, and there is no resemblance to any military unit I encounter. In contravention of this poor film, EOD is looking for men and women who are generally unbelievable and disrespectful, but highly skilled professionals are not adrenaline who perform incredibly hard work.
