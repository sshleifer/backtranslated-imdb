I'm a Christian, and I'm telling you that this movie is terrible, unrealistic, and entirely a front-line front for Christianity. You can also recall "remember your titans" and at least do not mix in a football movie like a formic steroid for those who are losing Muslims. <br /> <br /> In this movie, I made some striking comments about some of the things that disturbed me. <br /> <br /> The school was in Georgia and was a white academy school. I did not see a black student or player at school. I was dealing with the White Christian "academies in Paradise, and they did not build up except for the restoration of the separation. When it comes to movie, Christianity, and Christ's life changing ... how to change segregation hearts? (Note: I liked black black coaches, totally white team and all black "Giants" players). <br /> <br /> 2. Not everyone who likes this movie is unritical by Christianity. Could it be said that several people are worse than other films, bad movies, bad writing, and short poverty? If we compare it with another football movie, will we have the same character and energy? 3. The half-baked Christianity shown to me was less meaningful to me until it was unrealistic to me. If Christianity is to pray simply to read a small book and begin a full life change, no wonder that no one will listen to what Christians say. We want to sell Christ as a cure. It does not need to be sold and it is not necessary to join this charming lifestyle. <br /> <br /> I can say that this film can be inspirational for a few people, and that everyone thinks that Christianity is anti-intellectual. Most likely, this will not happen. It will not give you a real look of combat and heart tension. The most important thing for me is that Christian is not a tool or a luggage. It has these values, but as a positive thought, a quiet "weight-of-the-by-the-bootstraps" message falls short. If you live alongside people who are struggling and / or living in a third world, this movie will be empty because many churches are still in their religion today.
