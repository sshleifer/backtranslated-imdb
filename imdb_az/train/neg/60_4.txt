I liked Goldie Hawn and wanted her another movie, when I saw the Protocol for $ 5.50 in Walmart. Despite being intimate, the film does not take any steps. <br /> <br /> The scenes of a party in the bar at some stages continue for a long time, and there is really no purpose. <br /> <br /> Then, of course, at the end of the film, the film is so bad that I'm worried about the whole layer. I do not think this scene has been added to the movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, though I have another Hawn movie, I am not the same as the foolish comedies that teach me a lesson! I'm sure I'll pay for it!
