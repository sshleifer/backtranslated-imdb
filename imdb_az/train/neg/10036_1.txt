Sometimes I can not figure out what the filmmakers think when they shoot a movie ... I watched it (2007) and then had a traumatic experience and thought that they did not do it anymore. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red; "> Zero story, predictable plot, plenty of Akshay Kumar stunts and watching Kareena after its major weight loss is another interesting thing ... <br /> Music is another great catastrophe ... they have taken the time to give smaller dialogues and Akshay Kumar does not plan to sing in the background of scenes while stunts ...! this song is so beautiful that it will be compared to Tasan Mein and not be filmed in a music album! :-( If you plan to watch this movie, I would say that you can watch this background song to listen ... 'Bachchan Bachchan Pandey ...' <br /> <br /> Generally, it's very disappointing <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Bhagia tried to speak bad English!
