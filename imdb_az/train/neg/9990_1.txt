By watching this movie on the SciFi channel, we can only say that it was prepared by many amateurs who did not have a movie in the life of this movie. The film is an infinite sequence of strange incidents or "pleases" as my friend tells me about my shoulder. The area is not really worth the comment, but a plane carrying mostly footballers has hit the Yeti area. Before the end of the film, we missed enough to try to escape 50 meters, yet a woman who killed a bird with a 30-foot bird was killed by an orphaned bullet and without any damage, holding a foot a jump from the abyss, then jump and a collection of more strange events. Basically, you do not have to stay on a Saturday, or watch the movie, for the sake of watching the sci-fi movies. Or my friend, who reads on my shoulder, says: "This is the best movie I've ever seen." As my friend on the right says, "Only the technique of battle has improved it."
