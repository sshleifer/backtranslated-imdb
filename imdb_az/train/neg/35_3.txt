Sexo Cannibal or Devil Hunter begins with an assistant Jane (Gisela Hahn) for a new movie, with actress and model Laurea Crawford (Ursula Fellner, Ursula Buchfellner) when she is recognized among more English-speaking audiences. After a long day of work, Laura relaxed in her room's bathroom when she was abducted by two traumatic characters named Chris (Werner Pochath) and Thomas (Antonio Mayans), who was helped by the treacherous Jane. Laura's agent is on the horizon to get Peter Weston (Al Cliver) alerting the situation, the theft make Laura isolated island and require 6 million ransom. If Peter returns to 200,000 euros and returns back from 10 to 6 million, decide on how Peter and his Vietnamese Vet-friendly helicopter pilot Jack Island and Laura will get a faster drainage pipe. So, the kidnapped Laura & Peter do not want them to give more than 6 million, but not too much. Just as a primitive tribe of this special isolated island (Hell, we could only build a straw hut in all the generations it lives there, now primitive), some cannibal monster prevents the eyes of a person who is worshiping a friend (Burt Altman) and this cannibal young, white woman was able to love meat and gut ... <br /> <br /> This is controlled by prolific Jesus Franco, who is also a co-producer of Spanish, French and German production, as well as music. Sexo Cannibal came to a popular place in the UK because he was placed in the 'Video Nasties' list in the early 1980s, and is therefore officially classified as "unusual and prohibited" and has no idea what a bad film and even Turkish Franco, who does not fear being afraid, decides that Clifford wants to hide under Brown's beating. Even the most difficult Franco fan would have thought it would be a challenging period. Written by Franco means Julius Valery, who is obviously something else, because I'm surprised by Clifford Brown and Julian Esteban over the finished product and does not want his name to be deleted. It's so straightforward and straight forward. For a beginner, the film is not so dull, it's not the truth, but one of the most terrible things in the stolen area, the tension and the excitement, and the terrifying side of the things we get from a great black boy is not improving with bloody eyes and two small cannibal scenes. As a horror movie, Sexo Cannibal fails and is not successful as an adventure adventure, which is one to avoid. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Franco, Director, Yamyam scenes are weak, the action is bare, and there are infinite scenes of people browsing up from "A" to "B" and they do not do anything there. It is extremely dull and tedious to watch after about 10 minutes, and this is going on in an unbroken state of 94 minutes. When Al Cliver is about to climb a cliff, I also have to point out a fun scene, which is by Franco's turn to the camera and sliding on the Cliver floor! Just look at the coat and he will not be able to hold anything back because he is alone with himself! Gore is not so large and Europe's cannibal films go so far that the fire creates a bit of burns, because the meat breaks out, a man slams gravel, has a bloodstream and has a palm of the bowels. <br /> Sexo Cannibal had a small budget and I said low. This is a poor film with terrific special effects and sub-production values. Only good thing about this subject, at least the original, seems to be a jungle. Music eats and sound effects are scarred as it is very heavy breath when the cannibal screen is on the screen. Sexo Cannibal is a terrifying movie that fulfills a fatal mistake of being bored as hell. Only good things can be said that there is a certain confusion, and the relatives of the chewing gum are pretty much the same. Everyone who looks for a good cinematography experience should give Sexo Cannibal as wide as possible.
