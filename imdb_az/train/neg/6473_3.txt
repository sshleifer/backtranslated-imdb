The first charge as a child ("The Little Mermaid") was my favorite movie. It was full of great characters, songs and fun family movies. I watched this movie for the first time in a week or so. I believe that this movie was the most read and did not exceed the original. I think that maybe I feel this way because I've had high expectations and grew up. But this is not a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Ariel begins only when a beautiful child is born Melody. Eric and Ariel Morgan (Eursel's sister) feel threatened, so they build a huge wall around their seaside home. As his melody grows, he begins to surprise himself with the walls where he is banned from going. <br /> <br /> Morgana tries to control seven seas. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give any of the films. I love singing the same and more beautifully. I think it's generally a good family movie!
