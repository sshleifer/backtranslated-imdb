Jon Pertwee "It's very difficult to be funny, but it's easy to be unhappy," he said. PASTY FACES "Very Easy" when it's in good condition. David Backer (Director / Movie Director) and his sculpted slogan are very loud and sound too high, using the Britcomlar and the sophisticated sketch of stage design and progress, such as comedy LOCK STOCK. Alan McCaffrey is particularly vulnerable to this kind of OTT performance, but is not enough to destroy the film. <br /> <br /> PASTY FACES is scared at every front, especially in the violin direction. I did not understand why it ended in this way, but it stopped in a very sudden and foolish manner. Oh and other disclosure errors You need a green card to get a visa and work there to travel to the United States. This movie can come off the plane and start a new life in America without any permission. I'm still paying for blood donation in the United States - people who are familiar with America and those who donated blood said they made payments for donations suspended several years ago and that you could buy any weapon from the gun shop. As I know the laws of arms in the United States, there is a difference in state from state to state, but no arms dealers sell anti-tank weapons. So, we have a very wrong view of America than a very unreal and very unsuccessful movie. Perhaps this is the revenge for the Hollywood view of the Scots for the BRAVEHEART? Maybe, but this does not stop PASTY FACES from being a crap comedy
