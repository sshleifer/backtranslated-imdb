This surprising loss of production money is a proof of the film that can be foolish and obedient as a rich and famous politician. This project, played by Tennessee Williams (a fool), and directed by Joseph Losey and directed by Taylor, Burton and Noel Coward (deadly), was shot in the mountain island palace on the magnificent cliff in the Mediterranean Sea in 1967 won the winner. The result is stubbornly denying that it is very absurd and tedious. The film is magnificent, but it is the fact that the nature of the setting and the use of a real house is a fact. Frustrated Taylor, half of Burton's dreams, dreams of dialogue, Noel Qoraev laughs, funny stories and plotting devices, and entertaining antiques of absurd costumes just irritates the audience. BOOM is a clear sign that a disgrace, loss of money and talent, and a magnificent man's beard, as well as the rest of the planet. Not even fun. Only a terrible and terrible waste of waste.
