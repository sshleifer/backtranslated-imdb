After reading other reviews for this movie, the movie I was watching was terrific because it was awesome that with some wooden, poor scripts and plodding predictable leadership, some surprising backdrops with great broom vistas and dramatic skies and wide open prairies in this movie, unfortunately, When a movie is the most memorable thing, be sure to be a warning sign of the quality behind the gamers is a pretty stunning scenery, and it's best not to add the entire film to the western genre at the cheapest price available on DVD.
