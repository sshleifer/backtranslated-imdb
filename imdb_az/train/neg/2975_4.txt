After seeing HILLSIDE CANNIBALS, I immediately watched it, so something improved. Thereupon ZOMBI is 3 to 28 days late and then the comparison will stop me. Unfortunately, I was watching more and more about how well Danny Boyle understood the original and that this movie was effective after 28 weeks. <br /> <br /> This is the Italian horror film of more than 28 franchises. If ZOMBIE was the latest in 1980 or 1981 - My essay was called up to the age of 28 (Geddit?), But this page was released in 1988. All production values ​​indicate that tens of thousands of budgets have been crushed into one of the earliest parts of the decade. <br /> <br /> I like this movie as a fifteen year old schoolgirl in 1982, but not as it is now. Most of the problem is that there is no internal stability. For example, some zombies mix with a snail speed, others can move very fast and differentiate themselves, causing a ridiculous last space on DJ. In the same way, it is possible to kill some people with kick, while others are injured, wait until you see the refrigerator, just laugh. Even serious characters suffer from such controversial scenarios that a single character indicates that he is a helicopter pilot, causing me to use jeeps for the military's career. Of course, he recalled the Kyrgyz movie reminiscent of the previous 28 films. The terrorist squad also enters the scientific base that causes all kinds of disasters, and the victim is trying to kill both the infected and the survivors, and before the end, you will be dealing with the death of everyone. The problem was that the English franchise was better in a larger budget. Not only this, but 28 franchisees will appeal to an audience of audience who can show little interest in the middle-hero film. ZOMBI 3 will appeal to the audience, not to anyone, a heavy splash
