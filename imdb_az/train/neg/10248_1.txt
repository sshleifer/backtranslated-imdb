The end of the world resembles a good film in the box cover, but it was warned that it was bad. Mega star player Christopher lee was a great admirer of me. It does not mean that a good cast as tentacles (77) will be a good movie. From start to finish, it looks awkward to look forward to the future, and it's too dark to see what will happen to most of the movie. Like Lew Ayres, Dean Jagger and MacDonald Carey, as security guards. Christopher Lee deceived this movie, which would have been better than the Charles band, which had a good animated movie like animater and dolls.i. Jola Ferrer, John Carridine and Dean Jagger.well Dean Jagger was going to be going to make two good movies after the storyline.dean Jagger, better storyline.dean (Lucky), if the other two used a larger budget to make a movie about the end of the world ; The crocodile (80) and the death game (79) sue Lyon (Lolita) also denied their lollipop.if to tell you an excitement in the whole film in the world of an eagle for at least punishment.
