This film put me in a difficult situation. It was a great concept that was destroyed by this terrible post. The story just flowed and left the best way. This story had many elements that were not explained or put in place with any real thought. Elements such as the story of love could have been a little wider, and the balls needed to be written better. all the main character needs more things to do, the more training they get and the less about staying around. everyone likes a good "little boy out" story and promised, but the scripting failures. Although there were some pyro-technical structures in the last battle sequence, he was thirsty for lack of choreography. <br /> <br /> It would be very good :(
