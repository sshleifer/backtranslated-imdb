Rookie has long suffered. Jerry Lewis has casual music tracks drawn through the film, a lengthy senseless scrip and a pretty confused rifle. Noonan and Leavitt do not know when it's time to go. The story will take about an hour to complete the final field and the demolition of the characters. Then children play Japanese sailors with the standard racist cartoon of the day. The funniest parts of the movie Noonan and Leavitt are a shame when playing stereotypical Japanese children. However, it is extremely tiring after switching back and forth between the two sets of characters. Then it just ends. <br /> <br /> There is really little attraction in the film, and it's more than half an hour. Story is just trying to create funny situations and fail. Click on Martin & Lewis. At least Deano was attractive, and Jerry was a cartoon character.
