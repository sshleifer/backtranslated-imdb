When I saw the front view, I thought it would be a great movie. And it could have been really. The actress who played a key role was very safe and the beauty of the film could not be denied. But the dialogs darkened the whole picture. The level of language was very familiar and up-to-date for an action that took place in 1610 and took the magic part of the movie. However, the English subtitles were more subtle and relevant to the original French wishes, and it is likely that they are well-known in the imbd.
