I started watching this movie, but some intolerant hammer horror movie wannabe ... and I was not far away. There is a fair amount of imagination, and they are very nudged, but the next half of the film is moving forward. The holy cow actually gave a little thought to the story and did not fall asleep in anticipation of what was expected at the outset. <br /> <br /> In some cases, this is part of the "cold-blooded" nudity, because it corresponds to the story and the setting. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong though, as it's still a bad movie, but go to bad movies, it's a more shrewd shade than a really terrific tripe like Mesa like Lost Womens and Robot Wolves.
