This film gives a promising start, and then it becomes too complicated and dark. Kamal Hasan made a great effort to see the period correctly, unfortunately, he did not spend much time on the field. Most of the characters in the film do not appear for a specific reason. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's not too much sad, I suggest you stay away from this movie.
