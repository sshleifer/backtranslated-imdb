Ronald Colman won Best Actor Oscar for performance performance, especially as a popular scene speaker who lost his role completely like Shakespeare's Othello. Critically-lauded George Cukor is a beautiful studio written by the team evaluated by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, witty festivity here is self-conscious, and the backyard is over. Miklós Rózsa also won the Oscars for his account and Shelley Winters is a difficult waitress with a few wonderful moments (the theater asks Colman when he asks him: "What's Next?"). Otherwise, these scenarios are very surprisingly quick and not funny. * From 1/2
