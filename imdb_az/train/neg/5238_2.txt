I do not understand the positive comments about this movie. At every level, it is cheap and bad, and I do not understand how much it is prepared. <br /> <br /> Cartoon characters are many - Sue's mistaken, alcoholic, layabout, Irish father is a good example. None of the characters are remotely sympathetic - just like Sue's Asian companion, she is even capable of family violence! Both of them are quite as confused as Rita and / or Sue have no idea that they will throw themselves in a creepy, like Bob, but why should I take care of them? Many viewpoints keep thinking about how "realistic" it is. <br /> <br /> "I did not like this movie very much.
