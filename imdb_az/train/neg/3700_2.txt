This is the only way to keep in mind that this movie is a waste of time and money. A poor reminder for a romantic comedy is a remake called "Heaven Can Wait" (at least watchable). It's a great way to spend some time in the movie to weaken a good comedy. Particularly his jokes are usually from the old, fat, rich, dead man's body, but he shows himself to Rock. It is a mistake when cheating on teens and teens. The film is not funny, the weakest player is the weakest. Rent "Heaven Can Wait" and a live Rock video and you will be on the road before the game.
