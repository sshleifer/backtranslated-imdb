First, it takes half an hour to get Hackman out of jail and start the job. How much loss of time, we all know that Hackman goes out to do some work for his masters, why not lose about a third of the movie in these series. Then Hackman stays in a hotel and the story oil does not go anywhere, just telling us that Hackman looks at us in the near future and knows what he or she knows by the masters. Again, 20 minutes. Then there are more leisure time that shows a merger with your spouse. All of this should take at least 10-15 minutes as a set of true action, intrigue and plot folios. When I went to the real movement, I was so bored that I wanted the movie to end. Hackman is as great as the usual and other actors, but it's the first honeycomb.
