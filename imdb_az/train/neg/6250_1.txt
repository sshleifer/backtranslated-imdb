I really liked this show once. That is, until all the shortcomings take place. This is very unrealistic. I know it's artistic, but it's not even a little convincing. Therefore. ** Spoilers ahead of the nation ... ** Do we really believe that a child like Yugie will have a descendant of ancient Pharaoh Pharaoh? C'mon! It is the largest nerd in the world. What are the hair of Pharaoh (Atem or Yami)? Finally, I checked on the Pharaohs, wearing a shaved and fancy cupboards, except for a small hairstyle. <br /> <br /> And we're convinced that a wealthy boy can do a legitimate job while Seto Kaiba continues to spend time to go to a stylish little school like The Domino's Highness? Puh-leeze! First, he legally had to become an adult to manage a company. And this is not really a genius of a child because he is the only one in the class. And secondly, why was going to a school like "Domino High" when his business was successful enough to participate in the fancy snobbish academy? Moreover, his younger siblings are very pleasing and naked. Every time you turn around, he was kidnapped by the goons for the boy's badge. <br /> <br /> There is nothing new, there is nothing new. <br /> Joey is a poor child living with a good father. It says Joey is making money to go to school, because his father is alcoholic, but you will never see anything like Joey's work. He does not even speak about work. Her sister Serenity is a complete moron. Why would a cute guy like Tristan choose a snob like Duke (insulting her on television with her brother's dog costume)? Is he really clueless? Throughout the show, various symbols, possessions of satan, stealing souls by demonic forces, and mental illness. (Oh, this child is safe, NOT.) Tea is the only type of girl-door type to be a girlfriend of Yugi / Yami. </ p> <p style = "text- align: justify; All characters are looking at disease and anorexia. <br /> <br /> Probably, Yami says the worst hole in the series is Millennium Puzzle can send back spirits to their bodies. <br /> <br /> Pegasus <br /> <br /> Indeed, for himself, trade is the only side of it, by LittleKuriboh, "Yu-Gi-Oh: The Partial Series <br /> <br /> Please do something more valuable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
