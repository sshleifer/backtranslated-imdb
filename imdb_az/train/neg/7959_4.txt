Andy Lau is a star in a hidden tale of another police. Nick also works for Daniel Wu's police and is close to the narcotics gang (Lau). We watch the film trying to build a bust to see if the police go for only one number. Then, we know the mothers and daughters who were exposed to drug addiction near Nick and cronies and police, and closed the 45-minute movie and posted the news. As I have been watching for a long time, this is not a movie that's best to look at in the movie. Not as bad as her, you just do not really care. I want to say that I really did not care. I actually forgot about a subtitled movie, but it just started doing something else, that's how I care. I wish I could hate the movie, but the film was such an imbalance that I did not have any impression on me. What happened after his death? This is something to avoid.
