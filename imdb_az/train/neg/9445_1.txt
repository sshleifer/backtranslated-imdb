Shame Shame for Shame on UA ​​/ DW What's For! <br /> <br /> I was invited. <br /> <br /> Children do not see this movie. Humor is totally inappropriate for children - they are bored and disappointed. Of course, * all of us have read Theo's beautiful children's book and, of course, we have expectations ... but this is a clean garbage. <br /> <br /> Seuss was a shy, and, of course, did not give his "thumbs up" to such a skillful attempt to capitalize on the classic. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, <br /> <br /> Spend your money on the book. If you are a copy owner, buy the book and donate it to a toy for the Tots program. This movie is not worth the look of a "free" ticket. <br /> <br /> Put it on the book. If you want a visual description, the TV cartoon version works well - you can save your money. <br /> <br /> He is a wife. <br /> <br /> He is a wife.
