It was 75 minutes of my life. The move was defective and the plot was ridiculous. It occurs around a bad lesbians who have sex with rich married men and then blackmails them with money. One of the victims is a DA candidate, which creates problems with his wife's relationship. Another plastic surgeon is also married and the bad taste happens to cheat the children's spouse too! Meanwhile, a bad lesbian girlfriend is not really like sleeping around her. All the forgiveness of the place is a happy ending. Women get a lot of things naked, mostly in extreme situations. filthy filthy filth.
