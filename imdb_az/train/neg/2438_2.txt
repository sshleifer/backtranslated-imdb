This humble, who ended his career at Koen Wauters, drew my attention through 'Night Bad Taste'. Based on the comment index, I'm not the first player to be the last person in Western Europe to study this musician (of course, the best in our modern pop scene, and even the Netherlands). Whether or not he or she has not initiated can not be judged. <br /> <br /> "Intensive care" is very unpleasant, but he is concerned with the flick that he has. Nobody blames it. Verheyen Hall of Fame is worthy of all means and standards in its ranking. The story of the Murder Mania, which was meant to be dead in an accident, but was reported several times in live and imaginative, and even a director without a director general is able to present more stories through innovative settings and cinematography. /> <br /> IC contents with a hospital wing and several middle class home. Display tempo. The tension reduces the last part of the music's credibility because it accompanies each killer with a slightly offensive melody, after which the orchestral battles occur during the murder, or they can make them more perfectly flawless as a small budget. Sex scene is free, but not least attractive. A couple from the Amsterdam would have been able to put it into practice. Although the couple is dealing with the topic: The whole subplot does not work between Wauters and the girl. If there were only victims sacrificing their nerves through physical contact, a more effective emotional connection could be made on the screen. Even to other castle members I will not be able to dignify one word because all of them should be cut into small pieces of oil. In fact, most of them do this. I remember the places where the clarity is clear: pretty nurses and two police officers. <br /> <br /> So, a slasher, cavalry comes only to the need for rescue. (Anti-) hero, and often red barks often do not split into these films, but most of them must be deceived by intelligent thinking; they can overcome the illusion of invincibility surrounding the killer. Wauters, translated into events, kills the doctor and ends up in trouble. <br /> <br /> No human being, I did not finish. How this story is not gone. Wauters is making a heroic attempt, but it is beaten by an approaching "A Clockwork Orange", so it is necessary to move the girl to the boring kick and push the doctors' brains. Although this method ensures more deaths than the usual types of 9-millimeter bullets, the doctor survives to reach 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> My opinion should be up to date. Intensive Care is a filthy movie that can only be used by those who love Bad Taste. Verhey's attentive statements and prepare for themselves a bit and try to sit in this way. For example, the cost of the parody costume (unwanted) of the doctor's clown mask (Halloween) and the latest confrontation in the park (end of the 13th of Friday). <br /> <br /> However, the IC provides a summary of several measuring elements that give some credit. George Kennedy is not one of them. All they have to do is terrified by a terrible monologue by another doctor / French actor, and when it was thrown into a flames to label a great name on a stand, it was horrified. He could finish the Naked Gun party again as a beef, but the longer the screen could have been on time. Finals can be one of them. He had begun to fire with a fierce fireball. KÃ¶nen Wauters studied his own lessons and devoted himself entirely to music career. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
