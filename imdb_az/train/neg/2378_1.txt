Why did any legitimate actor reading the script join this shit? My God is ashamed to really follow it. I can not imagine the shame that should make him feel that he is part of the people. At the same time, River Phoenix has a series of debates about whether there is a community in the film. He was forgotten, but here's a list of his (IMDB) role-playing credits. Btw ... Rain was the sister of those who inquired earlier. This movie is proving how great the "name" is. Sow's ears do not make silk bags. I love Lorraine Bracco, but it was sad and sad ... Maybe someone can tell me the reason for this kind of movie one day. It does not have glamorous, entertaining, or even comedic features compared to everything else.
