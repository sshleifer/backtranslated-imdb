It took time to watch the movie. I wanted to leave in the middle of the film, but I resisted. I do not know what Ridley Scott meant, but I learned that women in the army are as stupid as men. They learn to spit, insult and fight, which is (in my opinion) a waste of time. And what was the hell in the last scene in Lybia anyway? Are they still fighting with Gaddafi or is it easy for everyone to endanger the Islamic people?
