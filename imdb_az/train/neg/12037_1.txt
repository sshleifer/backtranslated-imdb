This series is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Terrific toy, terrible effects, terrible writing, my driving. The stories are so beautiful from the legend of Robin Hood. They just seem to want to use the name Robin Hood to attract the audience. <br /> <br /> Mr. Bland's new actors could also be acting. <br /> <br /> If someone is dreaming of me, I love this show. This is a terrific approach to the television series. Such a visual media should not force your imagination to make things worse. It's like the episode of Simpson that Homer is trying to burn his brain with a religious propaganda film and tells about who and who killed him. "If a movie was rich, I only prepare my own story." In the end: Absolute human waste.
