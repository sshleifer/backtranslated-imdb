This film is probably the cheapest, most poorest and most poorly trained poster. <br /> However, it is the most fun and most mocked movie ever made by Disney, and laughs at the beginning with patience and nudity. <br /> <br /> Then give Belle a new loser who has lost three He decides to burn things by drawing a donation letter. The episode passes through this small episode, Belle has my eyes on the walls, and I'm very laughing. Then, more and more fight over the Beast and then learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they? Of course, it is old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Lumiere is the world's largest doping when it comes to romance. It comes from a man who wants to swallow any woman. And they make FiFi a psychotic villainess trying to kill Belle, and they are winding to get rid of the rats until the end. What a message to send children! <br /> <br /> Therefore, the next thing is that Mrs. Potts is unhappy. After the next, Beast is talking about having a bird, it's just as terrifying as it seems to be. <br /> Animation is so ugly and kills. <br /> <br /> Belle is a simpering handle of a blubbers, a string of wire when something goes wrong. <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br> But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. He was destroyed. I can not describe it. <br /> <br /> Therefore, see yourself and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I give it 1/10 for the sop, but I give 10/10 for the comedy.
