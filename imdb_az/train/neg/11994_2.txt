Another great star, another glamorous set, another famous director, is a flick with songs jumping to the buster, but what's missing at the end of the day is a story that every movie expects from a great budget movie movie. Without the red carpet premiere, it was a lot of things hidden around the film. Anil Kapoor went on to say that the film was one of the best love stories after Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge. Good Anilji, what movie did you talk about? The film area has a different position throughout the lives of approximately 6 different pairs and 12 different people, but despite their different approach to life, they all have a common problem, LOVE. The subject of really luring. But the film's charm will reduce the audience's last-lasting expectations from a huge number of films. These films absolutely hate me because I spend 4 hours in the theater after spending a lot of money for a multiplex ticket because it is always in trouble for leap. <br /> <br /> Unhappy starts from the beginning. The director mixes so confidently with how confident he is to spend time on shooting even the six different stars. Some women, such as Anil Kapoor-Juhi and Sohail Khan, do not give any meaning to their presence in the film (even if they are against it). Salman (Who's called Rahouoooool in a strange way to all the movie, like Rahoooooool) wants to be cooler again with Vid√© kinda Hindi accent. Hey Sallu Bhai, now married Aish, and at least go to Abhishek to increase your mobility. A simple striptease is not always a box office. And Anilji stops trading brand beard shaving or looks just like an eunuch. A girl of your daughters' age is just not invisible when watching Jack Nicholson in a romantic movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> Nihilji, do not shoot so many scenes in a film that is not absolutely necessary for the shooting! <br /> <br /> Another major flaw in the film is. Each story brings itself together to form a neat Salaam-E-Ishq field, as it has been taken from a variety of filters. <br /> <br /> Bollywood has to learn a lot from movies such as Snatch, Memento, and the director knows he knows the perfect art of working out a variety of irreconcilable sequences to create a perfect mix of story lines. <br /> <br /> While evaluating pre-freedom, the film's predicament was that somebody was not good at the film, because the name of this movie is 28, and 28 is considered bad in Numerology. But I say that the film will fail for the lack of numbering deficiencies, but I am totally drawn to the stand, but due to the many flaws in the film. <br /> <br /> Like Nikolai Advani, the director could have made such big mistakes on the entire story line. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is my suggestion for all children. Do not hesitate to watch this movie in any way. It's not worth the money you have to pay for the ticket. There are better movies on theater screens that are currently worth watching than Salam-E-Ash.
