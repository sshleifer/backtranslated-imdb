I only give 3 stars for Africa's beautiful pictures. The rest ... were quite boring. There is a description of the plot about 50 minutes ... How long was the introduction of the war in worlds lasted about 10 minutes? Then it was a real move! It's a beautiful sunset, "Let's Go With the Savanna!" Something like that. And "Do not kill the filth!" They can give some messages. Very ecologically. I would talk about it not from a "new" Steven Segal movie ... An important actress is telling me artificial sun tan, dyed hair and very basic! I did not see or sweat a scene that was breaking her hair, her clothes were dusty. It does not look like a 19th-century woman! And at the bar, your heroine is making a comment about the commander who looks like Swayze, Dracula. Hmmm wrote Bram Stoker's book and published it in 1896 and became popular in the following years. Livingstone and other researchers traveled to central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So, if the strike did not happen between 1896-1900 ... Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze creates a nice impression .. In short - it's tough outside, but soft and cuddly inside. I do not cling to a walnut, but you get the point. Indeed, he has repeatedly looked at his footsteps. She stayed in the movie. The road is very long and increasingly boring. do not watch! Do not buy! It's a waste of money!
