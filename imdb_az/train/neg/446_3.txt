It was a disappointment. It was good enough, but when it went and lost every opportunity, it fell flat. Maria Schrader's player is terrible, does not mean anything, and even says it before. She did not feel the truth for her mother's story, but for her lover. Together with Lena, Lena's story was less than academic interest. Lenin and his mother had no real relationship, and his mother had a good time at the wedding. The parallelism between Hannah's "mixed" romance and her relationship with her mother was like a clich√©, and it did not weaken anyway. The wedding was totally unconvincing and terrible. The objection of the protest was dim, and regardless of whether Lena had any influence on the outcome or not, she always showed a lot of sense in time, a remarkable look, and unexplained ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the film had any depth and spark. It was very difficult to care for any of them, even a small Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why did he leave the hotel away from the hotel?) Therefore, there are no contexts or explanations. If any reference was removed to him, that would not have been possible. <br /> <br /> A simple story has created a confusion with the development of a weak character (whose mother?), led by a weak and acting like everyone else. What do you mean, "calm down on a crown"? ... I began to think that it was worth 7, but to win 3 after the film falls gradually to 4 and then silliness of the fairy tale. As I have seen, it was a cold and sterile film. A terrible loss of a good story.
