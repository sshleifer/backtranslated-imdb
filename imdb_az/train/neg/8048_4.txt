Think you are on an empty island in the last decade. Scream did not hear and Halloween part 1 went to the cinema. <br /> <br /> Now this movie would be an explosion and an entirely new look on the horror scene. <br /> <br /> The IMDb currently has a rating of 2.7 and this is not worth the assessment. <br /> <br /> According to some information, "I know what you are doing" cut off all the paths, to whom and to whom and when and when the end came, who made me happy and satisfied. a coke, a madrassa and a tough structure, a beautiful flick though no challenge to get deeper characters. When video rental is out of top names, you can take it without risk, but do not expect masterwork. I've seen so bad.
