Terror film is based on a budget of about $ 9.99. Very clear miniature kits, a weak storyline, and a horrible storyline about the foreigners using a butcher for butterfly for fuel. Some films in the movie (not enough to worry) and a character with an eggbeater that replaces one's hands. <br /> <br /> A Saving Grace is a "talented show" (how mocking?) A "punctual missile" by a punk / new wave band. "Besides, it's not worth your time, bad "is good, watch your favorite alien movies, but everyone needs to be in the steering wheel. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1 out of 10
