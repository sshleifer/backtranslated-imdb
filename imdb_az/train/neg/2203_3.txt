Pay attention to all crazy scientists everywhere: if you want to make your son a genetically mutated monster, you have to give him a more terrible name than Paul. Do you have a clever trenching teeth and a dreadful hammer shark with the pressure of people in the water and the dry land? Give your child a better name, such as "Thor", "Rock" or "Tiburon". Even if he eats me, you probably laugh there, "Yes, take this burden! Paul's monster breaks me to break up !!!!!" The worst part of this film is that the shark is called "Paul" throughout the whole meadow. What a decent, terrible horror film may be, may sound loyal. There is no other campaign of Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy, and there are no defective parts. Scientists spend all the movies traveling across the island, and when girls go straight into the thunderous woods, it becomes scarce and, of course, "Paul must pour water on his feet to remove itching." SciFI Channel was right in this movie But a small silver lining in a film with another disappointment.
