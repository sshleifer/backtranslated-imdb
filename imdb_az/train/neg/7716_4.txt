If I remembered the film very much, I had a great time to see this movie. But we can say that this film should have killer tomatoes, and the most memorable things in this movie are the songs and scenes of elderly couples who talk about old Timmy. The only scenes that affect the fear and satiation are the fact that the film is spread around small tomatoes and large tomatoes outside of the film, and people need to see it in such a film. However, you just do not have to do a good comedy on a very absurd point and an attractive theme song. This movie should be B movie, something to be taken seriously, but you still have to make jokes that are funny and do not try to give a mildly fun place to a completely discreet movie. It would probably be a short time as an artist showing the older couple shown above, and a person trying to put a tomato under a tomato was really good. The trailer itself was like a fake trader, but they were actually a complete movie and made a very weak thing.
