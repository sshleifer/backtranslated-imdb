This movie is really hard. In addition to the spiritual truth that is expressed at the peak of the movie about people in the neighborhood who participated in the fight against crime, there is really nothing I can say about it. Besides, there was nothing in the film: good shots, good toys, and good writing. I'll give this movie a F and 2 at 10.
