This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I have seen a few films. It is a film of art, but it's actually a piece of trash. This rescue quality is a beautiful tango dance, but it can not prepare Sally Potter for a definite expense. The essence of this film is not exhaustive, and I will laugh until the end. In particular, he begins to read. This is completely non-realistic.
