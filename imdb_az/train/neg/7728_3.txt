.... this mini does not improve with age. I saw it and it was something that happened after it was first released and it was blown up as many others. In early 2002, I paid both for WOW and W and R, and more impressed. Then I decided again and spent $ 200 for DVDs. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; read the novels and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> First, check out the screen for someone who has been published and is not old enough to follow the reaction (warning - these people's reactions seem frightened to snowy laughter). <br /> <br /> This mini-Dan Curtis extract Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum Yikes! Production quality, music score, dialogue - a great story, turned into the late 70th soap opera by an overwhelming ambitious producer / director over his head. <br /> <br /> <br IMO - this mini is almost live up to his reputation and seriously fancies. breaks down.
