Dolph Lundgren faces stars like an old police / boxer looking at Boston's strange scene to find those who killed his good-minded brother in the public, but blame his brother for using strange sex and blame the comrade. Dolph Lundgren is very good in this movie, in fact, based on his performance here, Lundgren can forget about the role of joining the glory. Lundgren, who said that the material did not give anything to work with Lundgren, was really left to dry out in a predictable and incomprehensible fearful tension. Co-Star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact, when the movie, Lundgren and Brett are at the center of chemistry, it works best, really taking the time to explore the relationship that the film's film is worthy of. However, the film is inviolable, the action is virtually absent, the plot is not intelligent enough (Brother Blair is very bored about his brother's Lundgren investigation) and the film is unnecessarily horrible and ridiculous. Once again, Lundgren is actually really good (like newcomer Danielle Brett), but the film is later a lumber of sequences that cause a particularly disappointing film. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;
