Vision is interesting, but it's flat in the originality department. This tiring word in the nature becomes subtle after the opening war. Jude Law has burnt toast, but in defense this film is the worst dialogue ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the script is so poor that it pulls you out of the movie and sends me work, invoices, dogs and so on. He thought about it. Bluescreen has many moments screaming. Paltrow like wooden them. It could be saved by the noisy dialogue of the bored film or over the upper camp. The only complaint of my technique would be black and white (apologies, computer), because Turner appeared black and white. Only a great lifting clich√© confusion. I already broke my femur rather than sitting with this endurance test.
