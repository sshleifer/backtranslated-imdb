This movie was so much anticipated that you hope the obvious suspect is innocent all the time, and there is still another big twist. But ... not. She continues to be creepy, and she continues to ignore it. Did Mary bring a lot of evidence to her and still trust her? And what was "trapped in the trap"? There was no trap. He stood up and said, 'Forgive me and kill someone!' He left and it was his end. They try to use other suspects (like an elderly carnival girl later), but are not fully developed. In fact, all the characters have been developed less. They did not have depth and a grave was strange ... it depends on a recycling plant? It's crazy and nothing is going well. For example: after leaving the beer, she leaves her place and finds pics and she gets up and takes her and sexually gets in that car ... what? His reactions are not described. In the car, he was afraid of being harassed, but everything we saw was his next morning shower. booooooooo It would be better .. much better.
