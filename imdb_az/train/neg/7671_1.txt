The film begins with some moving text that takes about five minutes. Gives a brief overview of what happened. It can be easily performed by actor, but instead you can get a scrolling text effect. After bombing with the characters you have learned so little, remember that you will know about them. The field begins to get out of place and then crashes throughout the film. You can ask yourself if you're watching the same movie, not just changing the site. I have never played a video game, but I know people. This film does not get any better, if you're playing or not. Protect your money if you do not want to sleep in theaters.
