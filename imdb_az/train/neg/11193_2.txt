Perhaps I did not have high expectations, but this film went down to the depth I could not imagine. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Difficult, I could not imagine. Order by Sin Yiyen. Sin Yiyen allows Catholics to get rid of the Church's authority and is still immortal in a film with a trump card. <br /> <br /> You can not give meaning to any of the paragraphs, no matter what you know. <br /> <br /> Our Lord is planning to go to Rome. invest in his friend. It brings with him a mentally ill patient who loves and loves him in an angry time (I do not do it) and a drunken Irish priest and Peter Weller as a cardinal. To go to Rome, to find some creepy children who do nothing in the movie, to meet S & M anti-Pope, who informs the drunken Irish man (unknowingly) and killing people (oh BTW, that's bad, an industry / techno soundtrack) and then ... umm, seriously, I'm not sure. About living points. Heath sinks with Sin Eater, flies for a fascinator in New York with Sin Yetiint, and then comes in a number of other things and then drops the anti-Papa and film ends (from the whole camera). <br /> <br /> If you have a one-hour movie, it's really strange. There was something in the end, but it can not be important, because most drama think that you are really deceived before moving or abroad.
