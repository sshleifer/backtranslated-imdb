Caution: neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor play a major part of the poster's belief. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film is not true. <br /> <br /> The film is toughened by the comedy and the real drama. Especially for the protagonist, it is impossible to be very cordial, his conscience, and his fianc√©e. The area is dragging too fast and I downloaded it after approximately 2/3 - I want to finish it for myself. <br /> <br /> <strong> 2/10
