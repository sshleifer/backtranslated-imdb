I've been to a "very Christian" home since birth. Before I saw this movie and the rest of the series, I had to get rid of it and watch it in a youth group in my church. This movie was very uncomfortable. I've been to 12 years old, and since then I have been in the dark for years. I was awake in my bedroom and heard the sounds above my mother's tracks. If I had not heard his footsteps, and had not been lifted up, he would not. I spent many nights praying for salvation because Jesus was afraid to forget me. This, of course, is not something that will make my children more mature. I've been filming for a few years to shake the film.
