Okay, this could be one of the worst two excuses. All other films like Olsen twin movies, except for the newest york precision, did not have any stories, talk spaces, even disgusting ugly moves and bad movies in this movie !!!!!!!!! If you do not hate MARY KATE and ASHLEY yet, guessed !!!!!! The only reason I was watching was because I was really bored and there was nothing else to do. The Gemini believe that they will not stop the same stereotypical films they have an incredibly stupid adventure in an exotic situation, and they can get the help of two lovers who are deeply ingrained in the course of the day. At least one of them has 4 or 1 boy, or both of them fall into the same boy. The story surface was very imbecilic and simply dumb. she even saw a defect inside a child. Maybe they will be able to create separate films separately or separately, and maybe the films should start with a different story. Anyone who loves this movie has not really seen a really stupid, really artificial or really good movie. or maybe they are really smart and just have a bad kinematic selection. I do not recommend this film to the worst of all for a good movie experience .. or a good thing to do good at 4 alone, some of the sad attempts to make a bit of shredding laughter. If you're laughing, he's not funny. basically I give it 0 or less.
