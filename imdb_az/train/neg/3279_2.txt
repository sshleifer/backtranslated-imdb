Oh Geez ... I have many other films that I would like to see ... I stuck with my nephew for the weekend, and that's what she wants - yes ... <br /> Watch this show when I'm in college ... it's stupid, and it was somewhat moving. The show was a good heart ... and the characters were cute; It was impossible for anyone to be killed or even worse ... life came as a cartoon. Cut off until 2005 ... What happened? This does not work. According to others, there is simply no story of fuss and strangers are strange ... almost frustrating - absolutely not true of the original characters ... everything looks like a Mad TV skate and lasts more than 100 minutes. !! Ever since I've been watching this movie a few times. What did they think? Well, we can say that product marketing, toys and so on. I must be to be. I can all say that it should not die quickly. It looks like the original Duke of Hazzard is the Masterpiece Theater ... <br /> <br /> The only remake taken from television is Gilligan's Island ... Good luck!
