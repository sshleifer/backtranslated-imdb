This is one of the most hateful and brutal films I have ever seen. Unfortunately, the presence of Donald Sutherland misinterpreted his power. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <<<< <br /> <br /> One of many things in this movie tells me, "Where is justice?" He asked. <br /> <br /> Why is the cable late in the night filled with sadistic litter that's so patriotic? Most of these films have a specific problem for women and pay attention to their links with terrorism and murder. This film could have been defective in the process and without bending. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
