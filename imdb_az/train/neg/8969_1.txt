Land does not give any new excitement, even in the same way as the cuban. This time, there is no other development for cube machines, it is a very unprotected situation that has no other access. Cartoons are not well prepared as in the first episode, they are "flat" just like a "soap opera". <br /> <br /> If someone leads him to a normal exit, he will be asked a number of questions, such as "believe in God", that he is really creative and original, and in my opinion, this is in line with the mystery of the cube. Indeed, there is nothing else to say about it.
