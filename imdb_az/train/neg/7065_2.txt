Okay, I found this movie in old claws of good movies and I looked pretty good on the cover, but the movie actually sucked! Okay, the first question was good with the swimmer, but it went on for a while, then it was completely flawless with the boy! It was not even scary! His desire is like a child's bedtime story. Then a girl was completely lost in the news. I am convinced that some people call the news guy and ask you to go with you. However, he was cool at the hospital where he was stabbed and he saw it at T.V. and he said everything was about to be eradicated. It was a pretty gay evening about the man who brought the dead back ..... It's so stupid that I will not talk about it again. The latter was the best. It was not cowardly, but the idea of ​​the story was quite cool ... she married and the girl killed her classmates or something. While all of them are dreaming about each other, the victims are on the bus (HOPE HOPE) and all people see their dreams on the bus (Ha). Last.
