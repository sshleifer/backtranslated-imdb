This is one of the most bizarre, awesome, unusual and senseless movies! It is said that everyone involved in this project does not even try to shoot a tempting movie. This is a continuation of tireless films that want to earn money for the success of Smokey and Bandit, is a similar film. When Burst Reynolds is filming this movie, the film is shot, Jim Nabors is spent, other actors are not given much, the car racing is more dull and lifelike when it comes to explicit photography, humor uninspired and many scenes look at a two-hour stone. "Stroker Ace" is just a series of films that have nothing to do or do not differ.
