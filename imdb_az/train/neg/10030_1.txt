<br /> <br /> These films are really designed for the flop. As Yash Raj Films produces such films, it is less expensive than C grade films. Or some C-class films have a better and cheerful story than TAS. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the worst movie made by the dignified "Yash Raj Films" banner. How can it be said that the new Vijay Krishna Acharya, which is not in the real sense of moving to such a heavy project inactivity? Sanjay tried to imitate Qadvi's Dhoom, but at the last moment he suffered. Movement scenes are more than comic or animated films designed to exhaust the audience. <br /> <br /> The story loses its sense and sense of content in order to win the hearts of watchers. On most appearances, Anil Kapur, Tamil star Rajnikant, living in the south, reminiscent of body language and word expressions. I'm not an admirer of Saif and Aksha, but the Kareena award must finally go to Akif instead of Saif. Only from the start point I was expected, but at the end I was dissatisfied with the reality of nudity. Saif is behind the whole adventure when he is in the middle of the akif. In any movie, you need to say that the whole story in the final is evaluated with all the characters and given to those who deserve the award or premium credit. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < / p> <p style = "text-align: justify" It's a must-have to create a new look for his fans who feel regret again, and he has done a great job at the race between Saif and has now returned to the exciting nature of this movie, And last but not least about Kareena: Bikini is really hot with some clothes, and some are just complaining, but I do not even think about myself, but it's fine, but it's a good thing to attract the main people to a woman it's nice to see Saif's son, Ibrahim's son, and finally the young Saif, and now I hope he will be acting as his career. <br /> <br /> Those who love this Tashan not grown up mentally or still want to return to their childhood, or seek shelter in the shelter, the debutant director Vijay Krishna, who missed the project presented by Yash Raj Films, went to Acharya. Be sure to test the scripts minimum 5 years before going to the practical destinations. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I do not like to appreciate the good stars of such films.
