Although nothing is special, everything is OK, the story looks like a good idea, the scenario has a tough and end-to-end twist; First of all, the special effects are really bad (as it was made in the 60s), it may sound good, but in 2003 there is no excuse for vision. . Secondly, the direction is weak, this film does not just capture the essence of the story; it is a tough, dreadful, or frightening fact that a physician, the devil (or creatures of Satan) feeds the prisoners of the hospital; <br /> <br /> All of this is a very weak film, and it's strange and sometimes slightly fun, but it's still left alone. <br /> <br /> A very sad 4/10
