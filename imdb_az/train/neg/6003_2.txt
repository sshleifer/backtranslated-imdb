Sundown has the most elegant, most terrifying vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most ambitious, pretentious scribes ever written - and with Shane Vampire, every move and talk is so funny that they laugh a half times, <br /> <br /> Vampires have no special power - they can cleverly (once) and close a lamp, except for power (sometimes). this is really it. Do not worry, Dracula thought to run away from a battle because he fled the bullet. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In a vampire gang fight - some of Dracula's old geezer's. Some old B-flick might have been fun, but very dramatic music was clearly written by a man who took this movie a little bit, and the rest of the movie is now clay bats. In the end it may be very funny. Of course, there are some fun moments, but they are few and far away.
