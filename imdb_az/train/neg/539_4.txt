In the late 1970s, animator Don Bluth was angry at the company's speech, and Disney fled Mouse House to create his own studio. His first production, Nimkin Privacy, was still a brilliant feature of the day. Then followed by the US KALE and THE BEST GAME, both were purchased with the participation of Steven Spielberg and became commercial successor. None of these two films are very attractive and attractive for both children and adults despite the fact that NIMH does not have a dark adult challenge. However, after a long time, Don Blut entered ALL THE HEAVEN, critics were particularly tough in this movie, and did not assist Disney's issues with the PERSON OF MERMAID. <br /> <br /> Given that the film has such a friendly address, ALL THE REST OF THE SHADOWS is a welcome family right. Instead, Bluth presents a strange dark story, including gambling, deception, murder, ill-treatment and murder. Whether or not the film is for children is not a problem for the animated features that it says. On the other hand, it is difficult to say that Adolescents will find a lot of good things from the GOOD WORLDWIDE BACKGROUND. In short, this identity is a movie that has a crisis of identity. <br /> <br /> The movie, settled on New Orleans's infirmary, is a bad, cigar-swollen pitbull, Carface, with a gentle courtesy of former gambling casino partner, Charlie B. Barkin, a rough and rotten German shepherd. As you know, Charlie finds himself in heaven, even though it's default. Here's an ammunition angel, Annabelle, to him "all the dogs go to paradise because dogs are usually loyal and kind." <br /> <br /> Because the dogs of the film are presented as something on the one hand, this line reflects the mixed nature of the film. <br /> <br /> Charlie understands that she is killing her, and returns to the world. Even Arab fields with Karface. Carshi's award, AnneMarie, is a "human being" who can talk to animals (to predict who will win the races), with the help of Charlie "Dharshund Pal Itchy". Charlie claims that a small cutie will help a family find, but in fact, he uses his skills to win fortune in the race to build a more casino to bring down Carface. She loves to love AnnaMarie ... <br /> <br /> The story is not as problematic as the implementation of the concept. Apart from a beautiful music alligator, seen by AnneMarie and three-quarters of the human being (with the Ken Page soundtrack), none of the other symbols begin to show unpleasantness, or undoubtedly, kindness. Unfortunately, this also applies to Charlie; When he is trying to make him an anti-hero, the script (which is developed by many writers) only succeeds in displaying TOO unlovable character. Thus, the audience will not feel empathy for Charlie and worse, at the end of the film, its value is not convincing. (Burt Reynolds is a disappointing uncharismatic vocal performance). In addition, the film's other problem lies in the story structure. The slow-moving place jumps all over the place and creates the habit of throwing them into extra scenes that do not serve any purpose but capture the length of the film. The musical crocodile (living in danky sewer with native rats) was nowhere to be found, because Charlie tries to show AnneMarie her generosity with a pastel-colored pups pizza. All scenarios seem to be a rough first project; <br /> <br /> A few more polishing during the conversation could have been a tougher, more effective story. <br /> <br /> Charlie Strouse and T.J. Kuenster (AnneMarie's song and gator ballet are only good, especially from Ken's noisy vocal) or unequal sounds. As it is noted, Burt Reynolds' tough and lifeless Charlie goes far beyond the distinctive character (only exceptionally, a fiery confession of his intentions toward the end of Khojaly). Dom DeLuise as a hero is pretty good, but there are better roles, especially in Tiger AN AMERICA TAIL and NIMH in Jeremy. Ken Peak, as we have mentioned, is not awesome in everything he does, but has at least part of his character as small as at least unsatisfactory. Loni Anderson, who was just as frustrated, was once a shackle with Charlie, Melba Moore and Charles Nelson Reilly. Judith Barsi, as AnneMarie, is probably the only voice that is truly memorable, because his character is the only legally loved one in this stunning and joyous show. <br /> <br /> INFLUENCE OF THE ENTIRE animation. Technically, this film has the most imaginative scenes with a fearful scene about the end of Bluth's group (by 1980 standards), in particular with a fierce war of Charlie's satanic satanic devil. If there's anything, the movie is more animated than the stories. <br /> <br /> Generally, I can not recommend ALL the FUTURE OF ALL THE HEAVEN as a good entertainment. Although the film has admirers and acknowledges that it has given some energy and moving results, the overall package is not in the same league as Bluth's best efforts. Animated needers will be amazed at artistic designs, but after the time has elapsed, ALL THINGS ARE NOT INFRAED, you can get a bad taste in your mouth.
