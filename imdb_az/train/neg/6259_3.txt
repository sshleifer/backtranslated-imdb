Perhaps, the PC version of this game was impressive. Can be. <br /> <br /> I only play the PS2 version, and this is a complete mess. <br /> <br /> There are several elements that are OK or promising. I'll celebrate them for the first time because they will come to an end. First, the idea of ​​a GTA-like game is great. The game Gun was a GTA-like game in history and unlike the Mafia, Gun was perfect. I would like to see that I built a game during the Mafia period. Then, the story was written well. The story is logical, has dramatic springs, uses an extraordinary device (part of the game is a game) and interesting. Finally, some graphs - especially those used during cutscenes - are effective. The designers of the mafia paid attention to GTA's efforts to make sure that graphs were taken correctly wherever they looked. Unfortunately, in many other areas the graphics are very sad, and I'll get an excellent gameplay for very impressive characters. <br /> <br /> Gameplay is a very low download. First, control and completely suck the camera. Any gamer should be in the focus of attention first. You can not leave a game to suit control and / or camera. The first number, the character of the player, has no reason to have all the action that Tom controls with the left analog stick. If it is not necessarily necessarily and in a difficult situation, I hate the character of the left bar as "strafing" and the character can only use the right analog bar. Here, it is not only unnecessary, but also complicates some of the simplest actions. For example, Tom should rise to several missions. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <strong> I have never seen a worse fighting system. First, you have to automate or lock any targets. At an early point, the game tells you that you can use L2 or R2 to lock your goals but never work. In order to pay attention to any enemy, it is necessary to fight the stupid right with the analog stick and to try to correct the character of both the character and the tendency to err on the wrong side of Tom, which always leads to disappearance. Since then, it has probably been pummeled or killed. <br /> <br /> Next, if you touch one side or touch an enemy, of course, you'll face hand-to-hand or combat guns, which is mainly the knock-on or catch-up R1, is completely useless. Enemies embrace you with a moon, but if you do not come back, you can not move. Thus, the nearest battlefield is that you are burned from the left-hand analogue bar and try to move it so that it will not be 50% of the time, then touch R1 as far as possible before the enemy approaches again. and R1 is useless. If the enemy changes the angle at the same time for you, you want to fight your way through the right stick and to put the camera in the right position. At that time, it probably will be pummeled or re-stuck, and only the option will try to move the character again. I hope my battles can often hope to get enough time to fight the analog stick before coming to the EU's benevolence. <br /> <br /> There is so much to the real fight. <br /> <br /> The same problems and more are available to combat weapons. If you touch one, half an hour the supervisor will not let you shoot at just one shot, but you may still be full again. Additionally, there is no automatic purpose, and the target system is vulnerable, even though sensitivity is zero under Options. Gunfights are desperately trying to aim or move when your enemy shoots after being shot. Whether or not it happens, damage appears to be spelled accidentally. It can take up to ten kilograms or more to avoid any defects, and there is no such thing as a strange one. The enemy's head and nearest point can throw five shots in vain, and they will again be burned and harm you. However, players were fairly careful about realizing that they returned after returning to your target system, and after that, with targeted weapons, your target will be targeted and you will fight again. <BR> When it comes to graphics, with the exception of the characters and text you are near, they really make it quite disappointing. The distance is always empty, and often there are plain colors and the width of textures when you drive. The city was well-prepared. It's not quite different and there are not many things to see or do. The car looks slow and difficult to control. They also manage the same thing. Some of them talked about music, but it's a lot of copies. From this point of view, it could have been a better job. Also, as we have noted many, the loading time is ridiculous and stable. In general, the port of Mafia for PS2 seems to have fled at least. The game feels and plays as incomplete hack work.
