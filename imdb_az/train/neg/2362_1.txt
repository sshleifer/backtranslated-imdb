For the first time in the series, it has become one of the best Horror films of all time. This is unhappy. When I sat down to watch, I thought about the worst of the fourth and fifth provinces, which would be better than the previous ones. Boy wrong. <br /> <br /> When I waited for the first ten minutes, I really wanted to extinguish it, but I did not think anything, it would probably improve. <br /> <br /> This is not just a strange movie, but the next two (fourth and fifth) were already terrible enough, because no more! And how many times can you bring Freddi back? This action was EVERY HADISE, the story line was unpredictable and unhappy, and there were some defects in it. The way they did Springwood was completely wrong. First of all, he disrespects one another. <br /> <br /> Some people say this movie is "funny". This movie is not "funny". Should Freddy Krueger be "funny"? I would say it funnily shit. This film should have been a movie, not a comedy. If Freddie was the daughter of her daughter, this would not have been the same as the first! The last was simply stupid and cheesy. It completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first one. It only shows itself. <br /> <br /> Wes Craven creates a very good thing at the beginning, such a shame, but it needs to be dragged on the grounds of this trash. They should not worry about not even filming it. Except for a third, none of the other sequels. <br /> <br /> If this is not a part of a DVD and Elm Street Nightmare On Science Street DVD, then I bought it. <br /> <br /> Summary: Continuous and bad attempt continues. <br /> <br /> Full MOKERI of the first film. <br /> <br /> Please do not take time to spare this waste.
