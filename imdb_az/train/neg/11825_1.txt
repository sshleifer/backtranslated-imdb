<br /> <br /> The details of the film released on the ISDD confess to the original author, but I wrote it. I do not see it at the beginning of the film, just a loan offered by Silas Marner at the end. Suggested? <br /> <br /> There was nothing except the entire violation of all the essential elements of the prison. <br /> <br /> The oppression and sadness of an old, a craftsman, poor and just steal all his money. One night she goes to the door of a child while lying in the snow outside her mother. The man takes him and one day brings him to the local square (or a rich politician here) as much as he can to accept the child. The child has been ancestor of an illegal incident before. <br /> <br /> In this and every other aspect, the film's story is identical. I can only find a difference in one. Silas Marner had epilepsy - but maybe this was a great deal of Mr Marty's ability to move. Moreover, she has her hair dyed with some carrot juice (perhaps it encourages her to look younger, but actually she looks more like a clown). Additionally, addictive jokes are added that this extraordinary comedy can not resist to enter into a story that is not part of any and only reduces the depth of the story. When the child cries at the courthouse, he can only be happy with the man who has been fathered all these years. Here's a girl's film that uses nasal decongestant to tear off the nose bridge! <br /> <br /> I was amazed at the legitimacy of the film industry and, in general, such a film. If I were George Eliot's retiree, I would demand compensation. If I were Steve Martin, I would send the profit to this property or to the poor. It must be named Silas Marner, which is adapted by S Martin at least. Or get better out of the archives! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story and I hope to leave it completely and watch Silas Marner. Or read the book! The BBC made it a great adaptation in the 1980s.
