If Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood, do you remember he created great movies? Those days are even more reminiscent of a memory. <br /> <br /> Although the Hollywood Murder is not terrifying, this is a regular and surprisingly boring friend friendly police movie. A particularly funny comedy and especially an exciting action movie. <br /> <br /> Ford, most recently, loves himself more than his last projects and can take the most part of that movie. <br /> <br /> Hartnett is adequate, but he and Ford are not exactly related to chemistry like Newman and Redford. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, Hollywood Murder is a very fun sabotage, but simply. Get out of Ford, and this is not the case.
