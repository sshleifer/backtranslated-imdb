Just like the admirers of this movie, when it comes to the film, I decided to write another review. Last time I missed a couple of things ... <br /> <br /> Firstly, the script. Secondly, the player. Thirdly, Jesus Christ believed that he had created such garbage, and then, when there were no indisputable features from the beginning to the end when Joseph Fiennes finally exploded on a very bright summit <br /> <br /> I gave it to a homeless person or employer I do not believe when you spent this money! <br /> <br /> Do you get it?
