<br /> <br /> I met with me and I wish I could listen to him. I had to watch this movie because it was one of my favorite horror books by Shaun Hutson. <br /> <br /> Life is a shock, as it was in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <strong> Mike </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br> /> This movie looks like milk in this movie is fast (it's normal) and they transmit scenes fast! <br /> <br /> This movie was nothing like a book, the book was ten times scary, ten times more, and it had more stories! <br /> <br /> All this movie did not welcome me! I'm a great book of Slugs, and I'm saying the second book is "Mature Place"! Both books are great <br /> <br /> Read the book, then you can watch the movie, want more, and then give it
