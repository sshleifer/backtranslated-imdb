No, it was one of the worst films of the 1980s, but of course, it's a place to protest. This film was put on for two or three years and then appeared to be released in 1981. How would you explain the pre-dating effect of "An American Werewolf in London"? The disco is still cool and Ronald Reagan is the 40th President of the United States? Nevertheless, let's not look at the 1970s hairstyles of the 1950s and 60s. <br /> <br /> I've seen more of the "Happy Days" and "Laverne & Shirley" combination. <br /> <br /> A woman who was raising this movie in the category "very bad, good" was late. , great Elizabeth Hartman, but simply. Biff, a mousey of the mousey, has become a stereotype for Miss Montgomery, and has become a stereotype of death, and is still being thrown out of Hollywood, but even maintains mousey features like "hot chewing gum". His call for help is proof of that. She looks better than Miss Wimp. "Seven dollars in the beauty salon was thrown into hell." <br /> <br /> This does not mean that there is no good part in other places, only fewer and farther, and I just say it because I like Hartman. By the way, "Teen Wolf" was better than that. "Teen Wolf Too" was better than this, and that was not good. <br /> <br />
