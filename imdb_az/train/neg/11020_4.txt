First of all ... Fred Olen Ray, Brinke Stevens and Jan-Michael Vincent, distributors like "Rhino" and "Troma" in the video box, you know what this union is. B Movie Mania! In fact, if you are expecting a tension on the basis of "Edgar Allan Poe," you have forgotten it and corrected the perfect series of Roger Corman's 60s Poe films. This is a R-rated, finished video genre and nude, clean, unimulterated sleaze (only with a pedestrian crossing like The Premature Burial). But, of course, in a fun and entertaining way slipshod ... <br /> <br /> Rich, traumatized, sleepy housewife, Brinke (three naked scenes in the first 30 minutes) Victoria Monroe, a premature situation, the same fate as his father (Hoke Howell). His worthless husband, Terry (Jay Richardson), insulted some of his heroic debts (owed a gangster played by Robert Quarry) and his kinky, blonde, European highlighted sexpot secretary Lisa (Delia Sheppard) Brinke his money. The name-worthy actress Karen Black plays a physician and family friend in the 50s fantasy / horror star Robert Clarke and Michael Berryman still plays a blond naked (like a very talented player who plays a minor role as a short hypnotist) a decent nightmare sequence that carries out an autopsy on living Vicki. <br /> <br /> Yan-Michael Vincent often sits on a car in the car when he leaves Brinke and leaves the house. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; million times before, ending, creating an unexpected laugh (caused by the direct dismantling of the FETISH KUKLU segment in the TERROR TRILO) and created this terrible knife face, Everyone who creates a little bit of skill, Brinke is doing a decent job of somewhat sympathetic character, but the biggest surprise is the role of the old Penthouse, Pet Delia Sheppard, who stole every scene he's in, and easily performs the performance shown here.
