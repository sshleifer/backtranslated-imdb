Hired last night. Opening (2001) WAAAAAAAAAY took a very long time. The Hitchiker scene did not give any purpose. Some sketches were simply delayed. I knew beforehand, Chevy Chase was less than 2 minutes. No problem. <br /> <br /> KOKO, URANUS, BABS COMMERCIAL, Curtis Mayfield <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / <strong> Caucasian> Less rough film sealing TVs and movies, if you like AMAZON WOMEN'S FAMILY "or" UHF ". Otherwise, do not rent this movie. <br /> <br /> IMHO: Ken Shapiro's best film, "Contemporary Challenges"
