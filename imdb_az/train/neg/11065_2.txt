This film had a lot of potential. Everyone who follows Jeffrey's story knows that the details in this film are ridiculous. Huge time and effort has been made in Dahmer's homosexual tendencies and alcohol consumption. Where was the character development? The origin of any foreigner is always interesting and Dahmer is no exception. When it comes to killing and feeding small animals, does the film appeal to her teenage age? Instead, we give a dizzying array of flashbacks that we try to explain the origin of the murderer, but failed to come to the forefront of Dahmer's development. Also, the reason why the country is so interested in this story is its details - how it keeps the bodies in the apartment and the measures it takes to fulfill it; its cannibalism and body desires and so on. I can. But I could draw lots of delay points in the film, paying attention to her sexuality and extravagance. film "Dahmer".
