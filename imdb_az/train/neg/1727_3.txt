We have a lake. There is a collapse of the animated meteor. There is a killer stop-motion dinosaur with Flippers. Okay, so we call this movie CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm, two heroes called Arnie & Mitch called for the final definition of "comic relief." We should also have a sheriff who does not really listen to anyone who does not really have a damn thing in this movie. Aw shit, we're more than half of the movie and we forgot to enter into a bad guy! Let us introduce a boy with no anxiety, an owl, to steal a store to show that he is a bad person, and then bring him to a lake near the lake and pass it through the woods and the only purpose of the dinosaur snack. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete, irritable confusion. His logic will force you to shout at your heart. Dave Allen's first film, "Sustainable Motion Controller". After a few years, he joined forces with Charles Bander. Until the mid-nineteenth century, Band ran out of money to pay for it. The dinosaur effects are appealing and the whole movie is unusual funny. Unfortunately, the only good thing to say for that. <br /> <br /> Good immorality? Yes. The mind-bending logic of the poem should have enough reason to put it on the list. If not, Arnie & Mitch will do this trick. 3/10 and 8/10
