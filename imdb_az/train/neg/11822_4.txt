Harvey Keitel, John Lydon from sex pistols, and then thought of music by Ennio Morricone as a bonus. I was waiting for the excitement of an old, schoolgirl, Italian police in America. I want to have a sense of humor that has no meaning and a movie that leaves me behind: WTF! There are many unanswered questions and no action. Result: a potent kid has been cleansed under the classic toilet. Keitel and Lydon are working well, maybe Quentin Tarantino can reconnect these children with a good script. Oh, and the Morricone account: OK, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> If you are not a heavy Keitel fan, you usually do not waste time, you need to "see."
