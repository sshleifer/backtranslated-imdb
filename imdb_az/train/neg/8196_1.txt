Her ordinary frat boy pays for himself, but this is a pitiful bad Christmas movie with a bad performance that is equally painful by Vince Vaughn, who is a kid's movie, but with her mind and charm in her R films. Vaughn appears to be in the autopilot despite the majority of the film, and he runs to the wall with his full performance. After a 30-minute movie, this is an unusual movie, and in 30 minutes, you'll have your inner ear to think how uncompromising the movie is and say "Boom". Only Paul Giamatti and Rachel Weisz play a very prominent role in all of the actors involved in this mix, and this is also a manly act because the actors who play a part in this film are very good. Paul Giamatti brings a few depths and temperatures to St. Nick's character but Vaughn is forced to have their behavior level when facing a sad brother. You can see that Giamatti does not enjoy his role in front of him and painfully shows in some parts of the film. Rachel Weisz brings a sense of entertaining and spirit to her role, but she does not really have the character to work, and she knows so well that she is irritating in some parts of the film. Fortunately, there was nothing in the film for him to save a different face of Giamatti, who was thinking of firing his agent until the end of the film. There is no movement or flow, and this is a direction to be a holiday film, but it just ends up feeling when looking at a fancy widow's appearance. <br /> <br /> I do not know what's wrong here, but only two actors (Giamatti and Weisz) try to do their best to bring something at the table, in the hands of the topic (and all this is a Christmas movie) For an actor who does not pay attention (Vaughn), there is a very unhealthy movie that is very painful to watch.
