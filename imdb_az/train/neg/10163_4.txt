When I thought about the prominent feature of the movie "Bubble" at the end of the film, I remembered the "Machine" with Christian Bale in recent years. <br /> <br /> The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the characters. <br /> <br /> Small town is a simple, yet completely realistic image of life. The title is the reason for thinking. Probably the audience is in the "Bubble", because the films do not have a thin 90-minute working time. The reactions of the audience were often strange and biased, so that independent people can show how much humanity is to look at any topic in so many foreign countries. <br /> <br /> In some cases, the United States, the United States, the US, the United States, have to stretch out their legs as soon as possible. This film is essentially worthy of paying attention to things that are not obvious.
