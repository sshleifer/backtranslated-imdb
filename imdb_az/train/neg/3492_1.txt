I do not buy kung fu films for a plot. I buy them for war scenes. <br /> <br /> The story was worthy, but it moved to my taste very slowly. Each had approximately 3 or 4 mediocre scenarios that took about a few minutes. The last battle went a bit, but at this point I was very bored and did not pay attention.
