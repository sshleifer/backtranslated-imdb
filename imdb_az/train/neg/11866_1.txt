First, this movie won the "Best Film" at the Worldfest Film Festival in Houston, Texas, according to Slick. Hmmm should have been a quiet year <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie ever, but it certainly falls into the water, the other Aussie B class is Body Melt <br /> <br /> > HI 8 did not appear to be shot on the video. <br /> <br /> My predictors are filmmakers, they have looked at many Troma movies and really bad B grade movies, <br /> <br /> It goes into the business that has released this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I really love low-grade movies. It is only a fact that some of the characters are put on fake American attitudes, almost a chance to sell them in the states or in something. Indeed, the disappointment was over, the appearance was more exciting, and some of them could have been a good fight scene. We can see that film artists are trying to copy all Bad Taste, the car's explosion, rocket launcher, and an infinite number of people, but the finals are the best humor or "bad." If you really want to watch films, or if you're interested in taking off-budget movies, look no further.
