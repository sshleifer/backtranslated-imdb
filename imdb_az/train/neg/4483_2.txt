<br /> <br /> I admit that I love the first and then I was looking forward. <br /> <br /> I left. Certainly, the special effects were technologically beautiful - but they did not seem incredible. He looked more like a cartoon. Indeed, I love 80% of the pursuit, but I fight all Mr Smiths. <br /> <br /> Because that's all it can do. What I can not accept is the disintegration of the action. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew that I was in a conversation that lasted forever and did not touch anything. <br /> <br /> I'm also disappointed with the smallest plot. In this film he said that there was no truth in the first movie (except the existence of the matrix). <br /> <br /> This film was a bit of a DALLAS episode, and you knew that the whole season was a dream. <br /> <br /> Ugh! I'm back $ 7.00!
