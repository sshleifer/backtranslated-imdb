No, it's a movie about the 19th century England. Just like in the UK, it's not just someone's vandalizing football stadiums. In this magnificent view of the lords, dames and other randomly selected names, Charlotte Gainsbourg leaves the place where nobody reads anything without purpose, like Jane Eyre, purposely. Mr Roxeyt (William Hurt, an auto pilot) comes to love Jane and all this one day, but it's still a brochure that is not a brochure, it's not a brochure, but its fruitcake's wife's issue. Some people are thrown around and after some carefully fire (they are likely to rent a set), finally the end of the movie. Everything looked really genuine, I guess something. Then again, no.
