This movie might sound scary in advertisements, but the actual film was one reason for vomiting. This is below (even lower) below and there is no area. So every house scared you and made sure that a dead Japanese woman scared you, but what was it? Take a film that will appeal to viewers and will not only show pictures of people who are scared and some hair (dead Japanese women). Can you say "Terrible Destruction of Samara"? Do not start with "dead child". Even this is scary! So what? He has a cat and can imitate it, a great freaking contract! Just bury weak zombies and save a life that can be harmed by Grudge! 1/10! Yuck! >. <
