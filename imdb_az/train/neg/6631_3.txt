Ram Gopal Verma showed himself as a very innovative and competent manager. Together with Sarkar, he did a great job with his parents and he succeeded. <br /> <br /> This is a film that says she has been inspired by her many times. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong> Songs were horrible and unforgettable. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a break from myself and came to an end. Some viewers were wise to wait and filmed for the duration of the film. Finally, one of the worst films made by Ram Gopal Verma.
