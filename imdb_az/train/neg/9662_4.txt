I usually read reviews before watching a movie. Of course, I did not watch the TLB that did it, and I was very surprised to see the above average rating in IMDb. I found it to be no story. <br /> <br /> <strong> I do not believe that Ryan has filmed, I just will not fall (and just have a disastrous end to dissatisfaction for me) <br /> <br /> The injured soldiers, especially the low budget, and let them know that I look pretty real. But prepare yourself to laugh ... Some guys are thrown out of the air after an explosion, like the Olympic gymnasts. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Squeaking and sounding German voices ... incredibly funny. <br /> <br /> If the first actor / voice is spoken by the performer, it seems that all these are exactly the same and sound only "typical" German sound. except for those who just want to laugh a bit because of the sad and deep-rooted quality.
