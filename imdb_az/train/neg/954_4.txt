But ordinary Vera-Ellen says Sonja Henin's dance is for the ice-skating: blonde, strange, always beautiful, but not particularly good, and lumbered with poorly lit materials. When I watch sexy apache dances with Gene Kelly in Vera-Ellen's "Words and Music", it can not be seen that her blouse (red red horizontally yellow) came out of the South Vietnamese flag. For some reason, American Vera-Ellen has played in the * two * music albums (for several years) created in Edinburgh, which celebrates the beauty of "happiness to be happy" and "happily go". /> <br /> Then Cesar Romero plays an American imprinter who plays music in Edinburgh for a reason. There is an indefinite attempt to link this show to the Edinburgh Festival: this is not a show for the lovable legs. We also see several photographs of Royal Mile: besides the Highland accent, there is no attempt to convey the Scottish atmosphere in this movie. <br /> <br /> When we know Romero's show is "Frolics to You," the funniest gag comes from the beginning. This is a nonsense place for the British to receive and Yankees will get. <br /> <br /> Vera-Ellen, as always, is a beloved and seductive dancer, but very few music numbers in this film are boring and dirty. The goal is to mislead David Niven and Correspondent Gordon Jackson, though more than a few Hollywood musical pieces, but it's brainless. Romero is less annoying than today, probably not (once) he is forced to convince us that his hero is interested in the field. <br /> <br /> How is Bobbi the biggest murder of this movie? Sally Ann Hounes' father was a great star of music at the West End stage; In 1937, he was a great actor in the UK "He is my favorite". There, as Romeron's dog, appeared on several occasions, but there was no chance of joining any music, even a real comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie, with a theme containing the word 'Lovely', will capture a great British music star with Howes's greatest hits, but it will not give her anything! character actress Ambrosine Phillpotts (once I've worked) lights up a restaurant and the resurrection beauty is part of Kay Kendall. In the Vera-Ellen Confederation, someone named Diane Hart speaks in one of the most unexpected voices I heard: at the same time it sounds like an attempt to imitate Joan Greenwood and Glynis Johns. Val Guest has a story credit, but this movie does not qualify for its brilliant comedies. Colorful photography is unhappy, although I understand that later the UK could not handle Hollywood. "Go Happy, Happy", a pleasant time adventure, "accusation" is an operative word. I will only download this movie from 10 to 4.
