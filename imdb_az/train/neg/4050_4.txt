A very obsolete film aimed at banning youth freedom in a British school leaving some people. Yes, as in the army, you learn to obey and do whatever you want. Yes, it only distorts the dreams of something else and destroys their dreams and keeps their good at the threshold of life. Great. <br /> <br /> In fact, how can you complete these beautiful intentions ... Fine intentions that do not cause kinematic difficulties: an ineffective film. <br /> <br /> At least for an old Kubrick McDowell in a Clockwork Orange, he has helped a movie with a really strong social satire and a self-affirming feeling.
