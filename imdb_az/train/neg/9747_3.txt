Ok, first of all, this movie suffers. But it gives you an opportunity to explore why. The proposal, which has the power to convert a machine into energy, to its storage, and then to transplant and rebuild, is at least interesting. But that's how much we put forward. Instead of knowing what can be done to repair such a car, someone breaks things that are damaged. It could have been a good place. To live with such a responsibility and to deal with constant hardships, that is, invisible man. But not .. they break the damned things. And Lembach wants to leave. Thus, the physician, jerry-rigs is trying to get things back and forth in one place. Just to escape by his beautiful, but generous secretary (duh). Lembach did not decide to leave. Now he says he killed the neighbors in the country because his small experience was unsuccessful and did not give him money. Wah. Then go to dry English contacts between two adult adult hired to help her make the film worse. Among their favorite sessions, when they kill half of London, they make sincere efforts to find it. All this could have led to the fact that Lambach did not abandon the damaged machine that would never happen. This film tried to give me an honest 2 star to make an effort, but it would be better if Lambach was to leave and re-test if he did not break the damaged machine. Damn Lembach !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
