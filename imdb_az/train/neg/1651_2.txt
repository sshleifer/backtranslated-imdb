A badly written script that does not have any unwanted characters. As for the comedy, I forgot to laugh. It has about two respected friends who are fraudulently wounded in having sex in many beds (sex scene) and other friends (sometimes with deceptions), but most of them are considered masterbates. Meet three friends with the same woman (Amanda Peet) and drop. Anyway, this is really done without romance. The three children are not friendly with her. He took them out of friendship because they accuse women. - a bad movie
