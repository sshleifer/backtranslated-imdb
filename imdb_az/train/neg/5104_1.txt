What happened to the actors involved in this shit? Michael Dorn must remain loyal to Star Treck's property. John Diehl, Does anyone remember Miami as helper? I liked him ... Well, no matter what, what can you expect from a movie with one of the rescuers set up by baywatch? There is nothing, we will. None of the characters are pleasant, but special effects (but not funny) are cheerful. The story is (very bad) joke. No matter, no logic. I feel that filmmakers have something to do with something called "Killer Tomatoes Attack". Especially, at the scene where they discuss the national security of all important people in secret places ... <br /> <br /> If you watch TV, switch channels - your TV will always be grateful.
