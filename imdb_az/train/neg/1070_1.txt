I've seen a few bad movies (Austin Powers - The Shit Me Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is very scary, so BORING, I have nearly half way and can not watch the rest. Unfortunately. Kenneth Branag, Embett Davitz and Robert Duvall, and John Grisham's story, what's wrong? Branagh is a great time advocate with a night breeze with Davitz. His father (Duvall), his cat, and so on. An associate psychopath, and therefore Branagh sends him a bullet and immediately runs away. Robert Downey jr, Daryl Hannah, Famke Janssen and Tom Berenger blazed the story with slower moving than stationary. I'd like to love it and have read about this movie, a great Grisham fan, and I'm looking forward to something (my foolishness). This is a WORST movie I've ever seen and I wish my money back. * exit *****.
