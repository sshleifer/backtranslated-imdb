The only quality of this fraudulent miscast melodrama is the d√©cor of southern France and the song performed by Nana Mascoury. Stephanie Powers betrayed with evidence and a loyal accent. As mentioned, she plays a 18-year-old game and looks younger as a grandson of college-grandfather? Lee Remick is good, though, in his later years. The talented Joanna Lumley is used and his middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally manages to look younger when he finally marries Grandma Stephanie Powers. Stacey Kitch's arrogant arrogance raises what he sees in these women. Do not you know how any viewer can relate to his extreme image? The most reliable performance is given by Ian Richardson, who ensures that the strange look looks like rank-lovers. The good men in this epistle will always prove to be faithful to their expectation of agreeing to accept them. Can anyone believe that Stephanie Powers will remain alone in beautiful Robert Urich for decades to expect his adoption of his infinite marriage proposals? The connection between WW2 and Wehrmacht and Marquis laughs. First of all, before the war, the Germans did not occupy the Provence part of France, and Vichy was ruled by the French puppet government. We saw the French resistance as a day-to-day raid on the Mistral villa to steal the sheets that made the day's raid. After sitting down under a bridge waiting for the Nazi troops to surprise their truck load and to cancel it? If you want to see a mini-series that works well in a foreign country, do not meet Mistral's daughter. A better alternative would be Thorn Birds.
