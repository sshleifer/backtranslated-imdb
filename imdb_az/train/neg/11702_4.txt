No, I did not read Stephen King's novel "Thinner", but I drowned the movie version. Horror films are a taste. Regular movies give a hero to applaud the audience while trying to reach a goal. In horror films, viewers will make the heroine die. Tom deserves the Dutchman's low-fat, but tasteless revenge for his "Thinner" director, and he deserves a meal for everyone. The fierce New England lawyer Billy Halleck (Robert John Burke from "Robocop 3") has a weight problem. <br /> <br /> Although some vegetables are reduced to 300 pounds, she marries a mixed teenage daughter with a happy married, cheerful wife, Heidi (Lucin Jenney, "GI Jane"). <br /> <br /> Does not mean that the oil is stupid here. Halleck shows his sincerity in court when he acquits acquittal for Slezy Mafia president Richie Ginelli (Joe Mantegna, "The Game House"). When he goes home from a victory ceremony, Billy kills an old genie who crosses paradise by striking a woman. There is a veil and Halleck's friends bring it out of the soup. An angry gray father, Tedim Lemke (Michael Constantine of Skidoo), curses a dark lawyer and two clergymen nicknamed. Halleck suddenly finds himself in a lotion, even though he is not confused. The old man refuses when he calls the punishing Gypsy to curse him. The dreamer is back to Halleck Richie. <br /> <br /> Halleck learns that his loyal wife has turned his attention to the city's guardian doctor while fighting gypsies to overcome sexual intercourse. <br /> <br /> Thinner is not just a terrible horror, but filmmakers are also based on the stereotypes of men and women. Tom Holland (1988) and screenwriter Michael McDowell, who oversaw the "Children's Games," served such a slipshod script that Billy could not only avoid watching the dessert and watching the whisper. Thinner has several shock and less surprises. Cinema directors may have edited the royal novel, but feel the horror and humor. Holland and McDowell present symbols such as Mafioso, and then open the hook for them. A small character shows a long time to die and a chicken in his mouth fills his head. <br /> <br /> The stereotypic behavior of characters is also frustrating. "Thinner" describes women as pigs and shrubs. When Halleck flees home from a clinic, he finds a physician's car in his house. Her doubts are jealous of her, and she prepares a scheme to curse her husband. Even there is no satirical enjoyment that prematurely ends. Oscar-winning special effects wizard Greg Cannom "Van Helsing" and makeup artist Bob Laden have created a wonderful job for actor Robert John Burke to look obese. <br /> <br /> Only the steadfast Stephen King fans are able to make this terrible gooledyspook stomach.
