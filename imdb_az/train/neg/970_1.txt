Normally, I'm not a kind of afraid of movies, but this movie is no exception. Some movies have come to my mind! This is a very simple film, but at the same time extremelly effective, it has a great atmosphere, and it leads to some stunning moments, and the girl from the hill is a real surprise. Another was seen that I was not expecting a family photo and jumped on my seat! I would like everyone to see this movie, the lights will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
