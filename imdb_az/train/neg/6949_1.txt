After a live predictable opening bank-heist scene, 'Set It Off' is corrected and continues to sink. This is a film, instead of a cartoon, a film that has suddenly failed to improvise, manipulate and deal with sensuality and ugly cocktail of verbal violence instead of thinking, refinement or sensation. In short, 90% of Hollywood product is different. But this is a race angle, which is a particularly sad example of the 'Set It Off' filmmaking. Celebrating 'Sistahood', the movie actually records the most dangerous forms of accusation against African-American 'gangsta' stereotype. Gimmik this time is the dragging of gangstas. The film presents not just the fact that gangsterism is an important personality for all African Americans to feel cash or some sensitive people, but also as simple naturalists who make money and, above all, bling. Finally, 'Setting It Up' exploits the issue of racial discrimination and disability simply as an instrument to support weak structures. Serious racial social issues are drawn from the wheel in a controversial and opportunistic way to justify armed robbery, and after the film has to end with the inevitable condition of offending, LAPD comes out with many gangs, guilty guilty (tell Rodney King) and aspiration "good "Sista, Jada Pinkett Smith, leads to the world of high mobility and the middle-aggressive world of its buppie bank-manager, opened for her by her boyfriend. 'Set It Up' is a terrific state of the modern blaxploitation movie, full of stupid gangsta stereotypes and always acts like a celebration of humiliating it. Although the Shaft and Superfly were liked in the 1970s, stereotypes could have been brought to a well-worn area, with all the races of the audience having freshness, energy and guilt, and still watching them entertaining. Since the promising days of the early 1990s, if it were not a sign of the tragic decline and ghettoization of the African-American films, it would not be worth the wrath of 'Setting It Up'.
