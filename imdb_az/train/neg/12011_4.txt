John Pressman (Michele 'I shoulda called Ditech' Lerner) regularly works at a doctor's office. His mother (Zelda Poltergeist 'Rubenstein) hypnotizes people who think that he has been wronged. But it turns out to be a movie in a movie, but the lines are soon blurred as John goes to a movie theater to kill. The answer to a guy watching the same movie. Lerner, of course, is above it, but Zelda reiterates the lines of dialogue. That happens something frustrating. It's not as frustrating as the two girls watching the movie. If the horror movie fails this one, trying to be smart, trying to spread a message and forgetting the slasher movie is a feeling of tension or at least one jump or two. <br /> <br /> <strong> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;">
