This film was shot in 1949 by Noir, a place where "Criss Cross" was to be rebuilt. The latter was a disappointment, but it was better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a "neo-noir" and a colorful pearl since a modern day, two things that will disqualify the film's status as noir. <br /> <br /> Besides, it was not the biggest negative cinematography (good), but it was the last story. Hey, some 40s were similar to Dashiell Hammet's stories, but I did not care for some of them. The filmmakers did not help the situation by writing stories as it looks like every three minutes. It is not surprising to keep up with this story. It was ridiculous! What happens is that their 45-minute marks do not care much about anyone. I did not know.
