If you want to watch about 2 hours of your life, how it depends on your fears movies. If you love them, look at the hysterical, farther they are, the curse of God is terrible. Jigsaw is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life (I've seen 'Dead for a long time') and I'm saying this is a fan of the budget horror / gore genre and a few good ones to compare it. I do not even think of falling into the peculiarities of what's worse than this movie, and just one good thing about it is one of the funny things I've seen so terrifying. It can be found for cheap cheap rentals, it's definitely worth a look, if you deal with making it - shame. o o IMDb, especially for this movie, should submit 0/10, it is well worth it.
