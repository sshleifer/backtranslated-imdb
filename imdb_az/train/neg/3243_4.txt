After relying on any movie, one of the most important requirements is that at least sometimes we should be able to get on with us, with their illusory signs, cops, support, and ideals. . But this movie never comes out of it. Every deception can not be seen from the mildew (especially adults!). They are not very intriguing, complicated or complicated. Probably, Mammad hoped to quickly compensate for it with dialogue and complex psychological relations. If so, she failed. The lines are good, but for that reason, every one of us always thought it was a clever point that was delivered in such stylted, unnatural, stylized ... but it did not happen. As for psychological complexity, the main character is a bit drowning and releases a little ridiculous about his father, thinking he is a little prostitute. Although I liked the street scenes very much. It looked like Edward Hopper's painting.
