What a terrific movie. Rotten tomatoes also had a good rating. Do not be fooled by positive comments; It was not a fright. It was not funny. It was not smart. You will not even pay attention. 2 hours of my life we ​​looked at this jump-fest. It was interesting that the computer was created the first few times the monster was created. about 15 minutes later it was fun. Dialogue was terrible, translation should be the goal. Another drawback was the Americans. 3 were described, and all of them were character, intelligence, and judiciary. Now I'm going to write a few lines like it should be about 10. Workers at the video store slapped me to bring this title upside down.
