The song that was closed by Johnny Rivers was the biggest thing about this movie. Unfortunately, I can say about this western movie. According to my comments, I have to write 8 lines, but there are more than 8 horrors in the west. I'm not sure whether the film is a tribute to Hopa Along or just a parody. In this film, the hero and the villain were very plastic. Still not real. Many actors supporting this movie appeared original, but the shooting scenes were a joke. The former commentator thinks this movie is great, and made a cheap shot in President Bush comments. It was a democratic or non-Republican western. It was a bad western movie commercially sold. I think I do not want money. Sometimes I thought I was watching a film prepared by college students. If so, she was a great movie.
