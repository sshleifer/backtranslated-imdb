One of the worst films I've ever seen. The actor was terrified both for children and adults. Most of the characters have shown that there is little or no emotion. The lighting was terrible and there were many misconceptions about the film's daylight shooting (they came to the seafront only to destroy the boat, there were four shots; Sheriff and Baba on the evening boat, Jillian and Molly in the evening, swimming in the afternoon, children in the afternoon * Beatrice and Simonton did not go on the boat tonight, but on the riverbank, the doctor did not go on the night.) Cappy was the best actress in the film (though the pulse detector * shows what happens when people are bitten, Cappy has died, still still while the knife is heard, and the nurse wipes more of his money, then shows his pulse and then he dies). I believe it will be perfect because it is an independent film, but it can still be good. Honestly, it is not worth even to look at children. If you can now see something as good as the Royal Or Toy Story, you'll see everything you can to remember.
