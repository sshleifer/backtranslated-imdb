The movies were asleep before, but no movie had seen it twice, so I took three living rooms to complete it. Dialogue was bad. Women spoke stilted and men were cartoons. Two of the alleged Japanese women looked at Chinese, Chinese names, and spoke with Chinese highlights. I'm still trying to figure out that Emmental men are like sex. 10 minus 8 1/2 is a challenging option: Do I give this movie a rating? or two? <br /> <br /> The movies have been forgotten before, but no movie has ever seen it twice.
