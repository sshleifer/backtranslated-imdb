I just did not finish this movie. Pia Zadora is a scene between the two boys on a picnic. I will say that I am a candidate for the most unfortunate sex promotion proposal. Someone (a good guy) wants to see his mistakes. The other (bad guy) wants it as a simple dog, and then keeps it for him. Heavy levels. I hope I turn and say I will not break something and smile and take a hot dog. It is simply miserable.
