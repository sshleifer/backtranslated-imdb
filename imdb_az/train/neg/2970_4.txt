I'm a back Batman movie and TV fan. I liked the show (new and old) and liked all the movies. But this movie is not as great as some people hope it is. In my opinion, this is a great thing. I think the problem is no drama. Batman: Phantasm Mask and Beyond Batman: Joker's Return was a lot of drama. and Batman and Mr Freeze: Sub Zero also had some dramas. Also, I think that this film is lighting up for Batman. It's a big fight with Bane at the end of the only scene that's a bit dark. Anyway, this is a Batman movie. But I would only lease it.
