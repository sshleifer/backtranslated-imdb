The monster from Enemy Mine entered a small mountain community where he lived in a way. A woman is cured by a doctor-turned-vigilante to destroy her. This woman, who looks like a refugee from a Motley Crue video, travels around a motorcycle and tries to save a bunch of Big Chill, who chooses a right blow at the middle of the wolf's meadow. Dr. Mauau is a bad version of the island (and yes, it is worse than Val Kilmer) is the main place to attract the attention of the story.
