The first scanners could not be a big movie, but at least it was original. this update did not happen. In my opinion, the player is worse and the story is slow and there is nothing special. dialogues and special effects are better than the original. That is, the film is down to the first in all ways. Something different about this is high and chaotic. They would have made a good movie. They did something better with the story and they were interested, which could have been a decent film. Indeed, through this through direct advancement, it did not get all of this, it's a memorable film and much more. Despite all this, there are bad movies. In a generous mood, I'll give scanners 2 4/10.
