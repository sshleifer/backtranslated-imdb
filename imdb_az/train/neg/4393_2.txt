I did not like frosty refills and this one. Both films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad sounds. Sounds could have been made, but frostbite was worse than the unstable snowman they were driving. The winter of the Shakhty was great and was a hearty Drama. The only good thing about this movie was that the swallow snowman was like the classic 60s, and it was a funny line when talking about things that were not true, and then Shahriyar was upset about the window, shaking, but everything else was bad writing and bad animation and I just bought the area. 2 years ago 3 years ago I saw a DVD cover in the library and looked at artistic misfortune and a bit of background pictures, but I played this movie. The weakest art symbols, such as DVDs, were a bit of a shock, and it was just terrible about what happened. I watched this night and I was bored for everything I was sleeping (I always wake up while watching while sleeping) But this movie was generally boring <br /> <br /> Overall rating: Level -C <br /> <br /> This is like frosty turns and another strike in this one is a special bad rip-off. It was only 4 out of a fourth single as a single home, I thought the movie was good, but the house was only 3. But it looks like a bad home, only 3 or 4 people hate it. My sister did not watch so much, as she came to watch my room for 2 minutes and a half to go "I hate animation"! I'm looking at him as the 3rd Frosty Turtle. True horrible!
