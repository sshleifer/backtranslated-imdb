This can be the worst movie I've ever seen. Despite Mikhshtel's claim, this movie is not accurate in terms of history. It starts worse and then there's all the downhill there. Hitler's father cursed his bad luck on the "truth" that he was married to his own brother! They were, in fact, their second brother. Hitler's mother, Klara, called Alois "her uncle", because Alois was adopted and raised by Klara's father and grew up with her son as a nephew. Alois was much older than Klara and entered the habit of calling Alois as a child, "his uncle." <br /> <br /> Hitler's ridicule by his fellow soldiers and taking the hijab is simply a disgrace and an insult to all the viewers. We see that pushing the dog through the trench when Hitler takes up with the poorer thing to push it to accuse him. We continue to ridicule and punish the scary little man we see in the distance and his companion soldiers, but then directly to the oppressors, one floor of the ground and one last openly killed. As Hitler was the only person to survive on the stage, was not this cruelty and cowardice story? Did not Hitler himself boast about it? <br /> <br /> Later, Hitler threatens and scares the poor, highlighted and war-tired Jewish officer by giving him an iron cross! I just thought that the Jewish officer was a pawnbroker who did not fight for the Motherland, and I thought that the Iron Basin was not presented as it was shown in this funny Persian because we brought some plaques from his shop. <br /> <br /> All the strange clich√©s here are at least a calming and hypnotic effect of the Wagner music on a small man. Manufacturers only kept Ian Kershaw with them. Later, Franz Lehar's "Happy Wolf" could have discovered that Fuhrer's ship had been able to spend more than Richard Wagner's balls than any "Flying Dutchman"! <br /> <br /> Hitler, <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify ; "> laugh.
