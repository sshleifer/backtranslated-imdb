The spirit of an ancient mummy will be transferred to one of its scouts, who will be punished for the punishment of the grave. The relocation of the soul makes the young age a great tempo until it resembles mummies. <br /> <br /> The Phoenician's curse is a great deal of work to be done as soon as possible. The film presents several good, original ideas (blood-sucking mummies, soul transferring, interesting makeup effects, hand-held scene, etc.) and many atmosphere moments, plodding in the direction and tempo. To make matters even worse, the first 15 of a relatively short 66-minute movie is more than just a paddle. I usually go for these slow-moving mummy films, but Pharaoh's curse tests are even my patients. Casting helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Roden is just a brilliant point, I want the film to pay more attention to its mysterious character), it's boring as a scenario. <br /> <br /> Finally, I do not know who owns the idea of ​​putting the mummy-looking maid to look like a pajamas, but a ridiculous, ridiculous look for a lively creature that frightens viewers. <br /> <br /> Despite my negative comments on Pharaoh's curse, I'll rate it 4/10. Be sure, it's not a good movie, but if you take into account all the problems with a generous film.
