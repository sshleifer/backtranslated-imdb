(Spoiler included, some would say) <br /> <br /> It is impossible to take this movie seriously. This is so terrible in some parts that I can not just help smile. Look at the rank where a bad guy oversteps, stumbling over Stallon's character by jumping about 20 feet by full climbing or by placing it on a stalactite (and actually my favorite). Yes, how much mischief is there in order to accomplish this? I know, but in fact, the reality of the money.
