This movie was very strange, I do not believe in watching it. Director, editing, production and scripts were seen by secondary school students who did not know much about movies. There was no narrative flow in any sense. Great striking moments and galaxies (like an early period between Heath Ledger and Naomi Watts) and character relationships (like a mark at the beginning) are completely out of place, and they have made a more elegant and effective film. Heroes are, unfortunately, less developed and complicate our relationship with them. Imagine, not surprisingly, not entirely wicked, but terrifying writing reverses relative convictions. The film is particularly bad T.V. plays as a western / epic, and, unfortunately, reduces the exciting story. I read many comments on the film, which is important for Australians. Ned Kelly is NOT a FILM because he is an important Australian symbol of history. Nobody says that this topic is not good, only the quality of the film. Pearl Harbor was a very important historical event for the Americans, but I will defend it and say it's good, because it was still bad. Even though Heath and Orlando are wonderful looking, all around is a failure.
