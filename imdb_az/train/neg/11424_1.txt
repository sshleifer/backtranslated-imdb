I felt it was last night in the "Fire" cable and started watching it, because in 85 I saw that this movie was a terrible movie. Twenty years later, the film is still scared. In addition to the synthesizer, he was the most insulted instrument in saxophone pop music in the 1980s. To hear that song again, he wanted to hang a screwdriver. The complexity of this musical attack played Rob Lowe's typical saxophone and had a scene that was just like Charlie Parker and played solo, only reminiscent of his noise tone and the playing ape playing ape. All the heroes were intensely unpleasant, but I have to say that they have done a great job to beat unequal actors to describe themselves. In fact, I thought Mare Winningham was attractive and at first I did not apologize for her character because she was wearing a comic dress, but decided to have sex with Rob Lowe's character. Sexual illnesses were voted against.
