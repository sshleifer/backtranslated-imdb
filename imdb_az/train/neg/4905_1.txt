I'm often upset with network movies. The flix, which involves big names, is usually destroyed by TV men. But this is the worst of the worst. The scenario is weak and especially Tracey Pollane's immorality. I've been trudged to see my children's high-level games and treat them to work more efficiently. Pollan acts as she reads as she speaks. If it tries to express fear, anger, or sadness, it is a very empty place. It was difficult to accept seriously because of the overall quality of the production. If you decide this boldly, prepare yourself for a great disappointment. Terrible things will not terrify you, sad things will not grieve you, romance will not feel warm and flimsy, and we will be disturbed when we see the end. "The first to die" says a lot about this movie.
