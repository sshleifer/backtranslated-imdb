At least in the theater, the seats were comfortable and I drank my cervix at the highest possible level and drowned down the dialogue. This is not entirely a girls' movie. Any block who loves her can be sure that our ladies are away from us. Silent story, mediocre dialogue and overall cheap movie. I've seen a lot of movies, but this is a new winner in a bad category. If you see this, something you expect will end. Finally you can run as fast as possible from the theater.
