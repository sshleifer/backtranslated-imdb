This movie was the first time I was called "I lost my translation". But in some ways Bill Murray turned into an eccentric black man playing by Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson turned into a delightful Latino woman played by Paz Vega and turned into a city of Carson in Japan. Instead of meaningful conversations and calmness in our translation, we get trivial blabbering in 10 elements that cause anxiety. Instead of stunning and introspective characters, as in the translation, we get symbols that give us tips that are not relevant to them. How does a character who wears a T-shirt with a hundred and nine dollars and who is not in the Target Department recommends a working class as a administrative assistant to a business dispute with a woman? Do not think that he will stop him. If she does not give clothing advice, she tells her what to eat. The most boring part of the film was likely to be anxious to get an appointment and it was still a matter of time for characters to spend time, car wash, stop at Arby, or just 10 items or hats list. I wanted to shout at them, "Did not you tell me you were in one place, what was carnivorous? You were almost late a minute ago, and you are eating the baked beef and thinking about your life!" Until I see this movie, I do not understand that something can "push itself," but this movie just does. The dialogue is frustrating and non-sympathetic, except for the two players I wanted to apologize for signing this project.
