I have to say that I'm very excited to watch this movie, and when it was released in 1970 by the fox of the 20th century it was considered a disaster. He also appeared on several critically acclaimed films, and that was just a curiosity. I just have to see how bad this film is. As you can see, I have answers. I'll tell you what I'm doing for curious tracking, but it's ridiculous that player, direction and scripts, such a line is absolutely missing. Racquel Welch is trying to move the film, but after the sex change operation has been launched, the film goes to the hill, which has so far seen that it can not handle this task alone. John Huston's Uncle Buck Loner certainly does not help, he asks, and as leers on the screen, he seems to be wondering what he's doing sometimes sometimes. Rex Reed Myron spins around like Myra's alter ego and even has his own note masturbating scene. Bravo for debut performances! Farrah Fawcett plays a dumb blond; this role was certainly convincing. Certainly, of course, the most notorious role was driven to the west of Mae. A 75-year-old woman faced with sexual hooliganism appeared to be more suitable for a fright film. I do not want to give this document personally; but in this movie nobody is invisible. The director looks very comfortable and non-existent, the film is not only bad but also boring. Older stars took a few old movies and the movie was cut off. You welcome everyone and I've been happy to see it at least, but it seems like Myra Breckenridge has always been a disaster confessed.
