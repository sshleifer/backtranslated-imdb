Except for those garbage people! Though you are trying to make the best parody of the best betrayal, as it is referred to as "Spiritual Orel", you probably can not imagine the joy of this show. It is difficult to say what happened even when watching it. Is this a news story? Presented show? Who knows!? They begin by telling about different international news, but the news with seemingly unexpected points is cut off by the fact that the smallest person, with its bigger forehead, is thrilled and cheerful. <Br> <br /> <br /> Pat Robertson does not look so bad at first sight. It looks like a dark but still harmless shirt that is involved in the archaic belief in old darkness (like many grandparents). But this is a suicidal man, who has helped and helped anyone, but who has been using two abusive dictators who use charity for illegal use in illegal ways, SUPPORTING abortions made in China, and on a regular basis <br /> <br /> Caucasians (especially Americans from the Caucasus) prefer other races. Nevertheless, this is despite the fact that everything is funny, after 40 years of his small show (or enough money to bribe some television managers who do not curse them). Some people have to look somewhere and speculation about the consciousness that depends on each word is an issue. Although Robertson has repeatedly shown his corruption, people still listen to him. I do not know if it's funny or scary. I think both are a good mix.
