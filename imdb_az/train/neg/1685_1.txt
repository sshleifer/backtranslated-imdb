All 14-16 year old children want to see this movie (only allowed at 18). They have heard that they are a terrible movie and they feel so cool when watching it. I'm a very sad child, a good movie I've ever seen, and I feel it's a bad movie. These months were one of the worst films I've ever seen. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy of another movie. And the last? This is an open end ... why? It's impossible to get something decent for such a stupid story. This movie is designed to frighten you and if you are a little smart and have some information about music, you know exactly when you're scared. <br /> <br /> When the movie was over and when I came to my friend, I told him (slightly loud) that it was a total loss of money, but a little stupid guy seemed strange to me. Today I'm just using the right marketing, my robe can make an Oscar with a home video.
