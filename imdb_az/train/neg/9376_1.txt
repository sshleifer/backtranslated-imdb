I was ill when watching this movie. I grew up with Pippi and was always a real taste. As my husband came to Sweden, he looked at old people and was a really good laugh. but this version of the American version should be renamed and should never be shown. It's awful, it's over. how bad can they be? Well someone translate me ha ha ha ha .. but guess they are not close to Pippi at all. This movie will never be seen again and will never be published in the broadcast. to burn the movie and save the children. If you want to look at Pippi, watch the original movie and you have a good smile. If you love PIPPY INGER NILSON, you will never be sorry to be sorry for Tami Erin Pippi .. Yeah .. When you read the "spoilers" explanation, "a surprise" and a person who tastes the movie and slanders the audience. "It's good that the director stands for it ... you see this movie at your own risk ... it really does ...
