(SPOILERS AHEAD) I wanted to watch for a year with a Russian fantasy "actress" (and I use this word softly). <br /> <br /> To save two hours of your life, I told you that a man with a long knife from his arm designs will return home to see his mother. Things are getting ugly after being beaten by an old girlfriend's mafia boss. She takes revenge on the boy when she brings her home. <br /> <br /> If the cops are looking for her, the mafia mother sends her children to avenge her. <br /> <br /> Very little is said. no explanation is actually given for something (as they locked a girl in a shelter), and most strikes off the screen are off the screen. The film is made up of Adrian Brody, a man who is usually seen, and does not mean to kill people (most of the screen goes out of action). It looks good, it works well, and there's been a reason why it might be a good movie. Hell, I liked a real character development or a back story (we know it was a boy). The film is a part of two hours and feels like six. If they did not plan to tell us anything, they did at least fast, and they acted very fast. Instead get a boat hero. Hero, a hero in a bus, looks at heroes while walking on the hero. Hero with the girl. <br /> <br /> Because it could have been a good movie. Because they simply did something or someone else said something else without giving the instruction "to buy this boy." <br /> <br /> 10 I'll never go back for about four hours (all my attempts to see it). For those who want to see a very entertaining Russian entertaining movie
