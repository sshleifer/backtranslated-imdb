Can anyone stop John Carpenter and intentionally disrupt his reputation? How can you go down? <br /> <br /> This episode seems to have been made by a student of the film, and it is not worth it to start with bad words because it's just something. Borefest, directed by someone as a director without talent or motivation ... <br /> <br /> Dear Mr. Carpenter, retire immediately with a special rest and stop this kind of garbage <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
