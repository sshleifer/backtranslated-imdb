Hm. Severed was the worst I've ever seen, while a thrilling film pointing to treacherous action, primitive (the best) special effects (all this has caused me to have made this movie three times in the past six years), while continuing to pierce hollows. I'm never sure who the hero is, and what I know is the use of a portable guillotine, as seen on the killing scene in the killer's dance floor. Generally, I did not like the movie because the first 30 minutes were unpleasant and the rest is a mess of irreconcilable dialogue (which I can not remember anyway), which is unsuccessful to get a logical result.
