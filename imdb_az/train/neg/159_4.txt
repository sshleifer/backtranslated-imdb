I have always admired Susan Sarandon in her personal life as well as in the actor's integrity and integrity. So it was strange that he would appear in a film that distorted these facts. The rescue of the South Pole character was carried out by a Canada Canadian company flying with Canadian design and built Twin Otter aircraft from Alberta, Canada, from Edmonton, Canada. The visit was canceled by US Airforce, Navy and Coast Guard. The same company, after a few years, set up a rescue squad to bring a man from the South Pole base. I feel that the film is a very important issue and it is a very brave woman who has a terrible task. I do not imagine the need for manufacturers to see the courage of the rescue pilots and do not portray the rescue aircraft as USF Hercules.
