Slash flips lasts for a few days, so when I hear about Cut, there are great hopes and good things about it. The good things I was hearing were wrong ... very wrong! This flick is bad and I mean BAD. It's just stupid. Everything about it. Especially the origin of the murderer, how he survived and how his care was taken. There is nothing real or superior about this flick. Another slasher wannabe with just "Hip", "Recognize yourself". "Savvy in the movie" characters. I resemble that. One should do something different, the slash genre needs a new blood.
