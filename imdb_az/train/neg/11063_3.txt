I can say "hero", "Dahmer," I'm asking you to stay away from the biographical film based on the real story of a strange serial killer. "Dahmer" is more mistaken about the subject of focus. Jeffrey Dahmer, who killed more than 15 young men and eats some of his body parts, is probably the most unusual murder killer of our generation. However, real people are the directors of this horrific performance, which tested their heads before deciding to ease the horrible "ghost" project. Although Jeffrey can easily digest with a few fiery 'brainsadillas' appetizers or a real life, this is not an easy movie. Potato skins'. * Failure
