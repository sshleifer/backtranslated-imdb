The only reason behind watching the movie was "hope" to see something interesting. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The movie is really bad and the girl's performance really is really well, honestly, I'm an expert on a movie critic, but you need to have a good idea to notice that the job is pretty bad. <br /> <br /> He was the first thing that came to mind before starting the conversation: "Willem has a relationship with Dafoe, and since he's a brilliant filmmaker, he decided to help him with the scenario and appear in the movie." .. surprise, surprise, Giada Colagrande's wife, I watch the movie I've seen on the Internet. Horrible story and terrible performance.
