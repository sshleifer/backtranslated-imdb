Spend your time differently, even home work is better than this movie. These jokes are not funny, Dr. Seus has fun coins. It's a very bad way to spend an evening. My 4-16 year old children were a little laugh at first, and because of the unhappy youngsters Barbies and the elderly were left to play ps2 and release the gang. My wife left me and made meals. That's why I finished it. I'm the worst "kid" I've ever seen. If you want to watch Shrek 2 a fun kid's movie, this movie is entertaining for children and their parents. THIS IS MOVÄ°D. It is not funny, cute, but cat's make-up is just a good thing and you can see on the disc label.
