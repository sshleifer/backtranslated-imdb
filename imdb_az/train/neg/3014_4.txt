Recently, I explored the scenes produced within the Seattle International Film Festival. I was filmed as a photographer because I know and I'm an admirer of Burtynsky's work. I believe the film's getting this message is a good job, but I could not help but felt that Burtynsky's photographs and subsequent popular bookings were the next one. Obviously, some of these are still widely used in photographs of zooms and pans. Although it had a good effect on the economic side, 75% of the movie was from Burtinsky's book (it already owns me). Perhaps there is an exaggeration, but I felt it. If you have a book or get acquainted with it, it will be better to throw it away.
