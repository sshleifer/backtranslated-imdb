Kathryn Bigelow's film was endlessly sweet and I was expecting the 6th Oscar awards. Unfortunately, this is not really a good movie. The description of the situation, of course, seemed to be accurate and convincing in all counts, but the story was simply incomplete and the film's direction was uncertain and exciting. Actors made a good effort, but I really did not get what I was trying to do for the movie. The Atmospheric and Full Metal Jacket is not as flammable as the Brother Band, not as epic as the Band, but as a good thing. No doubt, why it is so popular, and people are 'hypnotic' to these epic proportions. Given the caliber of films over the last few years, I think there is nothing to choose from.
