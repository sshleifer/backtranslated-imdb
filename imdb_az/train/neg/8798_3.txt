At least I love a movie that has a story. This does not happen in this movie. <br /> <br /> The picking of pineapple boxes has scenes. A woman with a blonde sparkle will never remove sun glasses. This woman hit the others at the start of the movie and we do not know why. After 30 minutes completely disappears. There is another woman who cleanses a man's apartment forever. Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' (my favorite song) is an overplayed fast food joint with endless scenes. The dialogue is mainly related to food (pineapples, chef salad, and ordered drinks). <br /> <br /> Most of the filmmakers in this movie were shot by actors. Because many fast food consumed. <br /> <br /> There is no passion in this movie because there is no story. This is definitely a romance - there is no such thing. I wonder why I do not go forward. Waiting for something important? does not do that. Perhaps the only consolation of this film - the scenes swiftly acted that deceived the possibility that it would be downloaded to all nonsense.
