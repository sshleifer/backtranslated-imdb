Sergio Leone returns to the tomb ... This is the case if there is a movie that hit a man's life. The "single worm" of the lead character is thirsty and bare, and the scenario is written by an eighth-grade monkey. This idea should be whipped at everyone. The only reason I spend my time is that the line is 10 minimum. The family of Sergio Lion should appeal to the court, not his crap, as now immortalized as the maliciousness of the MST 3000. Hate. I blame Hollywood ... at least Gary Busey does something that does not hurt anyone except for cocaine users and weapon experts ... this movie is blasphemy.
