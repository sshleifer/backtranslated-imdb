Failed. It turned out that the director did not come out of nowhere, indicating that the movie was obvious. I think this film is shocking for a prize at the Gijon Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Everyone who came out of the theater thought like me - what was the point of filmmaking? The references in Iraq were either strangely or incorrectly thought. I was amazed at this film for freedom - very, very disappointing and lost time. Sorry, it looks pretty negative, but I hope some people will avoid the same mistakes. At the end of the film, unfortunately, Q and A could now be interesting.
