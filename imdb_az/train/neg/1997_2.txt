This version is probably available in the local dollar store on DVD. Writing is not great, nor is it a vote, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 or few minutes of cash, you'll get the value of your money (which is not too bad). Anna Neagle Nanette is an extremely vapid. Despite its charm in the daylight, it does not seem to be obvious in this film. There are many great actors in this film (Helen Broderick, Zasu Pitts, Even Arden), but the material is shorter in scope. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see how successful performers get the most out of the weakest articles. The musical numbers (really only two) are terrible. Obviously, the studio does not have to make money from the original music of the original No, No, Nanette. DVDs can cost up to $ 1.00. It is just as you see it.
