Having noted the cast, I'm looking forward to a film that highlights this movie because I'm watching the movie in the 30s. This is not a gem - it's semi-precious. Anachronistic clothing and Rolls Royce limo of the 1930s hit you instantly. Casting is also strange. But basically, there are many dumb and unnecessary plot devices. This film has a very good ingredient and promising structure, but the ingredients are not mixed according to the correct recipe. It just did not come together. And that's shame. <br /> <br /> Film shooting is very good, but may be a minor change. <br /> <br /> The film is about a wealthy English husband - an American show (Jean Harlow), preferably of nobility. He responds with Fran√ßo Tone and his friend, Rolls Royce, a friend of his friend-employer. Harlow is wrong thinking, Tone, Lord of Rolls, and he looks at himself. This early part of the film is an unmatched light comedy. <br /> <br /> However, Tone explicitly reveals the fact that her employer is actually Germany's 5th columnist on the eve of the WWI, and that when the film's sound is completely changed and its fall apart. Tone and Harlow got married but were killed by Mata Hari (Benita Hume) as the beginning of the honeymoon, and Harlow flips the scene and is accused of Tone's murder. (In fact, Tone ends up.) <br /> <br /> Harlow flies to France, but is still in love - this time with a rich French witch (Cary Grant). Tone is now in the army and Harlow was unexpectedly brought together in a hospital room where he was rehabilitated after a plane crash. In the following scene, Tone accuses Harlow of abandoning him because he is actually a gold digger. Harlow does not explain anything about the witness' crime and his panic! <br /> <br /> Later, Tone contacted the woman who hit her (Hume). He was in possession of his Paramore, Grant tested Tone's new airplane from England. In an incredible way, Hume and Tone know each other, but just where they can not get out! Okay, so Tone was shot and almost died; Perhaps his memory is a bit smaller. But did Hume forget how many people were shot? <br /> <br /> This is unrecognized and unnecessary. Hume knew him, but Tony played coy when he realized he was unable to locate him. <br /> <br /> This issue would be better treated. <br /> <br /> The final is too dissatisfied. The film said that Tony and Harlow were plotting to maintain the good reputation of the witch, and Grant, as a hero, led to fraudulent assistance. Then Harlow and Tone go alone. <br /> <br /> What are the film shots? Harlow explains that he fled with a panic on his face. accusations of murder; Ton forgives him and gently refreshes his love for him; While helping to build a crash site to protect the reputation of the grant, it also takes a flare. By the way, Harlow finally recognizes Grant for the cad. Tony then saw Tony for a brave and noble man, and Harlow also renewed his emotions. At the end of the film, both are reconciled, as they come together to correct the appearance of Grant's death. After the grave of Grant's hero we embrace them and you see the kiss of the dead. It would be a nice little movie. <br /> <br /> For Cary Grant fans, Tone would have been better off playing the French witch, who had been killed and his long-term spouse, Harlow. <br /> <br /> Francho Tone's Irishman living in the UK, Cary Grant, is a Frenchman. This movie would be better if they re-set their roles. And it would be much more helpful ...
