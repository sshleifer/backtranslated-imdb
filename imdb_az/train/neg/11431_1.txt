<br /> <br /> It is important not to be insulted by the lack of logic and healthy thinking, and those who have "grave issues" will agree that this film will not work. <br /> Options and lack of depth in a characteristic building. It was very difficult to say when I was expecting the comedy word to laugh when it was used. <br /> <br /> Brother and sister of the upcoming 30s seem to have a good correction. They get a strange look at a park, and Heather Graham's character comes to him and he asks half of the questions that half of the people will be working in another way or at least a police officer will scream. Then he goes on a rudder and gives some stupid statements and falls for him. After a date, they all love it and decide to marry in Vegas for a week. Hi, does anyone feel cunning yet? She goes out with thousands of women and she talks to a man who is talking about 10 words on a single screen and wants to marry her. There was not just one item, it was not. <br /> <br /> Now Heather is with her and Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (when wearing a very characteristic) kiss or get to the point where the chemistry depends on whether you are there. I found it to be incredible and unfunny, and when I said that Heather would not be able to move many, Heather was a mistaken person for this role. <br /> <br /> This was the first time Sue Kramer was a director, and it was too much to chew on me. It would take a lot of craftsmanship to work on this film and IMHO to make better writers and cast and direction.
