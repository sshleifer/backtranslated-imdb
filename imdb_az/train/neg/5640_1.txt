I am a great Willem Dafoe admirer and I really need to buy this movie (I have to get 5 Chinese DVDs in one region!) <br /> <br /> Dafoe and Colagrande BOTH wrote and directed this (as the director (though not marked), and they have no different talent for writing or directing (Willem's Stick, Giada's dismissal, PLEASE!) <br /> <br /> It's absolutely nothing. (except that it was only met), with no exceptional motivation, except for the sequence.Colagrande is not sleepless, almost little change is almost no change, and sex scenes are clearly naked, Yes, I've been beaten twice, Yuck! They're definitely not the least erotic and you're still filming it's time. <br /> <br /> Simply put, it squeezes you. <br /> <br /> Just horrible.
