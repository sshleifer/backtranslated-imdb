I usually try to criticize the good way to fine-tune the films, but I do not believe it's a script step. <br /> <br /> "I do not remember when it was the last time I saw this movie so badly." <br /> <br /> This dialogue is very miserable, the actions are very bad, emphasized. <br /> <br /> Joseph Fiennes may have just killed her as soon as she started her career. <br /> <br /> Doctor Moreau's island was worse than that garbage.
