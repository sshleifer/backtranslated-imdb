Well, what can I say about this movie is that it is very good to see a very Asian face. I did not like about the movie, it was full of stereotypes that would make the role of the typical racist characters. The elderly has undermined the Asian culture and left the world's yellow land behind and left behind a black taxi driver "by keeping the truth." Moreover, placing the whole coke, Shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product became somewhat clear. The story was fun, but I thought about how the story would turn out. Later, when you look at romantic comedies you will not expect much, but still want to be surprised at least once. Parents are the best of flick.
