It was a poor lot in a lot of uncertainty and a poor film with many empty-ends to count. I just watched this movie because one of my favorite actors (Ron Livingston) made a crowd, and I continued to watch it, because I love any movie that includes male nudity for a change like a girl. <br /> <br /> Then, I wondered how ridiculous the line of my own story would be, and every time it's ... more ... ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Sean Crawley (well-visible Chris L. McKenna, I've never seen before - but he loves the little lantern scene) meets as an artist when he meets with electrician Duke Wayne (George Wendt, "Cheers"). Sean works with contractor Ray Matthews (Daniel Baldwin plays a stereotypic bad guy), doing more than Duke. Ray is being investigated by the City Hall accountancy (Ron Livingston in a community where I'm in love with "Office Space" to "Sex & the City"). Ray ended up offering $ 13k to Sean, a prominent accountant to kill a bookkeeper, and Sean accepted the job. Sean, the warrior, his wife (Kari Wuhrer) asked him to feel attractive, to finish his stroke, and to pick up leaves with Ray for him. <br /> <br /> Sean learns how quickly he's used to it, Ray does not plan to pay her, and Sean uses leverage to get her money. <br /> <br /> To this point, tracking. However, after Ray, Duke and their crew Sean denied the information inside the file, until the film's writer, Charlie Higson, seemed to be just dumber and dumber (and still DUMBER ...) dating from a 10-day post, he understood how to put an end to incredible confusion. Not only without specifying the movie, say, after each theft, you can "f ** K!" You intensify it, Sean's pretty timetable and as it goes on in the general way, is indispensable. Finally, when you have a large number of empty spaces in the movie, you start to regret it even when you watch it. <br /> <br /> This is just a movie that should be watched only after you hit the cable. The film should have enough beer and friends to mock the full value. It should have been a psychological tension, and McKenna is a worthy player, but the "Norm" from the "Cheers" and the Baldwin Brother, who is doing dirty work, is hard to give a kidnapping strategy. Children will love violence, blood, and scenes and completely unnecessary sexual scenes and boob boots. Girls who are robbing in a movie will almost certainly enjoy the beautiful Sean, which is always beautiful in a beautiful movie. Personally I hate that the only actor who needs to wait longer than Ron Livingston is only one-third of the movie.
