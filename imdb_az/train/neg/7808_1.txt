I'm a great Michael Madsen admirer, so it is necessary to say that I bought this movie even without hire ... This film is very scared, even when I did not go back to the store, I do not want anyone else to throw it into the rubbish bin, Never fall asleep, it was the price of throwing it. The player is not that bad, good or nothing. The story was terrible and the end looked terrible. He was a broken man, he was alcoholic. his life was a group. I thought of her horse, peanuts, a terrible device to show off childhood offense, a dog would be much better. I hate religion, so there is no doubt that it made me angry. Jesus heals everybody ... I hate to know that even as great Christians and Catholics, and God does not heal all or anything. It was a terrible movie if he had to see, cross, or buy or rent better, and throw rubbish and leave the coffee rooms until morning
