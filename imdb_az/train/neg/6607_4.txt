Some are, in fact, very surprising to the saints, but some are not as bad as to do so. In my opinion, Amitabh is as great as immoral Babban Singh - try not to compare Gabbar with the original because they are unclear until they come into the same effect. In addition to some mediocrity scenes, the rest of the movie is wrong. Character development was weak and the story's development was in many cases gaps and missing data pieces that I do not know if I read back in case of a DVD. The worst part of the film was the support role of Nishan Kotarini and his new friend, Prashant Raj. It is known from the moment the engagement lips are opened for the first time. When it comes to Prashant Raj, who is this man? What was there and why was there anything other than serving the drink on the ground movie studio? It has a zero functionality and has the same tone, dialogue, and free expression on every scene, whether it's a scene, whether it's a comedy or a death. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his statements changed, so we can say for his wife's mistake. in general, the RGV's Aag Amitabh's sophisticated performance, as well as its special appearance, is worth watching Urmilla Matondkeri.
