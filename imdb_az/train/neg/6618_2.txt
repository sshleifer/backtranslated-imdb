GENERAL PERFORMANCE: - Finally, long wait for AAG screens. Unfortunately, the audience could not set a progressive fire. The best thing to talk about the film is to rebuild the mighty CHOLAY. And Varma has made a great choice to change the overall background of the movie. If people repeat the same background, they will say that there is nothing new. Different backgrounds are proud, but do not deserve it. Teluguda used SIVA's same lighting and background funding since his career. I think about lighting Varma Paradise, or could be, or to another lighting techniques, such as Gordon Willis could be the godfather. All this is DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH DUTCH. Why Some Body Used Many Dutch Angles and Extremely Close Shots !!!!!!! Impact distribution is bare. <br /> <br /> Babban: - The Amitabhz case was preferred. <br> <br /> <br /> <strong> Varma, Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Bhai Mallik was as big as the plotting, but this time the best symbols of Hindi cinema's fencing was unsuccessful. There is no comparison with Gabbar and Babban. Babban, the more psychological rather than a soft corner for his brother's (the film is a gift). Amitabhz's performance is not his mark. His appearance is miserable. The wound in the corner symbolizes the forgotten treacherous black and white film. Dad is not successful. Babban does not compare Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha - the best thing about this character that the audience does not stand on his hands. If he did it, it would be like teaching ABCD bachelor's degree. Itz well opened early in the secret. But flashback is very miserable. <br /> <strong> Varma </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo - I do not have to worry about a dead body, or at least the character looks. The film's complete failure begins when the director can not work closely with our heroine. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - Its quality deteriorates and decreases. AAG can be regarded as completely C grade film. Sholay is a revenge fire, one of the city's problems, the importance of true friendship and fun Dharmendra praised highly impressed. AAG did not make any sense with the characters. Storytelling is so poor that the audience will not feel kindness for the characters. <br /> <br /> If you dare to watch this movie, do not compare AAG. RAMGOPAL VARMA will be burned live on KI AAG
