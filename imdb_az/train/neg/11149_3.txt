Writing: Full Moon. A lively, great werewolf hunt. It is not for the body, but for the blood (a bite on the road is not foolish), but for a companion. A hunt for a girl. No girlfriend though. Girl. A clean girl (and still a werewolf, though she does not). Three, well, knows that two police (after the first scene) and an old bag lady can stop it all or even kill a large number of people around the full moon and eat a werewolf. This is a special powerful Kurtadam Darkwolf, connects to the girl. If he takes it, humanity is condemned. The cops need to find his daughter, not just one of them, but also to kill him, and maybe he wants to kill him, but he is a self-preserving man. And then stopped it ... <br /> <br /> Comments: It's one for boys, teens. With half naked girls, it's less important for many scene areas. Mostly less. Yes, because the plot is fine, you need something to fill in for a while. And, unfortunately, there is nothing else to help the girls get rid of. One typically turns into two main topics. Nudity. Check it out. And then special effects. Hmm ... There are some things you can do well. They are not very special though. In fact, it's too bad to be blunt. The film suffers from lack of money. Some girls will not be able to afford clothes; the effects are cheap. One of the changes made by the wolf and the human being is a clear thing done by a computer. You can browse such things. But Darkwolf itself is very crude and you will not see any murder. Later, some injured bodies. <br /> <strong> They say: </ strong> <br /> <br /> Very often they are good, but unfortunately the characters (and or actors) just got lost. Part of these defeats may be related to the above problems. As with weak impacts and poor budget (?). There is a low cost of shooting that if characters are armed as a small army and the target is flat (and does not move). But when you're in a life-threatening life, there's nothing that can save your life as a good liner ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they can not explain these moments, because Cop, Steve, is a man who knows how to solve the problem, When there is only one thing that can be sure, the worm survivors know that the worm is just for the girl next to her, and she does not know that we have her. <BR> <BR> <BR/> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> <strong> yes. To give a small result: Not a movie I offer. <br /> <br /> 3/10
