I saw this movie in London Premier, and I have to say I did not expect much, but at least I expected something funny. Original "Basic Instinct" is a great movie and yet a "smut classic" thing, but it was entertaining. <br /> <br /> But this kind of Friday or Saturday night watching television on the television numerous times by entering the movie, there is no late delay. Is Sharon Stone still magnificent? Well, this way - it's too hot for a 47-year-old girl. Is it as beautiful as it really is? No. There was also plastic surgery on her face, and her hair slightly weakened in this film. <br /> <br /> Therefore, she does not seem to be soft, real, or innocent, regardless of her - this is meant to be a bad charm. The rest of the audience is terribly worse - and Michael Caton-Jones (normally a safe director - has never ruled out making big films, but has been managing to make valuable films) officially delivered his first true turkey; <br /> <br /> I've heard that the film has gone through a lot of editing sessions, and it seems clear since the start. She does not understand anything. All space is a cosmic confusion and ending - oh me! Talk stupid and incredible. (We can still predict). I saw "Gigli" and saw the "Maska son" and I do not look for "burning" this movie, though I was released five minutes before the start of the film, and those in the theater started throwing things. <br /> <br /> Basic instinct 2 is basically wrong.
