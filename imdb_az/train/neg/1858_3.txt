A consecutive killer dies in a snow storm and defeats Frosty Snowman's evil twin. Then a killing spell continues. Interesting area. It sounds scary. And scary. If you are five years old. Otherwise, this is the type of cheese. I saw him in the cables and I'm glad he did not have to pay for it. The Kult movie has all the charm and style of a budgetable movie. I'm sure that there is a loyal fan base. I am not alone. Although I did not like the whole movie, there were some scenes that seemed fun. It's like the wind scene and post-explosion scene that Picasso referred to. It was also pleasant to watch many ways heroes were trying to kill Jack, and he just did not want to die. In short, "Jack Frost" is a good low-budget B-movie comedy, but a bad low-budget B-movie afraid.
