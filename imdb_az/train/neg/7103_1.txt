This is the best way I can describe a new married couple fleeing to a staged home by a husband's first wife who died in mysterious circumstances. Good and good sounds, but what she's playing is an hour of clean boredom. In fact, one of the things about this whistle is a warning to anyone who is dying of a horror coffin at the beginning of the film. Yes, no one has ever offered to trust me, the plastic skull, the ceiling, the strange gardeners, and the doors that are put on anyone. And the music is the worst, it consists of a constant tuba music that is played by a sixth grader. And you will understand the horrible mystery that people in this film clearly see when they are really surprised. Someone dying while running and heading, while the police are not called for research. Yes, this is a boring little tale, gradually (really considering the bad film for over an hour), easily understood by the average person. As you can see, none of these characters were average person.
