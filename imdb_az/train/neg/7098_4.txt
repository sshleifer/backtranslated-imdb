There is also an interesting idea of ​​a movie showing the last spouse on earth and showing her and her wickedness. When he was young, Einon was stabbed in his heart, so Bowen (Dennis Quaid) took him half of his heart to a dark lorry. Einon (David Thewlis) is now a human being and a wicked king. Meanwhile, Bowen's new Dragon Drako Dragon (used by Sir Sean Connery) to get the dragons reward for "killing". But Einon has half the hearing of Dracoun because both of them feel pain or are killed. Pete Postlethwaite was played by Glottenspur Gilbert, Jason Isaacs like Lord Felton, Julie Christie as Queen Aislinn and John Gielgud as King Arthur. She was nominated for Oscar for Best Visual Effect. It's worth watching!
