In the beginning, I was convinced that this was a film prepared for this film, which is not worthy of my primate. But after a few moments of horror, I realized that there was at least a comic value, top stunts and c-movies. This film would come together if we were so lonely, my husband and I were surprised that the actors could hold a straight face. The Big Hit was a less funny spy version (I got a huge Hit DVD) and was even worse than a player. They forced us to chose Nick to marry Elena and not Jim, but after all the hugs and the rides. A few rum and coke will of course help you easily.
