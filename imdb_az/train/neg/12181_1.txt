Unfortunately, there was no 0 for a rating, or I would choose it. This film does not have the star energy in which the original film is so abundant. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of Aileen Quinn and experienced pro John Huston (the actress Angelica Huston's father) What is the appeal of this film? The update in 1999, along with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming, and Kristin Chenoweth, has so far offered more of this excuse. He was known to have played a role as a small Chrissie Seaver, all of whom had Ashley Johnson, a Growing Pain in the main show at the time before the film was protested. There were a few pieces in the film, but I do not know that he thinks he has enough talent to carry the movie with him. And Joan Collins, like Lady Edwina Hogbottom, is ridiculous! They could not get enough of players to play key roles like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan, and Annie, but were Joan Collins going to sign some British women? It does not surprise me that this film is as bad as it is. Critics simply did not agree with this movie, even when it was just for television, was a poor continuation of another kind of movie.
