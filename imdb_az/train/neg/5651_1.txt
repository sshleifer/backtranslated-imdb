I've seen huge and horrible movies in my life. I am not an expert in professional assessments, but I do not say anything about it. First, these actors are the worst I've ever seen ... Their player is so realistic that I want to shoot the DVD in the first two minutes. I think the quality of these actors is not interesting. <br /> <br /> Another horrible thing is that these dialogues are very bare. Sometimes you get disturbed when you hear it. As you can see, your 14-year-old son can do better. I feel that this movie has a budget similar to that of a 14-year-old European car ... <br /> <br /> Please be aware that when my message reaches you, you can save your time and money.
