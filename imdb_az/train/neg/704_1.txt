Effective romanticization of sexual abuse of black women by NewOrleans with the power and privileges of white men. Ooh. Does this satisfy your appetite? Well, then this unique trolling through a mix of VHS or DVD and seamy segment segments. For a good measure, the book was adapted from the book by Hack Anne Rice. The director is cloaking and melodramatic, like a cheerless dialogue. Most of the surgery is amateur. The only valuable note of the production is that it has almost never worked in today's marketplace (Jasmine Guy, Ben Vereen, Pam Grier, Eartha Kitt), including some faces that are almost rare (Bianca Lawson, Rachel Cuttrell). This is a sterling showcase for Nicole Lyn, though. Sincere and surprising James Earl Jones is also hand in hand. Thus, late Ossie Davis is a minimal talent that succeeds in dealing with the legendary Negro Ensemble Company. This movie should be a "T" grade for the tripe.
