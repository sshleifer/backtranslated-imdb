This film can be evaluated in three ways: as a date, as Amine's as a profane tension. <br /> <br /> This is a history that fails, such as passing the coup in Asia, throwing the Asians and Entebbe hi-jak in the background, but not in a chronological period. <br /> <br /> Amin might be interested in a profile because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good and if it were a better movie, he would have been an Oscar. (He proves that Oscar voters do not watch the films they vote). Amin and Uganda do not see the history of the episodes in the novel, which is a doctor's point of view. Instead, he explains the illusory story of the Scottish physician and his improbable love in terms of Amin. But the story is that Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fictional tension, there is no plot to bring it together. This is the beginning - it gets cinematic liberties with the novel, but it creates a story. The physician's character is well-defined, but he eventually disappeared in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> Why does a doctor decide to stay in Kampala? Nobody is strangely friendly if not friendly. The character of a friend in the novel has disappeared, because Scotsman has a job instead of a black doctor - a terrible confusion that does not seem even sensitive, but shows the film's writer Amin's stranger. At last, there is a man named Horse. Finally, in 1971, moving to the left in Uganda, not true, the number plates were three letters and two or three, and where were the equatorial marks? In short, if you have not heard Amin, you may want to film this movie for two hours to appreciate Forest Whitaker's acting, but the last hour makes you chaotic. If you know Uganda or have read the book - do not see the movie - it will just bother you. And if you wanted to know how foolish the doctor was, he was not.
