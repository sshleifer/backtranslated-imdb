OK .... I only 3 words - cheeseless, cheesy and cheese! The only charge for this film is Dean Ca√Øn. In addition - CHEESEBALL SUPREME! <br /> <br /> There are some words in the concept of the film - an underground laboratory creates a real wildlife breathing dragon - which gives us more "Jurassic Park", "fire domination" ..... There are some great opportunities, Special effects are good - Even though you know that the dragon is CGI, it's invisible CGI .... I'm not guilty of Dean Cain (even though he's a producer), the director and the writer In Phillip Roth, I get more and more fault. It's a HMS job to do this movie .... and, unfortunately, it failed.
