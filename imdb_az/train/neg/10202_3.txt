Murder by Numbers is one of the movies for television, but not a movie. Although Bullock is the only actor of any record (although Michael Pitt is moving on bigger and better things), it is not a big surprise that this movie lasts from the memory to be replaced by more important things. Do not forget to lock the front door while driving. <br /> <br /> Bullock plays with police on personal matters (Cassie Mayweather). Together with his new partner, Ben Chaplin, he is called to investigate the murder of a young woman. There is nothing unusual that perps are a few young pupils who have planned and executed the perfect crime. As the investigation continues, a fierce battle between Cassie and the main suspect Richie Haywood (Ryan Gosling) appears. <br /> <br /> The problem here is that the two reasons are hopeless. Although Bullock looks very nice, Rodney Dangerfield (in fact, it would be better!) Is convincing in the role of tougher kinematics. Chaplin is a complete betrayal of her sins and I apologize for the fact that I filmed this movie in an attempt to enter Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pitt blame themselves, as if they were suspicious suspects. <br /> <br /> The reason for the vote is not bad enough. When it comes to a story that is not going to fall asleep and high-level predictable (but not logical), the Bullock will not replace it with an unfounded nuclear scene, but it's not enough to keep it alive, predictable and unnecessary - this is a direct film genre that Cassie is likely to say in his next case that there is nothing to see people.
