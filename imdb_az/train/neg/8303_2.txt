After being released in 1983 on behalf of "A Christmas Story," Jean Shepherd, his alter-ego, was Ralphie's story, a true classic. "My Summer Story" is still presenting the Shepherd as a storyteller, but it does not have any charm and the characters are nowhere in the caliber of the original film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Charles Grodin, who is normally fond of, is not very different from the father's role (Darren McGavin is better officially crafted) and his character is irrelevant regardless of anything. Kiernan Culkin replaces the poor for Ralphie and his younger brother has been forgotten here. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong > Multi-layered and lined paper is thinner. It can still be very unusual, but can appeal to "A Christmas Story" later, it is very poor and does not fall into the majority of people. 10 out of 2.
