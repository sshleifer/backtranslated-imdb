I would like to use this movie a lot. He moved very slowly and was just bored. If it were on television, it would take 15-20 minutes. What happened to the story? A great cast and photographer worked on a wrong foundation. If this is based on the direct director's life, why did someone not see the writing itself as "empty"? Then he directed the speed of a snail and showed a few people shouting in the movie. For musical music, but for a different film, this is not .... for soap opera saga. Armin Meuller Stahl spoke when the dialogue was incomprehensible. I was not alone, because I heard a few voices about who she was. Why Hollywood Can not Make A Better Movie? It was a nugget of a great story, but only poorly executed.
