<br /> <br /> The head of a nearby Indian tribe who is a sympathetic cowboy, hateful and violent, is accused of harassing and murder. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to defend any bogus character at any entertaining level of looking at these bare nudie features. Terrifying costumes and all the Indians are clear white, making it look more like a moving animated film than a serious production claimed by the press. <br /> In short, many nudity is a good cause. Everything is nothing more. Both genres have definitely better examples. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Ramrodard's film shot by Spahn Movie Ranch and not one, two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, are likely to be killed when they hit the Pussycat Theater soda-showcase was!
