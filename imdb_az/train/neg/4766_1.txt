you can tell that it costs $ 5. this is the waste of time ... ugh .. there is nothing remotely about this movie ... .. I do not know why I keep watching it .. Chicken is not hot. we can do a pitiful act .. we can do something and use your time better .. watching tv playing crap video game .. I feel robbed. they just robbed my time. At first, I did not have any reviews for a movie, but I felt it was necessary to follow and save the perfect spirits needed to look at the IMDb. - If there was no movement - hot chickens - no budget - an unsuccessful activity - a bad film. **** SUPER movie in a room. ***
