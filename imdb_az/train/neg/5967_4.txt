I think that only $ 250,000 is spent to make the Secretary. Did they spend only $ 45 million to create this great music video? There is no specific impact I have not seen, almost unknown cast, two or three sets ... I know that it should be spent on essentially prepared, economical, tense scenarios. Drag the bar to a package. In any case, Jerry Bruckheimer will not be dead to get more. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was not a horrible film like that. Women's potential seemed to be a good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK. IMO This sad, unfortunately, a very successful project could have been worth $ 5 million without damaging the production and could worthy $ 6 million worth of the movie.
