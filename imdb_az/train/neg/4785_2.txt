<br /> <br /> First of all, this is a strange fear film for American standards. Dialogue is a cliché, the characters are two-dimensional, the writing is ho-hum and no matter how small the story is, it is neither crowded nor distant. <br /> <br /> We answer the following stereotypes: Balding Loser A brave heart, a young hero (who does not make any heroism), Brave Little Kid (one mile wide with a murder strip) and (this is not known to anyone) ) Black Bad-Ass Bitch (more corrupt than the brain). <br /> <br /> At the same time, this film is full of bad metal orbs around people who insult people. When given a chance, they make an impromptu brain surgery for people who do not have mental fatigue when it comes to duck. Booh! <br /> <br /> In fact, one of them has been staged by a good mood (yet it can be a fraudulent spectrum). Our Brave Contagonists are intent on helping them get their kidnapped friend. <br /> <br /> Or even an entry for any character. Until the end of the previous movie, it starts with a kind of writing, but it does not explain much. If you see the first two movies, it's good. Otherwise, do not worry about who these people are and what they are, why they are not at school or at work, or why you live or die. If you do, you do not. The only meaning of interest is the effect of any leap. <br /> <br /> <strong> It is disrespect for the people living in the Caucasus. </ P> <p> However, most of the time they can not get the screen. They were almost immediately closed. Then they are buried (no one should take time), then again Evil Raider looks like Punk Zombies. The rest of the film appears mainly consisting of Caspare, the Friendship Leader's appearance and disappearance, searching for places, and using Balding Loser, Bad Black Bitch Booty, a pickup line that is embarrassed by a young man with a delayed mind. There is no dice there; <br /> <br /> Some of the movies could save this movie. <br /> <br /> Tall Man is a bad person, not able to scare anyone over the age of 3; boğuşma "Booooy!" every five minutes is not enough. Why, because of its beautiful teletechnical powers and the upper body power, the reason why our heroes are not dismantled as insects are not disclosed. <br /> <br /> Find some fun people who like movie clips like "Friday 13th part XXXXVIII: Jason goes to college". The rest of us who develop poor hair will be squeezed out of our skull.
