I know people and made some animation and graphic designs, and the show is awesome! They were talented younger children and probably begged Nick to accept them! Alex played a drum for a year, I played for 4 1/2! The movie is terrible and this is the show! This is the most mixed comedy of fun, even funny funny I've ever seen. It's so stupid that this is what I want to do! It is so embarrassing that Nickelodeo will not accept this and anything like that! They are very stupid and strange! I hate them and give them their show, and Nick, most of all, I hope you know how foolish you are!
