This movie is really bad. He plays in urban paranaments of the 1980s and turns into a school context. I say that the murder of a town is not a problem for many people, or that schools are not problem areas, but this bad part of exploitation takes biscuits. Violence is not something beyond real imagination, but in this case, social, not white, upper and middle class pupils use it to turn itself into a local high school school crime. And, of course, he knows how to play the system. Get acquainted with voice. Yes. This turd, a fierce exploitation, is a really bad piece of work. It is anxious about anxiety, which is as public commentary. This is Exterminator, Death Wish 2-5 and so on. It belongs to the same category as some garbage, and so on. Noteworthy is that Michael Fox broke down when he was forced to do something like that.
