Like a child, I thought the killer was dry, but I was a kid, so it was a little dumb. When you do not use a lightweight blade to kill the murderers, the filmmaking is foolish and a little boring, like a dumb boy. I do not know if the film is really strongly beaten. While reading the movie, he reads what kind of script he reads and is a tool to show the light sword in the smallest size. The plot is sometimes incomprehensible and the last is completely chaotic. All the film looks like aliens and turn around a weapon. The landowner has two sons, and there are several old friends, and after a few years, the flash looks like a mixed return. Dead animals and, for one reason, a friend takes a foreign weapon and continues to use it to kill it very lightly. Seriously, you have to wonder why this movie is happening, if a murderer has a good scene of death, I'll show you something strange light vortex outside the encounters and if you have light swords, then call yourself star wars.
