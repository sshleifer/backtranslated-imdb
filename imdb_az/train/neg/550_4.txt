<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First, In the midst of Amitabh shows a very funny 40+ Akshay Kumar, a little nerd. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> Some feelings <br /> <br /> Recep's comedy is too long, but lengthened in the second half <br /> <br /> Vipul Shah's regime is very late though many scenes are good. Okay Amitabh overcomes it in the first half of actors, but it is superior to emotional scenes Akshay Kumar also feels good on her part, but somewhat embarrassed py scenes Bachchan and his chemistry with her unhelpful Rajpal emphasize that she is laughing without compassion and presence and steering behavior and deadpan humor is a healer Boman's some comic parts are good, but I'm not going to do anything because of the high Priyanka hero so far, although up to date with Akki for the latest film, Shafali Bachchan, it's awesome
