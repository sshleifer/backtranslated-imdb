I did not like this movie. I'm not sure. One of the films specially designed for the Oscars is that in almost every aspect of the movie, music is almost unbelievable, in a period of time, with septy tone imagery, ambitious name, NO SEX and horror, sfx / cgi explains everything and we'll get it (stupid audience). Although it is something that makes me fun, they are the truth that NOBEL PRICE WRONG wrote! Instead, they call the Nobel Prize (called Alfred Nobel) a "noble price." Jesus! Perhaps, based on a true story, it can make such a mistake in such a large production. What a shock! You and others thought RON?
