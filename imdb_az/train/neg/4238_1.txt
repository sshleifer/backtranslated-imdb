This movie is terrible. At the end of that, you will not be able to get back that you will realize that you have been kidnapped for a few hours. The end of the "bending" is very flawless. The characteristic development that has been carried out by this end does not ultimately match the recent movements. The four-minute preparatory - Rob Lowe's death on the eve of Christmas, when he says, "We say we do not cheat you" took ninety seconds. Then Rob Lowe's character is not even bothered by this subject! "If you can forgive me, I will forgive you," he says. Someone took weeks to convince me that I wanted to die and then said, "No, I'm sorry, I just cheat you." I am not worried about removing spoil because I can watch one of you. Please save yourself and DO NOT STAY THIS MOVE.
