This is a pretty bad movie. Area is artificial mush. I think production values ​​are good, decent photography, surprising direction, and all this. Mark Hamill was terrified. I have never been so careful about him, and this film confirms that perception. Not surprisingly, he did not really see any career beyond the "Star Wars" movies. I will only say "Boh-bibe, Mark" so that he can enter into a decent spotlessness. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts show totally stolen. He began to act with enthusiasm, beauty and exit. I recently remembered her at Texasville, and I take into account her beauty. Ten years ago it is interesting to see it. Anyway, if you are not interested in Miss Potts, avoid shooting this film out for the hills.
