Shortly after I was released, I was fortunate enough to get acquainted with George Pal on the congress and still asked him to select the movie "Camp". Before she answered, the studio's studio "knew the best" and "no one would take this movie seriously". Thanks to a friend for several years I was reading Bantam reprints (in the 1970s, ComiCon participants would remember Blackhawk and his band, and I was in it for a few years) and had more hopes. <br /> <br /> Sticks insisted that no high-profile adventure was seriously implemented and that it was not just a "camp". Several other supporters jumped at me, Pal listened as well as possible. At the end of the small event, Pal came to us and apologized after trying to do more. <br /> <br /> STAR WARS put the lie on the sticks and a year after Palin's death, Spielberg and Lucas Doc proved that Savage could easily be the next big movie franchise ... if not for these sticks <br /> <br /> Doc's memory or history and movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style Doc Savage can still appear on the screen and can escape from incomparable comparisons to Indiana Jones, but all seriousness and serious work should be done to restore the fame that Mr Superhero should first expect. <br /> SIDENOUSES: Yes, ARILENCE has a second scenario for EVIL, and that's more serious. Yes, there were simultaneous shooting shots, but mostly made shooting and very few players. Yes, there is a layer of Ron Ely leaking from a brick wall and exploded with a special lead pad. Ely change a powder on a button down the white shirt with bronze dress and "DOC SAVAGE: LIVE ARCHENEMIES ... Next Summer comes!" POSTSCRIPT: Who knows the studio sticks accompanying George Pal to the San Diego Congress in 1975, let the fools go down to their head and say their gaps. At that time, they carry dorkknobs and Fu Manchu ribbons and Baggy Linen pants and Paramount's portfolio.
