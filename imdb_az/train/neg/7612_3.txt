I will not be able to pass the message of this movie. It is so clear that we do not see it, and it is an exceptional thing because it loses meaning in what it is. I have not read a novel, but Pollack's film opens with a scene in a CIA front in New York, and we have come to know and understand the half-eductive admirable members of Max Von Sydow's two professional torturers, An elderly female receptionist in the queen, including a foolish old professor (who is a joke) falling over the toupee, and finally, a beautiful photocopier, Tina Chen, says, "I will not shout", killing and courageous. Von Sydow responds to sympathy, "I know." These crimes are not entirely unexpected, unilateral, and wild by everything we know. This is a cruel scene. <br /> <br /> There is no way that Von Sydow and his figure will be released. <br /> <br /> Pollack, after killing innocent good people, Pollack knows exactly what he is trying to end. Von Sydov opens the parties (the other party is ready to pay him) and behind the intraoral CIA plot, which is complicated by the killing of the deceased. The script translates it into a more perfect, sensitive person. "It's better to live in Europe, or whatever, I swear I have not done that, Pollack wants us to believe that an honest mass murderer is better than a better curve bureaucracy, and if you forget it, you have to write it down. do you think exactly how much psychiatric disorders should be? I understand that there are unbelievers who do not love or even hate the government of the United States, and have no imagination everywhere, and they provide a knee-throwing explanation for other unexplained events, there are people who think, because some of them are among my close friends, but on the one hand, this hate should increase the intensity, or go beyond politics or morals and the psychiatric world. I do not believe that a man is better than a bad civilian, and I do not think he knows how the murderer is suave or cultured or how he will go to Louvre at the Metro. <br /> <br /> <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This is pretty good (Sometimes it is bad that the film should be less refused.) Even New York appears photogenic on the screen I have been in New York for a long time since I was photogenic. Robert Redford sees an astonishing task to predict the first shock and confusion of his character, but then he becomes the sixth genius of telecommunications, and the human being looks so beautiful! His cloak is right, even his foolish goggles, and his peacoat, each one that looks glamorous in the sea pea jacket. not like a pig, it looks like a pig but I like it, I like to tailor it with a shirt and paper, but Faye Dunaway is good in its role, but it is not a very convincing role, someone exclaimed excitedly with a man who stole him and took him by gun even if it looks like Redford? When everyone's reaction is over, does Redford ask him not to tell anyone what happened? Cliff Robertson is a striking thing. She gets one or two very good pairs. Perfection is perfect. The battle in a densely populated apartment in Redford has become an elegant choreography, and once, Redford (a book reader) is a murderer, because he does not seem compatible with the employer's terrible plot. This is one of John Housemann's last roles. Shame. The display has a magnet. What is the end of his life: A friend walks in the streets of New York, in a neighborhood where he has been familiar with most of his life. <br /> Yes, the movie is being executed very well, but I do not see this bad, paranoid message. I have the same problem with Leni Riefenstahl's "Stroke of the Year." Or the speaker watches a foot race and says that Jesse Owens is leading her and says, "This Negro is dangerous."
