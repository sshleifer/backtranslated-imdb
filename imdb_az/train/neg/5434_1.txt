Amazing! Wow. What a terrific adaptation from a beautiful novel. There are only a few problems here. - The script has produced two main characters from the book. - The land has changed strangely. - Voice sounds are sounded directly from the passages (especially with the Chabon writing style, but not the same in the conversation). - The player is more than a log cabin. (Esp. Bechstein) - Will this be appointed in 1983? I feel more like 2003 ... <br /> <br /> I could not bring myself to watch this movie to be fair, so it can save itself ... (sarcasm). I really hope no one will see it, or anyone who does not read at least a book reads a decent thing (A la Wonder Boys). I like Chabon as a writer, but this harmony needs to be ASHAMED. <br /> <br /> There is no star.
