OK, we love hamisyel dukes, but what's with this cast. Just like Jessica Simpson, Daisy, there is nothing about this girl, Daisy is not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the best of the original. Burt is not a crime, but Boss HOg has never been so tall. The boss was part of Hugo's humor. Did not even try someone like Danny Devito? Okay, is Jessica Simpson getting what you're looking at her husband now? She meets Luke Duke's tee !!!!!! These manufacturers did not look at the appearance of old castle members. T-shirt never ducked! This movie has been a quit from the start. I give it a great head down.
