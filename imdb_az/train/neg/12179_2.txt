Do not even invite these awesome spoilers to look out at anything about 'Annie'. These characters are almost cheap with a bad story and they feel low quality for production. It was perfectly prepared for the TV, but if I found it on the TV, I would hit it flat. The film's children do a good job, but the adult guys are incredible, and the movie really does not get you. In this film, the work was brilliant and brilliant, and we really love Annie. Because Anson is sometimes annoying and moving on, Johnson does not really believe that Annie is actually. The differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the movie. Just say it was a common flop later.
