I saw early film viewing in New York, and I was very disappointed with my friends and many other viewers. The film was not as bad as it was not so good; he was as lifeless as a sacrifice victim. Samual L. Jackson seemed surprisingly tired and snake effects were naked. Despite being arrogant, this movie reminded one of the loveless SciFi movies. They all looked worn, flat, and clearly shaped. I was shocked to say that Anaconda was more entertaining. SOAP understands that it is part of it, and it's easy to understand that it's playing together, but the start of a movie is a scary-scary fear. This is the worst skinny film: it is joy.
