"Toxum" tortured porn ... there is no doubt about it. Strangely enough, Uwe Boll wrote, produced and directed a film that was more polished than any other in the last memory. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch Boll, I feel that the script has not been missing. The story and the dialogue are just gigantic. Of course, nothing is too meaningful. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> home of couple or triple Unlike real policemen who enter and clean themselves, what are their separate ways when they come to the place of darkness? Why do not the police use the radio? How quickly bodies can rot, usually a few months? (I know photography over time ... but the Toxunma will never be able to kill people unless the previous victim is expected to rotate at the point indicated). How is the seed? a mask while waiting for the order of death instead of the typical prison form? How can the seed go into the maximum security prison, walk around the cell block, and then repeat it without stopping and even without seeing it? Why have there been only one investigator in the case, even though about 80 people were killed (according to some newspaper articles in the film)? Why did the investigator suddenly decide that the seeds were to be found at Seed's house, where he was arrested for the first time and where he killed his victims? <br /> <br /> Why does not the police allow the investigation to go without even going back and even sending it and sending it? <br /> <br /> Boll is particularly frustrating when you are away from the path to understand that the electrical chair is not working properly. In a word, the film is only a few different scenes (perhaps Boll will think of his "visions"), the fall of the skin by removing the skin to the skin of bludgeon, electrostansia and live grass. (Animal popping scenes were really unnecessary and uncomfortable, but I understand the context of the film). Surely, medieval women are slaughtered by Seeds with one touch. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, but it has been spent a lot of time, and this is an uncertain way to the classic scene at Reservoir Dogs. No. Is It Worth to See? Only if you are a victim of torture pornography or are completely determined to see torture porn. As I said at the beginning of this review, if this film is incredibly disgusting and unhappy with the points, it is really more capable than most Boll films. Perhaps he will continue to develop as a filmmaker. I only hope that she is moving beyond the torture porno and continues to the core of Mail.
