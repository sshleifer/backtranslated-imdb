Sending stereotypic slasher flicks falls as short of fun as possible. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby and all the shooting were actually wasted. Lame is a lot of jokes and every blow line is a good telegraph. A sincere liner is progressing rapidly, and almost every one falls straight as a grape. Musical numbers only help to capture the boredom and lingerie of the whole film. Another negative is a completely claustrophobic structure within the walls of an abandoned high school. Avoid this and look for one of the really funny movies of one of the Lamp's "National Lamp Roses" - MERK
