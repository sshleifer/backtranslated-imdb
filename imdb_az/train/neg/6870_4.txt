Dindar Talmud's Mendelin (Glenn Fitzgerald) is a good-looking film about his wife, Sonja Horowitz (Renée Zellweger). Who is deeply diseased? Mendel's brother sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and encourages him to work in the field of jewelry. He begins to associate with him, and then when he starts to spend time with the Puerto Rican artist, he empties it and betrayed the family who carried it out. There is a place where Sonja's dead brother meets him, and apparently, the magic beggar takes the form of a form, but why is it not clear? Unfortunately, what happens with Sonja, unfortunately, tell Rebbe that there is a fire in it, and perhaps it does not mean God, it does not mean what it means to be a magic beggar. The story touches the situation of women in the ultra-Orthodox society, and yet Sonja is not fully released. That is the idea of ​​being bought with the love of a well-thought-out man of another race. This theme comes from the biblical definition of a good woman's value and is still a whispering reference to Sonja. Zellweger is partly fighting; he was supposed to be a Jew from the midwest and sometimes his accent was straightforward, and at other times he was taken from Brooklyn's characteristic voices. He is the best at harsh and hard work, but in the end, the film is a mess.
