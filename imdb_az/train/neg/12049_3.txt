The killing box seemed to me like a shirtless hunter boy and promised some laughter and sex. <br /> <br /> For several years, Mark and Simon have been together for several years, but which cartoon is not interesting? It is enough to care for, so it is difficult to think that they are caring for one another. Wrong appears not in scenarios, but in speeches; Both actors can do their best with what they do. <br /> <br /> The latter is fertile and ineffective (well, I'm not completely afraid, I realized I felt comfortable). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an exciting movie about night relationships and AIDS, "Parting Glances" is better.
