A film in a very bad, sometimes painful way against All Hope. This is Michael Madse's first film, and it shows that he is not good either. Some people can find the story ridiculous; an alcoholic lives, and his family is separated from one another and calls for a preacher as a last resort to help him. After conveying the wisdom of the Author, Jesus accepts Christ in his heart. <br /> <br /> As I walked from Cecil Moe to Madison, I found a lot of religious scenes, as it was quite realistic. He liked Cecil's life separately and he knew he was trying to get help, but he could only help him. <br /> <br /> This movie is not well-prepared. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; The player is bad, the script can be used in some jobs, and it's worse than my home video, but it's a good message, because you're now a Christian, or does not mean that you will heal a broken family, and Cecil is doing it and works hard to stay on the track, in general, if a Christian thinks that this movie describes Christianity, and if not, you will be called to learn more about faith.
