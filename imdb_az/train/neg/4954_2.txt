I have been raised by watching the original Batman Animated Series and collecting the picturesque Batman graphic novel. With a heroic comic book hero like Batman, there are some features that can not be changed. Creativity is good and good, but when it is completely changed, the character is too far away. I received the hopes that the creator of an extra bonus feature of one of the "Batman" seasons could create a reasonable light for this kind of violence. In an interview on the creation of Batman, one of the artists and writers (I'm not sure of it) said: "We realized that we should not be confused with Batman, but we can face the oppressors." So, an immature little boy who calls Joker, pants anime anger, and Mr. Freeze goes to the grave of Bob Kane, a super-thief, Poison Ivy, into a teenage hippie and many other embarrassing moves. <br /> <br /> To sum it up: If I had more hands, I could give this show for the fourth time. Batman uses only my 10th rating for using it. Warner Bros ... think of it again! Please!
