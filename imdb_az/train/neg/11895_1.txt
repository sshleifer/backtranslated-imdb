Oh, what happened to my God hell? !! I do not want to repeat that, but how much is this film going to be retracted? In this regard dublin is the worst way of dubbing "King Kong vs Godzilla", Linda Miller was the worst actress and his suits were really cheesy. Who is the one who wants to build a robot about someone robot? The gorilla with the same power as King Kong, but when the robot breaks, builds another and then tries to escape Kong. At that time (Linda Miller is annoying), he is his slave John, but everything goes wrong and King Kong runs away. When I was watching the movie later, Linda Miller and other clowns began. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < BR> I hope that the craze in the movie will end the fight when I play. The end was really a bad thing. If you watch the movie in any situation or you do not, you'll be disappointed with the disappointment.
