I do not see a lot of reasons to get more into this movie. Sylvester Stallone is also a writer and savior of "The Hell in a Hell" writer John Rambodyr, who was once jailed for taking photos of American prisoners who were convinced that Mr. Richard Crenna was secretly going back to Vyetnama, still in a terrible state. Indeed, if he does not do anything except hiding, pics, and leaks? Who would see the movie? <br /> <br /> This is mainly the Feast of Stallon muscles. We are preparing for his mission that we see his fatty muscles swollen. (They are greasy and bruised). There are ritual bouquets on black skin, ugly weapons and even ugly knives. Black weapons are cleaned, loudly sounded and lubricated almost like Stallone's muscles. The spring has been tested and yes, there is enough poundage to drive a bolt from an enemy's forehead. <br /> <br /> Stallone and one of her prisoners are betrayed by one or two suits coming from Washington. grammar school. Do not you know? <br /> <br /> Some of the movies have a direct appearance. At the popular rally since the mid-1980s, North Vietnam could not be considered quietly held in enemy camps. Bumper stickers were everywhere. (DIAs are free.) Why do they keep? It could never have been justified, but in a country where soldiers were unable to work, except for their ability to work, the prisoner was tortured. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> <br /> <br /> Rambo was captured in the Middle Ages in North Vietnam. His neck was dropped on the pig in his neck, and then his shoulders were dropped, his muscles were still showing. Part of the Gestapo officer - "Vee haff reminds you remember". A high-tech type of Russian language uses psychology and electricity, not just a piggy dump. <br /> <br /> Rambo goes back and declares his intentions to "unwind" this country as much as we love. The witches were a myth that they returned from their homeland, and they were directly dumped and cursed, so we chose a large number of Congresses and appointed others to senior positions. After the last three candidates lost their candidacy, it was among the most disadvantaged groups. <br /> <br /> Moving movies with Schwarzenegger, Willis and others have been opened with rarity, but Rambo is humorous. This is a brutal killing of fantasy ideological swamp, but it can almost speak. Speech is a sign of weakness.
