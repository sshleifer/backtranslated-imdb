Another example of a complete loss of money from the Lottery of England. This film proved to be commercial. The film was intended to cause a half-mutable, consisting of film scandalous film fiction films, one of which was used in one of the London's Old Films, which did not allow the film to be filmed, and that the film was to remain true to the film. and in particular I had to imitate the Death Line. Among its many sins, the leading characters to the last minute are quite clear to be remotely sympathetic. A little later too late! Undoubtedly, all these development managers in the UK Film Board could have made that difference in the script stage. Add to this terrible action and the laughable appearance of the creature and be an example of how to scare.
