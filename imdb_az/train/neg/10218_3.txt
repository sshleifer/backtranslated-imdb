** There are Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I've heard from different sources that this movie is controversial and especially awesome. The thing I did not expect was a complete change to go about twenty minutes. Something that began as a typical cowboy / Indian warlock suddenly becomes a very dull romantic "comedy" about Honus (the skeleton of a soldier played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen) who escaped from the cavalry attack with Cyan. Later, most of the film focuses on these two inaccuracies from the romantic comedy bit. Donald Pleasance then turns and misses them for no realistic reason. Later, they survive and both remain at the cavalry base on the eve of the attack on the Cheyenne base. When Cresta used to marry one of the Cheyenne commanders, he abducted and merged with the cavalry base. So ordinary so far. Then it comes to an end. After one hour of poor activity, they do not take part in a story that's similar to each other, and the film is then turned to top use that begins with something else and hits a child behind the head. At this point of the film, similarities with Wild Bunch can be drawn, but Wild Bunch has kept the same tone and did not apply extreme extreme violence. In some cases, Soldier Blue recalls the last summer of Frank Perry and has completely changed for a shocking end. I did not hate Soldier Blue and realized how uncomfortable it was, but I was very disappointed with the fact that the violence was over. If you want to see a movie with a massacre that is really troubling the criminals, I suggest coming to Elem Klimov's bride and look.
