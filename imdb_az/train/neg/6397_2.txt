When there is nothing to watch, I have a problem with movies coming from television. <br /> <br /> But this was a pretty bad movie. After a comet, the concept of being the only one on earth, then finding me zombies makes me laugh. And that's why I gave this movie 2 instead of 1. The story was foolish ... but in this way laughing (very stupid> funny). <br /> <br /> I think I just watched it because the man from Star Trek was heading. I was surprised to see him as a young man ... and he was always a funny character.
