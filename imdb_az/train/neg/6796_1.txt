Linda Lovelace was a victim of a sadistic female hacker, Chuck Traynor. I do not understand how I have sex with a dog (including animal exploitation), entertaining or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced to make these films. I know that some people will criticize this idea, but I feel that such kinematics burn up hatred and hatred and more tolerant feelings towards women. Unlike people, this society continues to portray women as sexual objects. We call ourselves "cultural", but we feel a long way to go before we crush the civilization.
