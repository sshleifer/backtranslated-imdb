What is this?! Is a comedy, a horror film or something? This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Especially in the novel scene, the scene should be the worst scene. This movie is not funny, not scary and fun. Do not bother yourself (and I do not think everyone will suffer from this movie) and WATCH THIS MOVIE! If you're a gift, throw it away and shatter it.
