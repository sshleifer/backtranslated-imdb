it's a good movie when it's a movie, it's more interesting than the lesbian relationships ... these two girls look like the Russian group, TATu, is not nothing. silence? I do not think so. In this film there is nothing original to support it, so it's a must-have to use something popular now. Other actors ... well, I did not know what their role was. Most of them are renowned people in Romania and there are no actors for them (eg Mihaela Radulescu). "Opportunity to use bad language for a non - field + shock," a girl group predator "+ desperate / open" actors "= Love illness .... very bad ... idea was good, though ... and I seriously keep myself without commentary ...
