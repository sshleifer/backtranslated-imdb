A year before ILSA, SS's WOLF, BLACKSNAKE could easily be called SUSAN, PLOATIN SHE-WOLF, and may have inspired producers behind Nazi sexploit epics to continue with more sad movies than stories. the same: a beautiful, brutal, powerful (but foolish) blonde woman kills and kills many critics and killing many women. I know? Director Russ Meyer and producer ILSA Flicksman David Friedman are good friends and have started their career. That is, there is a clear link. By looking at BLACKSNAKE, I can not help, but I think that Russ Meyer, in the mid-1970s, was all angry and wanted to do something other than the typical busty female epics, and Russ Meyer's films were actually nudity and noise and violence never was close to the actual pornography. His films began to appear quite strange with DEEP THROAT and other severe punitive blur video blocks. Meyer knew that she could not compete with such films, and BLACKSNAKE was the last result of her difficulty in her career. Undoubtedly, she wanted to divide into a different region. But BLACKSNAKE B.O. also bombed. <br /> <br /> Unlike some movies, Meyxana has produced films of the VIXEN type. Although they were not pornographic, they were far superior to their previous films. <br /> <br /> A BO was a failure. Just horrible. Trash-o-rama. Jaw-bad. If you can imagine, this is not about slavery. The final result does not work. One minute we are in the typical Meyer area: enthusiastic, entertaining and foolish, and then super serious thinking about the next minute, slavery and violence. Huh? This does not just work. In terms of slavery / racism, it is a very unpleasant phenomenon, and it draws the film into a real exploitation category. But BLACKSNAKE SS and similar movies are not as sleazy as ILSA SHE WOLF, so the fans of the latter will be disappointed by the fact that fans of this race or Russ Meyer have almost no interest in this film. Meyer accuses BLACKXNAKE of failing because I also said, "It was not enough in the hearts." Yes, I'm sorry Russ, but the film is just bad, breast or breast. But it's true even though it's about the breast floor. Filmmaking is exceptional, except for Anouska and a servant. Meyer is replacing his usual bear with babies with throng hunks with massive pecs in the form of anonymous black actors playing with the slaves and great David (Darth Vader) Prowse. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Of course The star David Warbeck, who was lusted by Anouska and his right hand. Poor David. He looks completely unhappy with all the experience. Although the movie is fun, it does not even know what happens. And then there is Anouska Hempel. There is a beautiful woman, not for the 1970s, but for the 1870s. With her makeup and hair, a turn of the century's dominatrix looks more like the 1970s Brit pin-up babe. Her wardrobe is not funny. At one time, she really unzips her leather boots! I did not know there were zippers in those days. But the character he is playing really deserves the dignity (no purpose is expected). It is nothing but a password for the purpose of lust and dignity of every man on the island. For example, one night, David and Anouska In it, he walks in the room teasing slave driver, David and his aggressive way of unconsciously moving zərbələndirir trying to rape her. The next day the slave driver still works for Anouska and as the two moves have never happened. Totally funny. In any case, if his character is a real person, Anouska slave driver would be a foolish way kopunu island cırpmıs scored. Or even killed him. <br /> <br /> If the woman keeps her in agriculture after trying to force her to get it, it's the staggering story and symbols reaching the maximum level. <br /> <br /> It is quite astonishing as blaxploitation angle Blacksnake ridiculous details and a strange unpleasant, but watched the film. Traffic accident can be monitored by diversity. I just could not help, but I could watch for the full baseless aspects of the movie (it's easy to watch perfect cinema sorta). So, I think to be an exploitation film, it should be able to. But according to Blacksnake Russ Meyer completed.
