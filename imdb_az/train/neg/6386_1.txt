I really like this movie, but it was simply impossible. The player was ultra small, the plot was crushing and the tempo was SLOW, sooo slowwwwww. I always wanted to end the movie sitting in the theater. I'm 20 minuets for a movie and I pray to an end. Certainly some of the visuals were nice, but guys really mean me! And there was not much music to really talk about for a movie that regulates magical instruments about a boy. There the music was annoying and boring. There were also noise noises, and they were also annoying. Basically this movie poured me and at the same time succeeded me. <br /> <br /> I'm glad of it. I have to go to Tideland and get this bad taste out of my mouth.
