How does this movie believe it earns 6.7 degrees? This is worth doing better than 2.0 and it is clear that IMDb should be ranked among the worst 100 films of all time. The National Treasure is an insult to the national intelligence and another attack made by Hollywood by an American audience. <br /> <br /> I love the good of this movie ... "Nicholas Cage is lovely." People come to think that Americans around the world think the Americans are fools. This is the most stupid, insulting film I've ever seen. If you want to see a really decent film this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Millions Dollar Doll or Side. National Treasure, unfortunately, has more prominence than these terrifying films. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is a great actor in this movie, right in the movie. I saw his terrifying talent in films such as Cage, Con Air, The Rock, and Face-Off. <br /> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;
