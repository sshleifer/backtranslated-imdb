In a parade you hate raining (even a small one), but on the first stage, you can say that this movie is absolutely Shiite. I really like his shame, like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I was wondering how to mix it in a movie, but for the sake of my heart they did not play in the same place! I think it is necessary to repeat it - two leading actors (standing side by side in advertising banners and DVD coverings) did not have a single scene !!!! They do not talk to each other and do not appear on the screen at the same time. Makes these poor excuses for a movie. Fake advertising. <br /> <br /> Dialogue was painful, every character in the film was like an unreal and non-human being. Scenarios were very far away, the plot was empty, the jokes were exquisite, Freeman worked so hard to be funny (and a poor man in the office worked Tim), nobody liked it, and worst of all, some of them were like this <br /> low budget stinker was an epic failure. Even Danny Dyer did not give some humor and charm to this job, but he did. <br /> <br /> Everyone who evaluates this film as "ten stars" is beyond me. Ten stars? Seriously? Come on .... I'm not going to give some of the ten children because I'm showing that the star is a perfect film. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch, but if you watch most of the movies and watch a lot of movies <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red ; ">
