I was surprised to see this novel on television. In May 2008, I was in Six Flags in New Jersey, and it was shown in the 4-D charm (you know, the attraction of the seats). I saw that the version I saw was a shortened version (15 minutes) and it was re-created to add action effects. It was a cute movie ... but that was it. It was informed about the education and the first mission, but the CGI space trip seemed a little silver. I'm not a big fan of the movie, but I recommend this movie to any parent who wants to inform their children about the first moonwalk fun. I can say that character actors were well chosen and the characters themselves were very sweet. That's all, if you want to bring small children ... get. But when you try to take your adult, take another movie ... they will thank you.
