<div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Something was absolutely missing. In my opinion, people need to have something to look at in the past from the historical point of view. The accuracy of history is not what you are looking for in entertainment. <br /> <br /> There is no substance in the movie. This film is the only way to get the right to make a change, as if it were just some sort of legend, instead of just one story. And to a legend, the things people have forgotten over time, such as sacrifice, nationalism, and so on. It will have some elements that make sense. <br /> <br /> This movie is not the main theme. <br /> <br /> At least a strange legendary Flying Elephants, a psychiatrist, or eccentric king such as "The King and I" would be a nice addition, adding something to the film's appeal. There was no complaint except the flat vanilla film. <br /> <br /> After coming to the appeal, the story is the next thing we come together. In terms of marketing, we call it "must see". After hearing the name of the film, people would say, "Oh, you should not see it." What is the application at Kingmaker now? Why not just repeat the title and call it "Do not be a king?" and "Dr. Strangelove" to make a black comedy of old political days. It would be more interesting. The heroic experience of the king about the kidnapping of the first person would be very funny. <br /> <br /> Most of the day's movies have to "see" the "Spiderman", "Men X", and these topics speak for themselves. If there are no familiar characters, some of the movies like the island have the ad, "Do you still believe there is an island?" <br /> <br /> Or you can answer the question "DO NOT KNOW" to the movie: "So you want to be a King yet?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
