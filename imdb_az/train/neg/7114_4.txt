If cinematography is going on, this film was very good until the middle of the 50s. Several times the lighting was very hot, but the shooting was generally in the frame and remained in the spotlight. The player was at a moderate level for a low budget stinker, but the direction was terrible. Many scenes quickly moved into action and their effects were inadequate. The attack by the skull in the pool should be completely cut off and every attempt to bring life to the skull was clear with stick pokes and strings. I could not help, but I thought that the budget did not allow the transfer of the house, because they were referring to the carriers and I thought that all the things kept were coming soon. Honestly ... a worse film would be more entertaining. It was not bad enough to be a "good-evil" movie, but it was not good enough to be "good". Get the MST3K version ... more entertaining.
