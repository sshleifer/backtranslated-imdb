When I first saw this movie, I quickly saw the actress playing Lucille Ball. Rachel York's Lucy's images are completely scary. Lucille Ball was a striking comedian with incredible talent. Thinking about a legend like Lucille Ball is horrendous, as described in the movie. Not all actresses who can play a better Lucy in the world, the producers have decided to buy Rachel York. She may be a good actress in other roles but Lucille Ball is hard to play. Finding someone who looks like Lucille Ball is quite difficult, but they can at least find a bit similar to the look and talent. If you notice that York's Lucy's Lucy's Lucy's episodes are classified as a chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is in any way different - its expression, voice, or movement. <br /> <br /> Pino who plays Danny Desi Arnaz is terrifying. Pino Ricky is not worth playing. He is small and brittle, his emphasis is unreal, and once again, his player is incredible. Although Fred and Ethel are not the same, they are not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, extremely terrible castings and stories are spoken very badly. If people want to understand Lucille Ball's real-life situation, I suggest watching Lucy and Desi's A & E Biography, read Lucille Ball's self-study or find PBS 'American Masters: Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, "before laughing" is a better choice. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz's "Previously Laugh" movie are better than this. At least, there is more in a similar aspect.
