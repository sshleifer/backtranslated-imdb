This is a "A Christmas Story", titled "A Summer Story." Ralphie explains family adventures in the summer and moved to a small town in the middle of nowhere. Hilarity, unfortunately, will not happen. <br /> <br /> The original worked for lack of character and honesty - everyone could have been involved with it. It's just stupid and not very funny. Charles Grodin's latest film - no miracle! This is one of his poor roles. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburger does not have to be surprised that everything is shaped and even disturbed. <br /> <br /> I also want to say that the competition with spinning balls? Unfortunately, it's the best part of the movie ...
