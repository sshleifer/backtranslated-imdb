This series is meant to be a change over Batman - The Animated Series, I think, for one, it's been a lot of failure. Cartoon boots are bad ... (Catwoman, for example, looks terrible ...) But the thing that really bothered me is Batman's two helpless, even three sidekicks, who are not alone in a single battle. I want to say that he is Batman, for God! I know comic books, and I know that Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be Batman allies alongside Robin, but still ... They say Batman should help them ... Can not he handle a few fists? In BTAS, he can face many competitors without any problems ... Does he become old? Come on ... <br /> <br /> And something else: I do not think Batman will allow a child like Tim Drake to come to the battle without a hard workout soon. Batman - The Animated Series, with its history, history, history, animation, stories and symbols ... was a legend of Batman. The series of new adventures turned the legend into another Batman gear.
