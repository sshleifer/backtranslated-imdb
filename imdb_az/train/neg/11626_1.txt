This can be the worst show I've ever seen. In addition to the lack of a sitcom on Hitler, it is not funny and fun in no way. The Sitcom of the 1950s looks very sensitive and respected, but it's not funny here, though it's done well with Lucy. In my opinion, the show's novelty "review, it's based on a bomb sitcom figure of Hitler," but just dropped from every point. The guy playing Hitler is so sincere that it is difficult to sit alone. Undoubtedly, I thought the network was a good idea. I thought it was some of the tasteless show of America, but the Brits had to beat us this time. The American did not ever issue a sitcom on Hitler, though there is a show on the Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer, the slave of Lincol. Your chances are you will never see this show because only one episode will be broadcast and will likely never be released on the DVD.
