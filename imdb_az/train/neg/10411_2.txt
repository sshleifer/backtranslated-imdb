This is laughable. I've seen a group of Fassbinder movies and some of them have been extremely creative and interesting, some of them are rude and attractive - like this one. For me, it stretches to something big - there's not much in the middle. I know he is a lot of "sophisticated", but I can not help but think that his many requests are clean palms. From my point of view (and I know I'll get a lot of negative ratings for it), she has shot very often and has drawn much of her. Her gay or gender-bending movies are really bad - sometimes pretty boring (eg BITTER TEARS like QUERELLE and PETRA VON KANT) and sometimes just expensive (like this movie). Is not his message about accepting a person's sexual harassment better than watching cows to clash or trap it? Show some sensitivity for the subject and make your characters more sympathetic to people - and then, perhaps, pay attention to my films. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I can not worry about Fassbinder movies right now.
