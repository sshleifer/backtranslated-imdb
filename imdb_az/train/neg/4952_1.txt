Okay, I've always been an admirer of Batman. I liked the animation series and even Batman Beyonda. Now and then read a batman comic. So it is possible to imagine - when I heard about this series, I was a little excited, and then glad to MEMBER. This series is nothing. It does not even begin to compare with the original series. It's like a long TOY trade. There is no depth. And what was heck with Joker? My most modest ideas, the best of all times, were the Batman, and they killed him. I want his design to be the worst part. In fact, I would say there is something about this series that is far from creative or interesting. In short, do not waste your time on this show or money (I can say a lot more because I believe).
