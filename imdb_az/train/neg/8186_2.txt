Did anyone read the script? This should be part of the worst writing and leadership of the whole year. Three great actors Paul Giamatti, Rachel Weisz and Miranda Richardson could not do that. About two-thirds of what you look like, I do not believe I signed the contract. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but in the really bad Christmas movie list. Not enough line, what else can you say? Okay, the film does not just act with Vaughn's friendly dialogue; it's just a creepy man, whose nature can not just be past. It just showed that no one was able to get in.
