<br /> <br /> Can this be a scary movie? There is no fear, or it runs out, only BOOM BANG GORE, then done. <br /> <br /> Some movies use some strange, unhappy reasons in the wilderness, and they will be hunted by animals charged with the first film, which is a good movie, and they should leave it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < They know what the meaning of the plot is and they will be able to add more, people will see it. I ran scary horror films. Come to Hollywood, you can do a lot better.
