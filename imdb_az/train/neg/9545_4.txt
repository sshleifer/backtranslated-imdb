Farmer (Lanter) will play a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack and a super-state computer designed to connect with potential terrorists, Ripley, is a class trip to Philadelphia to play chess in his next door neighbor's bank account. The next neighbor neighbor, who assigns a computer to Will, has relatives in the east to send money to his neighbor's bank, and Ripley sees a terrorist link. Ripley has the power to invade missile strikes. Oh, oh! <br /> <br /> This version of War Games has a faster speed and aggression than the War Games movie in the early 1980s. Yes, the electronics industry has much to do with these days. It's meaningful. So the film looks at us with a fantastic CGI on computer screens and is a once-in-a-lifetime detective for Ripley, looking for a computer with a computer, and heartfelt, hoping, praying, talking, OGG, and more. Hopeful things will continue. In other words, we live in a film prepared for a TV and it's Oh Hum Time. Go back to the 1980s and watch the movie of original war games. Better. <br /> <br /> But we really have to ask ourselves: Where do you make smart computers one day, wherever you are? Hmmm ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: Nudity: No. Language: No
