With these movies, you know that you have ordinary jokes about ghosts. Eva is pretty funny as a ghost. And other actors are doing well. There is no direction and story. The images could not have seen better. The problem is not just a few jokes. Of course, he laughed a few times. Apart from the singing parrot, there was no creativity in the film. I blamed the director for not using his location for the full potential. Eva has, of course, had a comedy ability to show more, but she did not let it happen. Generally, this movie is perfect on a Sunday afternoon. It can also be completely skipped.
