I'm not going to waste my time writing more about this aspect of the film as it is worse than imagination. It has already been completed many times. "The field" began as a multi-axis cockney spinning boy / gangster-by-numbers and quickly turned into a shameful stupidity. Everyone who is able to see a secret witness in this terrible confusion just deceives himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < the only reason I went to see the film is that it is an entertaining fact that my brother Eddie is second in the pub scene. He was in the bar of "Russia" on the face of Rhys Insan, who had a zippo lightning on his face (actually shot in the former Butlins holiday camp on Barry Island). My brother certainly did not experience any activity - recently joined an agency of additional services, and this is his first part. <br /> <br /> After seeing the film, it turned out that nobody would ever function. <br /> <br /> He recalled that there were about eight people in the whole movie, and that was just a few days after his release. I never heard a movie that was not popular and very fast - and that's it. If you're thinking of hiring this movie on DVD, I'd suggest you put it in a fire instead of two pounds of red coat, then put them in the eye slots. It's likely to be less painful than watching the movie.
