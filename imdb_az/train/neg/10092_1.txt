Seriously unhappy film. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the film begins with a police officer and his partner is on the edge of the warehouse / furniture store. When the "bad" police ponders things that can happen outside a new police station, they take a girl to a wardrobe. As a result, the "bad" police turns around with a heavy duffel bag, and the new police does not think there is any problem, but still wondering what's in the bag, so she asks, gets angry, and then thinks everything. <br /> <br /> " Bad "police repeats this process, even once with the tit scene (slightly better). But in the end, people start to pick up, and how does that look? When a girl dies, she gets a curse of a voodoo. Now, the "bad" policeman kills this miraculous herd and then escaped from the duffel-bagged body. <br /> <br /> Since he has oogey-boogey magic, he has an eye shadow that can be a zombie too ... and magic curse makes all other girls "eye shadow monster". Some girls meet with a friend who is a currency expert, and offers them a ride (they seem normal to her). <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> On the one hand, when the girls see each other's wife, she is frightening (some are strange, but others do not even feel) .... great earth hole. <br /> <br /> So, to cover it, kill the "bad" police who end up being a zombie on the last stage of the eye shadow monsters. It was like trying to prepare us for later! It's like those who want to see two parts of this part of the human body.
