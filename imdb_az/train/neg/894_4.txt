Just yesterday I saw at the Sao Paulo International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ strong> > <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> anywhere and worst and worse: the abundance of Siemens and Organics ads in the movie. Despite the fact that I gave money to go to the movies and entertain myself, I still have to bomb the main character talking on the internet and always overlapping the Siemens mobile phone; or in the bath or another haircut, to show the Organics shampoo pretty much on the screen! Awesome, symbols, romances, something good, but it would be harsh if bad, really bad! <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
