It was Vampyres who watched this movie, and I thought I had to get other movies because Larroz did it, I was sorry to explain it, a weak attempt to download a secret / satirical movie was sex and only sex (with ugly actors and actresses, for this sleaze it's just an excuse.) It's just a regenerating factor and the atmosphere, it's too intense to cover it, it's not worth the effort to find it, Vampires, Oh and the Goat scene have other dreary films, I hope this hype I hope you understand.
