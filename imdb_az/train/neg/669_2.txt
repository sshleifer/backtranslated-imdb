I'm usually the person who holds his ideas, but I'm back in this movie and expressed my thoughts. Let me begin by saying that I am a big fan of fears. But what makes a horror movie? I really want to see a small part of a good script and character development. I know they are not often in horror movies, but the Prom Night resembled nothing to do in this department. Next, we love the grace of all of us. It's on the edge of the seat with unexpected surprises. Yes, Night Night was nothing like that! Certainly, we are a terrible murderer. Is there a prom night? No, you have a nice guy with a cute lil blade. And while others have failed, at least the horror of their guilty pleasure is gore gore and make it a random nuclear scene to make you happy! Yes, when you give the PG-13 a horror movie like Good Night, they leave that stuff. That is, all of these elements are missing, I ask .... is it still a horror film? Nope. I could say more comedy. People in my theater were laughing more, but in the film Semi-Pro I saw that it really should have been a comedy (this was also a question, but another story!). I just have to give up the new horror. All the best movies of a good day, when the movie studio can make money, have become trash. The people I went to see it did not know it, so it was a remake! Which made me mad! What happens if there are no more movies to rebuild? Where will the horror come?
