When I was a kid, I hated this show. The symbols of the kids were really on the day they were highlighted, not only mild, but common, the General American Dialect we used. Jack Wild was an English accent and was Pufnstuf's south. Although I did not understand what happened to the witches who wanted to do the job, as was the case with one another. <br /> <br /> Pufnstuf's comment on the similarity of McDonalds ads in the early 1970s was surprising to me, and the flute probably bothered me, and I was not upset to get it! According to others, Pufnstuf destroyed McDonalds. At McDonalds's popularity, the television show (or, more precisely, their creators) tried to show McDonald's characters, but when McDonalds did not accept the television show, the characters changed slightly and accepted it. Older employees and voice actors from McDonalds advertising agency were even hired to show television. McDonalds claimed and won. Pufnstuf find McDonaldland's claim and find articles about it.
