The main reason for this film was Mira Sorvino for a number of reasons. They could not have been so bad with the castle. And even seemed like a mystery, and then Olivier Martinez was his lover and he was 'Faithless' pretty good. The story is based in Spain, which can be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses. <br /> <br /> If you think the same thing, I warn you: this is really terrible, uninteresting, boring film. <br /> <br /> The story is full of subfields that do not add anything to the narrative. They try to build a slasher / thriller by looking at fascism in Spain, but not heartwarming. There are no credulity of fugitives, and the so-called investigation is nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> The heroes are paper! I did not care for anyone. <br /> <br /> Therefore, they are very worried and very hateful. <br /> What is Mira wrong with you? Why Mira? You are an Oscar Winner! Protect some dignity! Her character was weak, but there is no excuse for such a terrible performance. It looks like all the movies have been sleeping for a long time. When it comes to thinking about it, I really think that in some scenes, it is slowly shutting your eyes. I thought this woman was sexy. Well he is not here. If you want to look at some of the skins, Romi and Michelle, there's nothing you can see here. And that's the accent? My God ... <br /> <br /> Olivier Martinez is even worse. It is painful to remember his performance to describe it here. Sorry, but I can not. <br /> <br /> All this film suffers! It is so bad that in every respect it is even a miracle. Create a legendary team exciting scripts and make some money on behalf of the actor. <br /> <br /> Avoid her! <br /> <br />
