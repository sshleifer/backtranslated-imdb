You understand that you've seen this five-minute movie before. BOYA ROOM. It is a company. And it is DEVILS ADVOCATE. No new items here. Everything except Bill Gates-allegory is clear. Conpsiracies are always good things to shoot, but why should they be so extreme? The boiler-house is a good movie because it seems to be at least real. Everything in the antitrust is wrong. For example, what is the inadmissibility of being your girlfriend's comrade to work hard and manage you? I would give it 1, but the soundtrack was OK, so 2/10.
