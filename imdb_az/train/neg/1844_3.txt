Personally, this show is pretty cheap. Some of the actors are terrifying. They do this and look fake. I can say that I will always follow it for the first 10 minutes or less since it's always transparent. This is not very well written. I love to watch it laugh. You know, "Well, that's okay?" Well, that word is for this show. I also understand that I just want to see if I'm right. So far, I am always right. It's like a game I play. When you are bored, you like it and you feel like laughing at something.
