This movie was like The Dark After Disney Channel. Removing the language and theme "We're not good" and you remain with dialogue and building devices that offend the intelligence of anyone who does not portray it as "cool by the Bell" as a quality TV. Dialogue dialogue is so funny and knowingly contaminated that it is a product of Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room that gives orders to combine every evil script created in each of the scenarios. If that was Roger Kumble's mission, the mission was over.
