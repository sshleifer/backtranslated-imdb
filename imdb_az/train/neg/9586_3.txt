After the Disaster Revolution, this film was the Goldcrest and thus the ultimate achievement of the British film industry coffin. The film is definitely a trumpet, in the mid-80s, full of jazz revival and a well-known book and author-based music, and dignified by perfection. Temple tries to find Suzette and met with another 8-year Wonders Patsy Kensett, who was soon to become famous. Jazz's release has come to an end because of the film's post production, just like Kensett's career, and the film has completely met the uncaring movie community. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mediocre would be an overstatement for some of the worst / camp / english silver screen, about 20 years, and the movie is really terrible.
