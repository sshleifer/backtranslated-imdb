<br /> <br /> Firstly, I was skeptical, but after seeing the cloud cloud, I changed my mind and finally convinced that we had sex with watermelon, killed or lived. of course no safe sex. (terrible ugly) leading person after the dead lady hit her in the mouth of everyone. Did not hear HIV? <br /> <br /> The rest of this film is basically boring, and it is incredibly rebellious. In fact, it was a disgusting thing to turn off my eyes because of parts. sex with people who died! How is this common? and what is behind the message? We need water, we need melons, should we be dead to have sexual intercourse? Sorry, but that's a mistake!
