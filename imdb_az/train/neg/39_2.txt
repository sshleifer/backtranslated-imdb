An actress who was filming a film in Africa was abducted and taken to the jungle where he was held for ransom. The manufacturer takes a job to go and bring it back. <br /> <br /> It's a hanging owl that is a really "ugly" goddess who loves to eat these naked women. There are many nudity and violence to avoid violence against naked people. His exploit film was designed to appeal to the darkest parts of our existence, and if the film was not so dull, this would be a classic one. Despite this tragedy, this film is a snoozer, an evil sex and assassination and ugly monster. Pacing stays outside of anyone and leaves you alone. There are many plot lines that occur separately from each other, though all of them are a story. All the worst, almost nobody says anything. Most minimal dialogue relates to a cruelty or a symbolic protest "I'll do what I want." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ div> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <STRONG> has a signal from a clipped Japanese source to eliminate subtitles, and there are no opening headers inside them)
