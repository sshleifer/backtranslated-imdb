The worst movie I have ever seen! It starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way. When something happens in this movie, thnik, and the player is worse. Raises the latter slightly and keeps the film from total flop. Mark Wahlberg is a bad player in a bad movie. Sorry, Tim Burton Batman was good, but that's something.
