According to many others, this is a terrible film in every aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> Many people have complained about being pulled to "cheap" video cameras. Yes, the video is taken, but it's not a 'cheap' video. <br /> <br /> Many different shooting and editing methods are being used. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the digital kitchen, the use of harsh, contrasting lighting, handmade shooting (ala Woody Allen), angry editing (other Allen technique) scenes are embarrassing; <br /> <br /> Sexual scenes did not work at any level. <br /> <br /> How is this video not printed in any way? It is necessary to watch how surprised I am.
