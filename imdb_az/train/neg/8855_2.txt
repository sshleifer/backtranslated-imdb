Yes, the first "dream" was classic. A good wolf film that I received was slow, but he gained momentum along the way to get a good finish, and then the luggage turned out to be a pretty jacket just to shoot on the camera. Yes, make sure to have a fun horror movie ... Do not forget that this movie has nothing to do with this movie. But I am convinced that the lantern is the same as that of a woman, and she wants to know what her brother or something is and why she is down. In Transylvania or here you need to fight evil wizards or something. I often wonder what Christopher Lee is doing in this world, but here I am reading trivia, where he has never been in a slavery movie before, but you read the document before he plays. Perhaps it would have been possible for you to enter the hell of an "American Werewolf in London". After all this was established in London. Heck, the werewolf does not appear to be more specific to this film, except for a very strange and distant sex scene. In fact, for me, the most memorable death in this movie, when it started to speak louder, was a bleeding of a person's ears.
