Chilly denies the adaptation of the book from the Second World War, which has a disability memory (now an original idea!) With an Army Captain, kept in the memory of the West. As you can see, old Flame remembers Glenda Jackson, but his wife is not Julie Christie, but some emotions are enough to set sparks. This extremely well-scammer Alan Bates brings together director Alan Bridges and co-stars Jack, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but the burners are low. There are a few beautiful scenes (especially when Jackson is on the screen), but the sliding of the bridges is unusually slow and the dulled-out colors of the film are long-lasting. Long on the shelf, this "Soldier" was forgotten best. * From 1/2
