PREVIOUSLY, though by Richard Gere, and despite some good shots that may betray the dignity of some LAMBS days, the film enhances reliance on the breaking point and destroys itself against a field that really does not bring anywhere. br> <br /> The film is about Erroll Babbage (Gere), who works for security and retirees. Instead, instead of Allison Lowry (Claire Danes, STARDUST), she realized that she was cautious about Babbage's case. And this job is not very fun. He oversees hundreds of sex offenders who are legally banned in their jurisdiction. Allison goes to Erroll with many calls to oversee the "herd of criminals" and learns that he needs a retirement. But Erroll is not his method, but his job is good. Sexual predators are insulting and even have physical discrepancies with them. Erroll justifies the deviant's behavior and justifies his actions. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This "good right", which confronts the audience at this level, will allow Errail to see how brutal he is and how much he is still touching the job. When a young girl disappeared on the "field" in Arrill, she immediately jumped to the conclusion that one of the herds had stolen. But how did he know? Erroll is good at work? Allison calls him and Erroll pushes back. <br /> <br /> As Erdogan needs to find this missing girl, their fierce battle is over. Although the story for the story was okay, there was no hope! However, I will give credit to Richard Gere, who plays Erroll very well. The struggle for pension. She is concerned about anyone close to herd. Surprised by those responsible for supervision. He was surprised to do some things. Many variations of the character image for Gere. But there is nothing outside of it. <br /> <br /> Some groups are good (dark and dangerous), but there are many other problems to make you laugh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But this suspension has limitations. The biggest challenge against these restrictions is the destruction of quite scenic crime scenes. A tolerant person, like Erroll, knew he could be a big bum in his body. Or trampling with a crime scene. Or move the evidence. <br /> <br /> Another pernicious part of this movie is that we should never be in the character of Clair Danes, Allison. At the end of the film falls to the side of the road and we will never depend on what will happen to it: Will it remain or will it be released? Will it end if Erroll ends? It's not a terrifying movie, as it touches on some unpleasant moral foundations, but the story is all about to squeeze.
