I've seen my share of Woody Allen movies and they can always be sure it's not always good, usually fun. Perhaps the last really good ones were bullets on Broadway ('94) and Mighty Afrodita ('95), so I was seeing patchy, but waiting. And, nevertheless, I was happy when I was invited to meet Melinda and Melinda, the new Woody Allen movie that I was not aware of. <br /> <br /> What I really needed was the worst Woody Allen movie I've ever seen. The stage is over, the castle is terrible, the scenario is slow and lifeless. Many scenes have not said anything yet, but it's still lying, and I think I'm packing another 15 minutes short film. <br /> <br /> I do not care about the concept behind this movie. a simple situation can be interpreted as a comedy or tragedy, and obviously, the film continues to show us both scenarios. The problem is that these "two films" are not good at all. The comedy is not funny, and the tragedy is not very disastrous. Allen had a good idea, but he ran out of steam or time to complete the film. <br /> <br /> The overall level of the game is very bad - Will Ferrell brings something to the table alone and is basically the impression of Woody Allen. Good actors, like Chloe Sevigny, are just as annoying as Melinda, the worst of band members, is a shame because his character is almost in every scene! Radha Mitchell. Those who are fair to actors are missing if they do not have a scripts available. Definitely a long way from what we know and love classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
