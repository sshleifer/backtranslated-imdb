First and foremost, this is not a movie for people who want to watch something pleasant and enjoyable for the holidays. This film is cold, ruthless and just horrific. Mary Steenburg, who lost her job, lost her home, could not afford Christmas gifts for children, and so on. Because you can get happy things for the holiday. Harry Dean Stanton comes as the Christmas angel Gideon comes out more closely as a pedophile stands around a mixture of hats and long pants. It is better to develop Mary in Steenburg than Christmas, killing the family, and then bringing them back, even though Milad is more believer. Santa Claus is a darker and looks like a paradise for more refugee Nazis over his Christmas workshop lam. The film puts everything so thick that the rest of the film is very sad and unbelievable because it does not end there. I'm convinced that this movie wanted to be something like Capra, but left a feeling of happiness and emotion to be a holiday film.
