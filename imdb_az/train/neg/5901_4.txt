Something about singing was produced at Grand National Studios, under the controversy with the Attractive Cagney brothers Warner. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest casualties of the movie is that Jimmy Cagney has made very few films using terrifying dance skills that has dubbed two films for B studio. . Those who come to our mind are Yankee Doodle Dandy and Footlight Parade. Two little films, "The West Point Story" and "Nothing plays anything smaller". Cagney said he never used to watch the music of his retirement. <br /> <br /> How much did he take from them? <br /> <br /> Well, that was a mistake. There is a hoofer in front of a group that has discovered something to sing and has a movie contract. There is a conniving studio boss and a conniving press agent who are well-behaved properly by Gene Lockhart and William Frawley, have common complications. Cindy and group girl singer Evelyn Daw is hiding because her contract is not a marriage proposal. Then we get the complication of studio romance, which is familiar with the screen's leading lady Mona Barry. <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm not in the Caucasus. <br /> <br /> <strong> Dancing at the beginning and end of the movie as soon as possible, and there is nothing in the middle. Evelyn Daw had a nice singing sound and a ham sandwich charisma. She took music numbers like her. I am sure that the filmmakers pay their tickets to see Cagney dance. <br /> <br /> Along with giving some dance numbers, the female dance partner would be nice. She danced with Virginia Mayo and Doris Day at the Footy Parade at Ruby Keeler and the West Point Story. Ginger Rogers, Eleanor Powell, or Ruby Keeler were not available? <br /> <br /> No memorable song ever came out of them. And the voice of Daw is bent. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, Cagney fled to Warner Brothers. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Janette MacDonald soprano" has a voice. But we gave him delightful music.
