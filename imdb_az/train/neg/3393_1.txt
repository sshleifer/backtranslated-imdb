Actually, you have to watch this movie because your girlfriend is a romantic mood, a boy. <br /> <br /> After watching a good movie like Arisan, she was afraid to see what happened again in Indonesia in 2003. As you can see, the only idea is to make money, but I do not think seriously about working for the image of Indonesia in the entertainment world. In Indonesia, the minds of filmmakers do not look like a "global" world. <br /> <br /> The Indonesian community abandons the things they have to offer them after winning the taste of the western "Made in Indonesia". <br /> OK, she likes to start with the story. And it could have been a nice flick. But did not the director think that no music needed primarily for live music or at least good playback and secondly good choreography? In this movie, playback is very bad, so it wants to be in the movie. Every word you hear is very annoying by the actor after you read it later or when you read and watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Choreography morning gymnastics, but eventually I thought it would be nice to turn it into music ... They just forgot to change the choreography. <br /> <br /> Of course, at least there is a happy ending. But you can agree that having a good dinner is more romantic, DO!
