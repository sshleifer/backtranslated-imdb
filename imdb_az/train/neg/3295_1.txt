... it is better to watch this movie better. They completely destroyed the show premise. Duke boys in the movie beard, Daisy naked, Roscoe is bad, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is a murder ... Just for Cooter and Flash original characters. At least Enos is close. <br /> <br /> At one point, General Lee said he opened his door to enter nuff. <br /> <br /> The original show could not have been a big television, but it was fun and the characters were meaningful. This movie meets a simple life like Dumb & Dumber.
