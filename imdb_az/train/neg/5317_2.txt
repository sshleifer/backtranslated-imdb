The initial 20 minutes or so (I was watching on PS2, so I did not know how long it took) Alienator created an interesting point. I saw a slasher film that had been removed from another planet before it was bad. However, when you realize that a 'stranger' is a great bodybuilder in a steel bikini, the interest is instantly turned into disbelief. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Patently ridiculous in the world of shock or horror can often be a good sign. Nevertheless, his premise is clearly a foolish film that really goes on. The Alienator is funny as hell, but at the same time a high-class shoemaker suit. Serious mistaken attempts, potentially terrifying pure cheese dialogue lines are poured out by the incomparable incompetence of actors and do not even finish one or two decent sets of direction. <br /> <br /> Along with this, as the film ends, you can fully understand the original concept. <br /> <br /> Along with this, 'Alien' just kills people, there is a gigantic whisper of a kind of "blow" like that and a good idea of ​​decay. You laugh at the Alienator, but it's not. If this is your job, go ahead and check it out.
