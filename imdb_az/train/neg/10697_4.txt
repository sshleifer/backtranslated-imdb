First of all, I thought that the story and the scenario were unaware of what the credit was given by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of Hollywood's best writers until he retired until his talent was damaged. But Preston was not Sturges, but Preston Sturges, Jr. The story basically was based on Robert Louis Stevenson's story "The Bottle Imp." A good person will give him any desire, but in the end he will have a bad object that will condemn him to hell. This is a good. The scenarios were not to be original. Actors generally have the authority to translate into the screen. My biggest complaint ends. The hero thinks that he has found a way out of his own dilemma, but tries to solve the problem in a slightly different way to save innocent people. First of all, this is in keeping with the code of the modern film, despite the work, and they have to show the horror of the last puppet until the end of the film. It's a stupid convention. Old horror movies were a good way of allowing the hero to win at the end. Despite the fact that filmmakers are thinking about their current product, there is nothing wrong with a bad win. You can give a healthy fear to the audience, and you can finally make it happy. In fact, I think this is the dominant one.
