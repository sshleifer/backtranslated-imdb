I'm honest, I do not understand why this film is so good and that Baku is the best film. I'm a great fan of Baker's previous works, especially the "Heavy Traffic" and "Magicians," but the open-minded "The Magicians" (1977) was the best film he has ever prepared. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story is brave, animated television quality - and underground, adult sensitivity, "Fire and Ice" is designed for a 14-year-old boy and has Robinson Crusoe's mind in Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you love the books of Gore, you resemble it. In my opinion, this was another wizard to speed up the quality after Bakshi never recovered from "magicians" (although he has prepared some decent television materials in the near future).
