I have seen poor movies in my time, but it really takes biscuits! Why oh why was this film taken? There is only one thing here. Please turn off the firefight, believe me, and destroy the copy of this movie. There is a plot that can take about 5 minutes to show on the camera. This is a major problem, which ensures that the story is padded in just about 80 minutes, based on 'real story' (no matter what ...). And so we expect more than an hour that people are walking around. That's it! In the first half of the day, nobody will have anything, except for walking into someone's shop ... and then three men walking around the tree. This time it was spent on developing character ... but not. And on the screen people do not have anything to do and so when you start to pull out, there is less concern! In fact, I ended the baddie to end the film! The camera case on this is really terrible! This director / editor / writer / producer, Ti West trash can. I hate to hate a boy, but it's really his trousers! This dull rapprochement is always steady, and then longtime friends take people out - I'm sure she's smart, but the results are so short that she wanted to stop the film and cut my wrists! The movie is directed to the next movie boat film! To finish, fun is terrifying ... the film goes as a whole. I have not been completely cleansed from this trail to protect the foolishness!
