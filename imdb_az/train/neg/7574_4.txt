But there are some good moves and some interesting organization. Nevski behaves as a bodybuilder and she is not attractive, in fact, IMO, UGLY. Sascha was played very well by Joanna Pacula, but he needed more lines than the broadcast, his character had to be developed. There are many people in this story, zero romance, a lot of action, and a very damn way of ending. Very severe. I also liked the curtains very much, this film takes you to the whole world and is a bonus. I liked some things about the mafia, not too much or very little, but I did not pay enough attention. The actors should have been more beautiful ... My biggest problem was that Nevski was not quite sexy but very normal. I think for most of the children, Sascha will be hot enough, but Nevski will not cut it off for the women who are interested in us. In general, this movie was good, I did not like it or hated it, but I found it to be just another normal flick.
