Undoubtedly, a handy camera was used to give a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I began to take a moving illness after watching it. Something similar to that of a cerebral palsy was captured by the camera (CP was not a criminal offense for victims but I do not think much of a cinematographer's work!) The camera job was very bulky and my husband was anxious and I was tortured after 10 minutes I thought it was unexpected. After a while I checked it (it was shown on television) and did not see anything better. If you do not need to get rid of any bad sushi that may have been eaten, it's worth a miss!
