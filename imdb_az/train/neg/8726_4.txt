First of all, I want to say that this film is worth more than the four stars I value. I gave four stars, because for me this 86-minute movie is always 2 and half an hour, and does not attract enough to sit from everyone. <br /> <br /> While trying to manipulate the vicinity surrounding the Big Alligator River, one of the tourists in South East Asia. God, who took revenge on Mother Nature, comes as a giant Alligator. But creatures are not the only thing that should be worrying about tourists and major figures (a photographer and resort staff), but the local population is also mistakenly caught. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pretty good story adventure / horror story with a good music score and direction. But the main attraction of the film is the crocodile itself. Some of the sexes that are approaching are good, but all that we need to see is. Some of the underwater remote shots are really an exciting chanting toy that you can buy in a zoo souvenir shop. <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> And as many live movies , it ends with an extremely high body count. There is also a very good jungle scenery. Actor, though, has par, but who is waiting to be better? <br /> <br /> Recently, the American colleague is better than Primeival, but there is nothing to compare with Jaws. But remember, it can not deal with a few points.
