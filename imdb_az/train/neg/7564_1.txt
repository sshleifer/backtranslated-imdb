The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> I am angry about being able to write a good post about this movie. <br /> <br /> Hell was ridiculous, clinging to each other, and generally only naked. Nicolas Cage ... shame on you! I guess it would be at least good if you were in it. <br /> <br /> I felt that most of the film was in the cutting room, and even though the film was just treacherous and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> In the end, the mouth remains white, scandal, and good taste. I have never heard that many people have left a theater with a great hatred on the opening day. People complained about four floors in the small shopping center, near the entrance to the theater. This is bad. <br /> <br /> In comparison, I heard Glitter, the American Kurtadam and Gigli in Paris and Paris. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
