This catastrophe interviewed by Richard C. Sarafyan, coming to Japan from Japan before arriving in Japan, and the video immediately goes to the Turner nets and nothing more than the tape under the 3 buildings. Smithee's name would have been used to discredit the studio film because it did not want the director to be added anymore. But I'm afraid Sarafian does not blame the studio completely. Actors, mostly "101 lovers", graduate one dark line into one another. Area mixed. Special effects are unimpressive. The laughing parts are just boring. The scenario or the book should have been good - why would Palance, Matheson, Boyle, or Heston agree to appear in this area? But something went wrong with the screen. Summary: Avoid. Too bad is not good, even worse.
