This Italian semi-heroic film begins as a gentlemanly porn movie and becomes a mystery that endures a very good gap, and this pretty dull movie is very unwatchable for my taste. The only thing that is worth watching is the breath that has spread throughout the film. At the beginning of the story, there is a man who gets angry with his castle to take his daughters to the dungeon, killing one person and killing him. They showed nudity, but the film did not really show off their murders at this point. Then the man finds a beautiful red head for the party and continues to marry her and marry her. His ex-wife, Evelyn, likewise has something for the red heads, as well as one of his followers died under the circumstances of the audience. After many speeches, killing begins in snakes, foxes, and similar places. At this point, it is enough to figure out who is responsible for the killings and how it will end up in a meaningless way. This film did not work for me, gave me a lot of questions, and the last three parts of the film were not in the first two thirds of the film. Evelyn's death would help the movie, as Evelyn ended up in a grave. The author does not completely mislead the title by leaving his tomb free. With a touch of tactile and very little blood, it is very lightweight for most of the time, just like in the end. I just thought that most of this movie was boring.
