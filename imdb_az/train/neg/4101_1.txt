this can be one of the worst films I've ever seen. How can I describe it as a fright film, even a tension? more like lumbering drama. scary music BECAUSE, but because it's not a scary situation, it would be good to use the director for routine activities, such as pulling it down or dropping stairs. The movie had a lot of potential. There were beautiful cinematography (sp?) And interesting characters, but the writers supposed that you already knew. they will be exposed to unexpected behavior or even have a clue as to what they are supposed to do. this is just one of the movies that tells something about something and is quite different.
