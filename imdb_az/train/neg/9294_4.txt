I'm afraid to look at the film as a strange figure in the incredible visions of "Hero", but it's better. I also love an actress: Ziyi Zhang. Yes, at both points I was disappointed. I did not see DVDs of this movie, and that was wrong. <br /> <br /> I understand that the films of this flying-maritime martial art are a pure fantasy, but this story has drifted away from something far beyond me, and it just shook me in disbelief. . A blind woman defeated hundreds of opponents? Sorry, it goes a little farther. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the character of the great man named "Jin" (Takeshi Kaneshiro) also destroyed the film that was very annoying with his dialogue, foolish appearance and foolish smile. <br /> <br /> Beautiful colors and this beautiful story did not appeal to me to make a movie that is just worthy of its incredible scenes. This movie has no "hero"!
