Indeed, he really wanted Julian Po. I think Slater is less than an actor, and most of the players who support here are better off giving them a chance to show in this movie. I understand that it is based on a short story I have not read. So, I do not know if I've seen things that I've seen with regard to the movie's mistakes or whether it's been filmed by the director / screenwriter. The stage is beautiful and I love the sounding, the magnificent tone of the opening stories. But then ... There is nothing! Most of the local characters were trying to explain Julian pointblank's intention to commit suicide. He does not answer that he can argue because they do not. But Julian is only a man who is stinging public intentions under imprudence. Thereafter, neither Julian nor the director / writer, Julia's character, kept a tape record for God's salvation, but had to give something out of little start with Julia's life. He says he was an accountant. He says that because of his father's family, a child has moved to a family. So what? There are several interconnected contacts with the local people to clarify Julian's purpose. But none of them go anywhere because Julian thinks that all these dopey locals are aliens from another planet, as if they were the last (and only) intelligent among them. Although Julian Poun has something to do with certain characteristics or wisdom, this can work as an allegory. The best thing he can do to reveal something about himself is the scene where the mechanic nodded his devout wife to the target. And what this scene puts is not something that inspires empathy for Julian. I see only Julia's character as self-contained, small, and absolutely rude. This is a half-baked, adapted film director's attitude. One of the promising actors, Michael Parks, does nothing to work here.
