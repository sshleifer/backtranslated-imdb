From the start of the film, the director feels his / her attempts to describe something. What I want to say is that, contrary to the story that compiled the film, she hesitated. he wanted to make an action type and he wrote a story. And in a very bad manner failed. I think you're trying to shoot a very stylish film. In my opinion, this film is a total waste of time and effort. In the director's credit, he knows the press that he works, and I've seen worse movies than what I want to say. Here, at least, the filmmaker maintains its sustainability in the film. And the actors also performed well.
