Thanks to Neil Simon, a dull, dimensional scenario and unshakable direction from Robert Moore, the Second Chapter becomes a conscious showcase for Marsha Mason. He does not have a kid in Cinnderella Liberty (here at Cinnderella Liberty 73), The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only My Rose (81), just dragged around this time. Chapter Two is the third and last feature film by Neil Simon, "Cheap Detective" (78) and "Death with the Death" (76). Caan has been destroyed, the characters are mono-sized, the dialogue is quite analytic and there is virtually no detail. The first half meets a sweet, coy romance between the slightly more attractive, polished Caan and chipper Mason, and the second half lasts for the first half. NYC places, as well as Joe Bologna and a gentle, delicate Valerie Harper have nothing to do, but at least give you some embarrassment. And last and at least, there is a terrifying song played during the credits.
