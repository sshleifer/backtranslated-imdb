<br /> <br /> I've been filming this movie halfway down, but it's okay.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they're.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially the teacher, who is now a teacher, has proved that at least she can act if she wants! (in the sense that a person is in a heart attack, as well as actor, scripting, and the generality of a bad film). This is pretty clearly a cash saver in Human Traffic, but this was the best actor in the movie, at least the original and topical, and still trying to reach the level of hopeless GCSE students. Traffic as a car is a lot like Human Traffic!
