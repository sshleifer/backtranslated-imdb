I have been waiting for this excitement after hearing a lot about the cracker series of the 1990s. Undoubtedly, the combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane did not go wrong. How wrong have I been! <br /> <br /> Often, polemics supported by recurring and fierce flashbacks have won. The production tried to be super-modern, but blinking boxes and even children's writings were irritated. Robbie Coltrane went for two hours to sleep, with unexplained and inaccessible "insights" and the police were portrayed as one-dimensional bumbling idiots. <br /> No, I do not want to see more of them, but I will be back in the 1990s DVDs.
