Why I think that many Godzilla fans are actually one of the best Godzilla films ever. This movie is terrible and I'm one of the few Gojira films that I do not want to watch again (another G. vs Megalon). <br /> <br /> This plot tried to turn into a number of old-fashioned Godzilla franchisees in the Heisei series, becoming a bonafid action movie, returning from more ideas than in 1974 to 1991. Particularly, with some issues, for example, singing with the Japanese soldiers to shoot the WW2 scene, praising the godzillasaurus for the fun and seriousness, the former commander turns the capitalist and death as if the serious viewers in the movie are playing to laugh each other, If it is not something, I've seen one of the most luxurious movies I've ever seen, but I think that the lack of filmmakers was just so talented, and it was a situation where a plain motion film was bad. Special effects, from jet packs to Android, hockey sound effects, nothing to severely punish, frightened to compare, and the movie is still waiting for you <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> All nearly Godzilla films have such a meaningless romance, and this is an exception but it is possible to say something about it, because it is particularly senseless and uncertain. There is no reason for the romance, it just happens and lives there, it puts commitments of 360 degrees. However, the other terrifying aspect of this film is a dialogue, both Japanese and English, a terrifying, astonishing, and, perhaps, inspiration for Battlefield Earth. Tristar DVD combines everything, blurred, dim, and just the ugly, the same voice. <br /> <br /> I saw the Japanese version 2 for the first time, and the differences are night and day, the original vibrant colors and tissue, noteworthy, especially the fighting scenes are really beautiful. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, except for the Heisei series, Godzilla 1984 (Japanese version), there is little to be described here, and Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah is in a state of failure. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 2
