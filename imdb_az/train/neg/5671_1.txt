If you like to see the animals alive, their heads collapse, the dogs are rotting and poured on men, then this is for you! But if you are in a normal position and do not see the real traces of animal persecution, go so far. This film shocked the audience and made sure. From the very beginning, the killing of the animals and the babies in the film (at least fake) was enough to close it. it should not be allowed to appear before the screenings of slaughterhouses (BTK film) and such footage in a horror movie. We watch the horror of Gore because we only know his makeup and special effects, so watching a movie you do not have to sit and watching the real killings of animals is that we have not hired a movie for that. If anything, this should be a great warning tag that throws trash films and people do not get it. Like a very scary fanatic, this turned my back. All film shooting and crew chiefs should be checked.
