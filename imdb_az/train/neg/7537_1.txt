In my opinion, because it was different from Nicolas Cage, one of the greatest actors of the time, I thought the beach was bad. Do not blame him for the scandalous scripture and give it back to you, if he can not give anyone any idea that hell is the purpose of this movie. It is a cross between a village and a scrambled script. It starts after he grabs his eyes and, as he draws closer to this area, does not make sense in this sense and has not come to an end! What was he? The only thing that draws this movie is Nicolas Cage's great humor and funny ability in strange situations. Just go to a blockbuster and watch the movie, save yourself five dollars, and just go home and put something in the fire and say some of the stupid things that just come to mind when you ask why, and go there!
