I'm not a great admirer of the Stooges slap, but I see that their history is interesting. I recently tried to check the products of each Stooge era, but Joe shorts can not be easily seen; <br /> <br /> Some say that quality problems with Joe's shorts are not really Joe's fault and I suspect it. Joe is far from the worst thing as an artist. The most disturbing thing was mentioned in another statement: the nakedness of the third child breaks the entire comedy team / Stooges etos. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Joe's style was perceived as inaccurate by those responsible, although there were no non-camera conflicts between them and others, and that was their work around them. <br /> <br /> And what are the names of these and some Stooges shorts? Absence of absolute creativity; was this kind of thing or the formation of the shorts market?
