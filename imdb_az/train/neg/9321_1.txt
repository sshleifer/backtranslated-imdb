I hired this movie about 4-5 years ago and was immediately disappointed. <br /> <br /> I did not want to see the b-movie slasher flick, but my eyes ended up fecal. The player was similar to watching dry land. I worked a mild film better ... <br /> <br /> The idea that a crazy killer did not leave anywhere was amazed at me. <br /> <br /> The cost of this movie was the best laugh. There was no fear. The high school student appeared to be a new video camera for Christmas. If the area was, the area was all over the place. If you're bored looking for a horrible horror movie for rent, go on it. There are better b-films there.
