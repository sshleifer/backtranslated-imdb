You can see Boyd's scripts, Chillers, and everything else you need to see, the last bumping of a mile, and every story is really naked. The first is totally unobtrusive and does not look like an endless, and the best thing about these anthologies is the short stories that have rolled with a clean twist. The second story can be predicted and ends without any payment. Thus, every story continues and continues within the Chillers that is not profound enough that there is no prize for it. Character and dialogue are badly written, stories do not have their own original ideas, and the film is completely silent. At least every story does not last long and I like the idea behind the connecting segments. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Boyd, If you want to watch a 15 minute short story set in a beach, Chillers is for you. Stories are neither smart nor scary, nor are they built up to any tension or anything. Here are some beautiful scenes and some striking adolescents can sometimes. <br /> <br /> There is violence and cautiousness in the shack that many things that do not happen in Chile do not occur, it is a heartbeat, a curly head, and bloody as a little crumpled hands. <br /> <br /> Technical Chillers admire everyone. Basic cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects and lower average production values. Chillers also owns one of the worst final theme songs. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> <strong> But still I like it .
