The commitment of Peter Falcae does not show me that this dignified image (1) is worthy. (On this issue, Falca's loyalty has been watching all the movies until the beginning of the film.) Even if you are giving all the explanation mistakes, this is the poorest excuse for television "Columbo". I'm glad to watch the TV for free; It would hate to pay a penny for an article.
