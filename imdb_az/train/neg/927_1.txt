Almost all of Charles Broad's head could be a pretext for Demonicus. That is, there was no green light for the start. The story is repeated, the characters are the best, and there is no other real story in Tyranus, and then a bad friend. Then they cut off the way the writer or director ends up in a bad way. Demonicus climbs up a bad end. The last surviving survivor is a deadly cave, after which Chimera comes to a picture, can add a cheap and follow him. Then he goes home to FUNHOUSE. A sculpture that had been destroyed centuries ago seems to be reappearing only for no reason to fall apart. I want to say that in this sense, it does not make any sense. Charles was an attempt to create a pile of hopelessness for the movie with the fourth film companies. They asked me, and I had better ideas than demonic. THANKS TURKEY.
