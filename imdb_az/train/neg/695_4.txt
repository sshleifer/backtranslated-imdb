I've heard a lot about this movie that was a great slasher and in one of the more than 80 films, just watch the fans of the most-shot films die. Yes, I've rented it and want to say that although this is a movie that I could not care for, like April Fools' Day, Friday 13th, and Prom Night, this movie could be right, along with the above, with real enthusiasm and symbols which is due to the lack of potential. The characters I found were unsuccessful in this movie, a strange, haired, haired, haunted man in the country, and, of course, when he looked at the murderer, he was lying to the true climate. Another jean jacket would be a dirty smoker man who could have played more role in this movie, which said that he was more interested in the movie, instead of playing with this guy, he lost another party to make uncomfortable calls while sleeping with his girlfriend and after cutting it cut it off, and finally disappointed in its part. If the murderer's real identity is going on, I greet him when he's putting his identity, but all this seemed explicit, and he really betrayed himself after himself. true intentions have emerged. This film should watch once for all slasher fans at least once, but you should not spend your rarely earned money to find the inventor's inventory.
