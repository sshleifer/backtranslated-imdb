I'll never forget the night I saw this movie. There was an underwater boat on a patrol in the North Atlantic and this was a planned film this evening. After the second wheel, ALL refused us. They did not try to show it day and night. Instead of choosing rerun ...... this is really a stupid rule that I really want to say, but my comment must be within line 10. I do not need to write down my comment on random words, but I will continue to ride it until I get 10 lines of BS. I could not find George Goble in the list of credits, but I remember the movie. The Sinedrion is terrifying and the songs have worsened.
