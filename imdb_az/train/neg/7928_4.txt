In fact, the film is horrific, and Sci-Fi. With a very strong Christian theme, this movie provides minimal content and no downturn. There are half-decent jobs to read the role of second-class players. It's just a good performance, Sidney Penny, who plays the role of a mother ... I can not spoil the movie, either Christ, or the Anti-Christ. <br /> <br /> Avoid watching this movie as long as a Christian religious fan does not face the apocalypse. <br /> <br /> Because I was a non-Christian I wanted to write this review, I was forced to watch this movie. It's a pity that the Sci-Fi channel's last night's release of this movie is in the air.
