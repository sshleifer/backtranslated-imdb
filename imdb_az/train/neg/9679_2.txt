This film was terrible in the worst way: it just did not care. You did not think what happened on the field; you did not care about the characters. Everyone had no heart. I'll go within 45 minutes, because I simply did not want to draw more attention to my thinking. The film has a lot of sex. Sex can be okay; even the movie (thus Karma Sutra), but the animation here is not beautiful or sexual. It was just ugly. Do not watch this movie.
