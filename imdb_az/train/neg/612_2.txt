As far as B-films go away, SOCKET is one of the worst, which is extremely boring to sit. A pupil who has just been chosen by regular classmates and rejected by the girls, ends up with a garbage mother who is sexually abused by a drunken accident. Then he takes his children to nearby corn and kills him. Apparently, the spirit of the children was scared, and then killed the brothers and sisters who suffered it. It is strange that, apart from being a speed liner for each of its victims, you can also rush out of Matrix-like air and kill people on the sidewalks during the day. Also, why did it always look like rotten body? As a result of two unnecessary results, it is not worth the laugh.
