The movie was on the Nicolson screen. However, when the movie was connected to Meryl Streep for moving scenes without Jack, I had to fight with boredom; it was as soft as it could be. Relationships between heroes were specific; these characters have been described before and better. I felt like a real-life-based real-life scenario that's definitely a bad thing: 90% of everyday life is not worth digging and writing or watching. Why Ephron's life and his relationship to Carl Bernstein are interesting enough to escape from me. Perhaps he wrote it as a therapy - many authors are cathartic by posting episodes of their lives on paper. Fine: But when I feel this story in Hollywood, it's a mystery to me that's worth the movie.
