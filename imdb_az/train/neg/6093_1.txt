This should be the worst movie I've ever seen. I bought a DVD and did not work, the DVD worked fine, in fact, the film was actually very bad, since the actor (or before the actor's judgment). There was no talk and no real horror. <br /> <br /> Some foreign scenes are also dusty on the microphone for their low-budget movie, which is hard to hear because of the wind. <br /> <br /> All this was a movie that a viewer could think of as a poke that they did not know better (there was a healing). There are only two lines in the film, which are around the transvestite prostitute. <br /> <br /> As for the sale of DVDs, I feel totally deceived. <br/> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p> She has chosen her victims. He chose his nose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> This movie will remain in the first 5 minutes (if you think of it), it's just a disgusting movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, if anyone knows anything about one of the actors (eg, Patrick J. Mathews) and I would like to know what they have done since then. Is there a worse movie here than this or that someone in the movie is concerned about learning to act in no time?
