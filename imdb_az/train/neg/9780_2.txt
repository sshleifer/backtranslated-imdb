Good lord, everyone who makes this turkey must be buried alive. Sorry, but other reviewers should not see this movie, watch or watch a movie ... 9 of the ten stars? She said it was good or wind like Ben Hur? Insufficient comic, massive incredible characters, absurd situations, a Griffith Park (MASH in Griffith Park), crappy script, and everything that could be wrong with a movie included a package. As an example of how a movie might be wrong, all prospective filmmakers need to be reviewed. This is something that a USC student can do for a movie class. <br /> <br /> Give this medicine no medication and do not enter the high camp.
