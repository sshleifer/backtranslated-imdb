REVOLUTION OF ZOMBIES (2 outta 5 stars) No, this is a long-lost father of classic George A. Romero zombie flicks. This is a low-budget popboiler since 1936, probably for the audience of the time ... but it seems very complicated these days. At the head of a soldier approaching the zombie soldiers who opened fire on the soldier's pistol, there is actually a really good scene ... and the approaching bullets of one's naked body. The impact seems futile in these days, but I am convinced that the audience was mixed up in 1936. Story intelligence controls hidden search ... to create a seemingly unstoppable zombie army ... but then as a tool to be a feature to win the woman he loves. The film lasted about an hour, but it moves at a snail's speed, so believe its length, believe it! It's really not too much to recommend ... some "wading" star fake studio shots can get some entertainments. The latter is interesting ... so the film is worth seeing at least once. More likely, you will see some cheap "1 movie 4 movies" complementary feature in Wal-Mart for $ 5. Hey, that's worth the money.
