This film has never seen the light of day. The release of time was terrible. Gong Show has already "sharked the shark" with the emergence of the film, so who will pay for a few cranes of the show's original escape? And the show clips are just as trivial as it is the home of the show hosted by this exciting, 90-minute Chuck Barris. Wait for that he really wants to apologize for his and his messed-up millionaire life? Do we really want to know about his life? (Clearly, since he has written a strange biography about his career as CIA Operator). He thought he would stay 90 minutes audition for him everywhere, everywhere to have everyone? Or the network executives are perpetually perishing? This could have been a plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not as a full-length movie. But it was nice to see Rip Taylor, Gene Geni and Namiksiz Comic (though it was nice to see only his most vulgar routines to make the movie "spicy"). As others have noted, Phil Hartman's first major movie (although it lasted for a minute). His name is written on loans, which he was born with HARTMANN. Even more slim and smaller than SNL days, do not miss the voice and facial expressions. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small part; the first one after leaving the soap.
