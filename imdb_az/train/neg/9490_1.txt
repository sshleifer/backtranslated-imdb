This is a complete and absolutely garbage, a wonderful example of BAD movie, which can not be a charm for anyone, even b-movie fans. No, I repeat, do not spend the precious time of your life in this trash can. Poor work, bad routing, terrific (but really terrible) scenario and lack of ideas about entertainment (any form). I bought a DVD for $ 3, and I understand that someone should pay for it. The burning movie is not enough for what this movie has given me. I love B-movies, killer toys, weird lagoon monsters, but this is not near anywhere. Do you know that the movies are so funny? Not even. Just plain old miserable.
