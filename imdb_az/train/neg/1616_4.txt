STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday night ** Sunday night * Monday morning The second installment of Che movies is a story that goes back to night Now, the mixed fighters of the South American hills 60s where the tension between the group survived and survived without sufficient food and water. <br /> <br /> Everything happens once the Soderbergh passes the boundary to Bolivia, without any confusion between the time and place of the latter's film, and government forces increase their actions. <br /> <br /> Because of the action in the hills, she can even be a widow's experience. And more ambitious, the second cheat of the score drowned, giving the desired weather an artieness of any proven evidence, as more slimming. There is an air of boredom that never comes out of the movie. It is a shame that Soderberg's longing or Del Toro's guilty role can lead to such a disappointment somewhere in the production. **
