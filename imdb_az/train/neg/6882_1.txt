I hated the description of Mary Perez Puerto Ricans! We're not all ghettos - we speak Portuguese-speaking Puerto-Rican! I can not speak for uneducated people you are running. But our language is stable, our name is our pride. Puerto Rico is much more economically better than any other Caribbean island! Am I happy to be free from American influences such as Cuba, Dominican Republic, or Haiti? It is not the US poverty standard, but its true poverty. We are not sacrifices, we are humble, honest and clever people. Our ancestors include powerful African roots, but not "black" roots - there is nothing to do with black Americans.) <br /> <br /> There could be a similarity between Pedro Albizu, Che Guevarra and Martin Ling. MLK was a great hero, a true revolutionary - an honest man, that we all saw one day to be released. <br /> <br /> Che Guevarra Castro Today, creating Cuban, full of Cuban ships is to endanger their lives to come to America - because Che has created a better place for them? You had a great, awesome, brilliant idea, but you politicized it. We have so many things to be proud of as a people - do not embarrass our people by sacrificing us. I'm not a Nugger, so it's not possible to share your thoughts. I'm from Porto Rican, I speak Spanish, I'm not a victim, and I've achieved a lot of goals in America. If there is a future part - less politics - more and more history is more amazing - there are many. <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
