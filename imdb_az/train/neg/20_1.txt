This movie was terrible. From the very beginning I just read the plot summary and looked OK, I followed it. Imagine that. As the actor said, the camera was shy. Everything was fake. <br /> <br /> Several years ago, I was the best. I've been watching at least 20 times in recent years. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong > <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;">, so better, others, REAL, movies can be appreciated.
