I'm not worthy to criticize this movie for a few minutes, but I know many people like myself, and I refer to IMDb.com to help solve movies. <br /> <br /> "Live feed" resembles an Asian version of the 1976 "The Incredible Torture Show" (aka "Blood Sucking Freaks"). Http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0077247/. Torture, disintegration, homicide, murder ... Rather, here's a third class writing, a pitiful actor and a wrong comedy attempt. <br /> <br /> The film is Chinese, yet everyone speaks English. In a film horrified by dogs feeding on a market, there is a girl, but we're sexually excited to enter a porn halls. The pillow inside the towel surrounds a friend of his friends (even though there is only one charm of this movie). The film is absolutely horrible, even for the B-movie. Even if you download it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
