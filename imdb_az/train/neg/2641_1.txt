Almost every detail in this movie is not clear and meaningless. It does not have a true human wisdom, a dead and unbearable appearance. It is Hollywood's parody, which reminds Denzel Washington's film, captures and focuses on a charming camera, racist stereotypes, absolutely unnecessary and funny pictures, and acts of popular people in the clothing catalog. It is prepared to serve the abundance of zombies that follow the famous names in life. The only good thing in the film is the subsequent credits and the accompanying funky song. I feel like I'm getting rid of it to watch it.
