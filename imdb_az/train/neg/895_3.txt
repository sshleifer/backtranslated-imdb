but Cinderella receives my voice, not just for the worst films of Disney's princess movies, but for the worst movie made by Walt's lifetime. The music is really beautiful and the story deserves to be called "classic". <br /> <br /> Failures in this film are heroes, especially the title, but could only be the "hero" in the most sensitive sense of the time. <br /> <br /> After a short prologue, the audience is Cinderella. Awakening in the morning and "Looking - is the desire of your heart". It builds it as an idealist (and thus deserves our blessing). Unfortunately, the script does not give us any clues as to whether we are willing to. Freedom From His Servants? His respect for the family? Will anyone talk to mice and birds? In a song (cut off from the movie, but most recently featured in the DVD's special features section) Cinderella desires many to be able to do their job more effectively. Go to your girlfriend! In short, Cinderella is a very soft character. She passively passes her abusive family and runs to her unwanted desires for comfort. She reaffirms her self-justification and is still a member of her family. For this reason, he is allowed to go to the ball if he finds a job to finish his housework and wear it, of course, it is obviously absurd to anyone except for Cinderella. Anyone see Belle or Jasmine becoming so strict? Cinderella is weak, her male teacher is not lifeless. The Prince of Cinderella does not have any dialogue and almost no screen. If Cinderella or something respects a good man, we are not given any instructions. Everything we know is (1) he is a prince and (2) a good dance. Heck, even the "Snow White" has to read the least romantic song from the princess. <br /> <br /> Lack of this development is less interesting than romanticism; Cinderella seems to be a social climb or stupidity, weakening its already weaknesses. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the animators chose to give the movie's funny relief, Cinderella's friends, and mice overtime. These characters are entertaining. Also, when showing a show of funny realities, let's just say that your story has some problems. <br /> <br /> Dinsey describes all his animated features as "masterpieces". Although there are many, there are some people who do not deserve this appeal. Cinderella is the best example of this truth.
