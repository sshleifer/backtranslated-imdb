It's difficult for me to make an impartial decision on a movie that has been affecting me at such a young age. Undoubtedly, the worst kind of exploitation is the film. For the first time in my youth, I have failed to see this movie, and I will never forget it. I think it's the most terrible film ever. <br /> <br /> Military operations against the people living in the Caucasus continue. </ P> <p> It was terribly aggressive in this movie. I love the low-square movie but it's just bad. Instead of renting some Russian Myer.
