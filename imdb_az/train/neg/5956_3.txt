Is another horror shouting that a strange teenager fights with a supernatural sidekick who wants to seize a madman? Yes, the fact that this one is from Canada is a bit different. There is a challenging teenager Jim Majelewski, who has become a treatment that emerged as a "cult" leader of the "brain" leader, a major ugly "brain". Can Jim stop him? I think our northern neighbor has the right to make at least a funny horror movie after all the work they do. <br /> <br /> There was something wrong with a bad guy's brain. Why did not people film this movie?
