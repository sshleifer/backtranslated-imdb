I have been watching horror films starting with Childhood Play since the age of 5. Since then, I've seen good movies and movies, but this is not the case, the DUMBEST movie I've seen! The actors did their best with the material. The area was just strange. Moreover, all this was only. I can bleed a lot of blood, but it was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes, a woman was stabbed in the back and drowned in her bowels! Correct Stupid! Another problem with this film was its dull and probably the slowest movie. Its end is simple. But it still goes with the rest of it! In the end, the girl gets help from an old lady when she leaves her / her father. The old lady draws tea, but when she turns around to talk to her, the girl is attacking her! He turned into a lumber! Retarded movie.
