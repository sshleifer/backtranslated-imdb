Why? !! It was an insipid, thirsty and embarrassing film. Embarrassment comes from their city ... Pittsburgh PA! Why did these people release BAAAAAD? <br /> <br /> When this movie was released for the first time ... it was a romantic comedy ... and ROBO had nothing. All this has been changed, taking into account Disney's dissatisfaction. WHY? This classic comic character had a terrific definition. She did not even enjoy seeing Matthew Broderick enjoying their own movies. Sheesh !!
