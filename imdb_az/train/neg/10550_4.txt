I was awaiting this excitement and anticipation as I was a great admirer of ten minutes T.V episodes from Stella Street. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was almost disappointed by all the gags and a liners were removed from the TV episodes directly and were delivered with less enthusiasm and funny time. the actors once said and did not worry about repeating them. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Along with Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones, "some of the most famous people on the screen and screen for the last 40 years" live. All the elements on the street were built by a local scammer, and were forced to live as tramp and general working classes. There are some nice moments, but the writers get an interesting idea and make it very boring. * THE END OF PEOPLE * All the characters in T.V Episodes are played by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including women), but Ronni Ancona is added to the film. I think that's a mistake. <br /> <br /> If you are not an admirer of Stella Street episodes, you will find it. this movie is fun. But if you were a fan, I think you can move away from a little foolish feeling. 4/10
