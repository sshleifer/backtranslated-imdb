Older television shows are now seen as Hollywood's norms, but it's a clear middle-finger for disrespectfulness, toilet humor, do-you-kiss-your-mother-with-the-mouth bad language, rip-off. All the fans of Hazzard in the north and south of the Mason-Dixon Line. Jesse's uncle Jolie's uncle's son of Georgia (Ames Jesse, a moral compass despite the previous months's routes) said that the movie was a sequel to a month's run for Joe and Luke Duke's uncle Jesse (no brilliance on the show, is an outrageous insult to which he is exposed to disappointment. When I saw that they fled the theater in the first 15 minutes, I realized that many of their parents were deceived. The original Duke of Hazard was a family show with basic moral values. The original Dukes of Hazzard was a child safe, Hemi powered, showcasing entertainment that parents did not bother to teach children the seventh word of George Carlin. I read the show and the film that showed that the film was nothing but a racist. These deeds can be true about the movie. These deeds are completely wrong about the show. Show, if anything, about how to set out and accompany everyone. Hollywood finally came to our senses, Yankee, Rebel, or any other man who still believed in honor, loyalty, trust, family, and even his own disdain for those who believed in the right thing, even though they were not popular. Hollywood finally believes that people in our hearts will get any waste, wanting to sell foolish, uneducated, beer shift, bad luck, garbage. Make sure the Hollywood Elitist is wrong. Do not watch this movie. Boycott sponsors. Fill out the Warner Bros. email and snail mailboxes with complaints, so we do not appreciate them destroying the greatest TV shows of all time. We want you to save money and get the DVD's original show, but what have you done? Do not watch this movie
