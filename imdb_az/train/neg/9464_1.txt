Good previews looked funny and I know well ...... because I usually do not go to the opening movies, usually with my kids. A movie that does not appeal to children or adults here is a lot of jokes for kids and is completely flat for amusing entertainments. I was really ashamed of being 9 years old and 6 years old, and I had to explain my 6 year old S H * T. What actually happened here is a classic twist of Dr Seuss. Adds a bad and lazy neighbor who wants to have children get married with money. If it were a subplot, it would be good, but it ended up being a major area around the film, and the "cat" plays the sub-role of the neighbor who actually exposes his neighbor to the mother. Get my advice and read a book and go to the movie.
