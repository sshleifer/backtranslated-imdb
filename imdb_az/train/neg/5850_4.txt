Nell Shipman came together to take a break in the form of 'return to God's country' for the previous year and failed in a failed way. This time it seems better, but better. There is no space outside the discovery of 'something new'. There is a brief moment to set up the hero (co-writer and companion Shipman) to get rid of her daughter (played by Shipman), then there is no exciting, incredible pursuit there. Of course, Maxwell is played as an hour-long advertising for the Sedan, but the whole movie is ridiculous in line with it. DW does not seem to have learned much from last-minute firefighters. Griffith or his parody are imitating Mack Sennett and other comedians. <br /> <br /> What interests you is something that Shipman wrote and directed to the film as a filmmaker of the movie. a writer (Ship again), though he is working hard, he is clever or cunning. Nevertheless, others have initiated the joke of intertitles, such as "Wild and Woolly" or "A Girl's Folly" (both 1917), as Frances Marion and Anita Loos. At least, Shipman impresses that he or she will not take seriously either the film or something I say "hackneyed" despite his claim.
