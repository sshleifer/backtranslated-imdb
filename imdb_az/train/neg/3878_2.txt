In the 1950s, QUANTMASS EXPERIMENT was the only fantasy fantasy film to use this idea in the 1950s, when the area "Return to the Earth as a mutant worm" did not lead to mutated monsters in people traveling from the Earth's orbit. Thus, the idea of ​​returning the unnecessary plot seems deprived of the start. <br /> <br /> He will not see the man in front of his wife's eyes. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's an incredibly bad movie. The budget is in single digits, and I'm not a dollar lira. There is no cinematography to talk and there are countless editing errors. For example, a photographer takes his (legal) law to photograph. <br /> <br /> The sun was shot straight behind the model, then cut off the photographer who was behind the sun, then fled to the sun ... <br /> <br /> The budgetary film speeds up in other directions. According to the Trivia website, the budget manufacturers were so low that Saturn could not get any scene imagery, so when the astronaut Steve West appears on the beautiful sunrise appearing in the beautiful Saturn. In fact, the sun gives the most effective performance in the film because human actors are not hired by a porn studio. When I saw this, I was not scared by the eponymous monster - I was afraid of swinging from the rest of the rump. Perhaps, the lack of budgetary budget shows itself as actors who are forced to wear their own clothes. For example, a general does not complete his beautiful dresses with medals - he is wearing a denim dress and baseball dress. <br /> <br /> You have to stop the kufr to work on a movie like this, but it fails at every level. The sound of a film that killed a nephew of a melody and fled the hospital was put early. Instead of calling a police officer saying that the murder was a crime. Nelson decides to follow the same thing as a patient looking for a missing cat. This is a monster that kills a weird fatal crime can go without notice, but keep in mind that this is a typical movie of a 70-year-old dark man, which is based on dark roads, and forgetting that his spouse is pregnant <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> INTERVIEWS 'COURT TIME TIME. Of course, we can understand why people use this movie because "it's good that it's good", but sometimes it has an impressive effect on Rick Baker, but it's a very sinful taste.
