At first I saw the teaser trailer for Wendy Wu, and I was really thrilled. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls at Disney Channel, would make a martial art and I also saw the movie in this movie. The action was poorly structured, the film could not be fired, the war was not real and it was ... with the assassination. If you really think about it, this woman, another female warrior Buffy Vampire Slayer, wants a girl not to see her calling and become a queen of homecoming, a watchman who prepares his mistake for a great preparation to fight some ancient evil. The idea is just about the original, but the movie is time consuming.
