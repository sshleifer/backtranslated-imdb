*** HOW TO USE WORK USES *** The story sounds good and when you read a novel, we are looking forward to a deep and intense movie that can offer some ideas for some interesting and insufficiently unrelated human relationships. True, the scenario tries to do this, the director tries to do it, but the main thing is to hurry. The player of Maria is not such a dry, there is no sense, his most intense moments are almost comic. Sometimes it looks frustrating for the camera. <br /> <br /> Ioana looks even worse and worse than Maria, and she does not look naturally either. Although Maria was blamed for being artificially understood, she had an attitude, but she was, and her character had some credibility. We have no idea how to get worse and worse - how did she come from, how she got involved with lesbian relationships, how did her relationship develop? We only take some bits from their parents and their relationships seem to be just 'out there': they have content and end, but there's no start. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tudor is the only person in this movie, ) are trying to prove some of their actual talents. He has a character and is in harmony with it. <br /> <br /> I love this story, it's good that Tudor Cirilah is there. , the host really works and provides several lines with Puya style, but does not keep this movie. Too bad, the whole setting had great potential, and Romanian cinematography could use a film on this subject. <br /> <br /> Stubborn relationships with brotherhood, brotherhood and brotherhood, Mariya and Ioan's taste (Maria's intervention is a great attempt in this direction). I'm so sorry to spend for the ticket, and I was more comfortable watching my room.
