I remember watching the BSG pilot. I can accurately describe that night. I remember the seats I was sitting on. This show was magic. It was alive. I liked the first two years of the BSG. I enjoyed the third year's episodes and watched each episode of the fourth year, generally hoping it would just turn around. <br /> <br /> I watched the Caprica pilot and was excited. Here's a good thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a reminder of his political failure, his latest failure, called Virtuality. <br /> <br /> In DS9, most of her line was good. When it was organized in an organized way to the BSG, it was good. This was especially true early in the beginning, when imitating the episodes of the first BSG series. After meeting Admiral Cain and Pegasus, when they left, they all went on a picnic. <br /> <br /> Maybe he'll go. Perhaps only a few weak initial episodes. But I'm very nervous.
