Perhaps, this is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen, and I'm not too far away. I was on the list of my favorite fighting movies: "The Longest Day," "Hell and Back," "Bridge on Kwai River" (all black and white) is a great toy. I've had a better dialogue and I play an actor in a school with a student. The area is not a bad place - just badly applied. This is not like a traffic accident, though it can not seem to turn it off! There is no need for big money or huge sets of movies, that is, "Twelve Angered Men" and "Lifeboat" is a budget excuse to be good. What did they think?
