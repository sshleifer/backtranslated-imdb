<br /> <br /> I once saw this movie at night on a public television station, so I do not know if there is a video. <br /> <br /> This "Shirley Temple" called "Baby Burlesks" (sic) was in the early 1930s. <br /> <br /> Sirley Temple is likely to believe that her daughter, who has an average chance, will allow her daughter to make this street movie, which can be considered a part of this baby. <br /> Everyone over the age of 5 is in the upper teeth and has a lounge for milk instead of alcohol. <br /> <br /> Shirley throws the femme fatale out to the bar and speaks to soldiers who are sensitive to it (!). <br /> <br /> Along with this, a little black guy dances at a nearby table (!). </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; br /> <br /> A strange movie ... babies who use the rally playing an adult role in a hall.
