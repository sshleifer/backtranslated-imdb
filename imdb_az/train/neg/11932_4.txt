Oliver Gruner is not completely known to me. My friend showed me this movie, because he saw Gruner, a very beautiful movie called Nemesis. So, as we have seen, we quickly found ourselves in the incredible movement schemes through the BS drama part. Gruner likes to blow, shoot and shoot. And hit! haha <br /> <br /> The red character is a graduate student who is forced to move closer to a growing neighborhood. She sees the boy watching him follow the Mexican gang, who is suffering from the family, if he really wants to attend. Instead of joining, Gruner tells the boy to fight (a very terrible one). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Qruner is a typical Van Damme character who kills everyone (or rather bad ones). <br /> <br /> The solution was very strange and easy to think. If Gruner is probably the one to compare the possible options, it is best to choose his script. This ghetto is a hell of hell, and heroes sculpture looks like a chance against the character of Gruner. The music was typical of music (thumping pianos and timpani, swollen guitars) that is not really bad because I'm musicier. The director needed a really busy moment of the family to continue the action instead of breaking every 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Finally, I gave 4/10 because it is really a mid-way film for Oliver Gruner to star in the star, common feelings just want to get closer to what you see.
