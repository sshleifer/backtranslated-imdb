I was forced to see this movie by star power, but in the end it was all given. A big city plays more and more like a Greek tragedy than a modern tension against corruption. The biggest flaw is its shortness and shortage. We know the origin of evil men and follow them as dominoes. The film's credit is fraught with extreme violence and sex, but has forgotten to replace good, pure romantic or excitement in any way. Well, all the taste of a straight caffeine-free diet. Q & A is a better alternative to LA Confidential, which also takes place in New York.
