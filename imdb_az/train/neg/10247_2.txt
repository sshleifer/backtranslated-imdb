This is one of the most boring films I have ever seen, its terrible. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee is good, but he's in a difficult situation, but the best part is the opening scene. <br /> <br /> Do not be fooled by headlines. "The End of the World" is a really bad film, and it was just too bad for the immortal b-film fans who had brain to stop this ghusl.
