Thanks to some awesome home video distributor brought to the German Independent Series, it's not just terrible for Four Venice, it's really terrible. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> <br /> <strong> Occupation. Eva and Luis Eva are a few waitresses who live in the mouth whilst a waitress and an artist Luis. Nick, in turn, causes Eva to lose her job as a waitress. Luis and Charlotte had a relationship with Eva and Nick behind. Luis cheated Eva, claiming he would fly to London to do something about his artwork, but actually flies to Venice with Charlotte for a celebration of feast. Eva missed Nick and dragged two children together with Venice to face him. The trip to Venice results in the collapse of both Nick and Eve. <br /> <br /> Presentation of a visit from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva shows the failure of the comedy. It is not only logical, but also dragging. In the film, Nick tries to look for help in several ways, but does not help. <br /> <br /> This comedy had to add to the unnecessary scenes to extend the story. Although there are some problems that can be solved by common sense, the film uses solid thought to solve the problem. They prefer to go through a great era to solve this problem. <br /> <br /> It is not so bad that beautiful scenery in Venice will not cause the film's reputation.
