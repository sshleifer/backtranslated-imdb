you do not see it. It was one of the most terrifying films ever seen. sometimes it is difficult to be a Mormon when there are movies there. What a sad look of the life of Mormon. I can tell you that if you see this movie in a single ward, there is nothing like it. If I think of it, I would do it. The majority of Mormon films are badly done by a group of geeks who do nothing better. The actor was so bad that he was a friend but he did it hard. B can be said to have all the signs of the film. or C movies? Anyway ... I thought that this movie was full of cheese and cheese. I wish some Mormons would begin to shoot quality movies.
