Yes, should you start? This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I will not comment on the story itself, it's a wonderful classic, but I feel like a soap opera here. First of all, Eric, except for me, is the quality of soap opera, the player. I've always been an admirer of Brad Pittin, but here every actor of Bold and Beautiful embarrasses him. Camera movements also do not help. How he's bound to it when he thinks he's taking Brooke Forrester's days back in the lab! Peter O'Toole was either a bad plastic surgery or a hopeless need. In both cases Linda Evans looks more like Linda Evans! And Diane Kruger is a lovely girl to finish my comments, but she's not a Trojan Helen. Elizabeth Taylor is still pretty bad, because Peterson should choose the role of Saffron Burrows more.
