This series was CBS networks that succeeded in the Great Valley's success. The ABC program was a 90-minute West. Despite the answer, there were no materials for the 2nd season. <br /> <br /> This problem has really turned into reality and lost in this show. For example - in an episode, Johnny stuck his eye with a stick. At the end of the show, Johnny was completely healed. However, stories about this were not as strong as the Great Valley. <br /> This is a show that I do not want to DVD, and obviously I hope they will never be released. Imagine that GIS works for many, re-use the familiar settings. The latest western series of CBS, known as Westerners in the 1970s.
