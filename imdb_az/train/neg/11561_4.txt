Alan (Anthony Steffen) offers money packages for the weekend to deceive sexy, red-headed women in the castle, British multi-millioner (with the intentionality of the first spouse and the untimely death at birth) with several screw holes. <br /> <br /> Therefore, after returning to the parent's congregation, they are disappointed, and a bull comes to strike with a whip and then kills them. <br /> <br /> But when she gets to the blonde girl, Gladys (Marina Malfatti) decides to give up her charm, lethal ways and marry her. <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br> </ p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> /> So, the note Let's say: cold 70s colds with loads of delicious women in different provinces; spooky Gothic retreats and misty cemeteries; a sadistic rich psycho with an angel for dazzling dead fathers with stinging bodies; a number of malignant killings (including all the creatures that have been tied up by a victim's head with a rock and eaten by foxes) are a huge excuse. Normally, would such a checklist provide me a good time? Why did 'The Night Evelyn leave his grave'? Yes, the plot for beginners is very rough: red breads, nude plot developments and many suspects, and all of them are a little too big. Many people have come to the conclusion that we think there are a few people to get rid of the grunts of Alan's richness, and that the redhead should be the hero of the queen. My head was very caring! Secondly, Emilio Maragli's direction is very weak. Stylish, yes; <br /> <br /> <<Never time); Alan's wife, Agatha, is an old brother who is played by a lovely young woman; Starting a group of direct curling blouses, such as eyelashes; a poor attempt by the audience to try to discredit the audience in the UK (in addition, it is not enough to recall the word "weight" and take a courageous police uniform for one of the police); of course, a bag with a pavement next to the swimming pool is likely to find sulfuric acid ... <br /> <br /> 'Evelyn has come out of his grave at night' (how many women in the show may be?), but there there is a good giallo. If you are an admirer of the genre and watch the best of today, do not wait too long.
