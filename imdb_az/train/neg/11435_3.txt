When I rent it, I wish to get acquainted more about this movie. Heather Graham and the actress (IMHO) would like to put me in the strongest account. Although some part of the film was appealing, most of the film could not be thin, undeveloped or otherwise digging or predicting. Do not talk about the ICK factor for many people who think that siblings are a few couples ... I do not think much of the storyline is so great. And for Charlie, for a zoologist, of course, it fits more signals than other Homo sapiens. What is the Gray enemy for him (along with his warmth and some common interests)? The story could have been more exciting with a bit more depth. High Points - Molly Shannon (although I agree with the reviewer who discovered annoying on his occasion), dragged cabbie and dance sequences (if Sam and Gray were such great dancers, we would love to see more, the bits we've shown were better than most of the movie) . It would be better.
