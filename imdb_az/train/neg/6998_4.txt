When Hollywood always deals with the terms "religious picture". Strange Cargo is no exception. Despite the superiority of a superb victory and production of a top-budget budget, the film, shot by Robert Planck, was dysmally unsuccessful. Perhaps this is because the sudden interference of fantastic elements in the movie is actually a violation of the act of watching the action and the fate of characters. The story of the famous Ian Hunter was difficult to sit still with all the metaphors, parallels, and biblical references that could not be perceived as the figure of Christ. At least in Boston, Detroit and Providence censors agreed with me. Movie was banned. Some Boston / Detroit / Providence cinemas have complained or if they are going to other cities because Gable and Crawford have come up with a "message form" in a way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A home atmosphere takes the film's allegory more and more into the audience. But, despite its reputation as a strange or unusual movie, the structure of this strange Cargo runs along the rough, heavy lines that nobody can predict how the hero will survive.
