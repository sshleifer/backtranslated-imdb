What is the purpose of creating sequels that are not entirely a genuine film? There is no point. Therefore, the Prom Night segments are so embarrassing. The original film created a group of children hiding a dark mystery, so that they all kill all the killed and be accused of one's revenge deception. Can someone explain to me that the corpse has to do with the first film until the dead son rises from the queen-to-be-megase? The Prom Night 2 was a continuous hole in the audience, leaving the place of constant interest, and why should it have happened? But in the end, I think you can say one of the worst films, so laugh at yourself.
