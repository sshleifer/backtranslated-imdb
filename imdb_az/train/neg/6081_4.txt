The 70-year-old Italian film in the wild, original and good music, but interesting, but unusual photography, poor and sometimes confused story (eg, the role of the monster and the guy from where?) <br /> ) and the naked scenes (probably including the pseudo-koitus of typical 70s), an old teenager (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel), which is well-known and desirable, maybe 11 and 13 years old, - all 30 years from public-political point of view (and US) is very interested to see how this young representation of young people is acceptable and normal <br /> <br /> The story is that a girl's (Laura) conflict with the other two characters and discrimination is an accurate representation of one-aspired teenage life . The character of Eva (Silvia) will not develop until the end of the film, and will no longer be known for erotic art - there is no "age" for her: she is a young girl who has long been unaware of her sex charm, but eventually she only cries like a little girl, uses. When Laura appears as a very naive and weak victim, the boy is a terrifying violence.
