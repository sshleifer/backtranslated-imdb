This is a simple hedonism and / or public comment that is embedded in a tragic story about the scheme of a jealous young woman to separate her father and her fianc√©. Is it an Eyewear or a Look at a Girl With an Electra Complex? Whose mouth? Except for the mother, all the characters (Deborah Kerr) are important and bad. Seberg is weak (I agree with the previously considered interpretation of "children in heaven"). The plot is plodded. This predicted material, unfortunately, was sufficient for a film that lasted about an hour and a half, about 30 minutes! If you want to see great costumes and jewelry in Riviera, I advise you to "catch a thief." Here you will get an entertaining story and favorite bonuses. <br /> <br /> I want to entertain the movies. I personally see where a movie is. No matter what time and place, I would like a good story - comedy or drama. I also want to see some unpleasant characters. It does not hurt me to belong to them. Poor Deborah Kerr, typically giving a good performance and David Niven plays a reputable role. "2" rating only for Kerr and Niven, and for cinematography, rich color scenes and dark, black and white curtains. Unfortunately, not all major cinematographers in the world can save a poor story with an unpleasant symbol. The tooth ear is still a sowing ear. As a result, watching these turbulences was a serious loss of time.
