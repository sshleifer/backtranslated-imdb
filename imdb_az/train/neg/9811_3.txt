What can I say ??? This movie was terrible and stupid, so I thought it was a psychological DRAG comedy - They should change their name "Fight cat pregnant cats!" Chuck's "two ugly plastic dolls (later Jennifer Tilly '), if you want to see" The Bride "(DIE DIE!" I DO NOT WANT YOUR BABY DRAG QUEEN!) To rent a single "Chucky" movie after Jennifer Tilly becomes his Freaky self, it was more fun to watch UGLY's Chucky, then Daryl Hannah was attractive plastic rubber type when she was pregnant, terrible and stupid & Jennifer Tilly knocked her down Husbang, a food processor, tried to do my homework in my home! I was reminded that only BAD!
