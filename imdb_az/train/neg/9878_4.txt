Wes Anderson had a lot of love for "Fantastic Mr Fox", unfortunately, for all his love. Undoubtedly, many efforts and efforts have been made to create such a self-conscious quirky universe, but effort has been made to simultaneously synchronize and make fun of it. It's a terrible thing that I thought it was the best thing to do with Wes Anderson. <br /> <br /> Animated animals are good at close-ups of the animals, but then the camera is really tough on the eyes and looks quite honest in a somber situation. Wes did not really have anything to do with choosing to choose his friends and big names on more specialized voice actors that could make the movie better. <br /> <br /> Mr Clooney's voice response has two boats in South Park. One of them played a dog. <br /> <br /> The film works very hard to be smart and intelligent. Despite the film in England, different and typically all the good animals are typical Americans, baseball, and the bad guys are stereotypical British with the most insulting English habits. I do not emphasize how much this film has spent. I did not laugh at once.
