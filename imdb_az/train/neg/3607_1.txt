This review begins with a great spoiler about this movie. Do not read more ... come here, run your eyes! The main hero, the girl who always lives in other films, is killed here. I saved 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of the cheap movies that came together in the middle of the 80s slasher era. <br /> <br /> It is not only disadvantaged, despite the heroic killing. <br /> <br /> Both priests and college students get a bad rap here. <br /> <br /> Splatter University is a sociological moron, which, if found to be similar to a small college campus life, has led to many internal problems. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is associated with the degree of R (R) for strong physical violence, however, when there is nothing better, blasphemy is very short women's nakedness and sexual references. <br /> <br />
