First, everyone who thinks about William Friedky's "The French Connection" is very superior, absolutely absolutely insane or moronic or both. The problem of reviewing this film is a) a continuation of a bright film which always follows the objective shortcoming, and b.) It is the leadership of John Frankenhimer, one of the best American filmmakers. like it. William Friendkin was a perfect man who directed the film about drug traffic in decay in New York because of his approach and story as a documentary, while Frankenhimer, one of the most stylish directors, namely "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Seconds" and "French Connection 2 "trying to be defective and does not have a true concept to drive it. Frankenhimer's Gene Hackman has been chosen to lead the continuation of the story, really telling a lot about the concept of Hackman's original film. As it turned out, Hackman hated Freddy on the set and promised not to work with him again. He also knew that the character could be one-dimensional, lose weight, and play a plain character. Although he was a great actor, he showed Hackman and had no idea who would make the film and story bigger. Doyle is interested in the point he has built to become an addict, but does not provide the rest of the movie. Frankenhimer's filmography is a failed point.
