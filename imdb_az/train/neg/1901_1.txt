<br /> <br /> Since 1974, the 1950 film "The Past" has been rebuilt. In fact, this is a good move and the area moves pretty well. But a big Hollywood budget does not seem to be more convincing than the original one. For those who did not know, the original industry had thieves working as insurance inspectors. Who will question them? Even if there is a change in almost every aspect of HB. Halicki's original version is a very nice movie, and it's a great 74-piece version until we get to the final chase scene. In this version, only one 10 minutes are filtered into one, and a monster with a special effect of chasing out all incredible results. Where the true persuasion was quite convincing, the star made the whole stunt, and it was made in the last 15 minutes. My advice, if you want to watch a classic car follow-up movie, stay in the bargain bina original in your local rental enterprise and make a new remake of pure.
