Dialogue: stilted, clichéd; Players: hammy, clichéd; <br /> <br /> What does Christopher Plummer do in Nastassia Kinski's "B" trash? <br /> <br /> For a few years before this movie was filmed, Kinski had masterpieces such as Tess and Cat People ... <br /> <br /> Bad guys hit all the bad guys - bad * bad man's accents! (Especially Plummer, where did the "German" work?) And most of them are bad guys. All who are innocent have enough panic to make you laugh. A good man goes on to say something like this: * 5 knives thrown in a deep place on his shoulder only pulls and then uses his arm with no difficulty; * one of the sea's machine gun (I think) .50) bandage and then it's a little longer; * A few fist battles that are fraught with a plurality of punches, including a tap - enter a door frame, directly wounded ankle, or any other defect <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG>, but he can make a weak needle without resorting to bread techniques using villains. <br /> <br /> This film really takes a lot of time. showing, The wooden line of the 1970s film 007 responds to Bruce Lee's obviously fake combat scenes, but it's not as good as Roger Moore 007 or Bruce Lee. Please do not worry.
