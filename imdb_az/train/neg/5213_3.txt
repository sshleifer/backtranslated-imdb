As we have noted, this movie is like FLY (both versions) and less well-known fantastic figures such as ALTERED STATES. The big difference is well-prepared by people who know what these two films are doing and are doing well. METAMORFOSIS did not have these advantages. <br /> <br /> Mathephosis is a potentially interesting science fantasy that has wrong men and wrong actors playing a role. <br /> <br /> Story scientist Dr. Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) is about a genetic treatment for aging and death. The university, which has been working to endanger financial activities, decides to place anti-aging serum on it. As a result, Dr Houseman slowly turns the rest of the film into a laser. And oh well, watching a good doctor is a great joy for being a lizard. It's really bad that's good. Some of the lines are classic: "What's the matter?" <br /> <br /> "It's a nightmare from the past!" <br /> <br /> Show how many ratings I've read at this point are foolish and funny in the last five minutes of this movie. I'm just going and I'm spoiling it: a good doctor, half a man, half a lizard, and when the police finally hit him with a weapon, he looks like a man in the godzilla suit. On the final stage, a little lady who claims to never die will be seen, and the hero of the film, Sally Donnelly (Catherine Baranov), appears to be a small lizard Dr. Houseman's last embodiment. The camera then gives the liver to the nearest part of the face; This is what I think, the director shows us the way to show that the lilac is bad. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because it was part of the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Megapack that I received. I'm sure most of the film readers did the same thing. Because 50 packages are the only way to see this movie on DVD. If you recently purchased a box set and still have not watched this movie, it's really worth your time even if you really do end up ending it. It is also possible to find this movie online for free.
