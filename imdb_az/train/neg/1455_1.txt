In a film based on a historical figure, I was a little nervous. I'm sorry for a terrifying joke of a movie. <br /> <br /> Famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw first became the advisor to this film. But he insisted that he had found and rejected his works historically incorrectly and ridiculously and wanted his name to be used as a source (he felt embarrassed by his thinking). <br /> <br /> One area indicates that Hitler has defeated his dog. There is no source for this. Hitler loves animals on people. He led to the most serious animal welfare laws in Europe, banning vivisection and animal experiments. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The film is becoming a transplant of the Railway Cruiser on a bribe. He speaks lies. <br /> <br /> For a long time, he has been awarded the dubbing to repeat. <br /> <br /> Hitler has no historical record of sex with his brother. <br /> <br /> Hitler, therefore, is depicted as a rabid simpleton in these trash meadows. <br /> <br /> He would not even know that there is no such thing as the ignorant, demented, unfounded movie, as in real life. <br /> <br /> He says this movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> Wait for the button and give it a very large space.
