<br /> <br /> I have a few days after seeing the island concept, and I'm still afraid that any band will spend a lot of time to shoot such a violent film. <br /> <br /> No one should hope for this movie to be the result <br /> <br /> At the same time, nobody should see this movie in hopes of entertaining. <br /> <br /> It would be a terrible failure as a fantastic movie. As a rule, the main character is able to bring her past life and interact with her personal computer - by Timothy Leary's advice and promotion. <br /> <br /> As a drama, it would certainly be a terrible failure. The writer / director can not do anything for a full eighty-five-minute, unnecessary, annoying and unfounded drama in any way. I doubt anyone thinks that all the dramas of the movie serve as a cause for concern. <br /> <br /> I think it is difficult to express my respect for my Fatherland. The conditions I have seen have forbidden me from the theater, but I have nothing to ask for. I am still angry that I have time to see it. I can only criticize this movie more effectively, so I can say more.
