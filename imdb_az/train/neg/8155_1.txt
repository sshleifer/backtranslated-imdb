I really prefer Robin Williams' more serious roles (eg Good Will Hunting, The Fisher King, Garp World). These are my favorite Robin Williams movies. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Look at the day, though it works well, it's one of the worst films I've ever seen and of course the worst Robin Williams movie (Smoochy is worse than Death, Club Paradise and Alladin Ice) <br /> <br /> Every good story will be ups and downs. However, this movie is a giant. I do not need Hollywood cheese-fest, but I have nothing but 90 minutes of full and complete desperation. This movie reminds me of "Love Liza" (really worse) because the only purpose of the film is to see how much a person can fall. Answer? Whose hand is it?
