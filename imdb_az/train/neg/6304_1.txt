As a historian of the Second World War era, and as a person who is not proud of this country's racist history, I have tried to see this film. What is the frustration of the picture. I spent 3/4 of this, but I had to extinguish it on the lower attack scene. The idea of ​​throwing the U-bot torpedo in a DDE, as with the hope to shoot it, then the idea of ​​running away from the DDE is awakening. And that's just a small detail. The whole film has been written weak, poorly directed and weak. I admit that this squad might be a good movie for others. It was in the sky that all the WWII propaganda films had to be merged with the black people after they were made in black and white. And it's as bad as old movies, and that's even worse. And almost comes from the wrong ads titled Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. They had very small roles. Two beautiful players were ashamed to be related to this movie. I did. I gave most of my life to this crap movie.
