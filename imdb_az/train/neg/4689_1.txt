A really terrific movie made by cinematographer-director Ted Tetzlaff. Probably a fairly visible film, but is completely deprived of any tension for the bomb film. Ford, as it puts it here, goes to sleep, with a good laugh. There are some details around here - the Canadian army or the RAF, bombed the war, his wife abandoned it, but none of these backgrounds have added much. Bomber itself is a complete mystery. Why does he try to blow up those mines? When do we talk about it for that? Second World War or the Next War? I accepted the last one, which made the bomber's motive even stronger. Generally, though, it's just a terrible movie. There is often a good bombshell to skip these. Follow any episode of "Horrific UXB" for a more exciting time at the same time.
