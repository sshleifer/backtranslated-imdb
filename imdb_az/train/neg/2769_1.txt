This film serves as a timely warning to everyone who can write and manage their films. Face it, you can not. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> </ span>> I like this movie as a bare popcorn movie I really wanted to do; I love very bad movies. But once I was forced to ask what was happening to hell, and why, Lord, why? <br /> <br /> Several times, I will not be able to take it again. <br /> <br /> I would also like to tell you how one of LA's is Mordor for the final scene.
