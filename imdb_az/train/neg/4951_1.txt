When I went out for the first time, I commented on it and reviewed it in the "first toes in the middle" and I will only use it for the benefit of the first episode. <br /> <br /> I have seen six episodes totaling to this point in June 2006. As a lifetime Batman fanatic, I would say without hesitation that this is the show. <br /> <br /> Everything is wrong with it. Everything. <br /> <br /> This is just me or anyone in the movie Joker? Gotham is a turnaround gate most of the justice system? Otherwise, writers have no interest in making any effort on any other villains (see "no character development above"). <br /> <br /> And every Joker to worsen issues. 2) Joker gives gas to the whole city. <br /> 1) People with joker gasses. <br /> 2) Joker gives the whole city gas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The head of the Caucasus runs me, but it's a disgusting Cluemaster. ... Think Think Thunk episode with quiz show. This is the worst Batman story I've ever seen and heard. Yes, there was Batman in my basement. <br /> <br /> I really can not feel that this show is because it is likely to be against ToS, but it starts with "B" and "fastardization". Timm / Religious / etc. Thank you for your existence. Bat-entertainment cycle coming back from Fox and WB days. It's amazing, and I must know that, unfortunately, could not last forever.
