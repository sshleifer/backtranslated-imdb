There is nothing positive to say. Fraud, huffing and exaggeration with the "message". New Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (Cuckoo comes to mind), but many live in the bottles of the carton and the last drop of asbestos (a good example of Nochnoi Dozor). This is a kind of "dose" spacebar. It would be scary to act because of the weaknesses of the players and the lack of power to think that they are too weak and sometimes terrible. A special award for the operator (Blair Witch had a 15-second unbeaten fame) and focus on CounterStrike and less-focused pre-teens in order to make sure each shot was shaking. Women's lead is very often trying to look attractive, and on the contrary, men need antihero a diction coach (genetics is not bad: despite the very expressive eyes). This is a (medium) finger for this non-fictional stack. Everyone who appreciates this is a brother of "auteurs".
