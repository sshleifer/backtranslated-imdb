Well ... tremors I started in the original 1990, and I found it pretty enjoyable to watch the movie. However, they began to vibrate in II and III. Trust me, these films have begun to climb up after the first one, ie, ass blasters ??? Now, only God himself says, "Why does a god named God make someone else dumpster dives?" Can answer the question. Tremors IV is not a bad movie, in fact it is not considered to be an episode of a bad movie because it lives more. When I tried to sit down, my eyes began to flow and my heart was hopeful that the little girl from the dark came out of the television and killed me. did I really think that the people we look at in other films are sometimes from the bare west as if to make the film (with the same events) better? I will never honestly recommend this movie, which means there are cheaper ways to turn it on well.
