Unfortunately, this movie is in fact no credit. Nicholas Cage connects the screen with a range of skilllessly screwing up the screen as far as the wooden actors go. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Not enough information is provided to deliver viewers to things sold . This is an invoice of poor goods. Curses can not be stopped or doubted. <br /> <br /> The only saving feature of this film is that it is very visual, as it is required at the intermediate level, and should be praised for its location. <br /> <br /> Many spectators laugh, <br /> <br /> Disappointment! Wait for the original TV to come out, pour whiskey and enjoy it.
