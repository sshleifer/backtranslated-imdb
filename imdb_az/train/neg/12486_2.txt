Rich Dyak Joan Winfield (Bette Davis, bitterly ill) is engaged to get married with a stupid egoist Allen Brice (Jack Carson missing). His father (Eugene Palette) decided to stop marriage and was kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins (James Cagney, Siddique). <br /> <br /> This is a paradise only because of Cagney and Davis. They were both brilliant actors, but also they are not drama comedy and shows why this movie is! The scenario is simply horrible - the whole film has no real laugh. This is the joke that Cagney and Davis have for the first time fallen in a cactus (this is done three times!). Only their great talents save them from being completely insulted. They also do what they can with evil things. Cagney does his best with his own line, and Davis breaks the full power of each line, but does not work. Carson looks at this kind of "hell" all over the movie (perhaps his emotions change in seconds). Only a few smiles on the palette with the different voices and the best readings. But all this was heartwarming and ridiculous - a real thing to sit. It only earns two stars for the functioning of Cagney and Davis and some nice cinematography, but really - not worth seeing. Cagney and Davis hated this movie in the following years, and you can see why.
