The "Transylvania's 6-5000" contains very few familiar names and horror parody of the 80, which is a few realistic possibilities for entering the script, the useless, sometimes funny and attractive 80s. Gossipy tabloid newspaper's two Bozo journalists send a story about the alleged returning of the mad scientist Frankenstein to Transylvania. There are a few adorable little gimmicks and details to approach the right and left in the film as a little guinea pig for hard-boiled egg and lab test tubes used to put massage and sugar in the breakfast. Although the film is not sincere, it can be a long way from jokes and parody cases that are far away and can not be as successful. 4 years later, the production of Roger Corman, "Transylvania Twist," is very fun and highly recommended. The film is parody of the classic Universal Stages especially in the 30s, so if you want to capture all the little gags and references, it's better to make sure you've seen them. When Frankenstein's character is included in his lab, there is a pretty original twist that shows that he acts as a terrible evil scientist. Moreover, it shows that the Messiah, who is really related to the situation of the exiled monsters, is more than the Damien type. Michael Richards, a freaky man playing Kramer in Seinfeld, is a psychotic butterfly star that disappears in the most apparent and invisible moments. I am convinced that Mr. Dutton is inspired by the role of John Turturroun in the role of Richards.
