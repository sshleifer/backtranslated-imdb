All this lately became my chance to rent it and watch Santa Claus conquer fighters. Although children are more sadistic in SCCTM, I have to say that Santa Claus is a worse movie. As a Spanish-language assignment in Spanish, we had to watch all 5 of them. I'll tell you, generally, when we watch a movie, we're just talking and eating, but not for this movie. Everyone just wondered what Mr Pitch was going to do next. Will Merlin Help Santa Claosa? or his robot reindeer to come and save his day? I will lease it because it's the biggest trash I've ever seen and love it. : D
