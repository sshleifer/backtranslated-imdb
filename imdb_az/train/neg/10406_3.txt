Attention: There are small spoilers in this regard. <br /> <br /> The first Tremors writers are officially ignored. I'm a great fan of the first movie, and the first two albums are pretty good for a flat video cost. Tremors 4: Legends begin, but a very tough movie. Where are the Hack Graboid? <br /> <br /> For the first 90 minutes, I think this entry is a "characterization" of the series because of the relative absence of Graboid. Unfortunately, in addition to the character of Billy Drago, the film has little curiosity, very few lines are given, very little work is done, and ultimately little screen clock. The presence of Michael Gross, Burt Gummer, who saved the 2nd and 3rd films. If there is no movement on the screen, you can be sure Burt Gummer will be very interested in listening and / or watching. But in this film Gross Hiram plays Gummer's very weak and dull. <br /> <br /> Groups (Dirt Dragons in this movie) look good on the screen, but also look good, but it's so good. <br /> <br /> I saw the Tremors 4 given in 101 minutes. It's great for direct video. But after watching her, I am sure that this movie is very good for 15 minutes. A rich dialogue has a length and does not add any more space. Is there any hurry to get this movie? <br /> <br /> Of course, this is very important to me. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> </ font> Think of all the luck, get # 4 free for free # 1. After watching Tremors 4, I can not imagine paying a dime for Tremors 4, if I love to think it's paid for the original and there's no charge for this mess. Tremors 4 for fans of the series are the best to forget: even when Legend starts. <br /> <br /> Tremors 4: Legend begins at rates from 10 to 3.
