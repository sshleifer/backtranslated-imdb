This film deserved to work on the Mystery Science Theater. Although King Solomon does not do anything, it is an unexpected laugh-revolution because it takes an hour. Truly! It is worse than destroying all the monsters. Make sure that the sweatshirt (Shriners is here), the open polyester Norfolk sack of Allan Quatermain, and David MaCallum's badly runneck (which goes far beyond its worst influence), all the "monsters", the monsters themselves a handful of dolls, a giant snake that protects Macallum during oatmeal, red eyes on motorized crabs, a boat mounted on an old sandblock and a boat that looks like a Jr.Sr (oh brother!) . The Foenician city - the Emperor of the Roman Empire, but clearly the Egyptian hieroglyphic writings ("The Phoenicians have invented the alphabet!"), And the worst of all the prominent ballads - the 71st class, "Macallum and Ekland" (with its fears of weakness) terrible face - horror! The best part is that bold predecessors chose to lose funny French and to die more heroically than the African boy -Suffleupagus or any other thing - not on stage.
