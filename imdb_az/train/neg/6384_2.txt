Soon, social networking sites were online when I looked at the sites. The long list of films was in this movie and I thought it should be hallucinating at the attack title and premise. But, no, this is really what it is. And since the movie is only 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If some porn movies emerge, I will follow. Instead, it was the most strange movie I've ever seen. The Danish production team, with a budget of about $ 49, tried to create a Star Trek style movie about the squad of gay men browsing the galaxy without killing all women and killing all women. Earth! <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <p> If I have ever heard some of the characters I've ever heard, I could write them down on IMDb without my review I do not think! However, despite its similarity, something strange is beautiful and striking. However, as I have already mentioned, it is only a movie for adults due to the names and the only theme (though not naked). <br /> <br /> This movie was asking 1001 questions for me how the WHO would do it, WHY and WHO it meant? This can not be the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the most bizarre and maybe the most attack!
