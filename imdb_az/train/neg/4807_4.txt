"Pusquda" is no ordinary motion signal. To be ordinary is bad. One is approaching another with a machine gun. The other man burned a round and had more firefighters, so it rained down on him. Guess which one is a good man. Duh. Thus, the "ambush" passes. A good action is not a flick, not a good drama, not a good movie, but the "Bumpy" succeeds at all levels, B-movie moves mechanically, acting as they know what they're doing. <br /> <br /> Not recommended for everyone. <br /> <br />
