This movie is not worthy of even one. It was a waste of time. Loss of film and money. This is not an attack, but everything was provocative and disgusting. I think my spoilers should be read by everyone. There is a complete frontal nudity and disgusting language. But there is not just any land line, the actors are terrifying, the axiller is awful, the actors are short, and I'm glad to watch this movie! <br /> <br /> I rented Brian Van Holt (only fifteen in this way) for rent. <br /> <br /> This can be a mistake as a director and editor, but repeats the same segments two or three times and only adds a new sentence. <br /> <br /> A similar film Eraser Head is likely to be in the worst case scenario. There is no life line and it's not funny. He does not try to be funny though. THE FILM IS NOT WATCHING.
