All of these actors, especially Brigitte Baco and Eric Palladino, are in the movie, each of the three couples is a movie that Verrrrry should have been favorite or a story he had to engage in. In other words, they do not look like real life, but on the contrary, they become movie scenes. Even if peepors work on one of their clients, there is no realist in the film. Also, one of the characters feels artificial when talking to an overweight woman in the film and looks after each other after the dispute. Again, the actors are all good and the film is beautiful, but it's still another one that can re-write before the production.
