I love horror movies. Even the most cheesy meat (I'm facing today, 10 out of ten diets, 10 out of 10), but it was funny. Terrifying player, terrible post, absolutely empty and incredible characters (there are no Meisner actors here) and a lack of enough organs. Please, I will spend 79 minutes of my life, I just spent. At least Crook brothers are called aptly. Only good thing about the whole movie was Alice Silverstone, who wanted to blow. For me, this is so surprising to me for Sundance. The majority of the site was totally unreal, even with film-film standards. ONLY. A creepy stalker boy who just wants to get a cheap wind for 10 seconds after leaving the door? Lame.
