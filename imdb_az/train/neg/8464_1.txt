I am really tolerant of evil science and philosophy and horror films. I was watching them since 4 or 5 years, so I've seen some bad things, but I'm dealing with it. I even watched many of SciFi Channel movies, so I know not to expect too much - a hopeful movie to talk about. Perhaps hopes of hope are eternal, as I believe in the teaching of hopes and experience. Unfortunately, this dog was the beginning and I knew it, but I would think something like moth for flame, it would be interesting. It does not do that. All actors give a good performance - I do not know how everybody keeps their face straight when given a script. Collagen-hunger victims parasitic creatures slowly have a human race, something that passes through a body at one time. There is a bad plastic surgeon who cooperates with the enemy by giving the appearance of people ... Do not worry, he gets those who come to him. The Slug people did not know they were from where they did not really know, and they thought they could ride on a meteorite on the earth ... But they know something about slug royalty members among the slug prince. to have sex with a man who knows he is a worm queen and who loves himself ... oh, should I continue? I beg you, do not spend 2 hours following this life ... it would be better ... think of the worst, worst case you can spend for two hours ... it would be better.
