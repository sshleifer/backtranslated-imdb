This film is a twisted ridiculer of a film about an unemployed family that ends with a defective violent guest in Japan and is just sitting back and watching at least four members of the family. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie is sacred, sexually transmitted drugs and violence have been censored and surprised to extend this limit. <br /> <br /> Generally, be more encouraging than any other message that comes to look at the rest of us. It's a film that's the worst element in the community, and it's always a picnic ... It's a disappointment from a successful Lost or Alive and Audition movies.
