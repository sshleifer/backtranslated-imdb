Playing around beautiful women, playing cops and bandits, the middle movie is one of the most delightful guilty pleasure that delivers me. <br /> <br /> Dear Hitchcock, there are a lot of shopping, at least not Kelly's choice, but the House on Carroll Street has not spent a lot of time on it, though the story looks so scary and somewhat worrying. McGillis plays the leading role. Grace is dressed like Kelly and she is not far away. Not worth it. But his character is not convincing. He must be a political prisoner and a purpose in life as he presents to the audience. The whole film is clearly engaged in a certain period, real events and a specific issue. But the story is a sad incident in face-to-face coincidental coincidences, high predictable and two-dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Let's get your breath to the final in the US city of New York. Starts from the underground section and then moves up to the roof. It can be praised for good use of the film's architecture.
