I watched "The Eye" before watching this. I really liked the "Eye", this was one of the best films of the latest Asian horror film. So I chose this "Bangkok delayed" because it was the same director and it was a very popular tour. But what a man is a disappointment ... "Bangkok runs" love, revenge, ghosts, and so on. There are three stories about no fear, even worry about ("Eye"). There is nothing. <br /> <br /> 100% drilling. <br /> <br /> My rank: 2/10
