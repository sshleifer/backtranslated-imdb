So 'Thinner' ... Yep .. This is Steven Bachman (Steven King's) thread, only a genie who just killed a Gypsy Elder, about the man who has the season, The story itself, there is no doubt about it, but why not I know you do not like it. In my opinion, those who really attracted me were actors. So who am I? Robert John Burke? Who is she? And can anyone stop calling for Joseph Mantegna for the role of any Italian Mafioso, who cries out loud? And yet, does every Mafioso have an Italian cooking machine? The only good thing to do here is 10 kilos of makeup, as Mikayil Konstantin is a Gypsy elder. He is very good. But the rest of you, all of you, are "better actors ..."
