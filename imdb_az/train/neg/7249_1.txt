This film is one of the most horrific films ever made by Plan 9. That person should always be anxious: <br /> 1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink did all 6 work! IMDb shows that he and his father were Western-born men. Maybe it could be a problem. <br /> <br /> Here is an example of a film: In the film, the sheriff must witness another city to protect her. Of course, bad guys are finding and waiting for them. But what happens? The good guys are walking along, and a shot sounds and shoots them close to a tree. When the camera shows us bad guys, they just sit on a daily chat. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with this picture? <br /> <br /> I can continue. Perhaps this movie was intended as a comedy. If so, he did not do it.
