If you want to watch a real 'quality' movie, hold the Eden Formula. This magnificent movie should cost $ 50. The monster - a very laughful geyf thin scripts, bad kits, lighting and camera work, and a stop movement, were absolutely laughable (they were sometimes used as a rubber suit and / or a glove puppet) - but not all of them were equally scary) . <br /> <br /> Actors speak their own lines as they read from a teleprompter, as they did not see before. Special effects are a very bad way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Break down for the underlying crud. <br /> <br /> I loved every minute.
