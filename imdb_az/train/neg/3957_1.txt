The original Boogeyman was a staggering but fun non-natural slasher flick. No big movie, it was entertaining within the framework of the right mentality. On the other hand Boogeyman's return, the third installment in this series is simply strange. It consists of two things. First, cheap and lifeless images. Secondly, the luggage of recurring bits from the first movie. The new material is incredibly elegant, but not an amateur, but fun in a simple way. These footage are often shot in one another without any effort. Serves as a framework device for endless clips from the first (and likely) movies. And boy, these films are from the previous films; sometimes reuse the sequences again. Only a new addition to these parts is sincerely described exactly what we can see with our own eyes. <br /> <br /> Boogeyman's return is an example of the worst abuse spell; It is a kind of exploiters who are highly silent. I want to keep this review short and to the point, because this film is more worthy. There is nothing worthless here. This is worthless.
