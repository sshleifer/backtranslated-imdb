Hollywood is often the only film in Hollywood this movie, because this film is raves from Hollywood. People who love this movie can only spit you out of the story by spitting you in a large number of songs. However, this movie is overrated and overblown. Eddie Murphy just looks ridiculous. Nevertheless, Jennifer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles do not give Oscar awards for many, because of the fact that the film is more than ever before. I do not believe the condo was believed to be nominated for an Oscars, and his entire album set an album. Glitz does not replace the story line of anything. Many songs are not a movie.
