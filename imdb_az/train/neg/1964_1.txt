When I saw the cover of this movie, the first thing I thought was prepared for the video. The second thing that came to mind was to look at Darkness Falls, a terrifying film, in addition to the tale of this terrible witch that killed the dark people. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was quite a masterpiece compared to this garbage pile and should not be made of this film. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a small story of a witch, or more, a senseless application of two small children going to meet their dance fairy in the hope of giving them a glimmering new bike. The opening film was weak and, as the rest of the film, is not, of course, scary. The film is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). Peter renters his house, and his old lover Darcy (Chandra West) and his daughter Cole come to stay there. Cole welcomes a neighborhood child and teaches teeth, how to lose your teeth, or coming for you. Unfortunately, after a second, the dummy stole the fairy bike and beat the teeth. <br /> Cole Doth will be rescued from Fairy's anger, and his mother and Peter will be able to rescue him and renew his romance ... this is a bad movie, probably you could understand it. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this strange movie is how much the Dental Story is unclear. If you lose your teeth, they say they kill you, but they will die. He is like a serial killer who kills you accidentally and loses your teeth, you will definitely go. He stole a bicycle, probably he has a thief. I said earlier that the idea of ​​this film was based on the Dark Waterfalls, but was inspired by the appearance of the dance for fairy? Let's see. He looks like a victim of burns and kills his children before. Hmmm ... is almost the disassembly of Freddy Krueger from "The Nightmare on Science Street". And this is not the worst part of the terrible confusion, but the peak. This movie can be the most laughable climax (I'm more funny than I've seen because I'm not exactly funny) I've seen. Do not see it. <br /> <br /> Just a little bit. Lochlyn Munroe was a Scary Movie and Jianna Ballard was Scary Movie 3 and they were both, so Scary Movie stars are forced to finish their career with the worst scary movies. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out. 80 minutes. R. for violence.
