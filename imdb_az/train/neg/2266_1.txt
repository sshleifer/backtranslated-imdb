Ringmaster, a miserable excuse to waste Jerry Springer's movie as a toilet paper, has recently lost his confidence in film art. First of all, prepared. Second, people began to see it. Third, some people have seen the best film. If a monkey can shoot a movie, I know it's 100 percent, that would be 1 billion times better. There are moments of the worst films (even Godzilla had some cool effects special). If Jerry Springer was a star, maybe it would be a bit worse for the movie. If I do not want to wait an hour and a half, I'll get a dump in a box. I'm sorry for you, your children, and the children of your children, if no one is really humiliating this movie; However, contrary to Springer's belief, I do not clearly see the sexually explicit children.
