This is Peter Falk's movie. Period. <br /> <br /> When I was 10, I was in this movie; Since then, I was a movie maker. Certainly, my parents did not see this movie when I went out, but I liked it because it was a font and it's a great movie. Okay, 34 years later, I finally saw the movie - I have never seen a film directed by Cassavetes. He hack, generally. Zero sense of time, editing. Gene's performance reminds most of Dustin Hoffman's "Rain Man": technically brilliant, but not entirely a note. As Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man", Falk takes a cake for this movie. <br /> <br /> I really was really excited by Gena's performance - it seemed more appropriate for "Awakenings" (blecch!). It is not his fault: he has the last basket from the first scene. Why could not we find anything? However, Falk's character is real, and it is done by FALK as a pervert person. <br /> <br /> Take a break for at least an hour (you need an editor!) And this would be a woman's prison portrait. <br /> <br /> A woman in the Caucasus , remembering Cassavetes for "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby", unemployed and still unable to deal with three children and husband's long working hours. <br /> <br /> As he demonstrated enough with this movie, he could have been a better director. <br /> <br /> Bob
