Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. These three lines combine this ridiculous little movie, which can only attract children and parents. and his # 1 movie in America! What does this country think? Mike Myers is looking for more like Michael Jackson. Some Chinese lady who slept for 3 minutes. A lame area with dirty jokes. It's strange and terrible. Green Egg and Ham will be very happy when it comes to 2005! (not Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost Yesh-Egg and Ham. They will try to persecute Sam-i-Am, and this means the one who runs away. (I hope they do not destroy their classic book). Do not waste your time and money by seeing this.
