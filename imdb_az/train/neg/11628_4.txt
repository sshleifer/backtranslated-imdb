Rooted, Rooted, Rooted How do I feel about this movie? A good start to a good idea is that a boy (Edward Asner) escapes from a prison dressed as Santa, finding a child with him and his true Santa believes that fake Santa will attract the children to help him find the stolen money bag. The film resembles the Christmas version of the song "From the Wind". The movie starts well, but gradually it becomes Cheeseer and Cheesier, at the end it's ridiculous and you can not take this movie seriously. For example, Douchebag, who acts as a garbage dump for a young boy named Sumner (Rene Auberjonois), does not have such a bad dress for his son to behave badly, the poor little boy of the Dwarfs! Fake Santa is a 45-second scene with Sumner visiting, and she delights her son, Carol, happy to read until the end of the movie and embraced his indifferent son ... Yep How is Corny ... Especially when I feel a good movie during Christmas, I'm an admirer, but this one is very good for me, it's a shame that's a good start, but the second half of the movie is a movie that is not compatible with just the rest of the supernatural element. This is not entirely bad, but there are some strong movements from kids, but there's a very good Christmas movie around.
