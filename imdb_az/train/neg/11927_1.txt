The worst movie I've ever seen for a long time without question. I endured to the end, because of course there must be something here, but not. If the area does not deal with clichés, rambles to the point of non-existence; The street to be just hackneyed; symbols never develop beyond the sketches; The set is cliché. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <br /> <br /> Saintsin did not leave alone their depths and shadows. In short, craftsmanship. The violent editor probably would have made it a little shorter than 30 minutes, but because it was the 6th form film project on a million pounds scale; smuggling and exaggerated by his own claims. Other movies have made it difficult for the English cinema industry to finance the cash flows (undoubtedly, only by the name of Rankin).
