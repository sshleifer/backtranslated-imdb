The story and the show were good, but it really did suffer and I hated movies that suffered from it. Ri'Chard is great. She really was putting the top notch performance and the girl playing her sister was really nice and bright. Seriously, I thought it was Carmen Electra until I saw the IMDb profile. I can not say anything bad about Peter Gallegar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm currently reading Vampire Chronicles, but I've seen the movie since I read a book. This is a bit "real" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis legends to oppose the displaced. Eartha Kitt was so creepy and what she did after her character was filmed for me; I'm having trouble watching the rest of the show. (I do not want to apologize for this uncertainty, but I do not want to give anything) Sorry, but not my show.
