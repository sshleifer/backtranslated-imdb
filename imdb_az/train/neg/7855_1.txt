Once I watched this movie, I could not believe my eyes. There is no point in blood and violence after that. Unlike these terrifying films, this film is just blood, so it kills each other. This film is not interesting, it does not have any meaningful plot or story line, and it does not have an intelligence. Blood is very fake, and this film is generally meaningless. Do not even waste your time. Only an hour or two innocent violence. It's not frightful, there are many bloody scenes just rebel. This is the worst horror film I have ever watched from all the movies I ever watched.
