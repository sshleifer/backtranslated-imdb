If given, I gave it one star. This would give zero. I was expecting this DVD to put the best movie on when I sat on the TV and when I sat on the sofa. I watched this movie on the IMDb and saw that it was the worst movie, so I'm critical of every mistake. <br /> <br /> "I did not make a shit that I prepared to shoot this movie on the television screen." LET YOUR COURT ONLY. <br /> <br /> This film should be banned from all over the world. <br /> <br /> This is the best way I can describe the film, but it's like pornography, but not sex scene. <br /> <br /> Do not depend on being like "me" or "like me". <br /> <br /> In the end, I do not say that I can not make a movie better than this movie, but I think it.
