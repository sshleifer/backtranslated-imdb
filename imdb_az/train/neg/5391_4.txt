I really hate the end of world cinema. They show what Hollywood is thinking about the rest of the world, and we think that we are a part of a clear sadistic stupid (or at least watching sadistic aobs that reacts to things). I have come to L.A. many times, and I have a family run business business, and I just want to say that these are the last people to look for in reality. Some disaster films are at least a clever picture: Men's Children, 12 Monkeys, but usually the message only "does something to keep alive, all is dark, sad and unreasonable, and we should all be ashamed of ourselves." /> <br /> Do not misunderstand me, I love the story of a story thrown from the social plaister system and test people by horror and I believe that some people will behave like this movie, but sadistic idiots aside, I am solely responsible for every single person in society , serious doubts, it just insults.
