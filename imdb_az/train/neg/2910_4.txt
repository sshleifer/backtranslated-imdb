The highlight of this film was for me Tom Hanks. Like Mike Sullivan, he has definitely been raised against the type and has shown that he can engage in an unusual role. Hanks is usually a good man in the film - a loved, loved and rooted person. Sullivan was not necessarily a good man. It is true that in the context of this film he was somewhat noble - his purpose is to revenge the murder of his spouse and younger son. Nevertheless, he was already a gangster and a murderer before these murders. <br /> <br /> Hankes took a role that I did not expect and he did well. <br /> <br /> Hanks is a good performance, though I can not say it's a nice movie. I'm describing it as a very good thing (after all, it's not completely clear for a while), it turns into a very complicated film, Sullivan is developing as a gangster on complicated relationships - largely Rooney (Paul Newman), a sort of councilor , trying to raise their two sons and keep them "clean"; was isolated from his job. When his elder son witnessed a murder, the gang tries to kill him, takes his wrong son (and his mother) and runs Sullivan and his eldest son (Mike, Jr.). <br /> <br /> Despite a bit of encouraging note (at least in the general context of the story), it's really dark, and it's stronger with the mood. Many scenes are shot in the dark and torrential rains. Although I appreciated Hankes' performance, the film did not hit me at all. 4/10
