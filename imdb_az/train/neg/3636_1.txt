I am very open to foreign films and I am thinking of what I'm trying to do, though some things are lost in translation. But the simplicity and "intelligence" of this film were boring. I thought how often it would be interesting to make a movie showing a typical day or time which is really no point. Now I've seen a movie that I'm not thinking about these lines anymore. Society has tons of racism and desires ... but South Park did it. While watching the South Park, it really encourages me to feel emotionally. The closest thing I felt during this movie was the feeling that I was living in the first five minutes. I appreciate the typical movie at seven or higher levels for every single movie I love most. I gave this movie to someone.
