An acted / manipulated documentary about one of the darkest places in Guatemala. fun, safe ... but a sad place, sex workers began to play in a group of soccer teams, gathered no more than a week! the main focus of a documentary film is that the society denied these "workers", even though these poor women did not solve any problems, but documented them instead of telling them to use a kind of "star" to produce a documentary about this reality. However, he has a documented reality ... but, unfortunately, he has nothing to do with the story. I do not want to see it again; but I recommend it only for general cultural purposes.
