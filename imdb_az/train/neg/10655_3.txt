It's quite likely that the 80's has never been understood, but how can you be harsh in a movie with non-stop images with free entertainments of free women, aerobic exercises, showers, and intense armor outfits? Before making a movie, Aerobicide is a 90-minute promotional video for promoting the use of steroids, silicone and other body-building stimulating fitness products. Probably a story about 15 minutes if you leave all the yummy girls playing 80 tunes that they can not protect from crooks and gratings. A great security pin (yeah?) Is a time to prepare a poster on a sadistic killer who kills young health freaks. The film opens with an unpleasant cheerful scene of a fried girl in the electric sunshine. A few years later, people died in the same spa. You do not really need to be an experienced fanatic or rocket scientist to understand that there is a connection between the killings and the burning events, are you now? Investigating the investigation, as we have seen, is similar to the brained police officer and Charles Napier, and a lucky beefcake is a special detective with the tallest 80 beauty I've ever seen! By looking at loans, his name appears in Dianne Copeland and he had done nothing but this from Turkey and was a romantic Troma-movie called "Surf Nazis Must Die". What a waste of opportunity! She could not have been a great actress, but she certainly had two other great advantages in show business that would move her upward. The quality of makeup and the makeup effects are not specific. We're dealing with a pin and some stingy cooked knives. In the end, it is ridiculous and predictable, but since then no one has taken the film seriously. If you want to turn off all brain functioning in the night and feel like watching movies, "Aerobicid" ("Killer Workout") is recommended! In fact, Death Spa can create a terrible dual feature. Both movies have a lot of sexy and little babies dressed up? and both films are pretty dumb.
