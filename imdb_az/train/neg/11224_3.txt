... they even live without seeing it. It's important to be honest, that this movie (which, in one case, calls it), is of real interest to the freaks band. Bettie Page fans will not learn anything new (and I mean nothing) or they will use hot fuzzs that are familiar, loved, or dear. <br /> <br /> The terrible scenario, wooden, less-community-theater activity, the lack of direction, the worst lighting or the rest of the bargain basement production costs. It's definitely "Hey guys, let's make a movie!" Lowest ordered movie structure. I think at least they knew how to handle the camera. <br /> <br /> Yes, I do not apologize for why none of this is so unclear * is wrong. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page, the Queen of Darkness, bangs the dark hair and trademark, fails to bring anything in the role of a preparatory role, completely bound and gagged, because it's wrong. As it is known, this movie is, before and during the previous accident, the first and most unfortunate event, first of all, a companion of the B & D set of lovingly drawn-out pages, so to speak. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <p style = "text-align: justify; It's worthy of the" Notorious Bettie Page " is not a comedy movie, it's a decent movie, it's a fetish piece that has made an attractive trading of all time's greatest pin-ups, without any fracture, without style and no Bettie Page character without any real meaning. No Bettie Page fan, I see it as a disappointment, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> Do not waste any money, but remember that it's also money at that time. , you apologize for being too precious, and you've been frustrated by this time, and I'm done, you warned.
