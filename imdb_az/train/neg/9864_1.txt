As a gamer, I can not say that I love this movie. Fact, I hate it from below. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> br /> 1. The characters appear unnatural. I have met many players, different types of my life. I do not know anyone who acts like any of the characters in the movie. Filmmakers have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them at 5. Most of the players are socially active, some of whom are quite active. <br /> <br /> 2. Style does not work. Spectacular style is not the subject of the movie. The true documentary of the players will actually work better. <br /> <br /> <strong> Economy> </ strong> <br /> <br /> Dialogue is compulsory, unnatural. It looks like it has never been in the real world context. I swear by the players, I will admit, but there is no Tourette syndrome. <br /> 4. Humor is lacking. Self-frustrating humor is the key point of my band and some other groups I encounter with, though it is less like self-assault and more like a toilet. Likewise, a large part of the player's humor is full of jokes and jokes, and the toilet is not humor. <br /> <br /> Many players will be dependent on and avoid this kind of joke. <br /> <br /> 5. The biggest challenge for me is justified: Accuracy. I do not mean rules, but instead of dynamics. Undoubtedly, this movie will be compared to lower budget movies Players and Players: Dorkness Rising describes both players as actual players playing the actual game. Opinion, Player: The film faces a situation where you do not want to beat players. Players, you can say something like this: "Huh, I know a guy like this ... Yep, it's like Gary." "
