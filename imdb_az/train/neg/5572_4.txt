Again, the men in rubber suit are another colored excuse for wrestling with each other. Meanwhile, tourists coming in from the future come in 1992, and in the year 1944 several people are involved in the work to get back to Godzilla and destroy the future of Japan. But when it comes to performing this task, is it a companion of a pair of couples whose partner is sorry and can not stand with Godzilla? Eek! All this sounds too silly, and the plot is surprisingly worthy, and the final battle seems very good. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are not garbage, they are discharged and are boring like film predators. See the jokes of the fierce Spielberg.
