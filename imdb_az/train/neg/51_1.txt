This movie was a great rage. In this film, the level of intolerant cruelty and violence was very worrying. some scenes were really unnecessary ugly and moderately inspiring. it is not possible to describe or even sympathize the main characters. The character of the protagonist was as simple as they were. health room / hot air, and top theaters. This movie could not have been a little or nothing about the Spanish Civil War. Fortunately, I have come to Spain and this is not true! In addition, using the same sex charm as "heroism" is also very offensive and bad, and the DVD is packed and advertised to attract gay viewers. actors thought they were worried about their roles, trying to get away from these messs. If you watch the children and animals cruelly killing them, this movie can be particularly appealing to you.
