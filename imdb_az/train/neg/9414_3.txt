Although I liked the version I had on the DVD, this movie was a disappointment. Yes, it is far more realistic than any of the other war movies of the era to show the mood description, tricks and frustration, but unfortunately, this film is far from being thought of as ALL. There is no plot and dialogue is unequivocal. A good battle movie should not have a battlefield every five minutes. One of the best World War II films, "Twelve Clock Highs", works very little. However, this is compensated by dialogue and psychological tension. Except for GI Joe Story, a short battle segment in Italy (DVD entitled "Under the siege"). Of course, it is one of the fastest-moving and convincing battle scenes of any war movie. But, unfortunately, the rest of the film simply does not have to watch it carefully. The other turn-off is Pvt. Dondaro is a "novel", played by Wally Cassell, but suggests departure from a disguise. On the contrary, Sgt. Warnicki, if it's a mistake, is a sympathetic man. When volunteering for another patrol, Capt Walker (Mitchum) says, "Every step is a step forward ... back home." But is this the last step? Is there a lot of patrols? it takes him to the edge of his mind. The rest of the film is pretty bad. As for the description of Meredith's Pyle ... it is practically comatic.
