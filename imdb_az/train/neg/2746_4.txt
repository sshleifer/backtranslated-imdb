I was afraid to take my brothers to this movie, because I did not think it would be fine. Children aged 6 and 10 started seeing him. I was not as bad as I thought, but it was still far from the book. The film looked right at the age of 10 with a sense of humor and humor. I saw that the 6-year-old understood what was happening and found ways to deal with the problems. Finally, sometimes I have to explain that films do not provide the best solution to problems, because it's more fun to watch what happens when you make "foolish" or "stupid" choices.
