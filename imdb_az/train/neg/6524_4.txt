The Angry Red Planet (Quickie Review) <br /> <br /> Like "Planet X Man", fantasy and science fiction is a strange fantasy tale that has come from a period of cursing under the same thing. There are some highly laughable special effects and rampant pseudo-science that masquerade as science fiction. <br /> <br /> So, what is the main reason to watch this movie? <br /> <br /> <p style = "text-align: justify;" Oh, this is all the time our space crew is on Mars. (What did you think of the "Red Planet" called Neptune?) From the very beginning, a "pretty woman" squadron, who came in to a number of places, and went inside a badly-spaced space crew, and was thrown around a sexual chauvinist student, and it would be somewhat offensive to today's standards if it were not too laughing, but Mars is the real reason we're watching this movie, but Mars is the best Mars bloody red shouting, with a strange red plastic glitter, which gives a fascinating look to the furious red planet - it's really a look, like the witnesses of a foreigner watching (the "ratbatspidercrab" is the best). Do you think that this is a joke? They say this in the movie! These rats, bats, It is a cunning shabran of something that combines the features of rumens and teens (a small puppet), which stretches across all the puppets and shades the "heroic crew". There are other strange and poor imaginable foreigners, but only a cake. Finally, after any experience on Mars, the crew manages their "boat" and returns to any planet they come to. <br /> Not for everyone. Science fiction films are enthusiasts and enthusiasts and some common movie enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Modern score, 6/10 Nostalgia account, 4/10 total (www.ResidentHazard.com)
