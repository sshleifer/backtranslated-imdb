The film has a good start, which presents the exciting and powerful Shannon Lee and presents two sympathetic side characters from the first half. But then something happens and suddenly Shannon turns into a plain, second-handed girl and the movie is lost in her own context. In the second half, there is a lack of character and is full of clich√©s, bad acts, terrible trickery and even worse coordination. We will not mention the horrific actors they chose for the Chechen mafia gang. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> If you are not paying attention to your real tough action fan and your quality, then watch this movie if you're in a better production. I personally waited for him, but I was very disappointed.
