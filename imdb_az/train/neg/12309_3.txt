It was a hearty movie. Consideration of the material --- the life of the army is always good laugh - and stars, this film should be down the laughfest. At best, it was worth a few stumps. Steve Martin was so entertaining and it seems that Dan Ackroyd is able to follow Robin Williams's leadership and remain loyal to dramatic roles that Oscars will win one day.
