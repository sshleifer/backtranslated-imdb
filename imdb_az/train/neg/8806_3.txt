How much was this violation of "being there"? People prove that a good honest person can succeed despite the lack of intelligence. They make mistakes. The film proves that lucky: everything your friend hopes to invest in Apple, not Atari; When a storm breaks down, your shrimp ship is alone in the sea; Fortunately, when you hit the back, I hope you will die of shock; We hope you did not receive AIDS from your spouse. This film also moves politically - everyone who rebels against the public convention loses his legs, deals with drugs, loves their daughters, or dies. In addition, product placement in this movie (Nike and Dr Pepper) is unfortunate. Emotional manipulation movie is too, very empty.
