I watched it only because it was run by Lucio Fulci and my favorite actor Claudio Cassinelli. <br /> <br /> The condemnation of convicts will compete with television ratings, Rollerball, Logan Run, Blade Runner and the new movie, Death Race, <br /> <br /> It was just a fraction of the number. The "Kill Bike" movement was ridiculous. "Training" was a dark-fest. <br /> <br /> It simply captured me and wanted to take care of everyone, including Dallas star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. <br /> <br /> Choose one of the others and get better.
