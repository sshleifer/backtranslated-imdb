James Gandolfini is a good actor, so he has not played any part in this groundless trash. Affleck is simply a lamp that can not cut it, and the remainder of the rest is truly unforgettable. I saw it in an empty theater in the US, and soon I knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes. When I went back to England, I was surprised to find that one of the film's market markets, Paul Ross, saw a brilliant report from the movie. If the movie says it is good, I always trust Rossa to save money for film tickets to correct this page. This movie should have a flat 1.99 TL DVD in a supermarket nearby.
