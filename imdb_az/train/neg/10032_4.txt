The storyline was okay. Akshay Kumar was always as good and a good thing about the movie. Kareena Kapoor appeared bad. There was much hue and we had to cry over the size of the zero, but he had never seen a good leaner. I do not know why Anil Kapoor's hell has taken on such a bad role. There is nothing in the film for him. Since he is a Yashraj film, he does not say that a player should take his role badly. Said Ali khan was right. Indian bosses and manufacturers are the time when Indian clients began to think as intelligent thinking. What do we want? fools !!!! What do they think, they have shown the teeth to two men who are SWAT staffs and will believe them. The Indian police are so foolish that they try to catch some criminals ... .... they take all the police squads, and there is no one covering the palace. The action was twisted and I did not see such a bad move. Akshay Kumar was between 30 and 40 police officers and fired at all, and he opened fire. No bullets hit him in the police, but he killed all the cops. Crap. <br /> <br /> I think the war director who thinks this scene should retire. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend watching this movie.
