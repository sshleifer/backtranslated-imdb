I have a question for those who think this idea. Why? They were thinking of making a second movie. Cinderella did not end with "They all lived happily" if she served the figurehead? I'm sure he or she has trusted it. Wait a minute, if they all live happily, how can it be? If history does not try to make the most boring story, it can not be the next one. I'm sure they have been reading Cinderella for two hours unhappy, but why? A film that ends up in "After Happiness" can not be durable; If they are happily living then! The first thing to do is go wrong with causing problems! Why? This is not true, it's bad. This is my last word.
