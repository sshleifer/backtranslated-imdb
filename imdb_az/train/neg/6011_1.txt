<br /> <br /> I did not expect much from this movie, but my brother, what a stinker. <br /> <br /> Did I find this stone worth $ 5 million Walmart in a giant chest (elsewhere)? It was as cheap as the disc, and I fell in love with it. The special effects were an average school look, the camera work was affected by flattering tripods and sketchy lighting, and the player is a perfect example of the "Christian School". After seeing what we have seen, we can imagine a long and tiring "meeting of the production company" - those who manage these things must have serious Biblical feelings against an unsatisfactory production company cranking these things. <br /> <br /> Someone asked why the Christian movies were so bad: maybe Xian filmmakers should look at GOOD movies and try to copy some movies. Things that do good to them. A story that addresses uncertain stories and characters, less hysterical arm-waving and fanaticism, oh and story, is not just the true believer. I. Stop the deal, save it to the Church. Take, for example, the Omen or the Prophecy series. Great movies with spectacular story lines, great cinematography and intense music. Hysteric no-wave. <br /> <br /> If this film has a smile trace, it would be better.
