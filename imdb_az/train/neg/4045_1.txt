But without getting any information about street life, she will not be able to learn or partially understand what life is like. She is increasingly challenging her to work for a group of friends led by an old friend of the school and not to appear in the film because of the perpetrators being murdered. The life of a new friend for the leader of the gang, the disaster, offers a golden opportunity to do something better. <br /> <br /> It may sound relatively interesting, but something else. The first half is incredibly elegant and elegant, and "kidnapping" is followed only by low-speed low-speed cars. Only two police vehicles are used in this "pursuit", both Nissan Sunny's 90s.
