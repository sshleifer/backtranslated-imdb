This movie is not just bad - it was terrible. After watching, I really felt that I had to get a BLEACH to get out of my madness. There are 'jackals' dealing with several elderly couples, not funny, but it's disgusting. This monster was the makeup, but that's all. Only sustainability mistakes make you angry - at least I was. The change is really weak. <br /> <br /> Maybe it would be better than taking the time to watch this movie. Even if your friends have become your 'bad movies', this is something unusual in their loyalty, and I have not even been laughing at myself. You have been warned.
