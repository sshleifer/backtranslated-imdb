This is probably the worst fencing, fight with the sword, and the movie. It's not just because the brick is weak, but the array and symbols are as poor as to squeeze into a semi-naked sex scene, and then I think the band dances around the fencing area in the fencing area. I think the audience is interested. How much loss of F. Murray's talents. Zorro, Scaramouche, looks like everything, like a man named Basil Rathbone. Like a sword, I understand that I can not shoot my sword in my film, but if it happens, there are better, better drawn characters and a deeper field.
