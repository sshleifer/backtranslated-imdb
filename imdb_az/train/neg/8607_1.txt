<br /> <br /> The film "Slugs" is unique because the titular cost is actually good guys in this terrible tale of nature. As you can see, these poor slogans do not mean that they are contaminated by bad people and do nothing harmful, they only bottles inflate with sharp teeth and poisonous foods, but inflate to no one. True bad guys are people who are actively trying to destroy the rays we love or when they encounter them. <br /> <br /> For example, look where the boy's handbag is full of slippers. When they got out of hand, they were relieved of a comfortable gloves and defended themselves, reacting instinctively to irritating people. Now he is looking for medical attention for his delusional flavor; he works around a fire that begins to shout like a whore, splits very volatile chemicals, opens a fire, stacks a wardrobe and cuts his own hands - then combustion and a mixture of volatile chemicals and his house exploded. <br /> <br /> This film draws a portrait of an inexperienced person. The characters of this film refer to the dull sheriff, the drunken sword belonging to the dog, and the tip of the wet, at least the age of forty, of his wife. <br /> <br /> There are also many drunken young people who are attacked when they break and look at the genitals of long-haired hairs. Meanwhile, there is a devil that resembles a devil, Leslie Neilson: "You are not authorized to announce a happy birthday!" for some reason. Finally, this strangeness is created by a guy named MST3K classic "Pod People," whose face is created after eating slug-laces salad (other easily guilty of useful, safe glasses). <br /> People are described as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic, and aggressive on a senseless scene. At the climactic stage of the film, foreigners try to burn glass that has been drained in sewage. Also, because they miss it, people will LOVE ALL THE TOWN. <br /> <br /> If you hate people and I know it, then you estimate the "Slugs". If you are an admirer of a bad movie, thank you for the "Pieces" and "Pod People" director of this crapfest. It has a bad dubbing to behave badly in bad mood, illogical dialogue, illogical sequences, shadow special effects, meaningless scenes and attention.
