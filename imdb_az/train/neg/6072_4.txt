DeNiro Master is one of my favorites. And I love good sports movies (not a lot of baseball, hey, his sports movies, right?) I was expecting more for this movie. Well, it looks like it's been okay: DeNiro is what I expect, Snipes (those who do not like me) are as good as spoiled stars. Barkin's role was good for me. He's a good actress, but that role has fallen. For me, they always seemed to hurry to the scenes and then drags a bit on the places. It just seemed to be too immature for me! Given the cast and the plot, it would be better. I called it '4' and I was very generous.
