From the uninspiring headline for the right-running, Curdled is a very valuable movie for a very long time. The film has won some fans by quentin Tarantino's name, and some of his mistakes and dragging Rodriguez / Tarantino from 'Dusk to Dawn'. They are not a big movie, and it's more than just 'curdled'. The film suffers from a lack of clear ideas and tries to disguise crimes related to events that are intended to be stylish and disturbed. The Mexican music account, which accompanies the majority of the sequences in the film, is meant to be cool, but it is very fast; especially as the lead character is Mexican, and does not fit the tone of the film. The structure of the film is unusual and it deals with a company that cleanses the scene of murder because of its strange murders. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin is not the only 'name' on the list and does not even make an impression. It was pretty much frustrating to talk about something to do in the movie and to talk to his victims and to look at the danger. Angela Jones, or rather; Pulp Fiction's taxi driver takes the lead role as a murdered obsessed young woman, and his involvement with Pulp Fiction is always clear, not his ability to act. He could have been pretty good in Tarantino's masterpiece, but he did not have the talent to make a movie with him. For the majority of the film, it was missing and out of sight and without Latino accents; he did not convince the audience to be strange at every level. Curdled forgotten debris is a hundred percent durable piece. Such films often feature self-invention or black comedy antics; but it fails at all levels. Whether you're a Tarantino fan, William Baldwin is a fan of admiration, or just a movie buff; this is kidnapping.
