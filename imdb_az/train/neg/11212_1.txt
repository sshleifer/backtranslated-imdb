<br /> <br /> The premiere of this film was fair enough, but the sub-par was just mild and boring. <br /> <br /> ALLEGATIONS The film does not work because of the nature of death, by accident, it has not been killed. Through some flashbacks there is also a mystery that brings some sort of justice into such a kind of justice. There is no sense in this movie. In the first 20 minutes or so, she called her sister and heard her message. <br /> <br /> It would be great to have some polishing and better action.
