This film has created an eternal impression. I watched him as a Freshman in High School, and that night he was alone at home. Robert Red has lost all respect for Brady Bunch as an actor who has a great admiration. And I thought Chuck Connor's role was terrible and bad. However, this film has influenced me so much that I am now a volunteer for the Sacred Surveys and Church services in women's state prison, and at the same time trying to change the lives of women. I love the fact that a small number of people really watched this movie. None of my friends watched it, and my family was not clueless so far when discussing this film because they did not see it.
