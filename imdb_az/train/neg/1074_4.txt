I should never have started this movie and watched it after 3/4. I missed the botched ending really. It would be better if this movie was a disappointment. There was a nice atmosphere, a top notch cast and director, good places. But a baaaaaad storyline, a bad script. I drew attention to Kenneth Branag's southern emphasis - it was better than a script. Land was stupid by symbols moving in unreal and incredible ways. Nobody behaves like Hollywood.
