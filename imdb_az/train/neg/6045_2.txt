This is a bad idea. The secret is interesting in the document, hidden by tips from a number of killer, but the performance of Anamorph is too slow and unattractive. There is no other way to describe the movie, except for sound. Death tips are the only interesting parts of Anamorf. Everything that connects them is weak. Willem Dafoe exhibits a reliable performance as an investigator, but has nothing to do with a script that extends beyond the scenario. Peter Stormare, James Rebhorn as craftsman, police teacher Paul Lazar, Deborah Harry, a DVD worker, is still only a character. Doubles are double lines that speak a door. Not recommended. - MERK
