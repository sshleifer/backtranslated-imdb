I did not see any comedy, it was a lot of things to do, no laugh. Okay, maybe a little giggle, like Michael Clarke Duncan's big, black, permanent gay sister. But the rest was funny, not shocked. Even if you refuse any laugh, "sketches" will last forever! Stay away from your job if you value your time and money. ADDITIONAL! The worst!!!
