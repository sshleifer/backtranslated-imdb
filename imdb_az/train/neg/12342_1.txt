Everyone who has been acquainted with my views on the Internet Movie Database knows that sometimes I can be a cunning bastard. There are so many films that I do not like, for some reason, I felt a desire to consider it. But if anyone is interested to know the name of the worst movie I've ever seen, see more than 6-5,000 in Transylvania. Undoubtedly, this is not the name of all time. 1 horrible film. Mel Brooks's Young Frankenstein's taste is clear, but it's a funny scene of this movie, according to horror film traditions, a laughing and embarrassing attempt from laughing embarrassing materials. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr are ashamed to be here in the present-day Transylvania as a couple of journalists (maybe they have been convicted in this area). <br /> <br /> Everyone who directs this film to endure the film can pray to use his heart to relieve the annoying suffering. A career for everyone involved is rare and when comedy fails greatly, it causes great fun.
