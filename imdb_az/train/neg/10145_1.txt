Steven Seagal seems to fall asleep through a scary movie almost completely close to hiding the budget and resources shortage. Silver F / A-18s and F-14s to choose from a carrier for air strikes to select technical deficiencies and turn them into a F-16 for miraculous attack - more reliable than it deserves. The most interesting thing in the film is to say that all the users of Final Cut Pro have been pushed out of a possible lightning and then missing credit names. Putting all your creativity on your credit, Michael Keuschu puts Marcel Mandu in the same category.
