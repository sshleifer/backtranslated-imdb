"Sleepwalkers" is a film written for Stephen King. Taking this into account, the excellent Santo & Johnny song, used as the theme of the film, will perform strange and ultimate vision. Unfortunately, this is not what you get. Well, they probably did a good movie. The start is interesting with the strange atmosphere of the small town. It's about a strange 20 minute movie. The movie is funny for some reason! Since then, he has been killed in all of the Sleepwalkers. For those who do this, the good old Johnny "COP CABB!" after throwing a pencil in the police's ears? But do not make me mistaken, the humor's indisputable quality. I just hired once again, was it wrong for me the first time? Man, what a waste. I do not believe they've got the Santo & Johnny songs. I gave it 2.
