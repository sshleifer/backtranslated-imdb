I was really scared of this creepy movie. An unusual dark atmosphere. And so creepy music. Really hopeful! Indeed, in ten minutes you really sweat and you worry, because you start to fear the worst. This movie has a real atmosphere of fear and worse - all this happens. In an hour and a half I am fully tired and am trying to fall asleep, but a terrific soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a horrible picture for your eyes, ears, your intelligence, and your entire wallet, because it's the biggest horror of all the money you spend on film tickets for a cheap amateur homevideo movie.
