I found this movie to be completely dissapointment. Director Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (even without the four main reasons) - the talent was completely wasted, and the result was really strange, stereotyped symbols that can not be cared for at once. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is just a tidy thing (high loyalty, appearing to gratify humor), Crystal plays just the same old hyper-active, neurotic, annoying alter-ego and Cusack just goes with its part <br /> /> For what's meant to be a "romantic comedy," there is no romanticism among the central characters, just like cheat, not just chemistry), only the moments of good, soft humor came out of Cusack's role in Grosse Pointe and scenario writer Alan His relationship with Arkin could not have conveyed any particularity. (Spoilers) Azaria was quite entertaining in a pretty entertaining shade, like a Mexican-born lover and a curious-Dogma-type director like Walken, but these parts have little time to display, and instead of Spoiler Billy Crystal smoked her accusation with a dog . Pure genius. <br /> <br /> For a great fan of most of John Cusack's work, I completely missed a movie with very good ideas to remember the rest of the fantastic game. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> at the same time does not want or do not want to explore any detail , instead of resorting to the same old-fashioned kliches and even almost 'general, teen-film' in the depths of self-less> 4/10.
