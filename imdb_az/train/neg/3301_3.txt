Today, the standard procedure for Swedish films appears to go beyond the window and continue on this path for the rest of the process. <br /> <br /> In Stockholm, banks are robbed by high-level "military style" robbery bombers. <br /> <br /> Two police officers have begun to investigate the case and will sooner or later become more challenging than ever before. <br /> <br /> Like many Swedish people, you often see people you see again. Mikael Persbrandt should be in every Swedish movie in the last few years! Persbrandt is one of the few people here (as always). The problems with this film are mostly around the story itself. At first, robbery appears to be a background. On the contrary, this is another film about the police, a young woman struggling to prove her identity in a man's world (hence, she is not made a thousand times by a decent actress instead of Sofie Heli). There is also an absolutely incredible plot close to the end of the seemingly acceptable appearance of aliens. But still half a dream I thought it was a pretty touch, as I thought above. <br /> <br /> The main problem in the end is the same thing with other Swedish films. <P style = "text-align: justify; Simply the motion and mobility are not in line with the standards used in this kind of movies (mostly Hollywood), compared to the cheapest and weakest, in my opinion, the Swedish directors they must pay much attention and now forget that they are trying to do the Hollywood Action Lights, because it's another unforgettable effort from the Swedish film industry, and I appreciate it at 3/10.
