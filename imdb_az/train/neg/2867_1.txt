I lay in bed with a really bad cold or flu or something. Maybe I would watch some of the horror movies that he bought for me a while ago. I wish I had not chosen this movie! After watching, I felt more sick and wanted to shoot. Afterwords (of course, when I'm better) I did a research on Dennis L.Rader and realized that Dennis in the movie was not real. I hope nobody watches this movie, but if you do not eat it or you feel it after the first watch. I think it would be a good time to look at Santa Claus 3. At least this movie had better ratings on this site.
