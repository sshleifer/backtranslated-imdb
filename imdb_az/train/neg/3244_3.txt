This story is very sensitive about a psychiatrist who combines with ambient artists, so I have to think of any intentions. Sets are artificial and never felt I was watching movies. The players seemed to read more lines than to answer one another. Despite the fact that the movie has noir elements in the previous movie (except it is colorful), the approach is exaggerated, and I think it's almost parody of this genre. <br /> <br /> The presentation did not appeal to me, at least I was expecting an interesting story. In general, when it comes to deception stories, I'll be slow to applaud, but you see what's going on here in the first 15 minutes. When I came up with "Gee, I forgot my 80,000 dollars", I thought that this thing was really funny. It is not beyond belief to behave so stupid for a psychiatrist who has a gambling experience. If at any stage he behaved as a normal intelligent person, the whole story would have been separated. <br /> <br /> This wooden production made me cold.
