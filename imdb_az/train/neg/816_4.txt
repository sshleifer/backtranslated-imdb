In the 1970s, WPIX, the "Superman adventures", worked for several years each week. After a while, we were receiving a treat that would push the neighboring show "Supermen and Mole Men". I was always waiting for those days. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see how bad it was to watch it lately. <br /> <br /> It was not bad because of special effects or lack of it. True, the George Reeves Superman suit was pretty bad, the edges of the foam padding used him to look more clearly to make him look more apparent. And in fact, Mole Men's suits were even worse. It would not be deceived since it was a ten-year-old sheath, because it was suitable for zippers, grooved rocks and bad costumes that were badly nourished. But that was a sinner. <br /> <br /> No, it was a bad thing. Superman did not do anything to prevent the deterioration of the situation. Looking for Lynch group creatures? If the hysterical substitute changes or look for living organisms, he tells Lois and the PR man about the dangers of the situation. Are the living things in the corner? Still, she looks and talks, but does not keep them until they're shot. Luka Benson, the city's bare noise, hits him? Although attempting to kill any targeted person, Superman re-empathizes to cause more problems. <br /> <br /> That is, both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates have played their characters well, and as you can see, they felt at ease. . Only given them to work with a better script.
