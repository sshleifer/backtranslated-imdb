This series is getting worse and worse. Written weakly and is simply funny! Mercy is good, but the writer's experience. Everyone is insulted by a very difficult attempt not to offend anyone. Now in the second season, the desperate castle has not dipped its weapons and does not come up with any laughing scripts that has appealed to the moving "Oh silly you" style. They keep their eyes on their heads and say, "Are not we rich?" Is not that funny? Yeah, not really. Sand pain is less painful. Canadians, with the exception of corner gas, are generally avoided by Canadian television. If you come to CBC, it is our leading station that demonstrates the best Canadian talent. Take these amateur clutter handles.
