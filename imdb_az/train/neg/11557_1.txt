* Land * It's Fake! Everything is fake! There are no ghosts or zombies, Alan is a Lord and he wants his cousin, his brother or his siblings or something to castle and his own name. So this is a very sophisticated and unnecessary trivial plan SCOOBY-DOO invests in Alan's attempt to commit suicide. Most of the film captures red heads and attacks them. It does not even kill them. He fell asleep and threw his daughter and thought he was burying them. When she looked at Evelyn's imaginary imagination, she said she was wearing a gloves! When is my God lost? Do not watch, rent, and buy it, regardless of whether you are buying it or not. Soon! Give yourself a blessing and stay away from the night. I give CRAP-O-LANTERN to this stinker.
