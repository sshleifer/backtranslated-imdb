Some people do not like animation. Personally, the animation is very remarkable when it is given. There are many old cartoons I just love. The problems with this movie are not animated, but rather the way they are built. Heroes are all good and run away. And for this film, they should not. As you can see, everyone in the LOTR has a grief problem (for beginners). They generally bothered me as they acted. My two sisters and most of us were laughing at this movie. I think that if many people saw it before seeing new ones, they would not go. I'm glad to rent it and did not buy it. There are a few films that give me a headache. That was one of them. However, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, though. Looks like it's there.
