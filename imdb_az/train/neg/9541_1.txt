<br /> <br /> Many people comment / comment on the IMDb's first film. Because the movie was magnificent or terrible - the last reason I write. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled for the continuation of Wargames. I thought I was thinking very well considering the time and content of the original, and I felt that it was worth the look more than once. Since 2008, she has been hoping what to do with this movie. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Since the first movie, the film has failed at pretty much every level, but I accuse everyone who has access to particular writers and games aspects . The Dead Code was a flight simulator with a few people in the 1990s. Meanwhile, Will Farmer pushes the button to run nearly 7,000 teams - none of which affects what happens on the screen. Finally, he releases a gas that instantly kills up to 20,000 virtual people (someone does not approach gas) by pressing a box on the screen with a mouse. <br /> <br /> RIPLEY (real-life war machine) says he has 5 levels in 15 minutes, a high level of terrorism. <br /> <br /> Even if any 5-16 year-olds can do the same thing, the government believes that it is a deadly threat to humanity. They say things like "Bio-Terror Knowledge" ... They have shown less information than the first three paragraphs of the Wiki on Bio-Terror. A movie-length discovery scene, which causes the excitement of any of the Bourne names, about .01% of the budget budget. <br /> <br /> There are about 1,000 opportunities to catch him and clarify the whole issue. Sometimes they repeatedly miss him. At other times, however, they are consciously creating opportunities, but only deliberately pursue it. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I would like to write more ... but I spent more than 1.5 hours doing this, and broke 1.5 hours of commercial tricks with Broderick and Joshua.
