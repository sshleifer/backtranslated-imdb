I have never understood Garbo's appeal. She always comes across her films as she stuck to this boring sound, which is not her charm, and that the tuba divorces. He was also a very good player in a better way than Gloria Swanson. In his last film, his performance is very moderate and even unreliable. <br /> <br /> In some cases, she never believed and never dropped out of place (although Melvyn Douglas is in the air of skiing scenes is really fun only). <br /> <br /> There was a potential, but in every department, the script failed to break every actor. Douglas and Garbo were in enough chemistry together, but this did not have a place on the Ninechka and I saw that it was too overrated.
