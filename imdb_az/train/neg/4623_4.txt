If you have not seen the Gong Show TV series, you will not love this movie, not very well. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give him 10 to 5, because a few things are fun to help with his obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) It was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 2) You have received a lot of funny people from the people you see on the show. 3) It is interesting to see Chuck (host) when he is not on the TV channel's identity. <br /> <strong> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: 1) Gong Show has a true TV show clips that are tired of movie length. 2) The story of a movie outside the clips is very weak and largely consists of only one point of view. <br /> <br /> Chuck truly deserves a semi-loyal actor, but most of the remaining actors have a typical way to make the best of the 1970's. <br /> <br /> She wants to watch for half an hour suddenly. Watch for 20 minutes at a time and it's not that bad. But then it is not good either. ;)
