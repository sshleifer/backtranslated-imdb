I'm not sure how this movie escapes from the MST3K anger. "Gymkata" is a funny action film filled with (or empty) paper-thin areas, terrifying characters and terrible situations. <br /> <br /> Being a spy on movements around a gymnast selected by government agents (at least I think they are government agents). His father had missed his opponent in this game, and in that way he was another government agent called The Game. Hence, the gymnast (played softly by Kurt Thomas) competes in this game, and what can happen to her missing father? <br /> Okay, though not yet, these bones do not begin to describe the joys of this movie. You can see the strange details of the movie. As the mysterious Asian girlfriend of the gymnast who does not speak in the first half of the movie, she begins to talk suddenly and does not close the rest of the time! A really bad shirtless bad guy who wants to break and break the non-existent "The Game" rules when he or she loves it. Of course, our hero has a nice story through the "The Crazies Village" (of course, the real name of the place!). <br /> <br /> This movie is actually moving scenes where it sheds light. Since the protagonist is a gymnast, the director, Gymkata master, was wise to incorporate gymnastic equipment into the back streets and the Middle East squares so as to better use gymnast skills to combat the scourge of the body. bar and pummel horses. <br /> <br /> Someone is interesting. Many things, about half the cast, die from being hit by an ax. Angles are of interest to the fact that there are only convincing influences or actions in the whole film. If this really affects me, it creates my main note to a compliment to whom I create many real arrows. More likely, this is a way of not paying the movie. However, if you look at Gymkata without paying, it deserves to look at something and look for some silence, which is an easy target for riffing. <br /> <br />
