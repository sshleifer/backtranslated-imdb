I could not watch for more than 14 minutes. This is a great combination of really bad behavior and really bad orientation. The shots used are disgusting, they always broke 180 degrees here. It's painful for my head to watch the burden of "knowing what's going on". The dirt in the "Mysterious machine" window sees light from the light in the windows ... disturbing. What else ... is so badly set up that he just wants to shout at the woman's leadership. I was only directing short films, but I'm sure it will be a better way to direct the movie .... the story is incredible, just a long French kissing scene that says it will be terrible. So pretty much, it's going to be saved for 5 dollars or for rent, and you'll never get back to 30 hours in 1 hour of life if you really try to avoid all the bad movies ...
