I've heard that this movie is more stylish than previously directed by Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch), the problem is probably too much. Basically, Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released seven years alone and gambles in two years. Jake wants Dorothy D 'Macha (Ray Liotta) who wants to take revenge against a violent casino holder sent to prison. Doctors tell Jake that they have been staying three days before a rare blood disorder, oh and Macha puts men who hit him. Credit sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) Jake demand a refund of their money, and they do some work for them. The movie is given through some flashbacks with Jake and I think it's the last three days before Zach and Avi and Macha have made a great comment. Terence Maynard played like Paul Paul, Billy Andrey Howard, Sorter as Mark Strong, Francesca Annis Lily Walker, Doreen like Anjela Lauren Smith and Rachel as Elana Binysh. The sequences that involve a bit of animation, repeating lines twice in different perspectives, the speed changes for moments, and all of these make it an irrational crime drama for the point of confusion and boredom. Very weak!
