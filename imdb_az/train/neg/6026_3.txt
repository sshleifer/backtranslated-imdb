* Review spoiler can be * predictable, camp, bad special effects. it has a movie. The idea of ​​taking the UN by Satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world according to the Bible. The premise is interesting, but its excitement has dropped. If you want to turn people into Christianity with such a movie, at least make it a quality! While watching this piece, I was seriously examining my watch. I can not say anything else since I saw this movie a year ago and it's not really a lot to say anything else in this movie ... Skip it!
