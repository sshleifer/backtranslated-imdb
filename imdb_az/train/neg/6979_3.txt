I also watched this movie, but I did a very good job, found heart failure, and I do not recommend it to women who are younger children. Train is a really heartfelt child of this mother's child. And sad - something inside is dying. Finally, he goes to the Applacian Mountains. All the money he has created in the world of baby babies hides his concern. I remember his desperate face when he pulled out of his clothes to try to heal her child. I was surprised that this film was held in Detroit because I thought the people came to Cincinnati, Ohio. This was a way for the poor of the mountains.
