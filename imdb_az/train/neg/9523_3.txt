The plot of this film is not very strong, it's a lot of holes. If you approach as a car movie, this is not a bad, a very great car. The reason I love is because I'm from where this movie is shot. Looking at the places to explore the St Cloud MN, and enjoying the city's 89th birthday, I enjoy the most. It has an interesting history for us. When a movie is filmed, everyone likes it. It is not possible to find a copy of any of the local video stores because they were all stolen after the VHS. I have to get a copy from Japan on Ebay, and I think it's interesting how the speed race will be in the whole city. I did not know he was from St.Cloud.
