The film was particularly impressive, especially when Dianne Keaton and Tom Everett Scott did not have the quality of the writing so it would not be possible for any actor or director to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> My husband and I have come to the conclusion that we were watching the whole film as a train crash, and it was not possible to turn away. Perhaps, at the end of this message, we "hope" for self-clarification, and we can give some meaning to this effort. Unfortunately, this did not happen. Of course, the audience may have guaranteed the ingenuity of the human brain to win the meaning of absurd. However, as the writers seem to find meaning, they have done nothing to ease the need for this birth. <br /> <br /> Participants simply spent their handicrafts, and any personal passion was medium or non-existent for symbols or stories. Unfortunately, films prepared for television appear over the years. Sending messages to the presenters could have been one of the main interests of the writers in the past, and now the only reason why films like Dorothy have been delivered by writers and producers, primarily to ads that continue to manipulate us.
