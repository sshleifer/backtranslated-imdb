Edvard Woodward was screaming at the movie, watching the movie. <br /> <br /> I apologize enough enough. We have Carter, the Italian Work, Alfie and it's now. What is the similarity? No. It's not a coincidence that three of the original ones, Maurice Micklewhite and other stars are a great British actor. The main ingredient of these works is the British film. They did not show the effect of Hollywood. They were quirky English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that can not be repeated in the United States. The word CULT is a better way to destroy a cult film. <br /> <br /> Spider 06 did a hard job before leaving. Wicker 73, other cult films are also more complicated; <br /> <br /> So here comes a symbol. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify" Please do not ask, the original has not been damaged in making this correction: A number of key aspects of the story need to be re-designed for modern US - communication, idolatry, and girls, but this applies to all the principles So the police complement the police with shock music flashbacks that are inexplicable for fear of a coup, and then there is no mobile phone on the island that breaks out of communication - but in the real world it does not happen, and the cops are not missing. <br /> <br /> It was just a trowel, the name change was merely a knight, almost Carry On, a community of the island, no center, There was not a city center to catch your bed, there were a few houses around a forest, and it was just no information. and Cage did not let him go away, and he locked it as you know when he went to the rabble. The scenario was all the way to the end - you just hurry and want your end. Epilogue was completely fun and did not know that time would stop. <br /> <br /> This is probably the best way to summarize the difference between the two. The most beautiful sunset ends after the most terrible day. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong>. I'm grateful that this movie will probably dump one under one path at a time when it's forgotten.
