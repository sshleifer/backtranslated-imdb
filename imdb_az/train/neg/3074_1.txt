Even such care for cocaine in 1980. Why do not you want to leave someone else's celluloid, time, effort, money, and viewers to brainwash them to this kind of action? If you're funny to make a comedy. If you want to do so, keep it for yourself. If you plan to leave as such a joke: DO NOT! I mean, was that a joke? Tell someone that this is a joke. please.
