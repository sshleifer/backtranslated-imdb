Okay ... on my day I actually saw some unusual films. When I think of the fear and hate in Las Vegas comes to mind. It's not a good thing ... when you get out of here, when someone asks me, "Hey, what's the most unusual movie you've ever seen?" What does slipstream mean? And I do not mean "unusual" in a good way. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the film it became clear that this will be one of the "triple camera effects". The flashing of images on the screen means little things like accelerating people's words and images, blurring on the screen, and keeping the flash and the flash continuously. <br /> <br /> According to the film, it is the most strange thing that people can accidentally hit people, shoot things / people, just do not feel anything. <br /> <br /> The film is a writer who begins to combine the real life with the book he writes, and you see this "trip", which goes throughout the film so that there is no better way to explain it. Personally, Johnny Depp went on a similar trip to Las Vegas, but the only difference is that his journey is not painful but fun to watch! I'm honest, I've had a really hard time even finishing Slipstream. <br /> <br /> Some cinematographers believe that this film is a few, but add a sense of dementia. Blah Blah Blah. At this point, when you watch this movie, it hurts your brain .... it gives very little meaning, even if you try and understand it remotely, and even at the end, even the only thing you can do is happiness is over ... and you can almost say that you are sitting with it !! So, if you want to see a movie in the final, repeat and repeat it by repeating and repeating "what's the heck" and an hour and 30 minutes. <Br> Dear Hopkins, I welcome you as an actor and thank you for choosing to make a knife to guide .... please do not shoot any such films. Next time, try something that is a bit more than the great storytelling, compared to the camera techniques that tend to leave the audience with a headache.
