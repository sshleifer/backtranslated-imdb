Sondra Locke is wrong in this movie, but then she was a terrific "actress". Unfortunately, he drags everyone (hereafter = his wife, Clint Eastwood, who is in real life). But what did Clint Eastwood think when he agreed to take part in this film? it can be really a story, not a story or a plot. The main thing is that you normally have a good, bad work from Eastwood. There is no movement other than a few arguments, and while I am worried, this film remains in the heap of natural sleep amplifiers Wow! Should a movie be squeezed? I can be more entertaining to watch the paint dry or to grow the meadow. .
