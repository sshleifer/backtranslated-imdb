<br /> <br /> I've seen it on Sci-Fi channel. Right after the first one. For some reason, this movie was of interest to me. <br /> <br /> WORKERS --- OK ... How strange it was to film this man! In the first film there was a reason to kill people, but there was no reason to attempt half the murder / attempt to kill. Stanley killed the directors due to creative differences, took over the writer due to creative differences, but what was he trying to kill? Casting, no film. He wanted to "look real when he died"? If it were such a high-budget movie, use special effects, MAN. Of course, as the first, the captured girl is moving away and Stanley begins to deteriorate. Woooooow (sarcasm). This film is HAD potential. And the most unhappy thing ... is a sad part ... I was watching "The Lake 3 Cabins". Just like Judd Nelson, and he's the only good part of that signal.
