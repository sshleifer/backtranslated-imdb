this movie is just one of the worst movies ever made and is not just about the English film industry, but also the incompetent rights of today's work. The film has a major player in the British actors, just as the movie's main distributor, so what's wrong? I do not know, and I just do not care enough to engage in discussions because the film was terrible, and it was not worth it. and warn the paradise away from this garbage. but it seems that I have to write 10 lines of text in this definition. A man's marriage is built from his bad friend and his father's company and thus causes the Russian mafia and terrifying habits and foolish, stupid plot corners / devices. I wanted to get my money back, but maybe I'm shocked by the experience. If you want a good criminal movie, watch the usual suspects or the father family, what do you think about the lock ... this is the summit of the modern British murder movie .....
