Cassidy (Kacia Brady) climbed his head over Neal (Jason Dibler), who was carrying his arms around his neck. Cassidy was the lead singer of a "demons and death" rock band that did not shatter his feelings of indifference to his beloved lover (you know, I can find other ways to solve this problem other than putting a bullet on your head).
