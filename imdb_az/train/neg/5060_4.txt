This film is a perfect adaptation of English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit, Richard Gere, Emran Olivier and Malikka's Lane's perfect cheating spouse. They changed the second half of the film to fit the Indian masses. <br /> <br /> Even the film actually has all the traces that are not true, but could not keep up with the original. Mallika was the cheapest porno of Bollywood lovers, who were more than just a dancer to show. Emran played more role in such roles and was even nicknamed as a serial killer. If Indian filmmakers are planning to re-create an English movie in the future, they should look into the area with Indian censorship. Although the film was bombed in the box office, the actors were unusually well-known. In the future, filmmakers should be a bit more careful in re-designating the Oscars. <br /> <br /> Be careful not to look at the family movie, but to look at the family at home.
