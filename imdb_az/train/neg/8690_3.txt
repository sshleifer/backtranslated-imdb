Everyone who joins (and the audience) must look for "Candidate" to see how good this movie is. What happened to the South American story? Julie Christie and Kate Capshau were keen to allow their roles to be cut off. So far, I liked every Gene Hackman's performance and / or film. He was either uninterested (I do not believe in) or was terribly destroyed. I liked and defended Richard Gere (and I'm sorry for that). But here there was no power. It was never intimidating and only occasionally convincing. All this made me very disappointed. I really expected more from this filmmaker. If you can not find the "Candidate," you can still "watch it down" or watch "Bulworth".
