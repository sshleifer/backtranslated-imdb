Curiosity brought me this "masterpiece." Unfortunately, I did not rent it, bought it! The worst thing about this movie is that it does not bother you. Only for these reasons, the creators of this film have begun to show the human side of Jeffrey Dahmer. You are joking? The guy gave a new meaning to the term finger lickin "good"! The story with all flash-back and flash-forward was the following: all of Jeremy Renner's performance was not bad, you can hold him in SWAT, In any case, I estimate it as 1/10. There is only one single because of Renner's so-so performance, there are many books and television documentaries that work better than cover Dahmer's offenses.
