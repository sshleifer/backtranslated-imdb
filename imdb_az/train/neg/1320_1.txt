This was the first time I was reading the cast. Perhaps, if I had written a more exciting field, it was unfortunately left to a monkeys package. Alberto Tomba was definitely a good skier, but he should thank God (and we) for not having to rely on the actor's ability to win. She can not play, she can not talk, she can not move much better than her ... Michelle Hunziker is a beautiful blonde girl and that's all. Certainly, in his dramatic roles, however, he has probably not been selected for his stunning skills for his beautiful legs. Nevertheless, I must admit that Tomba could be a teacher, because she is even worse, and it is funny, especially if it is not Italian. I always laughed at watching this movie. I found it to be very funny and meaningless, it really made me laugh, loud, and very loud.
