True Mercurio's incoherent drill was completely wasted. On Thursday, perhaps one minute in a local movie was released, and besides me, all four of Sidney's people had not been filmed. BACK OF BEYOND is a project by a manufacturer looking for a product. Local actors such as John Polson and Terri Serio are better off (good Polson SWIMFAN and HIDE and SEEK as the direct excitement director) and Terry Serio did not get any guernsey except strange roles. But Paul Mercurio should be Australia's largest export. Such roles are great disappointment, and such films are just talent and time consuming.
