I bought the Superman 1's 4-disc special edition for about $ 5. Additional material includes the 1951 Superman and Mole-Men feature. <br /> <br /> I did not have some initial disappointment, and I thought I had written it as one of Kirk's Alyn's works. . <br/> <br /> <br /> - I did not see this job. <br /> <br /> - I have been less than an hour so far. Although IMDb was originally filmed before the movie's first television series, Reeves's series of television series featured a couple of episodes for a couple of parter-like cinemas. In any case, it's a strange choice for the reasons I will get in the future. I have an age when I remember television and film production restricting one or two places, so there's no big surprise here. For some budgetary films this is a pretty low budget. <br /> <br /> This story is about 1,430 residents of the world's largest oil wells, Silsby. 6 mph). The story opens with wells trapped in the well to approach the well. This Metropolis correspondent opposes the report on the well by Kent and Lane's oil company. Clark finds out that only a few single children (small size, large, lid black and brown) come out when discovering that the drill is a six-kilometer radioactive cave <br /> <br /> <br /> < Now, deep breath is the rest of the picture. Little children are scared of some children, as Jeff Corey (who plays the ugly xenophobic city) drives a palsy to kill this "living thing". Superman (moderate ineffective) takes steps and takes one of the small children who are taken and taken to a local hospital. Corey's pals believe that the other little man is hiding and killing him, but he runs and falls down the legs. Corey instigates a lynx gang for hanging Mole Mani in the hospital (despite the sheriff's arrest). Superman suspends them from entering the hospital and shooting a wounded witness back to his partners. A total of four Mole-Men, Jeff Corey, is shot with a gun (this is a Aargh! I say the gun because its only effect is to make Corey "Aargh") and Superman rescues it. Experts immediately change their ways because they are surprised at the Superman who rescues him after his behavior, and mole-men turn from the mild. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the film lasted only an hour, there is something that creeps around, beware and continue - from all the "Mole-Man 1" reptiles A to B - looking to make sure no one is following him. Mole-Men is in no way involved - they do not have any dialogues - they are just turning, oppressing and returning. <br /> <br /> Revers is a very good Clark Kent - a very afflicted journalist, much less than the Phyllis Coates, Lois Lane. But a terrible, terrible Superman. It does not just look at it (at least its hair is black, it's engaged in many sports in television episodes), and it's wrong in my book as it plays. I am sure that they say "posing" (SÃ¼derman always works), but someone told him that there should be a slap on the rib, and that there is no slack on the ribs. <br /> <br /> And he plays Supermen as a pretty hard and touchy school teacher - he does not actually play his finger in the equal, but he can do it. <br /> <br /> And I say a huge amount of money around the Superman around - it's actually nothing) and runs up a bit. He goes on a number of occasions and creates the land but does not appear at any point in the flight. Oh, some bullets turn it off, and she uses a telescopic look like Clark, but has no accompanying visual effects. In fact, visual effects are noteworthy with their absence, and those that are so far are not very good. <br /> <br /> I tried to review these efforts by referring to their time standards. According to these standards, I think this is a pretty weak effort. <br /> <br /> The production standards in the television series were higher, and at least they had difficulty with stories that were a little bit more. <br /> <br /> One of the disappointing things - I'll never follow.
