<br /> <br /> I decided to check the hell of the Aztec Rex (as it was billed). <br /> <br /> If the impact of the dinosaurs was convincing, the story could have played better. They really seemed to be animation (rough designs used by artists to finish CGI effects, more detailed information, smooth movements, etc.), which are probably inadequate dinosaurs, probably a return Factor was Ayacoatl's favorite Dichen Lachman. He showed interest in me; <br /> <br /> Some budget ramps have been removed and some convincing dinosaurs could be used. <br /> <br /> Disappointment. At least the cast and crew made a free trip to Hawaii where the film was shot.
