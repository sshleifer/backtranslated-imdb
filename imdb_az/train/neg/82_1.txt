This movie sucked. It was a loss of my life. He did not imagine, the surface was not entirely impressive. A long, long story short, these people are "terrorized" by this miserable "terrible murderer", but they are not completely returned. And this is after visiting a camping trip, taking a bunch of non-committles and appearing in a campshed with food and clothes and girls headphones and a fully assembled camp. In addition, after the boat is missing, they are scared because they are jammed in the woods, but then the girl's comrades come out and, as you can see, they can leave the forest as they go. As I said, this movie is also good. It's a joke. Do not let your girlfriend watch her.
