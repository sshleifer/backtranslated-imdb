H.B. Halicki's classic seventies discovery film is just awesome. Together with Vanishing Point, 60 seconds have passed, representing films that follow quintessence cars. Reconstruction gets its originality and stops its head. Halicki gave us 75% car acceleration and 25% support drama, in GISS 2000 we get 25% car chase and 75% supporting drama. Cage, like a super man, rescues his brother, kisses his daughter. MTV adjustments, tits and ass. Rent your original, rent the original. At least Halicki did not live to see his baby (wrote, produced, directed, and played in '74'), so it worsened.
