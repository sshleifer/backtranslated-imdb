With the coronary who wants to close the girl's eyes, we see the body of the dead girl in the morgue, but no matter what happens, she will not be left open. After that, we moved to the future and follow a group of old school friends hiding a terrible secret, but suddenly they begin to be taken one by one suddenly. Through the Flashbacks, we learn from this terrible suicide of a shy girl who wants to be one of the group, but they have discovered the past and discovered some strange incidents, because she closed them. So, is he coming back from the graveyard who wants revenge? <br /> <br /> Oh, what a great and always dangerous story! Yes, I can say I hope. And it was as good as there was "hope". This is an unforgettable, so-called supernatural horror that I've really followed before, but I thought it was my first look. I was surprised when I started to work on some things, but I just said it was a very memorable blend as it was seen at first glance. "Nightmare" is just another kind that adds a few "change" changes. Oh, give me a little newer, it's not completely original, but it's a formula. <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> Older, the same old story and shakes.This kind of creepy and poppy visuals showcases when entertains.I deaths are stained and displayed in a variety of originality, though the matte atmosphere the audience is a liar with its murky lighting. The scene that covers the soul of one of the girls is a fratricidal experience, but when you are not really trying to shock it .. I found the coma movement and thought to look a little bit. It did not move anywhere between the shock. You can say that the probable secret is not really so much, because the story is not true, and the heroes are a self-confident group that does not really care what's happening. The imaginary story had to pay more attention to the spirit that more than these mild symbols, which have group relationships. It's just plain ridiculous when it's just when it's going on a ride, taking too tense and too long, overplayed cards. <br /> <br /> The film's shooting is extremely loud, though the film is amazing, although it may be involved in rapid firefighting, and the music ballet was a little bit tougher in the play. <br /> <br /> <strong> Gyu-ri Kim has a leading role. <br /> <br /> This is not a new thing and stealing embarrassing ideas, but if you look at the past, it brings some bad emotions. Although, despite the adverse effects of vibrations, I found that instead of lethargy. As I said, a standard effort, but still can be missed the same.
