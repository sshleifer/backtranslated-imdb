This happiness was only good, but the rest was bad. That is, the puppet came in and even tried to digitize the film and became even worse! Normally I would like a low-budget movie, but it was just a waste of time and almost wanted to return the set to me. I have about sixteen budget films, and I see them as 6-8 films, and all of them are a bad movie. Also using horrific plastic machetes that do not even look like a real, they can use one that looks a little bit realistic, so keep the time and money and watch it horrorible movie.
