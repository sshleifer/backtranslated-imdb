Camera Case - Why is Camera so busy in this movie? It's boring and disturbing. Editing - burns of photo shots were very short. Most other scenes were too short. It only flashes. Sound - background music was very loud and surrounded by sounds. There is no need to retreat and repeat it to capture the above. No one checks these things and forces them to repeat. Reduce background music volume in the future. Editing the relative sound levels of Julia Wong's editor? The site had many empty spots. There was a key story potential. I think the film needs more work. Did this escape? Maybe they fled. It looks like many cinema, it started in a great way, but it stretched to the end. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, it has turned into one of the many countries so far. .
