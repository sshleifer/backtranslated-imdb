There are two types of music in the 1950s. First of all, there are brilliant MGM production with great names and great music. There is then a small league with fewer known players, less popular music, and second-rate director. "The girl can not help her" belongs to the last category. Even Tom Ewell or Edmond O'Brien was not popular and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her ... well, never mind. Each decade has a share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. Since the line itself looks subtle and can not help doubting that a Fats Domino, Little Richard or the 1950s rock moves appearing in the film attempt to sell notes to others. If this music appeals to you, it is also valuable. If not, do not worry.
