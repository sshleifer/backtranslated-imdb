Okay, this movie is in f * ck rules. no questions arise, the most contemporary cinematic pieces. absolutely terrible, but you will see GOTTA. Take that lease with your friends and have a drinking game or have fun, it's not funny. like rear windows, you can do everything with paper tiles and finger paint. awesome Okay, rent for only one scene: two characters actually take about 3 minutes to land. The director (in the commentary) says: "Yes, watching looked pretty smooth ...". Yes, the right guy, they are totally in the vicinity. it's so funny.
