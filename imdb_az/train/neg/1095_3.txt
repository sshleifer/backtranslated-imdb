I watched it several days ago, so the details are laughing. The film is filmed in hand-made and many studio pictures have been released before being done. I do not feel that the things we see on the screen are more cunning and more "realistic" than to think that it does not have all the compromises that come with a big budget. "But what we're here is much better than the first half of the Full Metal Jacket not one of any of the other or any of the other ones that I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> My main problem is that with my heart's painless children, deep harmony, short-term odors, coffeehouses, tired sergeants in the world, wobbled psychos and so on ... everything is at the same time the type of situations that will give you the most friction and tension.I maybe it was intentional to emphasize the foolishness and injustice of this situation, perhaps it was a decline, or maybe the largest auditory It was a romantic thing that only the scenes were really playing between the two main characters, although the volunteers and the genocide were mixed (normally all the characters would have to deal with the situation). This seems to be a major part of the plot, and volunteers give their feelings and weight to the task and self-esteem, but all are compulsory and freely exercised. Other mistakes that come to my head are, first of all, with threats of aggression and violence, with immediate return when faced with Farrell's comprehensive stoicism, and all of these, all the heroes (except for any psychos and real softness) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In my opinion Bozz, Tour, and watching the 4 episodes for my money would have been much more entertaining.
