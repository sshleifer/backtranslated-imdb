How it was built with the budget of about $ 70 million and goes beyond me without repeating it. This story and dialogue is amateurish. Characters say that no one tells anything and almost never reacts to what has been said earlier. No one will ever fall into the real world. Given that the writings are such a thing, the potential for mobility is good ... but several actors supporting roles really drive down their production. Hero's hair probably should have taken her credit, which was very strange ... Do not say that she does not have one of the best performances on the pic. Finally, for a film surrounded by giant reptiles by L.A, this film is shockingly boring. What a shame! If you see this, your mind will always compete, thinking about ways to get SFX scenes, and we've set up a better movie. Unfortunately, there was not much.
