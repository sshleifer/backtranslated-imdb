I would not really comment, but then I had something to say. I have seen this movie two days ago and although it has not been spent full time (even for producers it can be money), it has serious problems. There are really good cinematography and (little) nice music. Much has been said about Cristina Oliveira, but let's be honest, why? She is not an actress permanently posing as a very active and acting actress. His performance goes well, because no other film has ever been like Odete: crazy? sad? childhood? a prosecutor? no one knows. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a good example of the problem that the Portuguese films have made: soundtrack. There is a permanent NO for the Dubbing and this is the usual noise book, which ultimately turns out to be blue. People in other countries may think Portugal is the most silent in the world. In some cases, I was excited, part of the dialogue was dubbed, but it did not necessarily resolve the syndrome. And, of course, should be bad dubbing. It's strange to watch a movie that's the first thing I've ever heard on the first stage I talked to on the stage: it's dubbed. All this is to say that the film is a technical problem. <br /> <br /> This also has script problems. She wants to be classic from the first to the last scene. That is what stopped things, and it shows that there was a terrible fear. The writer, of course, tried to correct everything, but ... but it shows! All dialogue is very profitable, and there is no single piece of speech that is called a line of a movie. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that the film is a mess. <br /> <br /> <strong> It's a disrespect to people living in the Caucasus. All shooting is classic and non-innovative, but beautiful. Rui Poachas is a great job. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> Now, I think, this story protects people from believing in this story and laughs at the film: The man who plays DIES clearly is not an actor. In fact, this is a very important role, and I can not see what these kinds of actors are for. This man is neither an actor nor a good person. Here is the whole movie falling into the mountains, so we see that a great woman does not believe in a matter of seconds, and that the hunter who lives in is a bad time spent in harm's way, we see that this character is apathy. Very bad. The world is full of wonderful people who are going to become even beautiful charming lovers. There are good men in the world, and they are full of good actors who are able to make obsessions to people after they leave. The world is full of great films as well as great films. C'est la vie!
