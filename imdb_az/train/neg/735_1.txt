Five-year-old Michael, despite his mother's murder, was killed by Highwayman, the father of a suicide bomber "Suicide". "Twenty years later, Mike grows up" (Gordon Currie from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invites his seven darling grandfather and father to "manage their own fears" at a Halloween night suits party. Morty, a lifelong wooden puppet kept by a Indian worker in the attic, has the soul of the deceased father and kills them using their phobias. The characters are thrown into a window, drown in a toilet, eat rats, exploded, and so on. The morphs inside the father and the tree travel around and create stupid intelligence. The Morty design is good and Betsy Palmer (from Ms. Voorhees), after finding a diced and stuffy woman in a woman cardboard box, the characters remain at home, cheerful, strange, and sex. genuine Friday 13th), but it's more illogical and confusing than the original, and it's full of fraudulent fear, bad behavior, brain dead heroes, repetitive and frustrating camera work. Moreover, only two minority symbols (Indian and half black girls) are the first to die. BLAH!
