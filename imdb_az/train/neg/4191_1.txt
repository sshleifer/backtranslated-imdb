I've seen a lot of horror in my time, all of them foolishly bad, but nobody can reach the depth of that garbage dump. This movie made me angry and frustrated because I was looking at me because I was trying to turn my head into this song exactly. Now, after seeing it, I understand that some kind of thing - and why, but the film itself is a bad thing when you watch it. Yes, ordinary scenes of violence, symbols have a liner inside the foolishness ("Shose belongs to me ... ME!") And enough of us "dissatisfied" "but I still feel this movie alone, and you were in a box at the edge of the road.
