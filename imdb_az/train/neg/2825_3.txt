This week I would only think it would be entertaining to catch up with Corey Haim, just last week, and both of them have seen the "Lost Boys". <br /> <br /> That's why I've filmed three films for myself that I've made for myself. Unfortunately, I chose "Dream Machine" for the first time, and it was very scary, and I decided to hide Corey and before it had popped up anything else before. But first he was able to fight with me through this film. I was playing in the same league as "Ferris Bueller Day Off" (1986), but they were captured in their own hypothesis. He wants to be a tension in desperation when it comes to a movie that actually wants to be a comedy. The only good thing about Dream Machine is the dead body: a dead body in a Porsche luggage. All the rest will not worsen, embarrassing. Even the most for Haim. You can give him a young, enthusiastic self-esteem, but at least with some guidelines. This is not clear in Dream Machine. So, we have a perfect car, yes, the black Porsche. Haim's perfect lover? Only a blonde chick that draws any line in the movie. The perfect murder ... almost? Some friends who are flat on their donkey because the film is a liar can not succeed in actually pulling the entire movie to get out of the baggage, and then Michael Myers (minus White William Shatner mask) and mistakes for Jamie Lee Curtis for Corey Haim. When they try, do not think this flick can make any lamer. A fool, an unusual movie, a director who does not know how to handle his leadership with a story that does not bring it anywhere. Great achievement! <br /> <br /> One last question for Mr. Haim: Who is the idea to smile directly to the camera at the latest filming? You or your director? That is not done.
