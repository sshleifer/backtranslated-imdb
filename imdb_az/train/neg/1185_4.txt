Another change and improvisation in the fairy tales of celebrities and loved ones, La Bete (1975) is trying to imagine that The Beast (very graphic and sensitive and disturbed, but in fact can be very clever and funny) is really the beauty and the animal? I'm talking about many reviews and comments that appear to be too deep for this movie. I will not go so far, saying that Catholic religion is a serious and gloomy study of issues such as frustration, longing, fulfillment or satirical criticism. I would say such a horror-erotic movie. <br /> <br /> Although the Aristocratic young man has a lot of mistakes in the long (long way) scenario, parody is more common in all the genres that are touching or reminiscent of each other. The most terrible, but most laughable I've ever seen with a woman and a really impressive movie ... well-defined anatomy, Scarlatti, and keyboardist music are hysterical. My husband and I both laughed at the exaggerated details of the match. Moral morale - beauty can defeat the monster. Question - Who is the target audiences of the film? For an erotic picture, this is very accurate; For a film of art - there are many jokes in this brave madness, and I want to say the sharp end. IMO did not mean that the creator of the film would be a serious drama. Like a craft house / horror / parody of eroticism, it is funny and of course original. Do not try to find a good smile and a deep sense. This story of strange beauties and strange animals is, of course, not recommended to meet with children. The opening scene, which can shock a spectator who is not prepared more than an unprecedented scene scene, can be successfully used in Discovery channel as "Animal World - mating habits and rituals of horses."
