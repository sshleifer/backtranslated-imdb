When a movie such as "Duke of Dukes" exceeds $ 75 million, it makes a very sad statement about the state of our society. <br /> <br /> According to Hollywood, according to Hollywood, if good movies go out, people will see everything because nothing is on the screen. That's it. I went for a free movie though. Dialogue could not be a dialogue. Sticks could not have been more upscale and ugly. Perhaps this "great big" imya applies to Texans, but has not appealed to me and to anyone in the theater. Except for Burt Reynolds, none of the "big names" were a flick that ended this career. Jessica Simpson - do not make me laugh. <br /> <br /> Even if you're hopeless, I will not even recommend this movie for the video. It is better to deceive the public and earn enough money after the day's opening. Despite warnings from the people, they did not do it. Stupidity increases.
