I usually do not comment, but there are things to say. What to start? <br /> <br /> Jeremy was the hero of the moving player in London! I did not think it could be so bad. The field could be good, well managed, and had a good performance from the main actor. Unfortunately, this is one of the movies you are reading and you think it has great potential to entertain, but it is disappointing at first. <br /> Of course, at least I have good laughs. I did not waste my time.
