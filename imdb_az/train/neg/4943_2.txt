I watched Caveman's 3 episodes, and I did not know if something else was going to happen except perhaps waiting for it to be better. <br /> <br /> This show is just about self-advertisement, no real humor. <br /> <br /> We are talking about what happens when we sit on this show. <br /> <br /> Women's cave-woman attitude was really great, yeah. <br /> <br /> I consider myself to be a very good theoretician, but I must say that Cavemen resembles one another. old show, mom, car. I give her two coins because they are better than 1 because they really spend money.
