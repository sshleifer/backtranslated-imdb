I rent this movie one month ago when I did nothing else. It's all about 'TRASH' to describe this unusual movie. The player has a very bad job. I've done a better job in the high school kids. You read all the casting lines, there is no feeling, no sense. and there is no place to catch the viewer. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR @ <br /> <br /> The clown itself does not look like anything in the video cover. Until the end, he does not seem to be in the movie and he sings all of it and goes around looking at a few symbols. I have never seen a real murder movie or a real murder since it has not been shown. I questioned a few things. "Serial Insane Clown Killer" is a killer of killers, not the killers clowns? 2. If your friend is missing, why not go to the woods to deal with sex rather than meet him? <br /> <br /> Why is REAL acting just over suddenly? Did the bulk finally decide to do the job? This movie is so sad that they are coming. My advice is not to waste your time laughing more than an hour or two.
