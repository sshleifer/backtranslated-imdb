One of the central symbols closest to the last stage of Baby Mama is to describe the main picture of everything that has come before and summarize that 'all of this is a mess'; I really can not say better than that. The feature has now and once again a recurring hope, but vast majority of the survivors are running too far to be worthy of being worthy of the time. Silent casting, spectacular scripts and uncertain cartoon characters make sure that Baby Mama does not pay taxes, but it does not come with a sense of humor. Basically, the film, which consists of numerous clich√© jokes, which are contradictory to a pair of rich (rich and poor) couples trying to live with each other, are very ezoteric to give smile beyond the very delicate demographics. <br /> <br /> As a story of love, it's not bad, but it's particularly vulnerable to character, as it's some kind of side-story to work alongside a single-comedian-oriented tangent, eventually a warm romance without bubbles . Like the characters themselves, both central figures are somewhat fun when put together in smaller places, but often emptied when they leave alone and burn their gaps; Finally, when it comes to finding interconnected relationships with each other, the comedy is never at the edge of the faraway; we do not feel the characters and are not naturally interested in them, but we do not find their dynamics. Unfortunately, this dynamic is at least the best or best of the individual, as it is shown above, although rarely is the typical boundaries of a single pair formula. <br /> <br /> Kate (Tina Fey) Angie is a successful businesswoman who puts the working class into a business lady Angie (Amy Poehler) and decided to leave Angie's desperate husband Carl (Dax Shepard) then, secondly, the differences. Yes, it's a typical single-minded idea, and we've seen what happened in Vegas this year, yet Baby Mama proves to be chemistry between the performers of the film and the half-story symbols. Both Kate and Angie, both of them, do not show much of a personality other than two-dimensional contours, and both executive chemistry play a role that requires a fine air. In fact, the movie comes from Romany Malco's unfounded talents, which is lumbered only by a real attractive performance and character, a goalkeeper. <br /> <br /> Some creatures, most of this defeat, have been dropped by this person, and the rest of the creatures have generally dropped to Shepard. Of course, director Michael McCullers is still quite effective on the page as he directs the director to his world and through the camera. But it's definitely not a good thing for babies, a movie of over $ million, and a culture of cardiology. Baby Mama is a classic A-da, a plastic, all-weather-city with sugar. So, because of their two-dimensional nature, I did not emotionally sympathize with the characters, but I simply did not care about the world they live in. Dialogue, pastel blues and pink, with sound, suits and scenarios, have been painted, with all the shadows of humanity being constantly in dire need of the director to feel that the filmmaker feels a bewitching fantasy; These are not symbols and our world is not in any way? so why care? At the end of the day, the success or failure of a romantic comedy is completely reduced to chemistry among his love interests and the frequency of laughter; Baby Mama goes to any of these departments. Of course, it would be unfair that the film had no value. I'm convinced that in a similar ship like Kate's lead character, female audiences may get a slight hit from the trial, but everyone is likely to be unhappy and likely to be bored. From this point of view, Baby Mama avoids uncompromisingness, but is never convinced of the fact that it is not worth paying attention to anyone outside of the audience directly; <br /> <br /> - Reviewed by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net). <br /> <br /> Baby Mama is very light to be interesting and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> - Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)
