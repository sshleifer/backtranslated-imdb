This film depicts the experiences of several cunning men (Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two dragged queens in Miami overnight. The closing stories bring together all the people at one place and in the end. The movie was gentle fun, but the big problem came to the point where everything was happening at night and that many scenes could not be fully understood. On several scenes, you can actually see where they are trying to "extend" the development process to keep the images. Someone was unable to handle a movie camera. It is surprising that this movie was even released!
