<br /> <br /> This version can not compete in any version of 1995. As I watched this, I was not happy as Captain Ciaran Hinds when I read the book Wentworth and Rupert Penry-Jones, and I thought more like the Captain I imagined. And he was. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is the only indisputable quality of the film. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliot would not have crossed the streets of Hamam in a similar way. She was not his character and was not alone by a lady of that era. The book was Anne Elliot, a lady who was worthy of the woman. There are other painful anaconos, but it was the worst. <br /> <br /> There are 3 important circulations in the book, although it warns those who know the book, which is another important part of the book <br /> <br /> And if this version is not shorter than the other, feel everything sad is. Little attention has been paid to presenting symbols, showing their ideas and motives. Significant scenes were thrown. How can they be able to kill the last scenes in this way? Disaster! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> align: justify; If you love Austen, do not waste it over this time.
