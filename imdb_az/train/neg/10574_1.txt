This season, except for FAMILY, is worse than the first season. I can not think of what I think. As an admirer of horror, we can withstand many eyes and foolish confusions, but this series gets worse every time. I do not think the actors and the crew should be too hard to close this jacket to work every day. Story! Do you have many questions? CANCER! How can it be said that in these stories about the fate of everyone? If you do not, do you have to wake up or worry about it? Almost every episode leads to total shock or an hour of bloodshed, without any sense or outcome, by giving unwise blood. Even the efforts of Dante this season have also led to some sexual violence and the point has not yielded any results. Instead, production values ​​and performance are moving rapidly, and the content is completely bent. Exec Manufacturers have great hopes for Garrisin VALARIE STAIRS, but we'll see.
