This is not a movie. This mini-DV camcorder is a collection of inaccurate, misleading, and poorly packed scenes similar to the 10-year-old unmatched results. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In fact, I have a theory that a very elegant girl in the train corridor - fat-haired, with dead panic, ipod and nervous t-shirt - probably> If you extend beyond ten minutes, do not try to fit the context of the European Artist's mentality above what you see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ridiculous part is an endless series of vacuum-filled characters, <br /> <br /> What's next? Eight directors signal at Wal-Mart snack bar?
