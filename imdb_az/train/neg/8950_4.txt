I have heard this novel a long time ago, and most of my friends recommend reading it. I searched it everywhere and finally found it. This is a book that everyone should read, because it is thanks to his genius and his vision. <br /> <br /> I knew about the movie and did not expect to see it. Finally, when I'm finally disappointed, most of the book is not in the movie, but in the movie that makes the movie unreasonable (I do not think it's a spoiler) ... Michael Radford may be a good manager, but a bad writer. Especially as the application of the book. The film is not dark at all, the writing is really bad, good, and even great, it's just an actor. John Hurt is an incredible actor and I'll only see it as Winston Smith. <br /> <br /> This IMDb, which is most disturbed by me, is the people who read this book, The Best Compatibility Ever !! Or know something about screen writing! <br /> <br /> Do not think this alternative as you can only grasp the story's glimpse by reading a book. <br /> <br /> The points I give for this movie come from acting.
