You only had to write a liner, but really. I love the gangster genre, and this is the weakest I've seen in recent years. Except for the most important scenario, I would like to thank everyone who works for the majority. This is a weak story about a small criminal. There is no substitute or black-and-white film style. I've heard Kevin Spacey love and do another movie about the general. My advice is not worth the time.
