Unfortunately, realism is very boring. I thought this movie would never end, it would have been better if all the characters were nuked within the first five minutes. Where is Blade when she needs her? Though terrible as nightmarish like COMBAT SHOCK, REQUIEM for A DREAM, and BOISE MOI, dead creatures are not as entertaining as the little ones mentioned above. Although genuine cannibalism wannabe can move a little faster on the heart of Jeffery Dalmers, it is not as exciting as about RAVENOUS. Indeed, I was curious as the infomercials day and night and found it interesting as a walk to the dental story. If you have strong masochistic features, on the contrary, you can resist anyone. I was really surprised by the fact that this statement was harmful by a person, because it was the quality of the Dead Animals.
