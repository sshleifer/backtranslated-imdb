I watched this movie on DVD last night and decided to review it this morning. As you can see, "I, Robot" here polarized the critical review community on the IMDb (and caused a lot of insults and challenges). <br /> <br /> I see it as a little surprising. The movie is not great (even good), but not terribly (even really bad). What is this movie really? The US filmmaker believes he is ready to prepare insipidas, he has re-heated the clich√© and liked them for a great new job. Like the retread, written on every side of this film, Smitin's character (clever clever cynic with a backbone of titanium), plot line (Asimov and modern daytime style movement) "I, Robot", is probably the perfect motion movie for today's audience: superficial plot, insipidly snappy dialogue and many and many adrenaline. Smith is mediocre, but we knew that Hollywood's unsuccessful attempts to create a black Bruce Willis. In the story there are many holes in each size, but I do not think that the majority of people involved in this film are critical enough to bring them to the attention. Perhaps, according to today's standards, block-shouting, but many B-movies are compared with the owners of the truth.
