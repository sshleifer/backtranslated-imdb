It was time to watch this movie. I do not think science fiction. A good job can be done in any genre, because I do not reject any genre. This movie is not a good job. It is not possible to blame the visions (unless it attracts external makeup) and special effects are effective. This story was not BAD-out-out for the trekkish comic book. But fx visuals were where all the makers' attention / attention / money went. The changing direction of change and turmoil (one did not know exactly who did what at least in one important part and what he did). The "operation" was really bad. Along with a portion of the hardest readings, "It was part of the page and the director told me that he was mad / sad / afraid / OK, it was a SF series pilot, an excuse for transparency in areas that are important to a dramatic environment Am I surprised by the pilot that sold this array, or money in the hands of the technician?
