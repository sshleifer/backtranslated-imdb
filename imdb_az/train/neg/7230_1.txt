I love science fiction, I love the Egyptian mythology and I appreciate digital animation. I thought it would be a pleasure to have a movie that combines these three. I could not be more mistaken: the story (in fact, the fact that it was not actually) was absolutely indestructible and not imagined - imagination is usually the biggest component of any science fiction story. Dialogue and player are worse than average porn movies. In particular, Thomas Kretschmann gives a new meaning to the term "bad performance." If only the "educator" did not take it seriously, it would not be a big problem to act badly; all poems sound like it should be poetry; Bilal really thinks of doing art work here. Yes, there is no art or poem in this lane, it's just ambitious! This man should really be funny, because the director fails in all possible accounts. The worst of all is the horrible digital animation that is really ugly that turns it into a film that has been watched with a physically painful experience. The graphics look so fake, even fake players resemble live actors in Van Helsing! And since the half symbols are CGI-animated, CGI effects are a fake problem. Even though Egyptian gods are really dead, Bilal will receive a horrific revenge because they will not have any doubt about him in a sad film.
