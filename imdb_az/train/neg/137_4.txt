Scary Movie Poses to see creators found it easy to spoof these "teen slasher" movies. They are incredibly formulaable. If Valentine had been released a year ago or earlier, I would have been spoofing this movie, sure that if they found the actual original material that distinguishes them, I know what you did last summer and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentines offer something new in this genre, better than ordinary ends, of course, inevitable then puts many rooms. As usual, a masked psychotic killer concealed a group of beautiful young women, who killed their main character in one of the most common ways. <br /> <br /> I will not be able to stop such films about who they are "who carries out"? They accept the form. '. Certainly, they are not the reason, because the absolute truth is that the only killer was born directly and whose friends were killed. Never in the film is never something that is unclear (for example, the fianc√©e of the mother's uncle's uncle's mother thrown the dog's father's dog). All along the film still survivors are 'suspicious', but more than the suspects are 'Red Herrings'. <br /> <br /> Once the Valentine has been persecuted in this form, the main character, as we know at this point, is an incredible run-up and kills a dislocated psychic killer after motivation has emerged. *************** SPOILER !!!!!! (anyway, mini spoiler) *************** Even though the valentine's motive does not emerge, it is more likely to think that the movie's the typical "teen slash" path is only part of it and the leading killer the goal may be or may not be fulfilled by bloodshed and almost everyone's killing. <br /> <br /> This still did not give a good movie to the Valentines, instead of simply getting rid of the evil as usual, and still not counting I would like to ask those who are thinking of filming these lines, and authenticity is very important and it's hard to see the originality of this genre.
