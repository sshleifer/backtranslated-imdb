Once there was a director named James. He brought wonderful, exciting science fiction like the Terminator and the Aliens. These films were made of blockbusters in the squad and they looked at the computer to create a fantastic future in front of the movie industry because it created special effects. The Terminator 2 showed that what was possible in this new era. <br /> ....... and then happened ................ ... 1997 ........ numerous awards ..... ..... Ambitious amount of money ............... crazy dam of advertising ...... <br /> <br /> The Titanic was here! <br /> <br /> I have never been united in any way, In fact, I often used the majority of the opposite, but there was only one argument. The movie "The Titanic" was just a positivist - a movie that Kate Winslett was absolutely funny! <br /> <br /> Soon, the dialogue was something like the Beverly Hills 90210, the player was more wooden. The frightened images in my brother's tree house were really funny (falling from the boat and slamming into the staircase), lying historically (even my it was a strange theme music) and the story of a delusional love was so tedious that he did not respect the difficult situation of everyone who was self-destructive and miserable (he was glad and disappointed when I died). <br /> <br /> It is clear from the words that this is a photo of MTV, bubblegum chewing, car-boy boy, teenage girls (DeCaprio looks like something less heroic than a gang of a boy's group). then glide half an hour hoping to be lucky! The worst thing was that he stopped at that point. Millions down, cultural dreams have gone to see this attractive waste of money, because "they need a great deal" and "Steve and Barbara said they were good and knew their films." <br /> <br /> The Titanic, the Academy Award-winning merchant fame, swept the boards. King James of Hollywood fell into a serious moment of silence for the deadly night in which the three-hour-long half-hour Persian was set up. He looked at me as he prayed for forgiveness after a pardon without mistakenly describing the circumstances that led to the death of many people. <br /> <br /> However, if people are fool enough and are in syndication to buy such garbage, they are worth it. <br /> <br /> If Hollywood was successful, how much I would have if I had the chance to earn a living! <br /> <br /> In the list of my worst movies is a stupid, historically deceptive / humanistic trip like The Patriot and Pearl Harbor.
