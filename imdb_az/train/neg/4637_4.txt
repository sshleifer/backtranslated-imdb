Bangville said the start of Keystone Kops, which they call the studio they are working on for the Police case. However, they do not wear smart police suits or drive the car with the speed of the mark. In any case, Mabel Normand is a couple who begged for a calf. He sees some strange men in the bar and calls the police shortly. An answer and follow-up. After that, Mabel slams her doors as if someone were inside. The rest of the robbers are his mother! When Mabel blocked the door with furniture, the mother and father are trying to get their way! This is probably the most entertaining part of jealousy, with some explosions of the police. It was seven minutes before the start. The only realistic thing we can do is to extinguish Mabel's charm with his face and big eyes, and, of course, it's a very unpleasant thing to do with fear. Why it makes it easy to become a star. Most of all, at least I would recommend that at least once, so I gave 4.
