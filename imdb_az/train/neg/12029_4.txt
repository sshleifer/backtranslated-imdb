Generally, I've seen you do not hear a movie before you see it on DVD, there's a good reason for that. One day I did not hear about this movie as I saw in a movie until I was in Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Unlike some movies, all movies have already been rented (whatever I want to see). <br /> <br /> This is not really the case with other films. The Singles Ward or RM genre <br /> If you go into such films, you can probably do that. <br /> <br /> But if you are not a mormon, this movie will not appeal to you. There is no way to escape from the open-minded (mormon) message inside and sometimes it's like cheese. <br /> <br /> Do not fall into the Mormon demography, rather than watch something else <br /> <br /> The film had many funny moments, but I did not think it was enough to save the film at all.
