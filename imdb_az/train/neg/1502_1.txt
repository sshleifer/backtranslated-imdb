Django's Ballad is a strange blend of a movie! This spaghetti is a collection of scenes from the other (and better!) Movies, allegedly by the West, simply by the fact that they have been brought into different wars by Django. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) has nothing to do with Django's role. Just skip this one if you only make every Django movie and you will not have enough excuse to see this one!
