Vampires Vs. Zombies did not have their original name. It was really ... <br /> <br /> Get Hit by Nasty Lesbian Semi-Vampires and Two Zombies Cars: Bob Lesbian Gypsie-Witch and his dog, Random Woman and Catholic School Shortcut Zombi Chorus with Special Powers. Also, Box: Warning: No Plot - only the writer and director will understand the end or something of this movie. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I love bad movies. I love vampires. I like zombies. I love Hell, even from the lesbian. This movie combines all three with an indefinable and confusing (or non-existent) field, horrendous (almost bad) dialogue and a random STUFF and PEOPLE that has nothing to do with anything ... Knowing what's going on in the world ). Oh, and I can not forget the "zombie" green oats in latex gloves (yes, film makers could not even cover the hands of zombies with oats and dyes). In any way, it was eventually an exciting BAD movie. <br /> <br /> Was not the last meaning? Was the vampire really a nurse and the other girl was really mentally ill? Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, it's all vampires ... really did not call one of the girls' vampires. No matter what. <br /> <br /> Never rent or buy this movie. If you are really interested ... okay, I understand. Seriously, even the lovers of BAD movies can not stop it. The following number should be 1.
