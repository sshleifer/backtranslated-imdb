I will be honest, this is one of the worst films. If not, then it is very close. No young soap opera was seen. That's like one of them. Worse yet. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> Adam: I'll take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> This line has sex for the execution. Music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you do not read books, beware of this movie as a pandemonium. They completely change the identities of characters and events. In addition, they just get rid of something. It also ends before the film ends. This is AWFUL movie. So you did not read books, do not watch. If you have a book read, turn it on (movie). If you like low-quality teenage soap operas, lower quality soap operas, go. Do we need to wait something different from MTV again?
