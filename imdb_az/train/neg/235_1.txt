A beautiful bucket can not repeat this tale of a secretary who was killed by his married wife. In fact, romantic and murderous one-sided story has more questions than answers; and none of these questions will be answered as it is only provided by the accused. This is a type of tariff that appeals to "She, Woman, Human Hater." As presented, it is a story of an innocent woman "captured" in romanticism with a married, high-level lawyer. If possible, he did not appoint his partner twice, and had contact with a married man, could he prevent all the worst-case and complicated events? Do not worry about going to the refrigerator while watching it, do not miss anything.
