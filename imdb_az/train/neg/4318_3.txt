I thought it was one of the worst holiday movies I've ever seen - while others are Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST. All three films are related to death. If you want, you can watch this movie or any other way in any way. The actor is good in this movie, and some scenes (except for people to die) are beautiful. But I'm concerned that a person with clinical depression may see the movie accidentally and can do it himself! Despite the fact that the "happiness" ends, the main part of this film is one of the most terrible disasters. For some crazy reasons, watching a Christmas movie is NOT DEPRESSED (I know this crazy folk - I do not feel sorry about everything and do not worry about all the holidays) <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <! <br /> <br /> <strong>
