Wow, in a sense this is not unusual: it is usually the best film in a long continuous fashion. People are surprised when they are really good at a later time. With Tarzan, I thought this movie was the worst of the band, or at least the first six of my Tarzan Collection DVD package. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If you see lion attacks, crocodiles, hippos, panthers, you call it and you see one of the different tribes, including pygmies (called "dwarfs"). Since this film is prepared about 75 years ago, we can not beat any of the realities because it is not in the past films. They can do the best they can with the actors who are talking to fake backgrounds. However, Weissmuller made many moving scenes and was a great form. He and O'Sullivan created a beautiful pair of well-built, if only once in the history of golden cinema. <br /> <br /> The film has a historical value (a great deal of durability), which has acquired the beginnings of Tarzan Jane and English learning. <br /> <br /> BAD - by Jane Parker at Tarzan at any moment, after hysterics, shrieking and screaming scenes by Maeryen O'Sullivan. It is enough to give a headache and the film is damaged. Fortunately, she later calmed down, but not in this movie. Film, C. Aubrey Smith, Jane's father and Neil Hamilton "Harry Holt", as safari instructors, does not benefit from the form of "Big White Hunter", like hitting every animal, saying "animals are in danger." or not. These people kill - happy, especially Smith. In another note, there is nothing to describe how Tarza would first of all be found in the Jungle. There is no history of his growth here. He's where Jane and the band come to a certain point in Africa.
