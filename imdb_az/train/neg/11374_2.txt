It could not be related to this movie. He could not draw me from intellectual, emotional and aesthetic point of view.

I will admit that as an atheist, I probably do not know more about Catholicism, but I have also seen many of them dealing with religious issues that are still universal in their human condition. Based on specific knowledge or beliefs.
