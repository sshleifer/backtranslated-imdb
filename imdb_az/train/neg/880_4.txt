Waitress Canin has written and directed this vision of the "modern day" Las Vegas and the first managing director since 1940! David Janssen is a big gambling casino that combines his son (Robert Drayas, not surprisingly as the old Jason Bateman). Janssen treats every area in the same way: with the defense, with the chip on his shoulder. Janssen, who plays this cool and withdrawn role, is angered by an angry sheep husband (even throwing Don Rickles out and crying at him). Her son, who looks for her identity, causes the youngsters to look at Vegas (giving them ten years) and how frustrating that Dad is not happy with her lifestyle. Brenda Vaccaro delights herself as a conscious secretary, and Edy Willaims has a bit of fun as a showgirl in audition. Unfortunately, in the book Where It Happened, most of the adolescents and their children have been surrounded by adult aggression, along with ethical behaviors, some of the fastest T & A shoots and cunning high-level satirical bits. ** from ****
