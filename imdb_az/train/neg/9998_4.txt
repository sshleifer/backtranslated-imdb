At the end of the film I felt very technical. I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our fleet was rescued in the sea. I like seeing that the engines have a fire extinguisher. I think I should be figured out before, but I have never thought. It is unrealistic to use 747 to carry valuable old paintings safely. The player was pretty good, because they are mostly experienced experts, but so far it is likely that it will be fantasy, funny, and so on. Must be more. Everything was very serious. At least in the film Felix Ungary pilot, Buck Rogers, at night stalker and Dracula on board. The film is full of celebrities. I understand that Hollywood should be exaggerated for a drama, but a serious topic will damage the quality of the film when creating a cartoon. So I said it should be funny. My pet-peeve films on airline travel are just accidentally made to everyone. They walk in a drink, put them on the floor, and shout them five minutes later, as if they were a building or something, and act like if they did not stop shaking. And I also know that there is a disaster movie, but there is no possibility of a 30-second accident after hitting something. In any case, experienced actors and actresses continue to make this vulnerable script a movie that can be preserved after the first sight. I love Lee Grant, but was fun to watch a psychotic person pigeon ... :)
