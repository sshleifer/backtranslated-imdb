To die in a film that is too small. Vanessa Redgrave dies, but she begins to tell his daughters story and secret love before they go ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the films that looks and looks at a movie. There are so many great actors and actresses in this movie that really is something. It's not that bad, but a bit more enthusiastic story with Redgrave, Tony Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes, Natasha Richardson, Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson, Hugh Darcy and others (all performing well) <br /> <br /> Wait for the cable.
