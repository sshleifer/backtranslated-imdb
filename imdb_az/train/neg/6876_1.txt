Yes, it was pure incredible flaw. We know that the French often come up with an idea from the United States, and this is a pitfall and an idea of ​​sex. Like the American living in France (Hoosier), I have enough opportunity to adhere to these relationships. Some of these biased ideas may be true, but some of the city's midfield points described here are not real. Is a person who is not sexually active because he studies secondary school 20 years ago? Where is it in the world? Just a juke box with a bar playing old blugrass? A city of 16 people, less than two hours away from Chicago, but no major television station, no television in the home, McDonalds, a city with no children ... A population still capable of knowing each other's intimate details is still a ruthless one like a great family who hate each other. The mature men with torn bags in the local cafe have farmers, but they do not harvest, killing a guy they do not love in front of everyone and feeling with each other. The 17-year-old virgin boy is a freewheeling French girl who will spend far too many body guys going to go cornfields with breath only breath in the breeze to help the shadow of a 17-year-old farmer boy, according to sex grace? HELP! I was amazed at the absurdity of this film, and I was amazed that I did not clearly state how ridiculous it was. See the A-to-Z primer for removal. Gosh, I hope you did not destroy it!
