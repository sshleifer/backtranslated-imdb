I tried to watch this movie in a military camp during an external mission, and tell me, you will watch something under these conditions. <br /> <br /> For the first five minutes, the poor quality of porn movies has set tone with stunning strangers and unusual situations and behaviors. Then it gets worse. There is no saving grace in this movie, and it's not funny to watch it yet. Just horrible. I've seen a lot of movies in my life, and I'm not one of those critics, which is bad, though I love most movies. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
