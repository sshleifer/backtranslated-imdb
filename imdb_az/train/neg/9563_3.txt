This is based on the concise 80's hits. <br /> <br /> Taking into account that the base in Afghanistan has seen a base destroyed by a UAV at the beginning, this is a modern day. <br /> <br /> And the movie skips the full shade. UAVs are not armed. Maybe it could be, but in reality I do not think it's a reality. R.P.L.E.Y. We see a computer that manages this process. We will introduce Will Willer to "Will Hacker" Will Farmer (Who's a computer hacker who does not do chemistry and electronics) and his love affair, Annie, and Hacking Will just imagine who Anni was at her only IP address at her IP address. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus is the original film that the Global Thermo-Warriors decided to play they go back and they play the Dead Cod. <br /> <br /> <strong> RIPLEY's office will not work, not Massoud's PC, because all the evidence collected against Will is unhelpful. <br /> An online game?) and also felt that all the power they had to stop all the electricity. Why an anti-terrorist organization sees it as a reasonable target is extremely suspicious. When it comes to activating the RIPLEY mobile phone? <br /> <br /> As RIPLEY agents come to Massude's home, I think it's not connected to the PC and can not play if the message really does not answer the phone. , take it and you will be given an envelope with lots of money. You will look for the car plate on Massoud because you have never seen it because you will not enter it on a DMV computer. RIPLEY agents looking for Dennis at the airport are not allowed to arrest or arrest him. Mother did not "steal chemicals and Bio agents". Even if he does not have the right to detain or arrest Dennis. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Computer is offended by computer and will all actions against her, her mother and Dennis were not allowed by government authorities. <br /> <br /> It is the first show of any hacking skill in the film, and we want to enter the RIPLEY, which looks very easy for such a powerful system. <br /> <br /> The last "boy" went to Annie at the airport and was in the same place with RIPLEY and was ridiculous with RIPLEY's ability to watch a phone. Understand that the underground computer is reading the lips was foolish. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> We find that the "boy" who fled to Annie is Falken (regardless of whether he played the original actor). <br /> <br /> We destroyed the RIPLEY "WOPR" and then kept the same voice. Falken and WOPR are destroyed after being used in a very difficult way (the same explosion should kill Will, Annie and Russia). In addition, they are not able to create an independent computer system capable of releasing or releasing chemical weapons. <br /> <br /> The proof and the idea of ​​"disinfection" is completely unbelievable. Such orders must pass the Presidential or General Headquarters Certificate. So ridiculous and incredible <br /> <br /> RIPLEY's IP attacks are not done by Will, he only contacts one of his friends, who offers and carries out their ideas. Only one input would be available from RIPLEY's work. It is incredible noise and shouting from Joshua to RIPLEY (especially after being shot down) as a backpack, without any idea and trying to work on this film. /> <br /> RIPLE HERE is a terrific good play Y is an immortal code and we see a countdown (telling 17 minutes), then RIPLEY says "Decontamination within 30 minutes," so why not continue with their timer? RIPLEY's Philadelphia Attack (in my opinion, very easily) stopped and Joshua decided to attack in his inner circle and directed Philly to RIPLEY in Washington. The idea of ​​nuclear exchange is something that does not work if Ripley does not understand what to do (does he know that Joshua is inside the film as he learned these lessons?) original film. <br /> <br /> RIPLEY's disappearance repeats the same words of Joshua and shows the end of the original film, showing only his original ideas. <br /> <br /> If you want to show off your bad and stolen ideas, men's fault is Randall Badat and Rob Kerchner. This is a terrible film and it is best avoided.
