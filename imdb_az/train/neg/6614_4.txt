Sholay: One of the biggest films. I always thought that they would not be classic. When RGV announced this movie and I was a little excited to see it. I've always thought it will be a good movie, but every week RGV changes something. <br /> <br /> I am very happy that I'm not a B-class movie. <br /> <br /> I'm really looking for a positive, but I promised to save my mind from my mind. Cinematography is wise. The film works for its own. But this is the upper side. Movement sequences are weak. The scenario had the potential. The biggest flaw is correct. None of the scenes excites you. For example, comedy followers have fled from a lot of places and have been compelled to do so. Ironic was originally fun because the comedy. And none of the symbols are developed. No scene will end. And the latter was very hopeless. <br /> <br /> The biggest question is moving. Amitabh Bachchan was as good as Gabbar Singh, nothing great. It seemed as though he was paying too much attention to the appearance that the character seemed intimidating, but not leaked. Mohanlal has difficulty in the film, but surprised by his few appearances. Ajay Devgan was decent. He did not have much performance, he gave them all, it was a weak script. Prashant Raj is very confident and has the potential to make it better with cinema. <br /> <br /> There were many expectations for Sushmita Sen. He was expressive, but it was not enough. Nisha Kothari surprised me. He seemed uninteresting to most, but after his friend's death his emotional scene was pretty good. If you need to find a director to help her talent, she is not her favorite. But I was very disappointed with chemistry. Ajay Devgan and Prashant Raj did not look like friends. Ajay-Nishah was not a strong couple. There was no passion between Sushmita and Prashant. Amitabh and Mohanlal did not have the passion they needed. <br /> <br /> As for the lyrics, they slept a lot. Urmila was in the very center of Mehbooba and I slept with her very much. But it was a beautiful dance. The holi number was very enjoyable, but not memorable. It went for the same other songs. For a person waiting for this movie, I was very disappointed. I had great hopes for the RGV, but it seems like she has lost her talent in filming. But hopefully, Sarkar recovers his talent for Raj. But this movie is forgotten. All the positives still do not prepare for drilling.
