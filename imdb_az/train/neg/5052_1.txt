Rocky IV is the Vietnamese War, as it is for heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stoun is a story of US military fighter experience in Vietnam in 1968, which is ridiculous. Most weeks or events in Platon are a war (week) to describe what happened in a small group in such a short period of time (weeks) as it occurred during the ten years of US military presence in Vietnam. US soldiers, US soldiers who killed civilians, a US soldier US military sergeant, a US soldier who killed another US soldier, and US defendants, see the whole thing within a week or two. Soldiers killed or wounded by gunfire, 90% + on the frontline were killed or wounded. For Stone, this film is a disgrace to try to experience as a typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam. The two Vietnam War films we recommend are Soldiers (The True story of the worst war for US soldiers in Vietnam) and the HBO's Bright Shimmer Lie.
