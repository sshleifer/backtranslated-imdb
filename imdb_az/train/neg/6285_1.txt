Horror movie really ???? I do not believe the film is so bad, what is the point of this movie? about 1 hour and 30 minutes and the first 70 minutes of movie, just a crash, then faces this foolish appearance .... it does not talk much, it does not even move too much. I have to say that there is a small movement in the last 20 minu .. and it was still stupid ....... and the last oh god, I do not know, I do not know lena face lol .. do not get me wrong Lena Headey I love it but I do not know what to include in this movie .. watching and watching is not a story of this movie because it does not have any activity .. and there is no point ... do not touch how slow this movie is and then watch it forever you feel like.
