Ahh had a great potential! <br /> <br /> I believe someone in an unnamed marketing department has the same idea. Basically, the Legal Blond allows you to do some sort of movie, but it's doing in New York. This great luck is a man with the city, strength and money, and a soul that has a soul, power / money. Let's add one to Jessica Simpson, a small town bimbo, brother of Owen Wilson and Andy Dick (just because you should not see this movie). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Boy Boy creates a girl for NY, Enjoyed by the boy (Brother Wilson) and kissing the day. <br /> <br /> In this film, a few words will come to mind when you are thinking terribly, horribly, unbearable, unbearable and xenophobic. <br /> Just watch this movie, be happy. At a glance, he refers to Guantanamo and I am absolutely convinced of it. This film causes shock. And I know what you think ... at least I'll see Simpson as naked or too close at some point. This will not happen, donate yourself and your YouTube. <br /> <br /> Is it wrong to fix movies, the player is unbearable, and why use blue screens? <br /> <br /> In the end; Why Willie Nelson always plays a father figure in every Jessica Simpson flick, and why is there no black, Latin, Asian or European? people in this movie?
