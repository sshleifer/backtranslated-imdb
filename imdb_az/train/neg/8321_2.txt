Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba are in a straightforward attempt to recreate both of the least beloved actors of this century, with a very severe butterfly effect. "Awakening" is very sleepy and does not really care much about sleeping. <br /> <br /> Alba was still restored after Fantastic Four. <br /> <br /> Alba, the Silver driver's rise. As always, it is natural disaster and equally unwatchable. Only once was in the safe hands of master Robert Rodriguez in Sin City. Maybe Jessica Alba may not be the actress but rather her credit, perhaps possibly complicating her ability to work with a poor script. If so, then he will explain "Awake". <br /> <br /> What's going on with an article that will outline the Plan 9 Outside Space? <br /> <br /> For the first time, director / screenwriter Joby Harold's thrilling psychological excitement led to Jessica Alba, Hayden Christenson, and Terrence Howard, who appeared in the operating table as "strangely ill" and could not help, the "fear" known as the "fear" of the common surgical phenomenon. When a successful young man (Christenson) finds out that he is under a knife and does not understand the anesthesia well, his troubled wife (Alba) is awaiting excitement and horrors as a terrible drama occurring in the operating room. <br /> <br /> Final Destination for planning, hoping to do whatever operating tables, director Joby Harold pivots with this first effort in a blood-freeze moderation. From the beginning, credit sequence is exposed to a disease called "anesthetic consciousness" in one of the 700 people where the patient remains conscious at the time of the operation. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Clayton Beresford Jr (Hayden Christensen ) can feel every slice. <br /> <br /> Sadness, intelligence, Awake, do not turn into a real work of terror. By turning cold simplicity into absurd conspiracies, Christensen and Jessica Alba avoid stylted turns. Would you like something calming before you watch? <br /> <br /> Verdict: "Awakening" is not the best result. No doubt, do not film any fist on the paper. As a film, it is generally common and much getting. It will not romanticize the Awake novel. The final result is really bad. Alba and Christian movies are at least a bit of anxiety as they are unable to scare viewers. "Awake" is the most likely film.
