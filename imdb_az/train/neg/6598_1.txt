This "movie" is a transvestite. No, wait - it's a disgust. No, WAIT - this is undoubtedly an absolutely WORST movie, created by some of the most beloved heroes created and created by other actors. <br /> <br /> I'm Peter Sellers instead of Alan Arkin (!) "Inspector Clouseau" <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> > <BR> <strong> Laurel and Mr. Hardy, respectively, since 1957 and since 1965 he was dead. Why does everyone begin to imagine that the updates for L & H will be in the identity of Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain? I was expecting horror and embarrassment, and, of course, I was not disappointed. Everyone in this miserable, moronic, disgraceful should have something to do with Hollywood and the film structure. EVALUATION OF ALL SOURCES - WORKS FOR YOUR FEAR.
