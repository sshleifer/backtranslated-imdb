I have never seen one of the worst films being extremely boring with this very boring dialogue, and there are some very boring characters and ridiculous creatures. The only reason I was watching this garbage dump was because of the horrors I had on the 8 discs. The area is extremely unhappy and extremely foolish. The angel does not have blood, except for a few bloody marks and several bloody wounds. Fear of inaction! Richard Cardella is shocking and terribly laughable plus her character is bored. Glen Roberts is a funny relief and is not ridiculous! Mark Siegel is very bored and FUNNY! Bob Hyman is worthy, but not more. Richard Garrison was frustrating and there was no chemistry with Kacey Cobb. Kacey Cobb is here and no chemistry with Richard. In general, avoid this trash anyway! BOMB came out at 5.
