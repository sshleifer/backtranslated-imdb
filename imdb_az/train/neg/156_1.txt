Zu Warriors is one of the most definitely an animated series because it's like watching an old anime hanging like a movie. The film starts from just one place and the lover of the cloud or something until the prince himself sacrifices himself to fly around these wings and other foolish weapons. This prince is a god or an angel outside me, but soon enough this flying wind comes and kills a man, but the man with the knife wings is not a cunning line with another mystical God / Demon / Wizard, or to get this movie it is very difficult to watch that you need to be insanely smart. It is soon followed by this deadly Chinese, called by God, to kill a bad man, kill a bad man and soon fight against evil. there is a very choreographed Uwe Boll, a battle scene complete with a terrible martial art on a mountain or something. I'm looking at some of the visions, like some of them are stunning and colorful, but I'm looking at a pickled goat as I say blurry (yes, this is a word!). Now I watched both dubbed and subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand ... I do not understand it, so I did not understand it. They watched the 30th episode of the 1980s, and ran away as if the story began or began to read 5 comic series number 4. Because I did not know where this thing went or how it ended. All the time. Honestly, this was one of the worst film experiences in the episode Inu-Yasha, looking at 134 drunks ... yes, you do not know what this paradise is. The brain tries to understand this.
