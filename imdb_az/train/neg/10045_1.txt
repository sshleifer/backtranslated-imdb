The whole world said that the film "Tasan" would be a good movie with great pleasure, but it is not. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake to act as actress Kareena Kapur. It was unbearable throughout the movie. His roof-length look is not really good. Even the film's story does not mean the movie. Everyone said that Quetin Taratino Vijay in India, but not Quetin at all. Talented Anil Kapoor took part in this stupid film. Anil is a large-scale actor and this is not a movie. Akshay Kumar is also the victim of this movie, all of them Saif. Style and Phoormola are not really good in this movie, and I'm disappointed
