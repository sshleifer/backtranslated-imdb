I'm not concerned with this movie, movies. 40 years ago I saw it as a teenager, it was too late to find that it was too romantic, 95% romantic, 4% everything, 1% history. It's a movie I call fodder and meal, with one interesting subject, a real movie is a scam. This is a good cinematic treatment theme, this film is almost an insult to the service. The actual members of Lafayette Escadrille did not escape from the law, nor were they the products of insulting homes, but were actually idealists who wanted to do something to help France. I suspect that most of them came from a background higher than Tab Hunter's character. The flying school is not for intelligent appetites and knows all this, a man mentioned here would not last two days, either on a stockade or on foot. The discipline in the French army was often fierce. In short, another Hollywierd version of a historical episode that is worthy of a proper treatment.
