First, I'm not scared easily ... Everything except a few phobias, but this movie is absolutely terrible. It is not suitable for all children! I just opened my mouth for all my shocking moments. I did not believe there was a bloody thing for a child's movie, the bunnies were brutally murdered! You just have to be so terrified that you do not need to fall into G. degree. I suggest you to be over 8 to see this. But I did not make a mistake if it were gentle, like a child, would be good. I do not believe the 4-year-old child will be able to allow the parent to watch it. It's just tense and complicated, not just to forget the crack for young children. I'm shocked by more than 4 friends and violent. I do not recommend it
