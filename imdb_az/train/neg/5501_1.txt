I thought my favorite Martian was too boring and drawn! It was not funny yet. The audience watched the entire movie and did not laugh at all! The kids laughed so loudly! Sad for a Disney movie! I thought Christopher Lloyd could have found someone to play more than a jog! He was really stupid! And he's funny! I thought the suit that I was talking about was really dumb! The suit does not talk and moves on the original TV series! In my opinion, they should not waste their time in this movie! Give me two fingers down! I really spend time and I do not recommend the movie to anyone! Thank you very much!!
