After all the fruity music videos of Kvazi-gothic, the film begins with the killing of the singer, which started with Cassidy. In a perfect world, there will be the last loans. We are not living in this world. Insipid group members decide to go to some clowns to touch her dead end. When I say dirty, I mean the actual clown. He says that they want to die with Cassidy's dreams (Dora, Dora of the Spirit, owns one of his group mates). All the heroes can not remain as elegant, vapid and terrible. Adam Hackbarth (there was an incredible apropos surname), and Corbin Timbrook's directed (to find out that he is talking about a life after his guest and tower), the constant fight of this film is the inability of the film and the need for the audience to stay awake. Gore-hounds are not enough blood to suppress, or nudity enough to provide pervs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> I saw: Starz on Demand
