The "Trigger Man" is definitely the most boring and silliest movie ever seen in my life. <br /> <br /> Dear holiday videos are more attractive. <br /> <br /> Players are hired at uglypeople.com. <br /> <br /> They walk and walk through the forest. Together, there are more than three sections of the Lord of the Rings. After the first hour, he began to read the Porsche brochure while watching the "Trigger Man" along the way. Terrible. <br /> <br /> Spend all the time and money. I would give this movie 10 to 0 stars because it's impossible, I have to give 1 star.
