I have not seen this DVD set, I have not seen it, and did not want it. The scenario should have been rewritten, as it would have to be completely deprived of any feeling and pile compared with the writing. Lighting is very scary, it's not too small, but I can review it. Scenarios do not pay enough attention to heroes ... There is no sign of anyone who does not make difficult to identify who they are (in particular, there is no information on who died on the plane). <br /> <br /> I thought the key to a good movie for a long time was to pay attention to the characters; If not, there is nothing. The heroes were not given any attention - you never knew them - what did they do, what they wanted, and what they did. The sequence is 5 hours and is divided into 6 parts ... Instead, they wondered what they were doing all the time, although they did not describe the characters - they put many filler ... I think that watching at least an hour's land and aircraft means LOL (ie really need to be repeated again). If only we could improve our knowledge of our characters, I'd give it a higher rating.
