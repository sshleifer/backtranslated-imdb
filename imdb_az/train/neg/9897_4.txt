I found a good movie to go through, but there was no chance of any historical value. Cleopatra's description reminded me of an inexpensive soap opera. <br /> <br /> Facts have turned into reality ... funny! She was born when she fed her own people! Please ask ... The queen of Egypt, a pregnant woman (especially this one), was therefore not forced to move from one room to another! They tried to be holy to God for his righteousness! Cleopatra was the biggest politician of his time. His decision was based on something other than his emotion and morality. He did everything for only two reasons: Power and self-defense! He stayed in a family because he lived a very good life. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it was very powerful to kill the octave, and the gays had to rise from head to toe. So it was his end ...
