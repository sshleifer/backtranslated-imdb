(which may be a bit of a spoiler), I did not want to start with the whole film, nor could I have been, because it was understood from the first hour I was incredibly disappointed. <br /> <br /> At times, wrinkles had to be made in an incredible way. <br /> <br /> Therefore, many believe that it is an incredible book and turn it into a Disney Made-for-TV movie. A long time ago a movie. There is a great story that can close kids and adults. It is already built in quality sequels. But there was no way to go to Disney. The problem with the movie was so great about the book to turn things into a visual story. It's a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace completely "psychic" because it was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to argue as an additional tension between the three ladies, but there is still a tension in the story. <br /> <br /> There are many people living in Gabala, but I also think things like that. For example, look at Camazotz as we look at a strange dark sky. The sadness of the book can be Camazotz's Place. It looks like a place. There are people who seem like people. Blue is blue, grass is green, children play. But a little bit. The Directors chose to select another one instead of using Camazotz's book and applying it to the general direction of the film. Of course, Camazotz is a good person, so let's forget how we love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text -align: justify; <br /> <br /> Sometimes someone can tell me how Disney is breaking the last one. <br /> <br /> Generally, an artistic frustration. <br /> <br />
