When I first saw this movie, I thought I came from the kid's part - it's very entertaining and sometimes humorous, and in fact it's a good story, but romantic chemistry is capable of delivering Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins. It should be noted that Walter Matthau is perfect for Albert Einstein and his performance is extraordinary, but this is the only exception. This movie seems a little compulsory, there is no directive and oh yeah ... the music was ridiculously terrible, it did not make me a good mood. But if you do not expect a clever, well-crafted comedy / romantic tale, this may of course be as fun as I said ... in the kids section. Einstein and his friends are in a good mood to miss Tim Robbins and almost find it hard to steal Mel Ryan's heart. It's a very controversial film, but it's a good movie if it's not taken seriously.
