It's one of the worst films I've ever seen. When a man says he wants a superior power to be able to love himself, I think that the film's 14-year-old fantasy fantasies are in the childhood environment. The bedroom scene was up and down, and it cut down intimate moments in the community of biological functions similar to natural gas. For each other stage, it was the first time that they had sex, how long they would have been for a couple of days, what kind of sexual relationships would be, and who would be with them. Moreover, dialogue and mobility were very flawed and they were overwhelmed, senseless, and filled with content in sexual content. It would be really funny because the concept is really interesting, but here it is poorly executed. Please, do not worry about going out to anyone over the age of 16 if you need to go and see it.
