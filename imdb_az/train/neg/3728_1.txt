As you have shown in another statement, this film scared you when you were a child. However, if you are old, this movie is just one thing: great breastfeeding - and hence I mean the player, his soundtrack, cutting or s.th. like this. I'm just talking about the "plan" (if you can say it). <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> More spoilers than you need (after reading this, you really want to watch this movie), but after graduating from any school, is a great offense to your intelligence. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, the United Nations (a bad organization of the UN) <br /> <br /> - We just have to believe that it is bad. Even worse? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why hell (no purpose is provided ) do it? <br /> <br /> I present Christ as a lip service to your heart. <br /> <br /> - Because the film was nothing like a "real Christian", they said Fool's Prayer. So ... just pray before the surprise and get rid of it - no matter what! <br /> <br /> So, rating 1/10
