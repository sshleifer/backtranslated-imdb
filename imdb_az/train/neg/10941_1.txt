Wow, what can I say? I love my sweethearts and went out of my way to watch a mixed flick move, but Snake Eater had a nail to my pee hole management that gave me a skirt dance .Lorenzo Lamas, more like Lorenzo Lameass, pfft Bill Clinton himself , this guy has the ability to play. He has all the goods to make a really bad film. Crazed Hillbilles YEP! unnecessary trembling (with a strange wound) YEP! crappy soundtrack YEP! I want to give the movie -10 stars, but less than 1. When I saw something seriously, I thought someone was playing a joke on me ... that's a worse thing. 2MORE SNAKE EATER FILMS! ...... I guess the demand.
