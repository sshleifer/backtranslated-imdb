I am a great admirer of hell movies. Some sources are Braveheart, Truva, Last samurai and Gladiator. After watching the moon, I had a high expectation of the movie, Serge Bodrov, who was awesome and very frustrating. But this is not a terrible, terrible or even terrible thing. The whole film waited for something that had happened but I did not do it, then at least at the end of a great epic battle, but it was a great disappointment, just a few casual escape, swinging with swords ... There are many good warrior films, is not one of them.
