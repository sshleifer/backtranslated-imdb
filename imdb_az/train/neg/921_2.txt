I took this rental to see Vanesa Talor once more. He can move, but there is no chance in this lane. Opening sequence is the direct crane throws of mountainous landscapes. We should have come from a stock archive, because the movie is shot directly on the video camera. Generally, production values ​​create _Blair Witch_ professionalism. There is really an unimaginable statue of an animation, but it does not have any other effect. This movie is bad, but not fun. Players will not talk about their resume.
