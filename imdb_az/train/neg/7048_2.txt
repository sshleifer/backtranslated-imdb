I chose this movie with a bad move. It is not ridiculous, and the main characters are very striking. The girl was beautiful, but the story and the player were very scary. Surfing has nothing to do with it. Terrific movie with surfing and surfing "theme" that has nothing to do with any real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful, and the film is probably now in the focus of attention with Gordon Gekko and all of them, but do not waste your time. GREAT surfing, with REAL surfers and AMAZING, a beautiful movie, GUZES cinema was in the hands of God.
