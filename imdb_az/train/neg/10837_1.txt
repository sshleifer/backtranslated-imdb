I can not tell you how furiously after seeing this movie. Heroes are not an interesting thing and the plot is not available. So, what do we get if we expect the last two and a half hours to have a somewhat significant result after waiting for the effects of these characters' lives on each other? Storm frogs. Now, yes, I understand the Bible and its main point of reference, but first of all, it is definitely not presented in any resolution, and secondly, to anyone who has not read the Bible (a major part of the population) or Charles Fort (a larger part) . As a good reader, I thought it was a bad imitation of a seinfeld episode of this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> It's a good thing to be honest
