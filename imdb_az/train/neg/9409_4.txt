I liked this show! I think that's not the wrong thing! Only Spidey does not hit anyone, but it does not show the show! Some people just think this show is bad. The story was great, and the other heroes were fun when the X-Men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man appeared! Bad Sandman never seems to be, but it's kinda even so! The best Spidey show ever! My favorite episodes are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. Hobgoblin 4. Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. First Morbius creates plasma instead of blood and I do not like vampires. And I'm annoyed by the fact that the 2 nd Season is dead. Of course, I have to talk to Hydro Man! He was terrible! I see Sandman! His last appearance was terrible. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;">
