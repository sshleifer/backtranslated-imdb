A terrible phenomenal success. <br /> <br /> First of all, Nicholas Cage should be in the final in the actuarial class "Over-Emoting" category. New hair caterpillars and multiple backed back ears are tense to touch the back, it is simply a sick smarmiess but creates a "hero" character that has no interest. <br /> <br /> I do not know what is with Neil Labute and female characters. She leads women to be absolutely indifferent and bad ... and directly pays them back from Cage punch and repeats them all a few times "b **** es". <br /> <br /> I will give this film only on 10 to 2 out of Ellen Burstyn's speech. It looks like it can finally be lost in all hope (his boldly appearing clear on his forehead with his scenes with his parchment), giving his appearance. He deserves an Oscara here and now speaks straight lines, and when he looks white wax and blue, white and golden face, The Wicker Man, who knows that Scorcese and Fridkin really are working for him <br /> <br /> This film wrong, and believe in my heart. <br /> Nicholas Cage, Nicholas Cage looks like Ms. Gulch who stole a bicycle and walks around her Oz Wizard <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <! <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Ellen Burstyn <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage screams: "Who burned? Who burned? Who burned? Who burned? Who burned? Who burned?" <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage puts the last month's suit (I do not deceive) in the woods, leaving some of the shoes (but leaving the toes behind), and then makes some karate movements. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Undoubtedly, If you can do this movie without laughing, then you are awarded a medal. Perhaps, there was actually a point in the film that surprised us that this film was not a complicated one in "hysterics" ... only Cage reminded that he would scream / shout / dialogue .. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it is very sad is a person.
