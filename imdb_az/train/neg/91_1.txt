I rented this movie about 3 years ago and still thought it was the worst movie ever. I do not think it's all over. A home made video by a high school student is worse than a video. I remember something in 1970 and there was a guy with a new SUV like flashlight, polo jacket, oakley sunglasses and a Toyota Rav-4 or something (still not remembered). We can say how it would be in the 70s. It could have been a mobile phone, and I remember, it was just terrible. I returned her to the video store and even asked why she would take the movie, and I can take the time of my life. So far, I've seen the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen the bad ones.
