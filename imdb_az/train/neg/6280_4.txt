Do you have an unbelievable look that you think would be nice to be in a movie? Like a detective falls in the crack of the broken fence? Or when you see a woman walking on a street that warns of cold and intense and scary? Yes. Imagine that you've been filming this entire movie, you've got Broken Think, though there is no detective in this movie, and I use it as only one visual example. However, a tightly-resounded woman is here and has nearly 99% of the display time. There was nothing to complain about this woman, she is a perfect choice for this role. <br /> <br /> I consider myself a very open minded person who can enjoy all kinds of artistic expressions, and I'm really moody stuff. It would be nice if I could take one of the scenes from this movie and hang on the wall. Be honest here, acting is superior. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is now. There is nothing beyond the Spirit. The director basically blamed an idea and dropped its value. If I say that obsession is a "mirror", I do not consider it to be spoiler. We encountered this idea, it's a bloody place, and all the director has a job. Of course, there are a few twists and return here and there. <br /> <br /> Now, I do not collect bones with this art style because I often love them. . Still, I believe that we must judge the artwork used by artists to express their artistic base. The film is not a piece of music, it's a picture, or a picture, even a poem and, of course, a cool look in your mind. All this is a good story and character development. I think the Lynch style of the film is deceptive. This is irresponsible and cheap and medium loss of vehicle. For a good reason, the film gave 2 hours of running movies. <br /> <br /> This film is not entirely Lynch style, thank goodness. There is a real development and the result is a result. There are not many stories or character development. It presented itself with symbols consisting of very common folklore, thus at least leaving the surface away from other fantasies. It does not give any explanation to the fantasy element and did not try to build a consistent world around it. This strangeness does not come from anywhere and seems very isolated and accidental. <br /> <br /> Perhaps he is standing on the one hand, but I see that he did not make much effort on the screen. <br /> As you can see, she has made a lot of effort to build a mood and improve it with music. The music is often built into a tease, which has been tensioned. Only in the last part of the film was the fear and tension. <br /> <br /> In the end, I feel like myself: OK, I know what you mean here, but do not waste two hours of this tension? These are the characters and they have nothing to do with life. And we have given very few characters. Here is what we have. Frustrated, but the director did not have much material to work and it shows.
