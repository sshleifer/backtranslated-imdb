The worst show I've ever seen. The story turns into strange, bad design suits for a group of youths who have super powers and some special devices for some undisclosed reasons. They act when they are not in late-looking suits. Absolutely not good, it's not the worst I've ever seen. However, when they wear their suits, actors act badly; too, very bad. Hyper-animated bones have a large number of unnecessary movements. Even when they talk, they seem to be seizures. These oppressors are more cheating than Rangers. Every episode, some weak, ironic villain, comes with a plan to destroy the Rangers. Later Rangers sends a force of hyper-animated aliens to attack. Rangers then start a 10-hour animation transformation, and then destroy foreigners. Then, a human ladybug, which is actually visible and evil, can be a delicate structure or armor, showing the traits of a truncated decay with trumpets joining a creature. The Power Rangers survive, and then they have a rain cloud or nuclear missiles (yes, living things and creatures turn into giants). Power Rangers calls the Zordes of 5-minute hyper-animated players and players who use special effects for real-time viewers. Power Rangers wins, the villain goes terrified, all teaches a "valuable" lesson and the show ends. This is so. Twenty-five minutes of brainwashing, fake kung fu fighting.
