The summary presented by my cable TV guide really sounds more interesting. "The Raccoon Cemetery" is the worst horror film I've ever seen before, "Urban Legends: Final Cut". In the opening scene I could say that it would be really bad, but I could not care less so I was very bored. This film has a funny action by an incredible person, especially in dreams, unbelievable placeboats and the most terrifying music I've heard, and prefers Britney Spears and Nsync air waves. The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is that it's not funny. One would be a delicate and boring film, and therefore would not be afraid, because here and there a few anecdotes would try to make some spice with a little flavor. Tormented Guy's peculiar friend tried to be laughable, but instead came as an annoying one. (spoiler) Who is terrible and self-hate to enter a creepy prison in the midnight of this crazy world? No one! If I'm going to make a horror film, at least be convincing. This is something.
