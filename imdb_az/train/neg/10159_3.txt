More widespread, hysterical 50s give a new meaning to hyper-festive, anti-social, pathological behavior. Danza and Grayson will ask you for mercy. <br /> <br /> All the people involved in this film have been killed (or in the dormitories) now. I thought about torturing them. During this time, when I began to shoot an aggressive attack on my poor, unprotected ears, I felt all my vitality sudden and severe pain. This curved muscular vibrato can divide Soviet tanks into small pieces, nevermind glasses. <br /> <br /> "Why did not you change the channels you did not want to want?" You can ask in anger. Fair point, fair point ... The answer I wanted was, but the pain was very sudden and exciting, so I fell to the ground and suffered. <br /> <br /> I tried to reach the far distance with my last energy ounce, but could not. <br /> <br /> An orange little fisherman, discovered by Niven, who has the ability to sing songs with an irresistible opera, then "pigmalionize" him. Lanza is in love with asymmetric Grayson, but she is unexpectedly respectful until she finally closes. It might seem like a very thin area, but this noisy movie is full of music that says it's not just about any dialogue. This movie is RELENTLESS. Do not forget to torture hippies and war prisoners with the Slayer's Blood in Reign (as in South Park episode). No matter how little talk about this strange 50s, the foolish adults in the musical world are all teenagers - as if all 6-year-olds are growing. I can participate in people who like films that are so funny. It's a very easy thing to do: a curious world only opens to me that just like a funny comedy like a comedy, a mind can give the old mouth a pleasure. <br /> <br /> But let's take a look at this phenomenon, music of the 50s. The best I can imagine is that in the 50s, musicians gave us an idea of ​​idealists dreaming about daytime utopia or paradise (depending on whether you are going to church or Lenin's grave) or at least a favorite version of these fantasies. inspired places. TTOO comes to represent the hell more, but it's just me. I do not look like "buy" music. People talk, there is a story - but suddenly everyone starts to sing in about 4 minutes, after which they suddenly calm down and pretend not to do something unusual! When you think about it, music is more strange than any science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> Worse, TTOO (my favorite pizza type, btw) is only 50s musical but has an opera signal. Opera is no longer a means of bringing the taste of the listener, until the point where it has become a weapon into an ear, proving something like a training. The most obvious example of this transcendence is the time when Lanza and Grayson combine the Dark Side vocal forces into a truly unbearable duet. I tried to reduce the volume. I downloaded it from 18 to 14. Then from 14 to 10. Then I downloaded 8. It's usually heard with certain types of dogs and marsupials trained, <br /> As you hear, I heard these two donkeys! <br /> <br /> Take the stage in a small boat on the river. Danza begins with his deaf, brain-dead melodies and then ... nothing. No animal can be seen. Even the deceased crocodiles have been abandoned. If you look closely, even the color of the trees varies from green to yellow. No, this failure was not a mistake, the fluora was plain old torture. And these trees were only matte paintings! <br /> <br /> Think about how the real trees will react. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, when a high knight is scattered at a high C above, the glass shades are not with the waves and the physical laws of the frequency, because the glass is a single person - it can only hurt itself without committing suicide because of spontaneous self-explosion. Within a few hours, I can listen to at least a friendly band band, but I can give a minute soprano and give it a headache.
