Silly, simple and short, GUN CRAZY (VOLUME 1: SEVEN WOMAN) does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> This short (sixty-minute) fairy tale is more inspiring than the classic spaghetti western. Sam Raimi's shaking is a call to QUICK & DEAD (acknowledges respect for spaghetti westerners). After Hurricane Stone's character, the fate of his father who was in his hands (Gary Sinise's brief community), he was a real sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) accidentally hit him in the head. GUN CRAZY, looking for revenge against Saki (played by Ryoko Yonekura), a loyal Mr Tojo (played by Minimalist Appeal by Shingo Tsurumi), he put his father's fate in the hands of a child; she let her foot out of the valve, and the beloved ole grandfather pulled out of the semi-truck and drowned. The only significant difference to the settings is tojo sadistically with Saki? <br /> <br /> In short, Saki? Clint Eastwood's pale imitation called "Man with No Name"? dragged into the city? basically a car shop and an American military base, so why is it enough for a city? The criminals who have been violated by Tojo, who have not given any reason, or have been ridiculed for reasons not investigated. Taking the true self as a bounty hunter, Saki takes the locals in shooting at finger flips than choreography Johnny To and John Woo. Of course, the end of the film, Saki, put an end to fair torture in the hands of the bad guys, but he rallied on occasion? kneel, a surprise at last a funny attempt? <br /> <br /> <br /> Look just for yourself. <br /> <br /> Image quality is average for DVD freedom. In several sequences, there is one mouth quality, but not all of this is a bad transfer. Sound quality sometimes falls somewhat, but still not a bad transfer. <br /> Instead, it's a bad movie.
