I was surprised by many female voters who made this movie the best brand. My idea of ​​this movie was to target audiences with adults and men. Wounded and tortured women, miserable revenge and high body count are the typical items included in the movie history by the spaghetti subgenre. Opening and handling DJANGO is rip-off. SHOOTER, but there is no style, e.g. DJANGO. Accountability, action, and cinematography are the best mediocre, but place where you look for the above items. And actors do not have Italian accents. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
