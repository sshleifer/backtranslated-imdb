Yes, yes! ... No, Pintilie does not like to rob her actors and show her privacy. Pintilie says the naked "emperor" - so to speak ... <br /> <br /> It is a great time to express someone's truth. This disobedient curve is a brat that is locked in the corpse of an old man. The abundance of naked scenes does not have any artistic legitimacy.

Did you know that with the kit "Niki Ardelean" he embarrassed the poor Coca Blossu: "Oh, Coca, what would I want for you?" She is a very kind and sensitive lady, and she is shamelessly embarrassed - for her little satisfaction!

Does anyone have the moral values ​​to demonstrate this truth?
