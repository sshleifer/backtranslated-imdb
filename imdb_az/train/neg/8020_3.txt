There were some beautiful poetry bits, but it's really just an artistic-fartsy, without any direction and resolution. How do these people get the movie school? Who gives them money to do evil? it could have been a great actor, and I've always been like Fairuza Balk, but the sub-rock metaphor, looking down on the empty place that can not find anything, is very tired and good movies. the director must go away and live in a good time and do not come to the camera as much as he really wants to say. This is a combination of mastery, as a craft-spaghetti-walled school school, and hopes for hope, this poetry emerges. if the director really has any kind of vision or if there is a brain that knows when the potential exists, it will work, but here it is not the empty filler. After touching on me, I felt the lazy moments and when it came out, you said "hard bastard" on the screen.
