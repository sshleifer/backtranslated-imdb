This Hitchcock film is far less similar to its subsequent release movies, and much more like an old fashioned moral tale. They believe that some young children will bring happiness. They spend money traveling around the world and living in a very hedonistic existence. However, after a while, anxiety begins to emerge, and couples become worn out and become illusory. But nowhere, in a luxury cruise ship, the boat sank and they lose everything and eventually they are happier because they appreciate their lives! Strange, nervous and fairy movie! Personally, I would like to learn how to take over all this money and make me miserable! <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are relatively poor compared to production afterwards - a rough movie with poor sound quality and more amateurs.
