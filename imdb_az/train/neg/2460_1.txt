I really like this movie, but it did not give me any chance. It is primarily intended to be a Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, but fails to fail. Some school projects have been written and operated by high school students, and this is at the level of humor. There is nothing modest and intriguing, it never feels like a documentary. <br /> <br /> A few days before the conversation, this is advisable for people like "comedy" in the "Big Momma House" or "Norbit" vessel; The words "butt" are naturally hysterically laughable. Other people should stay away and do not waste their time.
