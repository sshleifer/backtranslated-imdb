I watched several episodes of this show and, considering the medical facts that can be studied, I found some elements of it very interesting. But it was completely thrilled and immersed in the immoral relationships of the show's characters. Everyone, though in a ridiculous, unacceptable working time, appears to have slipped into nearly everybody's sleep. The whole show does not have a solid, lasting marriage or relationship - everyone is split and deceitful - a true reflection of all Americans. Indeed, there is no disrespect for marriage or monogamy, and it's really complicated. <br /> <br /> Then, we are presented with infinite spiritual "dilemmas" and they do not agree with all the conscious conscientious management and special practitioners who are generally dissolved in a way that does not betray anyone. For example, in one of the latest episodes, a baby born with an unspecified breed was rarely presented and Addison refused to do so because we can decide later on to the baby. <br /> <br /> <strong> The number of people living in the Caucasus dropped. <br /> <br /> Addison was awarded a single black character, which does not allow anyone to give up on this issue and forbids morally abortion. General feeling, if you resist abortion, you are a stranger - a popular feeling in the United States. Two of the main characters in the show are unusual: Women have been aborted when they are younger, and they have no apologies or regrets, despite the fact that women are exposed to severe depression. A younger woman comes to the clinic for abortion and then goes on to the squad and tells her how this young man has helped, and that's something like a joy. Planned Parenthood. <br /> <br /> All this is an inexpensive show where there is not much in the future, unless you give a realistic relationship to the fabulous soap operas and a whole range of medical conditions. all show
