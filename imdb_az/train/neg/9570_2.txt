For the first time in years, I felt I needed to access the IMDb today to clear myself by writing a review of this movie. The area I was reading was awesome, I was expecting a mysterious tension and a claustrophobic fantom. Unfortunately, all this is a mundane, exhausting love story and a lot of delusional and gothic teeth infected by "diabolism" - something that is not said to be-nothing-bad-movies. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ font> This is simply the laughing key. No, in fact, it's angered. And lazy. <br /> <br /> In this regard: The cheap excitement. <br /> <br /> - The main characters. Indeed, the scenarioist real-life experience did not come from the real people, but instead of gaining all the information from bad movies. Hence, his symbols are dull, lifeless second-generation clich√©s. They are simply plots of space, without the slightest part of personality. They are "men and women who are separated from one another". I have never seen anything other than 100,000 films, and it's more realistic or unpleasant. Think of the moderate two-dimensional Hollywood ride and get it. <br /> <br /> - This movie does not have a character that is fresh, attractive, or exciting. <br /> <br /> - It's a mistake, the "resolution", which is too bad, because the film is a boggy that can not go anywhere. No longer do you care for yourself, no matter how much you have already done. <br /> <br /> The last third part of last year's movie was sent quickly, because it was hard to watch. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's it. Regardless of the features of this movie, all of them are embroiled in incompetence. Do not watch this bird.
