Probably the worst Dolph movie. There is nothing you want or what you expect here. Do not waste your time. Dolph plays a miserable cop who does not have any interest in life. Her brother is killed and Dolph tries to understand things. The character is simply perverted in a foolish and purposeless manner. It's meaningless.
