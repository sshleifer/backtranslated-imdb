<br /> <br /> Kathryn was surprised to see what this blackmail was all about, and was surprised that he received 7.9 degrees from Oscar and IMDb from today. Bigelow really should be the best film for this kind of really bad movie and be the most successful filmmaker to win the best Oscar awards, and why? An absolutely non-realistic "cowboy" bomb-destroying human-story means something for someone that I have not seen? Why did I continue to get a mental picture of the restoration of some old bad West movie about a cowboy who made "courageous deeds" in the United West West infected with the "evil" Red Indians? but this time in a different background has been identified? Oscar was given because the director had left James Cameron and made a good story of gossipy for the daytime television shows? <br /> <br /> Or was it the clothing syndrome of many emperors - did most people know that they were disobedient, but could not even say that because others could not speak? <br /> <br /> And finally, a high-resolution, super-slow-mo, as well as a "deep message" or something to convey the dropping shell of the sniper scene? What is happening on the EOD children's line will suddenly create good snipers and will always get bad terrorists? Do not know if there were so many bits and pieces in it and there was no obvious reason to be compressed in the movie? <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this, do not waste your money on tickets. Wait for a few years to work on the TV. Do not miss too much.
