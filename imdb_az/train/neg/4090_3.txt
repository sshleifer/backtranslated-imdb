Shlock-merchant Leo Fulci makes a change of speed by replacing the bare, sophisticated sword and magic fantasy movie, replacing the subtle, simply related horror. <br /> <br /> An unusual Ilias of Ancient Greece, Orlando Bloom, is a place that combines hunting with an animal exposed to warfare. worm-men and mutant minions are a vampire topless bad sorceress. Wackiness occurs. The magician puts pressure on domestic Cavemen and wants magic for himself. At the end of the winning heroes, the oppressed caverns are hit by various minions and, more recently, weaker. Does this movie have a steady flow of WTF? elements and moments. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the whole movie is gently emphasized and the picture is further blurred with the presence of permanent smoke. This is an attempt to create an atmosphere or to hide how everything is fraudulent. In either case, it failed. There is no atmosphere, if this is not surprising and gentle, and does not hide how everything looks. The slave slave resembles a poor man's hand. For some reason, when the director was attacking, he fell in love with our heroes, shooting at least six million dollars in Man's style. Probably, there is a lot about these shots throughout the film, and it's hard to go every time. Other minions of superfluous magicians are some of the pellet white mutants that appear to be covered with trees, other than people with general skin coats. Unnecessary say they are slow and unthreatening, and as the gay Equality Hispanic they hear, the voice of Daleks. Fighting is stylted and not convincing, and special effects are gained. <br /> <br /> Yes, the music would be embarrassed to use Dr. Kim's users that are cheap synthesizer stuff. <br /> <br /> Elijah, our heroic hero is gentle and unforgettable. She is especially visible in her midriff, looks full wuss with a leather outfit and big hair and is a clear moron. Of course, his dynamite shot with his magic summer, but he takes three to four arrows with him on his mission to fight the evil of the whole continent. In a few minutes, we should not say that he fled from his arrows and should be saved by the traditional sword and magic hero Mace. When he talked to Elijah, he claimed to be a friend of himself, building himself as a lacquer, but you are talking about the secret homoerotic subtext day and night, so they run together in the smoky hills. Mace promises that Elijah will meet her with the blessings of the summer. Elijah asks where he is going. "If my legs took me away," replies. Good enough for Ilias. Mace is also an animal lover and a ugly double. By referring to the traditions of the people as they understand people's superiority, they declare their great love and affection for animals. He says that he will hunt and kill a beast to feed himself, but he will steal flesh after he has hunted animals. Not casual killers of innocent victims for any reason. Shortly after they talk, Ilya's test is over, and the movie takes place at the head of a few casual voices, and Mace kills her. There is no sign that Elijah, who claimed that this poor spirit did not do what he deserved and even regretted a more moral and cultural society. <br /> <br /> The villainess of films is quite unusual. The entire film is completely naked, except for the g-string and the gold mask covering all its head. In addition to giving Fulcya the mandatory T & A part of the movie, she decided that she had a lot of butter in the last minute. He, as you can see, enjoys plenty of time by enjoying the pet snakes and designing a springboard with a man dressed like Elijah. Wow, that kind of symbolism! If he later did not eat Elijah and Mace and killed himself in the film, he promises to make himself a slave of some ancient warrior friend. Even the most terrible villain in the world is not really a step to women's rights. In my opinion, he combines the curly creatures inside our heroes, and there is no one else around Mace, but for Mace in a foolish state. Was not he really worthy of respect for Ocron? <br /> <br /> Are there several WTFs? moments. Most of them come to the end of the film. Elijah says, why I forgot, he probably got his hair hair mussed, but he understood the mistakes of his ways and went back to fight the forces of Mace. Suddenly, for some reason, summer is looking for more than one target fireflight. If necessary, bolts can also be hit by rock. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to say that the troops of the evil men occupying Mace are a short work. <br /> <br /> The surface is also very unusual. Mace uses Ocron's remaining forces to target springs laser attack capabilities. It can use Ocron to rock with more than a mile distance. He begins to die. Her mask reveals a ugly Muppet leader. She turns a strange dog around the shouting and walks with another dog. Mace smiles. Roll Loans. <br /> <br /> Unusually strangely enough, it is so frustrating and focused on the low-cost budget sword and magic movies. Everyone who sees the magic of the Kingdom of Lost can tell you how truly these movies are really unusual and worthwhile.
