I am a great admirer of the Westerners, but this is something, a stinker! I think he did not look like he threw me. I can write a better dialogue than I was in the eighth grade. And poor actors! In view of this terrible dialogue, no one was in a ridiculous situation. Indeed, I am not deceiving. Some of these are better than you are in an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. Perhaps this movie was a "big" star, but if you say B-West, then it's a praise. Maybe it should be B-minus West. Pity Sterling Hayden, co-starred by Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other great talents. <br /> <br /> An annoying thing about this movie means that all men look shimmering. a week and all of them are greasy. I know that the children in the Old West were not always well-groomed, but it's a movie that anyone wants to go to "EWWWW"! Undoubtedly this is a strange West. Denver Pyle was forced to live on, especially after appearing in a very large West. Bad, bad movie.
