This movie belongs to a very young girl, Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller), heading from your family to become a first-year college student. One night, Cassie and her friends decided to go to a wildlife drinking and dancing caf√©, and Cassie set off with her beloved lover, but did not say she did not like it. Like a Cassie's driver, a car stopped in the middle of the road and could not prevent an accident and eventually had a bloody loss of life with her boyfriend. Cassie has a very emotional affliction and has a nightmare with her lover who is causing trouble with his wife and wants to be killed, and she learns who she really is, wants her death, and she's a horror threat. Cassie says she loves her love and asks for her love when she finds another boy in her bed after she dies. It's a way to get out of the movie and it's not very good.
