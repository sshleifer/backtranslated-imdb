Dough, several times betrayal - is the end result of Madhur Bhandarkar's last work - Page 3. Does not have any reviews - just the surface of the stereotypes, funny excavations. What about the movie? There is no time for anything else to report a group of people involved in attracting and developing profiles in life (types called these). Or there or from it. There are no press releases for everyday events. Madhur Bhandarkar is the main newspaper and only forgets that it is an extra; maybe it's fun to check who is and what it is. Do not mix the two sides. And then there is a power game - it will happen every time of life. So what did you say at the end of this all - nothing - a few rude jokes that shot less films in another direction.
