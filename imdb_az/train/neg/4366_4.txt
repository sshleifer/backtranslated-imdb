X-Files was a smart, thought-provoking show. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "text-align: justify; The presentation had provided two perfectly good episodes to expose now ("One Son" and "Requiem") and had a dramatic increase in the 7th season barrels, causing inconvenient or thought-provoking episodes. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " After the "Patience" that stands out, the episode sees a strange parasitic bone with the help of the power of worship of a weak Christian, Oh, and they think it is the second income of Christ, but you understand it in the last few minutes. one time * no s Do not try to figure out what the bone is, why it's happening or what's going on, even in the early hours of the show - in fact, then in a little deeper, slightly in the background, or vice versa - a little mystery , some uncertainty about what to do about it. <br /> <br /> That Scully really kills her. It may not stick with silliness of goodness, but it is not strange to watch as a smart skeptic, which has been transformed into a completely clean shade to make a progressive advance, with a well-developed character within 7 years. You feel as if you are watching some conscious young fear, and then throws her thirsty child into a torn isolated society, and throws itself into the stereotypical hicks or the very best part of one's worst part, which leads to the profitable prowess. Oh, by the way, the new Mudler, Doggett, is not around. Scully just ran to the stage and was looking at a miserable crime without him. It ends up saving the day - I do not remember - but besides, it is not really. Again serious. <br /> <br /> In short, you feel like a generic script written for another show or someone's pet movie project. , has been showing a long-running show during the most sensitive period. He could have worked on fewer shows where the characters were more archetypal and the audience was expecting less. But X-Files had a good deal, and Scully was one of the strongest and most characteristic television characters of the 1990s. A good fifty or several times when you decide to change your identity for a story in Star Trek is meaningless.
