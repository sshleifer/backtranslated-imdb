How can 4 out of 16 previous voters give this movie to 10? How many of the previous voters can give it 7 or higher? Who voted here? I think it's just kids first - very young children. In fact, this is all bad movies. The story is stupid; It is difficult to think like a functioning player; character is characteristic; and dialogue is awful. I saw this rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. If it is disappointing, I suggest reading it instead of a book.
