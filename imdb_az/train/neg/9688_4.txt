Greenaway films are smart, researcher and play an innovative role. However, his style and grammar create and remind the audience of the filmmaking process: frame composition, mid-size, static camera. It may be good to skip to the mainstream movies, but this is not new. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, like any other "innovative", TS Eliot is more than just a past, waiting for it to be a truly innovative innovator. Nevertheless, Greenaway's biggest failure is that he can not write. His dialogue and even the structure structure are mechanical and unreasonable, but another dramatic logic, without Brechin's vitality. This is where humility is most clearly understood in his humor and illogical humor, and before that jokes die before it is over. The result is something unsuccessful: if it does not respond, please contact a stand-up comedian to justify their actions. Probably, the filmmaker we were learning was able to learn something from humor in Freud. Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenawi has manipulated actors for years to work as a clone. <br /> <br /> This film is meretrical, despite its design and lighting.
