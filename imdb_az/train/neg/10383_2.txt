If you do not take it seriously, this can be one of the most enjoyable movies. It's a little dated and the effects are lame, but it's very nice. There are giant crabs attacking a girl. oh, and crabs read Japanese. It's strange bad. And the last one telegraph throughout the film is terribly afraid. We can predict but if you see the last fight, your seat will be rounded up. Do not even give this movie a chance and you will love it. Susan George is entertaining and yes, looks bare. The daughter is not worthy of extremes, but she is attacked by gigantic crabs. They are the size of big cats. This is 2, but I love it. As a movie my God, but for fun, I give 7. Are there giant crabs?
