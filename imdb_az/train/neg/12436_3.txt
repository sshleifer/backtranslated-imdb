The First Home was just a decent film ... it was quite the same in a new situation later. It works to be genuine and succeeds to some extent ... Of course, the formula is basically the same, so it's like watching the same movie for a third time with a slightly modified plot. The new score is very bad (although the new "regulator traps" were exciting and different, except when nothing else), especially compared to the first big score, and almost not quite, quite good score. This is (almost) a series of pretty good non-original music, but it's not the same. The site is fair and franchise, but it is still the same two films, a worse player and a less impressive example, "terrible character is good." Acting is more unimpressive. These characters are mainly cartoon characters. New thieves are less entertaining than old ones (and they attract seductive things, and this punishment is limited to a limited number of penalties). The more they are (and more and more traps) the weakest attempts to rise to a higher level than the first two films ... and they do not work. The idea behind the thieves and their mission also makes a great impression ... for an adult and serious adult (and for the first time in a series, sex jokes or two). Generally, as is the field, this is an unnecessary complex. I can follow it, but I doubt from a child. Some of the expositions are clearly conveyed even by such children's fools. Animal stuff is generally not fun. There are fewer siblings, there are more developers there, but fewer than the first two films. Generally, it is not particularly good or you deserve to be watching, actually, to watch the murderer who is harming the violent film. I only recommend this to the great fans of the series. 3/10
