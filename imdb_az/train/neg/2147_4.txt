The original is truly a relaxing hour with truly memorable animated sequences. <br /> <br /> <strong> Not the best of DTV's next, unfortunately, the continuation, the sparkle is not completely. <br /> <br /> The biggest frenzy is the lack of story. Like the Belle's Magical World, the characters are explained through a series of vignettes. Magical World is marginally good, yet manage to make a mess in the story. We see mice in the work of Vignettes, and I personally think that Jag and Gus Antics are an invaluable work of this film. <br /> <br /> The first vignette is best, being Cinderella to be a princess. This is the best, because the mice were funniest here. The worst of the cases, when Jaq is turned into a human being, is sometimes cute, but not conceivable. The last vignette was cute when Anastasiya fell in love. It was a problem, I could not imagine being friends with Anastasia Cinderella because I thought that she had come from her parents. <br /> <br /> PomPom's lover, Lucifer, was also affected by a more ridiculous subpoder. I enjoyed listening to casual music, but I hated the songs, they were really thirsty, beautiful Tchaikovsky inspired the melodies of the original. <br /> <br /> Here the heroes were the strongest development. While still caring for Cinderella, she lost her sincerity and lost her original appeal, though she was wearing very beautiful clothes. Duke really had funny moments, but it was not enough to save the film, but also with Prudence and the king. As I mentioned, the mice were the rewarding feature of the film because they just helped to cut the film. <br /> <br /> In general, the animation is colorful and above and above, and its sound is surprisingly good. <br /> <br /> Generally, a sweet, non-singing song, a story. 4/10 for mice, moving sound, animation and some nice clothes.
