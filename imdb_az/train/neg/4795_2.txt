It is apparent that this was the only film that John Saxon directed, and then stopped and stood in front of the camera. This film is a puppy from start to finish, and it's boring and boisterous with nothing to do with it. A Vietnamese war hero takes a job for a boss allies, gets a little friend with his wife, and then his wife was killed by mobs himself and the hero of the war, and was sent to the ranks, especially prison. Now this special prison has been tested on prisoners and testing a formula that transforms people into the ultimate killing machine. Of course, everything goes wrong, and then there are all those traumatic illnesses in prison, some of them turn into zombies, and do not want to be there more than once. It's just going on and above nothing to show or show myself, and I've stood up for a long time seeming to come a few times, but it's just a different and equally boring way. If they look at each other, they can be zombies themselves, so they do not risk it. 10 out of 2.
