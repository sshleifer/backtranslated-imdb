I first met this movie, Brooke Burke (like Jill), and I first met LA in modeling trade in the first movie. I thought he was more, but I thought his role was very good. It's not surprising that he has such a beautiful and loyal television owner and model. I was wondering why he was killed and what happened. <br /> <br /> I'm not really sure of the genre of this movie, and I felt as if it were for a collective audience. Taking into account the horror, I tried to keep an open mind, it was not my favorite genre, but felt like it came out of the gags. <br /> <br /> As you drag in some places, you predict some of the powers of a bad professor and, like many other films, have been an unpleasant end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> In summary, I found something interesting, but it was a satisfying patience and it was not over for me. Jill (Brooke Burke) will return at the end of the portal and finish everyone's donkey and get a higher rating.
