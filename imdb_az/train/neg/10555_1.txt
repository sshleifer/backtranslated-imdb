Above all: I love the good Splattermovies and I am not afraid to contact art, but this is no zero budget bang! The picture quality is so damn that the soundtrack is the most annoying person I've ever heard (!!!!) and, like the FX, the super quality is some of the worst of them as they are in a real movie (this is not junk here). I'm thinking that they count about 10 sentences in the whole movie, each with a repetition of about 20 times ... which can be the same for many movie sequences, which turned the audience into a hell!) Story it seems that a young man was instructed to follow his father's aggression and kill his mother, to be psychologically damaged, and to walk around one of the elders and to hurt himself. So far so good ... But for those word-art-ethics managers, this area is just a line for putting a series of consistent cheap shock scenes that do not just give a message or a meaning (why the newly-taken intestines are thrown to a naked, naked woman's place ... Why and why is the whole bloody "movie" just a time for a woman and a shooter? Anxiety? Yes! Sick? Yes! Required? No? Art? NO !!!!! This cheap gore show for art anyone who has made a mistake should visit the psychiatrist as soon as possible or explain to see how Pink Floyd's "The Wall" works out a similar topic ... I hope the Last (!!!!!!! Andrew Cobb ... !!!! You know that everything is there with you, remember: everything that looks cheap and obviously does not automatically mean "Art" ...
