I was thrilled to hear about this event after seeing the film trailer and finding Spike Lee's management. At that time, I lived and did not live in New York, so I was expecting a history lesson than anything else. Some interesting activities, sexes, and about a 30-minute movie were related to Samin's Son. In my opinion, the movie is not about Samin's son, but he looked at the summer of 77. <br /> <br /> <strong>
