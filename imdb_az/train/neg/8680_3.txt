I just finished watching this movie and WOW it was bad. In fact, the only thing that watched me was so fun. Heroes' actions were dramatically shooting at gunfire with their unbelievably bad deeds (bad guys just taken out of the street or really actors), delivering too many bad lines, and their undiscovered movements (if they were going to break and shoot one inside a door to enter, obviously it hits it in the doorknob!). This film should break some records for the worst recorded and delivered lines <br /> <br /> The camera job is really bad - you can complicate the events in the battlefield because of the opening of the cameras and the vibration. / / <br /> I would have voted "1", except for Chiba and sidekick Sue Shihomi, and I enjoyed several scenes: 1) breaking a human's weapon, coming out of the bone 3) Sonny Chiba, with a fingertip Performs a tear eye surgery. <br /> <br /> I'm really a great fan of Sonny Chiba, but it's not really worth the time. I've seen 7 or 8 of the movies, and the only ones who have come to the conclusion are the Street Fighter series and Killing Machine (and they are great!). I also heard the Stacker and Golgo 13 good. I advise you to stick them.
