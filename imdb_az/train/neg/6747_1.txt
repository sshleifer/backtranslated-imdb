Wow ... I can not say a lot for making this movie silent. The lid on the local video tape said all that ... Nothing more than the six actors / actress who lost the Scream on the set and decided to shoot! <br /> <br /> Acting, in fact, was a budget, but they could be worthy of nudity and good-looking actors! Most of these lines should go somewhere where this table is read, remembering that the style on this item is almost here. Only 4 or 5 is killed by a masked killer and a realistic club of silent leading actresses is killed by a dark contact with the Murder Club (only that <br /> <br /> I feel bad about people who have taken the movie, and we are reminded to avoid being overly surprised by a similar movie, and no one will be able to get away from them. .
