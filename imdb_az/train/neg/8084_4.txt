I chose this title from a friend who was sitting in a comprehensive DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so I did not pay for it personally. I thought it would be a bad movie, but as I know, after seeing a child like her, I'm not sure what a really bad movie is, and what's amazingly strange creatures that kill me and turn into zombies. <br /> <br /> The sun crisis is bad, but some films do not reach the absolute point of pain. <br /> <br /> By the way, the general structure of the Sun is a great sign of the sun, which will destroy it. In order to reflect this danger, humanity has set up a spacecraft and crew, throwing an atomic bomb on the agenda of the task (the opening is called "the biggest explosive"), with some rude science fiction. <br /> <br /> < Ensemble's Speech (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle, and Jack Palance) <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> Solar Crisis can withstand a medieval level of difficulty, thanks to a time that begins with a simple start, but gradually becomes increasingly unusual. <br /> <br /> A treacherous character that is insistent on sabotaging the mission of the film's titulus achievement (played by Boyle). With no undisclosed tools, the woman's management sends an evil minion with a shameful, unpleasant hairstyle to carry out a series of uncertain electronics witches on the genetic engineering expert of the space crew played by Annabel Schofield. Why is he sabotaging his job? In addition to his moronic aspect, he believes that the flame will not happen and, if this is not the case, he will become rich because he has brought his bad claws to the stock market. <br /> <br /> The structure of the film is very strange and develops very slowly, with only the use of symbols that are only indefinable or inappropriate short-term roles. story line. I can sit here and explain in detail what the scenarioist really does not have to create a field that he or she clicks or keeps in mind, but here's where I'm writing this review in Microsoft Word, and I know that you will get three pages and I will succeed in losing your interests . But then you still get the same effect without watching the movie. <br /> In any case, the film was hardened by a very bad dialogue. Imagine that everything in Star Trek Enterprise has thrown a fantastic jargon to make the characters move forward. Yes, I know they are doing it now, but all of them use it as they do and use the viewer to create indefinite and indefinite scenes that do not cause any excitement, tension or interest. > <br /> <br /> This is a good example of a Zero-G environment when a character suddenly turns into a metal box before it starts to weep before suddenly a few minutes before the explosion. The scenario tells the story of a previously exploded character, but it does not have to be difficult to answer any and all of what's happening and why it can not really run. In all, you have a sad cross between the strange and the laugh. <br /> <br /> Then there are several scenes that dramatically did nothing. Jack Palance's performance is spent on a character that serves only her boyfriend (asking) around the desert before being beaten by a suit and killed. In the bed of death, Palance finally spoke of his hero's last name, a terrifying fruity makeup that puts a balloon under his eyes like someone who used to keep silent. Colonel Travis J. Richards. After the child has ended, he repeats silently and explains to the audience that the film is of the utmost importance. Undoubtedly, Charlton Hester's clever admiral character recognizes him, and after repeating his name, the plot will go. Anything. <br /> <br /> No. Sorry. At the moment, just as in the career of Palance, there will be a stain in the Palance career, and you will be hoping to get one of the most miserable and unsuccessful attempts to create a plain and hackneyed drama. <br /> <br /> Filming is a painful end to Schofield's commitment to sinning in the sun center. has one of the most well-known visual effects sections of the film, even though it's a careful care for them, it always looks as hard as the movie actually is. <br /> <br /> The most inconvenient budget on this film is a british, unhappy incident and a closed helper behind Boyle, Heston, and Palance. /> Rank: D-
