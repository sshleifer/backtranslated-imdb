It's worse than the terrific Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 1960s. They were terrible, but at least they were the simple propagation of Stan and Ollie restoration. The new audience re-introduced the couple's comedian genius, and the cartoon was a garbage that labored to make money for the children's interests. Should be expected. But even if I try to complicate it, I can not even say a word. I want the producers to hope for another Laurel and Hardy to revive, but it is a true and attractive piece of work that the past can not inspire. Impressionists (I'm hesitant to call them actors) make and act on the Vegas action. The area is relatively strange compared to what used to be used in the old days and tries to extend the two-reel ideas for a feature. I'm convinced that in the case of REAL Laurel and Hardy, one of the first people, the audience believes that the communication between the original couple remains intact. The only movie that you hate the worse than me is in my times. And, you know, this film makers have done the same thing for Stan and i.
