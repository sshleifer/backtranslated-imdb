Rodney Dangerfield is not the main character of this movie. He is in a difficult situation. Undefeated jokes dominate the clock. One working rod is that one character is called Jerk Off. There are many erotic jokes that have an erection in some of the punch line. This film is funny because Kirstie Ally's English accent is convincing. <br /> <br /> This film started as a weak movement movie: a five-minute backstory story and then bam! Unfunny jokes. However, in addition to the horrible story, the film is also poorly oriented and the player is strange. Also, this film is an old bad comedy clich√© with very well-known B-movie actors. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfrid, Randy Quaid and Phil La Mar. Although these are billed as the main character, they are more time consuming than Rodney. Do not be surprised to sell this movie at a $ 5 store. Even that is a lot.
