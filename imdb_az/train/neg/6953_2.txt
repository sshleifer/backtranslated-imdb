Rating: From 10 to 4 <br /> <br /> Over the last six months, as this mini-series approaches and the Sci-Fi channel continues its pepper show with BG ads. <br /> <br /> As I learned more, I felt an increasing turmoil. <br /> <br /> Different people go to different things, just as with any cinematography that runs until a test. From this point of view, when people think about Battlestar Galactica, they remember different things. For some, there are chrome fighters with red light on the visor. For others, it is their love for the special effects that evolve into their time. In the late 1970s, especially the special effects of television, many forget. Some memories are solved around the storyline. <br /> <br /> Of course, how do others remembers the relationship that helps others overcome the challenges they face? <br /> Of course I'm coming from the last group. Battlestar Galactica's nucleus were people taken together to save each other from a wicked empire. Yes, it's bad. Cylons did nothing to win, but did so despite the destruction of human race. While returning to base stars, men and women came face-to-face with limited resources and were able to live up to the next show. They did not live because they had better technology or more fire. <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "<br /> <br /> The authors of this current image did not understand this, the most important part of the show, the character names and the story arc and the television science has made nothing less than a reinvention of science fiction, since they have the goal of being able to judge for what they have done: failure.This was a reinvention, is one of the deepest types of science fiction attempts for a long time: liberated from ST: TNG, ST: DS9, Babylon 5 and even Battlefield Earth. <br /> <br /> Ronald D. Moore has been a renowned scientist for over a decade, was one of the most influential television science fiction television companies, and one of the challenges he faced was that there was no conflict with the crew of Enterprise D & E. The Roddenberry's ST inviolable record TNG: As long as those who did not follow that rule, Ron Moore had forgotten some of the lessons he had learned with a well-known scientist: Gene Roddenberry. Instead of writing the best possible story here, he has created a dysfuntional game that I have seen to create as many conflicts as possible. Dysfunctional, while others were not even convincing. Everyone in the army knows that a few days after a senior officer does not attack, they will not be in "hack" for a few days, they will be prosecuted and will not be able to pick up the next day. <br /> <br /> The thing I remember most of Ron Moore's previous job was Capt's death: James Kirk. He killed Capt Kirk and killed me for Battlestar Galactica.
