<br /> <br /> The most difficult thing about the White People is that they have a great potential. For several years I have lived in the area reflected in this film; race tension was high and basketball meant everything for everyone. The film about the members of this "basketball culture" might have been a lot of fun, but the white men did not leave anything mediocre and poor scripted by Job. <br /> <br /> The sequence of events in the film is cyclical. First, Billy earns or loses money by playing basketball. Then he returns home and relaxes with his girlfriends; the process is repeated. Most stories cause a rise, but the "peak" I saw was another sequence of repetitions (in which case "Billy earns or loses money by playing basketball") <br /> <br /> Some dilemmas need to be solved to develop a field; If the film is interesting, this dilemma should be interesting. As it can be seen, "white men" can not jump to forget this rule, as writers can be proven as "Billy should pay bill". I appreciated the speed change from other classic sports movies, but I was upset - it was just terrible. <br /> <br /> However, the White Man is not a failed film. As you can see, some proud sports fans will write terrifying basketballs for a few scenes. Others, I'm sure big names playing a leading role. When it was replaced by unknown actors like formerly and changed to a basketball lacquer, it made me wonder, was everyone concerned about watching this movie? <br /> <br /> I will give him two stars from this movie; additional star "Danger!" It's a few minutes to wake me up. Thanks, Trebek.
