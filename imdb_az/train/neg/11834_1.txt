Let's say with the simple words that creators of this film can have a chance to understand: this is a very dumb movie with an original story, such as dumber scripts, naked animations, and others. Do not worry if you can not find a way to have fun with mentally retarded adults or very slow children. In particular, they laugh, regardless of their health. There is a particular insult in the film - the filmmakers do not think that children think they are clever enough to have fun with the mosquito, which is about zero-effort, but even when one of the adults is entertaining, one can find fun. This film clearly royally sent me off. It's up to you to stooping down.
