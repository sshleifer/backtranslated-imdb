This movie is one of my favorites. It's not really good, but it's okay to laugh. The dialogue can be incredibly horrible and weak (for example, "Manji, can we ask a few questions?" "Believers." "We can answer.") Any fight is almost a matter of fact. Be sure to watch for the cage clever Brock who attacked the main heroes. There are only two lines, but one of the best guys in the movie!
