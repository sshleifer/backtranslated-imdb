This film was able to be a clever, sparkling comedy, but for some reason it took the route. <br /> <br /> Perhaps he did not know who the audience was. But there was not a single man's film about the filmmaking and structure of a film, but it was too much friction and a terrible bloke to turn to women. <br /> <br /> Like the legitimate blonde and its continuation, then it's going to be surprisingly terrible. Great actors like Luke Wilson should expect better materials. Jessica Simpson could handle much more. <br /> <br /> Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller are not entertaining, they have difficulty supporting very intelligent roles. <br /> <br /> Many things in this movie are paint-by-count, various Ã¼ber-clicher assemblies, last minute "misunderstanding" Even the children's chaos. <br /> <br /> If you do not take this movie seriously, you like this movie, but these buzzing may be better than being disappointed. As the scenes go from the past, they are increasingly disappointed.
