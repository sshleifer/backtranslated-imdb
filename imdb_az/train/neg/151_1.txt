This is really a terrible thing. <br /> <br /> This film is only a handmade feature that the next time people asked me what the worst vampire movie I was asking would be appropriate. <br /> <br /> I think that I was pulled over 35 mm, so it's now as soft as hell. I would not worry about commenting, but some fanatics (probably joining the film) claimed to be the best film ever since Matrix. <br /> <br /> There is nothing spectacular in the film. Everything closes. The actress is dirty. War choreography is the worst thing I've ever seen. Battle scenes are incredibly amateuristic. Imagine that a child is turning his weapon into an unattractive time and that it is not a kitten. Obviously, the director took people to the street to play a role. <br /> <br /> I know that the director did not have much of the budget for the film, but had been made better films in the smaller budget than before. Unforgettable.
