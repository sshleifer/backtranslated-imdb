Often often Tobe Hooper saw his bizarre 1974 horror movie "Massacre in Texas chain" and every time he saw a Hooper movie - said that the appearance just shot with a stronger enhancement. When Hooper wanted to produce his own version of Scanners and Firestarter films in 1990, we must end with Spontaneous Burning; a movie with a few good ideas, and a movie that is more loaded than any other movie. Put all this in one place and get a horrible, boring movie that knows how to do the most! The film believes that the audience can only half a point with an interesting story directed at some young people in the early 1990s. The couple has one child and is killed shortly after the experiments on them. She is moving fast for several years, and the baby's name is Sam. but naturally, he finds it as a normal person and soon finds out he is allowed to shoot his desires. <br /> <br /> The movie stars seen as the choice of a good cast Brad Dourif 2 years ago Success with Child Play; but in fact, the fact that the center functioning was really terrible, it was a groundless decision; and does not help to provide terrifying support. Silent direction and jerk do not make the film a lot of kindness and continue with the special effects of the lack of advantages. This is very unreal, and there is nothing left of the movies; All these were done a few years ago. The area was really slow and it was almost an hour before an hour before celebrating it and did not care for me anymore. Soon, the direction of the movie is clearly visible, and all this boils up to the taste you expect. The final confrontation is a great disappointment and nothing is revealed during the movie. No revelation would be interesting at all. Generally, this is a trash film and Tobe Hooper is a long way to being a great horror director. Instead, go to Firestarter.
