This movie is just shame. Orlando, Florida, becomes a more recognizable cinematography area (like the rise of Vancouver). Brothers is filmed in Central Florida, and this short film is a retreat for the region (now it has taken big steps with the great HBO miniseries from Africa to Africa). <br /> <br /> I will try to be as honest as possible. Orlando, I think it's a perfect place for The Brothers. The "Boy Band" had the potential to give a new spin on his nakedness. N'Sync also comes from the Backstreet Boys. However, Brothers may be unlikely to be due to a weak script. Both lead characters have almost no development (some may be amateurs actors, but some of them are, of course, written). <br /> <br /> Both the problem is a joke choice. Most of the pictures are repetitious (they are funny for the first time, but they grow up a bit boring). <br /> <br /> Some of the "Concert" scenes are staged (and many of these scenes do not move the story in any way). <br /> <br /> I had great expectations for myself, a disappointment. I also hope for the best feature of this short outline. But I think the best thing to do for John Beatley is to go to different genres. Comedy is not his strongest claim. However, he claims he is definitely one of the most prominent filmmakers in the Orlando area (which is now conscious, not famous). <br /> <br />
