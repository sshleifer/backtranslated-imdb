I like all kinds of movies, especially horror. <br /> <br /> Despite the events in Syria, despite the conflicts in Syria, there is nothing wrong with investigating the same issues or rebuilding what others have done. Now, the movies have become a police force to take us on a journey through the woods, on a horrific murder scene and have recently been thrown into some terrible family. In these lines, I have to compare Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn (though something similar) and others. Survival falls short of comparable movies. The area is not genuine in any way. Some movies may consist of a special, fx, or other factor that works perfectly with the weak (and deceptive) plot. Survivial does not have any of the bank. If you like, please write the following: The film has never run out of time. I do not beat or blame the actors for this. Dialogue was the best mediocre actor and the actors never showed (did not say what they did not want). I'm recording 2 support. The lead man in this movie, of course, has a look, but he thinks he should get more education without a serious film. <br /> <br /> The actor who described Grace also had the potential, but we have never seen it (why not see the movie, you will not believe it). <br /> <br /> See a mixed movie. Yes, a small part of the magical movie that the film is about to bring to the celebrity days of the film "Grindhouse". In today's film, this has become a gimmick. It either works or does not want to. In this case, it does not just work. There is a lot of other defects, so it does not pay attention to the movie and does not add it. They said that they did a good job to add grain. Here's a good, good quality grain. I think with a different script, better direction, and possibly actors, another "Grindhouse" attempts. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, regardless of the technological aspects, they did not do anything for me. <br /> <br /> As you know, DVs were too soft for me to shoot. <br /> <br /> I want to say about all this .....
