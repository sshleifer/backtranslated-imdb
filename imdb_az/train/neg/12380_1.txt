The creativity of this film has been replaced by terrible special effects only when the writer and the director left a good story line. This movie was directed to entertaining children, but it did not succeed. Many smaller low budget films have the potential to be great movies, but this is not near the movie. Fortunately, this will be another movie and will easily be forgotten. This film was probably a chance to earn some money until the actors' chances played a real role in a good movie. Anyone who respects movies should not view this movie in any way.
