Frequently trusted Leonard Maltin says that this is a "pleasant romance" and Sanders is "superior". Maltin should have blended this movie with something else. Sanders, is snide and droll and perfect? You can imagine the delivery of a line on betrayal: "Sometimes marriage chains are so heavy that they carry three", but this is a non-smoking, wooden, and historic movie that describes this movie more accurately. An autobiography, such as an irrigation thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who is the head of the police, but can resist the fine jewels, is quite entertaining, but he has such an empty history of Hollywood so epic heroes * Marie Antoinette * of course, miserable * Forever Amber * (who screams for a classic colorfulness). In his defense, Sanders works hard to add some depth to his character, but nothing is there. I'm an admirer of Douglas Circus, but it's 1946, and it's one of the oldest American efforts of Sirkin, and there's not much of a signature tissue that identifies its flowering, potatoes that open the chest. The Circus only moaned his feet here and dropped many unmemorable films over the next decade, and he struck us with the "Obsession" * and bombarded us with such an estrogen feces. * All That * is hell, * Written in the wind and * A Living Example. But * Scandal is not the most difficult thing in Paris? a smaller budget connection with cheese sets and an effective suit.
