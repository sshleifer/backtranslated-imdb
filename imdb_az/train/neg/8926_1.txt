When I first came out in 1970, I saw Myra Breckinridge. At that time, the 20-year-old loved the movie and loved Raquel Wales. Moreover, I read Gore Vidal and thought it was very funny. I saw the movie on the local drive and about half way down so I was forced to turn my car's engine so perhaps I would not be forced to see the rest of this movie. It was not "smart" or "fashionable", it was light and clear. The voice of all actors was deaf and the director did not have the slightest idea what he was doing. Mae West's filmmaking was one of the cornerstones of film history. As a reviewer here, the role has nothing to do with a movie or book. The character in the book was sexually assaulted by a young woman and would never be for the legendary Mrs West. No, the plot is changed, as it is more convincing than a 77-year-old woman who is sexually exposed to everyday years. I can continue, but why? It was a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto
