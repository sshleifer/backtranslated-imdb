<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie with extremely low expectations and sadly I can tell you that the film was a difficult one. <br /> <br /> <br / Janne "Loffe" As I love to see Karlsson on the big screen, writers write early in the writing process, and seven people are drowning in the water, not original or funny. The story is very kind and jokes are used and predicted, but those who are not, are simply boring. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <Div> <div> "Findus did it!". <br /> <br /> GÃ¶ta Channel 2 does not need to be seen on a movie or DVD, just wait for air to use on TV and will not take too long.
