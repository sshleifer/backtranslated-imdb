Ye Lou's film Purple Butterfly placed a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) against the Japanese forces that destroyed Shanghai during the war. Ding Hui (Zhang Ziyi) and her ex-boyfriend Hidehiko Itami (Toru Nakamura) find the opposite side of the conflict after a lucky chance. <br /> <br /> I agree with the reviewer from Paris. Movie audiences replace a semi-historic confrontation for a plot without giving it a reason to avoid the characters or their causes. The sudden change of time does not help, as it seems completely unfounded and meaningless. Normally, I do not care about dark movies, but the lack of light, bumps, camera pictures, and generally bad filmmaking make it a challenging movie to really watch and get interested. I agree with the audience I do not think that this film is from Georgia "a chaotic edit style and claustrophobic cinematography", but it does not help the film. In the background of the film has become one of the strongest events of the 20th century, and I do not believe that you can do it as a Michael Bay movie. Absolute melodramatic moments do not add to his expectations. <br /> <br /> All players are a good melancholy. Zhang Ziyi once again shows that he is quite limited, because he spent all the movies watching all the movies in the best of their movies and generally showing off. <br /> <br /> At the same time, at least, it adds a role-like scene to a chain-like and least affectionate scene. <br /> <br /> In general, he sees a film that is very disappointing, especially from Suzhou He's the director. 2/10
