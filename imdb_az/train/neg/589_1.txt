It's not just a smart aspect of the whole movie, but it's hard to get to the stage. (especially when you see embryos on the stage, goggles, and hearing the baby is awful). The cause of the film was considered to be a state of grace where the film was actually tough (for example, it was pitiful, but fun and had made great miracles in the Asian cinema and except for a magnificent film). No one can say that this is a Horror movie because it was more than just scaring the public (showing the face of the Reptiles in the middle of the film was a bad decision); For me (I do not want to apologize) is a human director who dreams of anxiety.
