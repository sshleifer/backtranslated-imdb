Father - Rajinikant will never forget that name. This is a film that has caused its fall. He was freed with frost, but suffered a bad crash and put serious financial losses on manufacturers and distributors. The Rajinijant must pay them personally for their losses. Immediately after his release, he wanted to enter politics but was unsuccessful. It's a terrible film, a terrible actress, poor quality makeup and a miserable scenario. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth resembles a person suffering from some illnesses. I'm not one of the unsuccessful spirits of Father, the first theater show on the first day. The audience was so bored that most of them left the theater before being released. Sorry, I will not recommend this one to anyone.
