Probably not complicated. This and coming up are two of my most recently cerebral films I have ever seen, and both are suffering from the same problem. Dialogue is a fraud. Nothing that comes out of the mouth seems remote. Perhaps there is a way to make this movie feel as though it was built up, but it was unwatchable. And boring. <br /> <br /> I went out after a 20-minute tedium. <br /> <br /> I'll stay with bedroom and banana for Woody Allen's correction. If you come across this on any teevide, I'll try and find Quincy an episode instead.
