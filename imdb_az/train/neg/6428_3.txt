The third I've seen is Errol Morris and I'm increasingly fond of his style. Very interesting and different characters, great personalities to create documentary documents, and then enjoy everything related to language-checking. It's really their caricaturization and Morris, "But these people are really interesting!" Most of the time seems to be part of the time, but there are always such fine little mosquitoes and also inaccurate adjustments <br /> <br /> It is the technique that Morris is behind in the back of them. <br /> <br /> This film is made up of four people who have broken the traditional boundaries of organic separation ... A man with a lion tamer, a beacon with a busy shrub and a robot designer, like a strange ant in Africa. The overall theme of the film seems to turn around the question of the nature of animals, human beings and life? So Fast, Inexpensive and Disappearance does not really mean anything from the movie point ... right? Of course, except for Morris, it is a little worried by the passions of these people (he can say "obsessions") and performs synthetic designs over life. <br /> <br /> I am not afraid of this, and I'm not honest about the relationship that Morris has made in the movie. <br /> <br /> But I'm emphasizing his subtlety. Morris did not worry about the audience's collective headlines when talking about no conversations and leaving the words completely in the interview. Instead, when he is expelled from circus and ants, he often mixes with circus shots and ants, showing that some of these people are collective absurd behind them. I do not think of them absurd, I find them all clean and interesting. <br /> <br /> Certainly, if such an approach is not intended, it is silent instead of a bad artisan. subverter. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see none of these films I have ever seen, and I really do not care about learning what I'm trying to do. <br /> <br /> PololarisDiB
