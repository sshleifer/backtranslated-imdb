This is the worst movie I've ever seen in a movie theater! We will not wait for this to happen. The 12A certificate is issued to further worsen matters, so everyone does not see the flames, but the bodies are smashed, despite the Babban's killing! Many scenes were cut off to bring young audiences because I thought it would be floppy disaster! The Amitabhs had a great deal of work, but 'Ba≈üanti' wannabe and Devgans could not move even another caller who played his wife. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <
