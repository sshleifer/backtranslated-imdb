Imagine that, as he said, 12/1 - at home, you are not tired. These scenarios occurred about 4 or several years ago. I joined the TV and shot on several channels and saw that this was a movie. OH MY WORD is the worst movie I've ever seen! It is impossible to stop a fleeing car (because the brakes are cut or something) through the road - what will happen? This movie was really spectacular - I think the stunts are worth about $ 2, a baby / small child has a situation down the helicopter from the car - an attempt to excite the viewer - a well-placed bridge is approaching ... THIS IS THE BEST BOTTOM OF A MOVIE SHOULD it be that the child shows a loose end to the bridge, but it does not look so bad - you can almost see the look of the slavery used - the whole class of low budget! I remember the end of the movie, but I bet that ALL was great! I doubt that I'll repeat this movie so glad to see this piece of garbage!
