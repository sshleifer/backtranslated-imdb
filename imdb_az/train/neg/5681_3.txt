Having seen and watched a favorite post (yes, I really love it), I decided to try another Uwe Boll movie and chose Toxum because I made a mistake about it on a local DVD store and its the first 10-15 it was very encouraging and seemed to be the beginning of a very unstable psychological tension, but soon dropped it down and eventually turned to at least one. Total slasher films I have ever seen, lots of plot holes, non-realistic emotional reactions and sub-par activities. Boll did his best to get out of the field, but after a while he refused. Maybe you need to sneak into a comedy? The good thing about this film is that it is generally created to create a creepy atmosphere that special effects are better than expected and the overall soundtrack improves the overall atmosphere but its unparalleled pacing is its overall character, Destruction is quite exhausting to watch. There is a very good shock scene, but it appears to be worth the shock alone. <br /> <br /> I hope Uwe Boll will learn something that will make a good movie one day. Because it's very bad movies. Now and then the movie. The seed is not just that one.
