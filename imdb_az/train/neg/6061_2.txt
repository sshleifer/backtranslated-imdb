This part of the horror masters was terrible. As you can see, Mr. Carpenter should learn something about pacing and a decent, meaningful dialogue. There were times when I was proud of what I was going to do. Maybe he is thinking of building himself, but Carpenter needs to return his (or his son) very simultaneously musical score and move things a little bit forward. How many times did the girl say, "No, this baby can not!" and "Oh, or is it coming"? The carpenter takes elements of very good, better movies (the 13th Ground Offensive), and throws it as if it were acknowledged and valued by its brand style. Here deficiencies are real hunger and energy. It's like falling asleep with the filmmaking process. <br /> <br /> For Better Carpenter films, the tested and authentic classics - Sting, Halloween and Live. For better masters of horror episodes, see my personal favorites: Family, Jennifer, and Dreams in Witch House.
