This is a pitiful disaster of a film. From beginning to end, it is full of bad behavior and even worse destinies and adjustments. The only share of the film is that of Streisand, because it is not possible to watch and listen to Kristofferson's parts. The main problem of this film is that Christofferson does not see the nature of his character at the summit or the struggle of Striarchend. First, the decline and the second rise are seen. The final Streisand number has been one of the best finals of the movie if it has been properly directed and corrected. The total weight of the face during the song's life was a big mistake. This figure could have been dynamic and interesting if the group, audience, and scene were shot wide. This movie should be directed and edited to a NYU film school exams. Only the worst thing can be the scenario. The latest music track is the only paid part of this movie, and is completely immersed in error-free technical decisions.
