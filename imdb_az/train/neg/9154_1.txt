BUSINESS. WORST. FILM. EVERYTHING. MADE. <br /> <br /> After watching this unique gay movie, I suspect that someone has rounded up the damaged half-nosed neo-Nazis and has drawn the worst gay movie in some cunning attempt to attack gay culture. <br /> <br /> I came to stop the movie and call a friend because I was shocked when I stopped shocking, suspiciously and strangely in the movie. <br /> <br /> The terrible writing and acting, and the illogical and stupid structure, is a weak film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading a few positive reviews, there is a film that suspects that the writer should have half an IMDb account. Everyone who says this movie is as beautiful as anything else but a liar, or is paid too much to say it.
