Steve Martin must go out of the attempt to remakes classic comedy. It does not completely comply with this section. Out of Towners, like angrily rebuilding, this movie flies flat on his face. Everyone believes that Steve Mart√≠n could be close to Jack Lemmon's performance, so it's the same for me and for the same movie. Dan Ackroyd could play Bilko better. Martin is great in fulfilling his original characters, but attempts to reconstruct others' classic works. The most funny part of a movie is a sad statement when it's on the first line of the movie when the movie ends. "Manufacturers gladly accept the general lack of co-operation of the United States Army," was actually the only line that made me laugh. If you want to see the Real Bilkoon, keep Phil Silvers Show's original episodes. These things should not be wrong, but you are guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this mistake. I placed this movie in the same category as the above-mentioned Lemmon classics and Psycho restoration. None of them had happened.
