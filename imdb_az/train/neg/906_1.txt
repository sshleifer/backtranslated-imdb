Yes, this movie feels real in my life, I understand it and try to watch over 1 hour of my life. The bald man gives me the impression of being a psycho-player and the girl is the worst actress I've ever seen. I believe you believe you appreciate this movie, it requires money that requires a movie to be created, and some movies do not have this money, but it does not cause a stupid field and bad behavior. I always support independent films, but such films give a bad name to such cinema. I'm still traumatized. I'm not going to trust any nice cover anymore.
