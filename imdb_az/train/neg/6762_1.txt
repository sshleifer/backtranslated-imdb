This is a film that everyone should be embarrassed in the film. A weak leadership, a structure that does not leave a point beyond the high level of action and violence. I've seen for the first time perhaps that I was thinking of the media as a satirist and how violent, but it is not. I'm not sure how bad the film is. Oliver Stone is the worst director ever. This film is simply a turmoil from the scenes that Woody Harrelson has no reason, and that Robert Downey Jr is a dreadful performance like Wayne Gale, a seemingly bonkers.
