This movie has never come to theaters in our region, so when it comes to DVD, I'm the first person to rent it. Once I did not listen to the critics and I did it on this subject. <br /> <br /> Despite the perfect line of film actors, the film has been very disappointing. Now we can see why the video went straight. <br /> <br /> I thought I could value it with Bloom, Ledger and Rush. All of them have done a lot of good in the past. <br /> <br /> This film was moving slowly, and never did. I did not develop empathy for characters, and I just had to call for speedy advancement. <br /> <br /> I do not advise you to rent this movie only for "eye candy". It does not even provide it.
