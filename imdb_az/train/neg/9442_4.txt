I tried to love this movie, trying to use all slasher films. How wrong can you go wrong mixing with a bit of nudity and confusion in a miserable way? But I do not think this is an incorrect example of the formula. The main issue is the horrible movement of three main girls staying at home. It seemed as though it seemed to me that it seemed to me that it was a difficult situation. The film is aimed at filming and heartbreaking, but in the direction of the numbers, it attracts them and the film is quite bored. This is a shame, because if the film was done better, it would be ace. The story and characters are terrifying, and in the old home there are dark and strange humorous moments between the mother, the girl and her daughter. Some have good nudity and sometimes splashy blood loss, the film is not enough to give the stroke you need. The award is a pretty bent and scary movie, and it gives a very big elevator to the movie, but, unfortunately, it's too late. So, in my opinion, to escape darkness, if you really love inferior slasher films. There is a fair potential, but the film gives little to it's value.
