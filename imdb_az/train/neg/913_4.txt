Now, OK, let's see. What was funny in the first movie? I know people with fun habits, flooded people, foolish boats and funny comments between the two teams. In this film they did not translate the emphasis to the maximum. Many people are flooded because of indefinite reasons, they are good. Boatcrash, check. We only succeeded in making funny comments between the two teams. There may also be personality tracking in this movie. This film should be about what happens in the water, not on land. I'm sorry to hear that the funny parts are too far away and the film's sponsors are used to the maximum. Not good. Generally, I give the fourth one because there are some funny things.
