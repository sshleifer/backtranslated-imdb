One of Keaton's best efforts was that she could not revenge on the family they had married in Talmadges. A Polish / English barrier and a series of coincidences Buster opens a marriage with an Irish woman, so they behave compassionately, without thinking of becoming a fate (with their father and siblings). <br /> <br /> The Metro has short at least two real laughs - using Buster 's clever calendar, the foolish personalities of turning around the lack of his eating habits are set up here abundantly - gags, and yet fail to pay the main. to bring the meat to the wall and to the main ignorance of the family taken by the plate. <br /> <br /> The first family photo, the whole group slowly collapsed, because the camera triangle has lost its stability. <br /> <br /> Mayan beer can be a catalyst for a massive gags of beer overflow <br /> <br /> The movie writing is clear and clear, and is considered one of the piano, percussion, and sound effects. It's worth a few laughs, not one of Buster's best efforts.
