Only American Pie: Beta House is finished watching, and I must say, it was such a stupid stack. <br /> <br /> As we mentioned in the film's headline, the Beta House is talking about a fraternity, first-year students, girls and their most original part, fall in love. Of course, the man who stays with the shepherd is Stifler, and he and his spouses try to fulfill another seemingly impossible task. It was real and super fake. Its only really predictable and the area is very weak. To see if everything is happening on both sides of the college, to sum it up: terrible player + tricky script + American Pie franchise = misuse = This movie is unbearable. I gave up two of them, though most were naked and beautiful girls, like 2 comic scenes :)
