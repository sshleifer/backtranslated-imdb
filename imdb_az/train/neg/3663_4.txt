The Spanish horror symbol Paul Naschi is one of those stars, one of his weakest fake shadow movies ... but with a moment I carry it with me. Most people will be introduced under WOLF MAN FURY, under his most common television headline, and have been home video version for many years. If you want to seriously think about giving a hard hit, the most widely used edition I go through is the WOLF MAN NOW SLEEPS headline and it is a continental and full European version that restores some trouble scenes. Includes original nuclear imagery missing from FURY's diameter. <br /> <br /> Naski, Waldemar plays Daninski, returned home from a trip to Tibet and said that only one werewolf was cursed and his wife was involved. She cares for her and her lover as an animal, but then becomes a guinea pig for a female doctor and her assistant. As you can see, doc "wolf" tries to break his heart and at least in the original version there is a very strange sado-masochistic love between him and the dark and tortoise Daninsky under the trance. As Daninski fights like a Kurd, in the end, we are in two wolves for the price of one! <br /> <br /> The film's biggest problem is that the director is often drunk (according to Nashi's allegations) and the results are really not very appropriate. While watching the WOLF MAN NEVER SLEEPS image, it does not make any difference, though. The most important of all is the unusual appearance of another of the previous movie (LA MARC DEL HOMBRE LOBO, aka "FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERRORU") and Naschi's predatory werewolves without any reason! Wardrobe clothes change from black to white and style, like its behavior; the worm travels with lethargy in a hypnotic trans of FURY, then grows and runs fearfully from the bloody TERROR. It's really strange.
