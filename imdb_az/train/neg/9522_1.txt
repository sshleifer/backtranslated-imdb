Amazing! Wow! From the early 1980s, I remember many films that were browsing around the middle school. They were usually suspected of conspiracy, and most of the 27-year-old actors acted as pupils. When I watched this movie, I felt a little nostalgia growing in the 1980s. But am I studying this movie in 1989? What did you say? Well, the nostalgia factor ends there, it's just bad. The school's secondary school has a city ready to shut down, and all students are threatened with a bus by the city's secondary schools. Students at this school are both rich and plentiful. In fact, the main character lives in a palace. They are surprised that the school does not have money to keep alive and have not heard property taxes. Oh, but here's the kicker. The school board says students can earn $ 200,000 in cash. Thus, the elderly continue this work. Hmmm, you donate $ 200,000, but if you save money for college, do you put it to a high-grade school? And why are they going to shut down a large number of schools before the end of the year? And ... ahh forget, this movie was foolish and in 1989!
