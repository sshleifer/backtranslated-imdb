This movie is like any other Dutch movie, so you enjoy movies like the Turks fruit and kleine blond pictures. If you can do this (though these are both better stories and actors) Zomerhitte starts strong enough, but a good scene has nothing to do with this story. Nudity is more (but me and others do not find this charming daughter), the dialogue is laughable (as we have done more to the dismay of other filmmakers), and some of the scenes are totally unexpectedly comedy (another random scene ... it's nothing to do with, and once you've heard in one sentence, "I was there." The only reason I gave 2 was that somebody looked so beautiful ... I saw that so we have a hidden preview (in the Netherlands we have a strange system of sneak previews, pays less money then went for a regular movie, and you do not know what's going to be a movie) You know, it's still a new movie that's not in theaters, if you really want to watch a good dutch movie temmink or zwartboek e if you want to.
