If I were not with people who loved him, I'd leave half of the movie. The film is based on real events, but moreover, it really did not. I have some psychological roots, many psychotherapists, and I know serious people, so I do not think of such people. The only characters in the film that seemed to be permanent were Augusten's father (Alec Baldwin) and young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood is an interesting provocation - very sexy with a bad entertaining feeling). There were a few fun moments, but the overall tone of the film was negative, strange and bad. How much we lost a spectacular arm! As I watched their turns, I felt like I was watching an actor class. This was evacuated during the loan. When a few people sat there, they did not work, they did not talk. More than a couple of minutes ago, it was more fun.
