There is only one word for this movie. Terrible. <br /> <br /> Karmichael has Potensiala, but may not be worried about using it like Cray. Sequencing after being involved in a minor crime, Crayin's vision of English youth. Like British writers, this film describes young people who have no desire or respect. Cray draws attention, but not worth it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He thinks the audience does not know the world's cruelty. <br /> <br /> Some actors have smaller portions of this movie. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville also make short speeches. Acting is not another amateur, but young men Joe and Ben freak out. Carmichael creepy by Daniel Spencer. Miranda Wilson plays celeb chef Jonathon (Michael Howe) attractive wife Monica; it is not beyond belief that it can attract itself to such an agony. The film is never frustrating and Monica is exposed to the most severe violence by warfare. War images are used to convey the idea that young people can not help themselves, and weakness movements will even occur in "cultural" countries. This is really true and is a sign of a changing society with men's increasingly important positions, but Cray goes down to the level of barbarian men who are trying to come up with such brutal and violent images. The female characters in the film do not offer any relief. They are both victims or mothers destroys in the work of Manville. <br /> <br /> This is Cray's first film. I listened to what was said at a Q session in Edinburgh and at a meeting and it was not incomprehensible but simply a lack of experience and a film's self-esteem. The film will be released this year, but I hope the company is going bust because the public really does not need such kind of materials.
