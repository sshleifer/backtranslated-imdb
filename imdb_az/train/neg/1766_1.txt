Baldwin really stooped down to make such films. Scenario, music, almost everything in this movie is a waste of time. Sound FX does not sound realistic, they go too far (technical gadgets, etc.) If you try to shoot a movie about such things, at least try to be real with this and add bleeps and beep signals because they work these gadgets do not really make loud noises. <br /> <br /> Guidance appears hopeless for such a low-budget movie (I hope this is turned into a low-budget production) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I thought Baldwine would be a better idea than some Spaniards, that Spanish actors can speak English, we all know that the language is lively and lively, so the performance of actors It is a great deal if a strange language is used. So, finally, how stupidly some of the international actors sound to speak English with a bad accent? The film must have a dead body buried long ago. Does the production team hear subtitles? This film shows the European police as lazy and corrupt, and that the public is sensitive and helpless. I would like to say that the arbitrator can still "Interpol jack," so let's call an American to throw this international syndicate, or something. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures, on the same track as Colombia, only produces hell movies. I think of their self-esteem. Recipients are forced to take every dirty title, because they produce something good every few times a year? Perhaps you should use the same command as Di Que Si - do Do Do. Spanish and Paz Vega and Santy Millan will be doing a decent job for the film's storage. Visible and sounds better! Sony come, sleep, produce less, sell more.
