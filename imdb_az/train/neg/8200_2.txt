This film did not decide what he wanted to be. After a while, there were a few subfields that you thought all of these items would come together ... but they did not. <br /> <br /> If you like the story "Do not forget about frozen waste", it's not the version of the 1950s (not seeing the 20+ years of vision failure). "<br /> <br /> The" INDEPENDENCE DAY " <br /> <br /> The "bare minimum" sets would have been more effective if they had actually hired actors. <br /> <br /> There's so much to do with lots of scenery.
