In 1998, Shaban had been given the right to produce the new Ninja Turtles live broadcast series. Of course, although TMNT was an admirer of the day, it was of interest to me. So, I started watching the show ... it was meaningless to say that I was disappointed with the last result. After some time (later on), I gave a chance to look at the series. <br /> <br /> First, let's talk about some positives. They have re-created Turtles' Lair, as seen in the films, as they have limited budget to this film. In terms of these sets, this is usually a dark atmosphere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Turtle suits, although not the biggest puppet and something, were functional and seemed strong enough for most of the action to be followed in the array. <br /> <br /> Soon, Shredder and replace it with these original villains that can easily be used in a Power Rangers show. However, Shredder can be defeated many times before evaluating the value and intensifying his value ... In addition, most fans do not understand or remember or just plain, actually, Shredder was launched in the first case! Do not wait for countless resurrections to follow. So, from personal point of view, I am happy that I was saved from the Shredder box. Because then the expectations would be based on the point where they would bring it back in a subsequent episode. <br /> <br /> Of course, Shredder works very well in very small quantities, and then matches with Turtles are more memorable. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it shows him, in his opinion, demonstrated by a Power Rangers Ninja Turtles. And with this new magician's structure comes a new woman wizard turtle, lying Venus De Milo. I'll be honest; I've never been comfortable with her. I'm against a woman's idea of ​​turtles; I'm just opposing the ideas of a man using magic and, therefore, remains as a wound between a tribe of ninja turtles appearing outside their territory. I would say that it would easily link Venus De Milo show with enemies who believed in Him, and TMNT had only to provide the star power (or after losing account). Fortunately, all are in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> The next Mutation was frozen in the air after a season and the creators were happy to ignore it. When it's time and maybe another season, I believe that this live replication of TMNT can be anything and a great chance to win. However, although the idea was sound, the performance was defective (though there are a few good episodes in this series). As it stands, the next Mutation Turtledom is one of the most bizarre, the best left buried and forgotten.
