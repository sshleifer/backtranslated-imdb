There are all the elements for a bad night in the movies: dialog biological texno-bamble, chintzy sets, balsa-wood working, horrible late-80s Casio account and Sci-Fi channel scheduling schedule, about 1993. Although "Metamorphosis" has started in many words, the film opens a soft idiocy like Peter Clark Kent "Wannabe" Doctor Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) and his secret designs, but when he experimented with his inexperienced experiment, it turns out to be a particular creature (more like "House of the Cemetery" to Dr. Freudstein.) The FX job is good enough for low budget production (though most of it is stored in the shade for a reason) but in general, despite the hopes of the "Metamorphosis," to shake us another way, I do not agree with the final speeches of a character: "It was a nightmare!"
