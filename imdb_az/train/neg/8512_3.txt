I love silent movies, but it was a bit moronic. As long as we want to, I can not say that I can stand up for it. No version of the movie comes to the book. And do not try on guys, they can be strange. How old was Pollyanna playing woman? 38? I know that the labor law was different from now ... But I WANT TO BE.
