Under the barrel, unobserved, and the WARRIOR WARRIOR can not be ignored practically. On the contrary, this movie looks like the Philippine STRYKER movie and is so far away! Bad fun, information, effects, dubbing, pacing, motion sequence ... The list goes on. In the early 80's, Italy's road warriors were dozens of them, some good and some were bad. This is not the worst, no competition. Only the mood of the film is completely painful and strange, with a half-life experience. At the start of the film, there was a cool shot of 1 (one) good trail sequence and a man exploding a grenade. But everything else about this movie is serious reeks! For genuine post-nuke entertainment, follow a copy of ENDGAME, AFTER NEW YORK, or ESCAPE from BRONX. This is much more pleasant than the rubbish.
