<br /> <br /> This winged film shows that even Gollywood's best can not save a true landfill deposit. <br /> <br /> It can spend a lot of time describing everything that is bad about this effort <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> Donald Sutherland? Why? <br /> <br /> I have to fill more lines to accept this. I have to fill more lines to accept this. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time in this movie. I'm late to do something exciting. Bye.
