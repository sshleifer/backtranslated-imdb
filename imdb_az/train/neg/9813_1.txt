<br /> <br /> I do not have a good thing to say about this movie. The player is weak by Jennifer Tilly - as expected. Daryl Hannah is doing a good job, but there is nothing that can save this movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in this film is that the plot is too weak, though it has appealed to the "stupid heroic game" to create a hesitation. If all Daryl intends to do so, Hannah runs away from his pursuer. The hospital scene is absurd. Without explicitly covering a lot of things for a plot, I would have been difficult to hold a pregnant woman without a bloody petite woman from a hospital. Lame. <br /> <br /> Take yourself a little time and pick another flick.
