Okay, if you're fired for a few hours, or if you really hate your life, I would tell this movie. If there's anything, it's good to have some laughs. Only obese, topless local and special effects are very bad, in most cases, in most cases, illegal. Seriuosly, the "PG" rating is also pretty humorous, once you see the Native Porn Extravaganza. I will not give this movie to my late nephew. We can not even show it to Iraqi prisoners without violating the Geneva Conventions. The area is sketchy and clich√©, silent and stupid. The player is strange and, finally, it is very painful for me to start salting my eyes, so it's just a matter of pulling my mind off the screen.
