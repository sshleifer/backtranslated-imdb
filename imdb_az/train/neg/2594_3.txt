Despite being a R movie, I really doubt that you really love it when you're a teenager <br /> <br /> Why? Because there is no real space, no character development, no funny jokes. <br /> <br /> This film is just a nudity. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why this movie is the title of the US Pie because it's just bad. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see just a few naked chicks, but you get a rent / erotic movie. <br /> <br /> I have 2 smiles in the whole movie and 2/10 for 1/2 beautiful chicks
