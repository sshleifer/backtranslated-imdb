The "Stella," starring Bette Midler, is an unobserved Tearjerker. Founded in New York, Stella Claire works as a bar worker dancing pouring into the work room at night. One night, Stella Dallas, Stella Woos and his work are inviting a terrific medical experience during their inviolability. She also abolishes marriage and abortions, bids her to a lucrative medical career, and raises her daughter to a close relative. Flash is 16 years old and her daughter turned into a gorgeous, loving, young lady. Dr. Dallas is still outside the picture, keeping a tight, but caring element of her daughter. I'm having fun and even worse, yet it's just a bit of an exciting movie. The player and the script writer are at a very high level, almost every scene will be a noise. Chief redender Bette Midler, but behind John Goodman as her alcoholic friend. Each stage is more advantageous than the previous law, or rather one finale. This drama, taken as a dramatic piece, falls more than D, and B does not want B as a camp. <br /> <br />
