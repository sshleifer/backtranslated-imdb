I must admit that I will not be an admirer of Rodney Dangerfield. Indeed, I have no "respect" from me. I watched this only because my spouse wanted to see what I was looking for: a story without a real humor. <br /> <br /> <strong> I came to Dagerfild. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Dagerfield "played a weak cast, including Andrew Dice Clay and John Byner (who was not even able to see her name as she was still around), which is on the hill <br /> /> <br /> This is really the Dangerfield disaster. <br /> <br /> 2/10
