Susan Swift is a flower boy born in the 1980s (like a young Susanne Dye), but he does not have a vocal range of a very demanding dramatic device and he cries; yet, she has very sweet and bright eyes and pretty smile. "The Coming" (as it was called when the theaters were briefly released), Swift could be a Salem witch reincarnation. The call is a very low budget and I borrow a lot of other pictures that I have given for about 15 minutes to go. Begins in a powerful way and appeals to some camps. There is no doubt that Salem has more serious movies related to witching experiences and deserves to be seen on them; But, like charming films, he was not afraid. Boston's indigenous population is a dominant and fun toy that is entertaining. * From 1/2
