After reading about how great this film was for many years, I saw Ruiz as a watchman a year ago, how he settled between French critics (especially the snobbish Cahiers mass), but it was so disappointing that my expectations remained in heaven. Satisfied black-and-white, this is directly related to a cerebral film (prepared for a TV, with an hour-long, only one hour) and an artist on the screen with some pictures. (these are shown in the style of masked vivans) and try to keep some clues about a hidden political crime. (The horrible Kate Beckinsale movie appeared, there is a similar evidence). Borgesian is a word I have read in many studies on this film, but almost any Borges story is more interesting than this movie.
