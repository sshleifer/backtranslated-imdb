I was looking forward to watching this movie, and then realized that any hopes on a consistent dialogue between actors were unnecessary. Now I am not a prude, but it is not a good movie to confuse each other. Evan Bremner, one of the worst actors in the world today (witnesses of the life of God in a terrible Life) and his "Cockney" accents are almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid it. Most of these films include "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Beautiful Creatures" filmmakers f-word, c-word, and more. It must suffer before a proper dialogue is replaced.
