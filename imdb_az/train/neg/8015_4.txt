There was enough to end my sitting on something I liked about this movie ... I thought I could go on stage in the future ... Excellent ... <br /> <br /> Gus Van Sant's films - those who love the next - maybe like this. Personally, I find Van Sant's films dark, ambitious and simple. <br /> <br /> It was an executive producer of this movie, so it's not surprising that the movie is made by him, though I personally knew better than Van Santa's latest effort (eg Elephant). Contrary to the majority of the here, I did not think it was difficult for the film to be understood or distracted, above all, a film that wanted to describe a certain mood - the adolescent mood slowly moves to the adult world - but slowly the changes may seem pretty intense. But the problem of the film is not enough, and not just, but the mood described here is wrong for the story that actually happened. A quality similar to nature is closely related to sleep, but it is a mood that is more of a tiny child, really a man (a waves on a beach) to look at nature, flowers and spiders, etc. . The rhythm in my eight or ninth movie reminds me of my writings. There is a LANGUOR in the movie against the ones that must be a very tense time in adolescent life. When you are crushed, or you become an object of violence at school - but you're a curse! There are two moments in the movie that really work for me ... CLAIMING HERE - When Logan drops her grocery store and her mother relaxes a bit. <br /> <br /> The dreams of an adult dealing with a classic boy, especially a father who does not have a father, seemed real to me. The second part of the film seeks to divert Leo's Rodeo phone with the first reason I love because the person who plays Leah is the most convincing actor in the film. (This is my husband, Claire Danes he was thinking ... the sound was called Claire.) He and Rodeo were the only scene that seemed completely convincing among the children, and especially loved Rodeo just behaved as if it were the best moment in this movie - finally! <br /> <br /> <br /> Generally, he made some mistake ... Before we can say a lot about the director's ability, we must see what he is doing in his next film, when Van Santin may go away from his influence , who can make him a good world ... Who is this filmmaker, one of Van Sant's boy's toys?
