<br /> <br /> DeMille's TV debut film about the ancient Egyptian curse of the United States in the 20s when ReMaLa was reawakened when descendants descended from the first version of DeMille's 10 commandments. <br /> <br /> The worst films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Are filmmakers serious or cheating in the filming? It's a big movie to pick up a serious film and bad. His comedy is less good but for his wrong reasons, though funny. In this movie, you probably smile at many other Hollywood comedies.
