Batman and the brave Batman's last and pretty good light, Batman's life is a deadly blow to the bug in his life. Twenty years ago, after the first revival by Tim Burton, as a great fan, I was able to accept different tonalities in the dark or darkness. This is not just credible: many effects, poor intrigues and very few questions. A good thing about Batman is the diversity of his skills and personality: detective, criminal fighter, playboy, philanthropist and so on. Batman only shows it in karate days. By the way, despite the Penguin airport, how does this virtuoso have a jump? And look at the Joker with a blend of Blanka and a stereotypical reggae man on Street Fighter 2, can Batman admire such a betrayal? Anyway, to me. Batman's name is better than the "The" article.
