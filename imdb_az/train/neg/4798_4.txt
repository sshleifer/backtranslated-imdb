* There are some spoilers * This movie is a severe 80s horror in all sadness. The field takes a long time to get away from the ground, never managing itself, and then takes about 40 minutes to film. <br /> <br /> zombie fans have a gem of a moment, but not nearly enough to create a real sense of terror, not zombies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < First, there is half a film about mobs and prison guards. The protagonist of the film is an old Vietnamese veteran who has been arrested in the mob. The main mob boss builds it and goes to prison. In this prison, they are being tried by the prisoners to find a way to treat offenses and criminal behavior. But the psychologist chief scientist / soldier has other plans. He wants to use a slightly different version of serum .... and so on .... super soldiers! Some infected prisoners have a round of communal wine infested with a few guardians and most of the prisoner prisoner, a military / crazy scientist called "Hey it might be a problem" and a genius scientist, the investigative journalist is a strong female character who is ultra generously inspired by the original serum. Hərbi gəmi həbsxananın xaricindəki təhlükəsiz vəziyyətindən bir neçə SWAT komandasına çağırır və qəhrəman adam bir neçə günahkarın qızğın ürəyi ilə bir neçə dəfə məhbusları məsuliyyətə cəlb edir. The hero of the people and scientist / journalist and her team find a cure, guards and save the children of the inmates to fight each other infected. At the same time, the prison boss boy contracted to enter prison and was able to save his prison brother. <br /> <br /> One person was injured as a result of the explosion in the military unit. <br /> <br /> There are many heroic scenes in which prisoners are killed. The infected prisoners, including the creepy dekapitasiya rasta scene and electric wheel scene is also available. Still, the most disturbing scene in the beginning of the film, a prisoner of corrupt guards have been raped. <br /> <br /> The main purpose of this film is a scene towards the end. Heroes, women and children will go on single run routes. Their way is in a long corridor, on the one hand there is a wall, and the other is prisons. Hundreds of bloody zombies carry their hair and faces. <br /> <br /> In general, though you to watch what you explore the zombie classic "new munching on dead bodies" and "pieces of a sudden a lot of zombies zombie" zombie klisesi many are well-known; is a practical guidebook to avoid doing a zombie movie. But if you want something new and real fears of zombie screams, we should look elsewhere.
