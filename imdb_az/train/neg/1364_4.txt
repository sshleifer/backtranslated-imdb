I think more about this <br /> <br /> nothing about the movie. I've seen it 9 months ago, so my memory could make it worse than bad, but I know it was at least 4 bad. <br /> <br /> After seeing the film, I met the director. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am trying to adapt the formula prepared for the film itself I felt that all 9 people should be closed. <br /> <br /> From the "A" point to the "B" sign, we must avoid prostitution so we can see it at the beginning and at the beginning. <br /> <br /> It's about minutes for each character to interact with another person. <br /> <br /> I just remembered a part of a movie Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchemi has a nice spot there. It's like this. <br /> <br /> Four out of ten say that.
