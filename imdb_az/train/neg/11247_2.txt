This movie is out of the way. Many of those who thought that it was "beautiful" turned into old school movies because the entire movie was set up in the past. From the very beginning, I thought the film was something of the past, so I waited for the character to pass as an imaginary dream, but it was just going. Basically it was a movie that tried to mix the past with the future, and it did not mix well with this particular movie, especially with special effects. Actually, you can see the blue screen on which the act is running. There are many films that see exactly what this film is doing, so critics have no reason to praise this movie as "this is not the biggest movie ever". Just bent in one rod. This did not help the storyline sooo defective. I do not accept why Hollywood produced this movie, and I do not see how actors / actresses in this movie are ready to be in such a movie. Almost everyone read the script and forgot to read beautiful ... "This will be on the whole computer". It was a movie that should be in a movie network because nothing about this film is revolutionary. I'm sorry to pay for it to see it. Whatever you do, do not waste your time and money in this or tomorrow film.
