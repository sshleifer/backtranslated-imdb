Les Visiteurs, the first film about medieval spouses, was actually laughable. I love Jean Reno as an actor, but it was more. <br /> <br /> Now this attribute is of the same character, in the majority of the same actors and at the same time, at the same time, traveling time. The site changes several times because characters must be traveling longer. So go history without paying attention to the fact that you continue to absurd in the movie. Duke, Jean Reno, tries to keep the whole game together, but its character is empty, there is nothing to save the movie. <br /> <br /> Now the duke slave / helper really has all the attention. The film is simply connected with it, and it is everything that makes it irritable / boring / stupid or not. Fact; This character is trying to make laughter from the audience, but it is unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> If someone tells you that he is really a very bad joke, you already know, but he insists on telling this joke until you have added detailed information to finish your punishment for a little longer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I like Les Visiteurs, If you do not like Les Visiteurs, you would never have thought of it. If you liked that later, I think perhaps you should see most of the movies.
