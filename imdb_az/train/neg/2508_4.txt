After releasing this movie on DVD. Some say that WB will be released due to the movie The Dreamgirls. <br /> <br /> How do you hurry to release a movie that has been in the catalog since 1976? <br /> <br /> I am very pleased with the DVD version of this movie, no special feature, 5.1 DD sound. If you come to WB, you can do something better than this. <br /> <br /> There is a serious need for sound and picture quality in this movie. <br /> <br /> As you can see, WB did not take much time and attention to this movie because it is a black movie and my sales are good. They do not have all the songs on the original CD on the CDs they store on the CD. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you buy this DVD. Yes, because it's a classic movie. However, the WB needs to add a little more specific feature. Take notes from other band movies, Beat Heatbeats or Temptation, and just watch the audience all the sound is much better than this DVD.
