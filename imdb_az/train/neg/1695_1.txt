Okay when I saw the previews for this movie I actually looked scary and was quite excited to see it as a group I was. Now I see a lot of cheating in America in this election, but I have to say that these are in front of the list of previews. I do not see how many people are afraid of this movie. I just saw two real jump scenes and just jumped one. The whole film was extremely predictable and maybe some of the jokes for my jockey mix. As for the soundtracks, many were scared that they were the best fun. Oh and uhh where did the catboy come and why? The worst sound of all the movie should be a strange noise. How does this frighten each other? I can do my voice easily. Now I am not mistaken for that I always love all these really terrifying films that make you smile all the way, but I did not even think it was just bad.
