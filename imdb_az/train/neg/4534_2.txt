The book that took the film seriously changed my life. But it's a little bit to say that this film is a disappointment. The actor, director, cinematography and story story were terrible. I do not recommend this movie to anyone at all. I talked to a few people about the book, but now I will tell you everything you need to see in the movie! I did not expect to follow the book exactly, but left many key components of the book. The film tried to convey a powerful and inspirational message, but failed, and only condemned the main theme of the prophecy. While I was reading a book, I saw the Celestine Prophecy as a dynasty BS. I'm totally disappointed with Redfield because of this movie.
