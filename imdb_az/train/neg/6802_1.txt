Words can not describe how bad this film is. I just can not explain it by typing. You can see how terrifying a movie really is. I do not advise you to do this. There are lots of clich√©s, mistakes (and all the other bad things you can imagine) here you just cry. There are many mistakes about the plane because we have to start technically. I will not show them here, but I'll mark the color of the plane. They could not even show a plane in the colors of a so-called airline, but 747 instead of the original Boeing boards were used. Very bad. The area is stupid and a few times more, much better. There are many funny moments here that have really lost their number. And in the film I've always been on the side of the bad guys, because the good guys were very ridiculous. The "Executive Decision" is undoubtedly the choice of choices, even the "Turbulence" -movies. In fact, every movie in the world is better than that.
