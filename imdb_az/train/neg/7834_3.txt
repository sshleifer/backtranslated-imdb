<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I normally do not write, but I do not understand why the reason was so high and wanted to warn those who loved horror , because I think only these high ratings are provided by mid-TV observers. <br /> <I only watched the first two episodes, but both were so clichÃ©s, it was not even funny. Probably the same stories you read / read several times - living toys, bad things from other dimensions ... and these stories are not innovative but are pretty bad versions of these clicks. e.g. At any time, these two episodes have a "lucky" and "silent hill". and do not even ask for visual effects ... those who come in the first episode are good, the second one is terrible. some of the film students seem to have gone wrong with the project. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend "on the edge of the faith" - now I am talking about a worthy mystery TV show). but for an adult fear fan, that's worthless. I only gave 3 points because in fact there are some nice cinematography (especially in the second episode) and some nice players.
