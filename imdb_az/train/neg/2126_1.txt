Jason Alexander is a wonderful player, but it's ridiculous to throw him as a romantic hero. She dances so well that she has so much effective croon and feels like an entirely fragile, but it just seems more creepy to her. She could not move away from my eyes at her more wonderful moments (with Rosie's girl at the train station at the last station), she was very rude. You expect him to stop moving the beautiful man and begin to run away. Vanessa Williams was a real star, better than the 1963 movie. By the way, if you see stage music, the 1963 movie, and the 1995 movie, you'll see three versions with more revisions (different songs, different characters, and the same songs set in different situations).
