Peter and Kurt's re-imagining animation is very good, but it's a dream in the 29-minute movie. They should call "Peter & Snails" because everything moves at snail speed. I could not even watch the movie in one session - I had to watch at least 15 minutes and this was pure torture. <br /> <br /> Keep yourself 30 minutes - do not see this movie. <br /> <br /> I can assume that the Oscars nomination committee is watching only a few minutes of candidates. Unfortunately, in the Best Animated Short (Short) category, voters have to sit down to vote for victory. I'm sorry for them, and you have to predict that there is no way for this movie to win.
