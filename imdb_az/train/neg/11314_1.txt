This movie can be the worst I've ever seen. Bad fun, bad script, bad thing. It is interesting to compare it to two films in the same genre and approximately at the same time. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are both better in both the story and the directorship, and are still the two of them, Albert Pearl! <br /> <br /> The story is not genuine. The world may be associated with an ecological catastrophe or nuclear war, and people live in medieval conditions. Robotics live in a special sex (kiborg) human blood and have a story ... Cyborgs need to get many people to accomplish "prophecy" there and someone needs someone to stop them. <br /> <br /> In this film, the filmmaker, along with some of the participants, stands in beautiful Hong Kong scenic scenes. far flying and splashing away. <br /> <br /> I would like to recommend this movie for a reason to get a new "worst movie" to associate this movie with most people. And to the fans of the genre, I'm coming to Cyborg, because I think this is a very poor film with a very entertaining factor. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to stop Van Dammy. <br /> <br /> I sounded this movie 1/10.
