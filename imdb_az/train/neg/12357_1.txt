I will come to the point shortly. This film was an insult with a room temperature IQ. Fans, fans, and so on. Sorry. No woman will be in any environment. They can forget about the project or be in battle. Will not be. You see people and women as difficult to understand or accept physically differently. Regardless of the truth of 2007, things can not change to prevent people's feelings. <br /> <br /> Women do not hesitate to provide birth or breastfeeding (forgot about Oh-San Franfreako). <br /> <br /> Women are deprived of physical force to be with men in a battle or other physically challenging situation. How many women are playing in NFL or NHL? Finally, I could not endanger a bloody blast in heaven if the things I just wrote were wrong. Come to think about it - if this is anxious about you, it will make my heart warmer. I did not write anything that was not true. This imbecilic movie is a comedy and a bad thing.
