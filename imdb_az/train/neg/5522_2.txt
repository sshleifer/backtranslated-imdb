I started looking for the right words to describe this movie. However, I just had to move on to more important issues, because the film does not give a decent explanation. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to describe such things, and I was a little interested. question: "What can you say about such a movie?" Garbage? No, no garbage, garbage can turn into something useful. Greenhouse gas? No, its greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases helps the plants grow big and healthy. <br /> Finally, the re-processing of the word "not even wrong", sometimes used in theoretical physics, is to describe a theory that is not even "bad" desperate and unreliable. Later, the Georgian Rule: Not even bad.
