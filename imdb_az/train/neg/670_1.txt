Prom Night is a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow), followed by a psychologist who tried to kill her at night. So he kills his family, friends and enemies. <br /> <br /> Now I'm tired of the horrors of PG-13 in the last days before I started. You're tired of the foolish girls 'dialogue,' Oh my God, and you're talking about strange things. And you really got tired of relationships with girls, and then you cry. And last but not least, you're tired of re-creating American, Japanese, and Chinese movies. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> <br /> <br /> "If you do not, do not see the night of the Prom, you do not see that the dead are only crying and you see blood in the wall, deaths are repeated 24/7, so they are not just fears, but that's not a bad idea. Many girls speak, many people speak and many 'Oh my gosh, this is our baby'. I understand that it is not fun, but seriously concentrated. <br /> <br /> <strong> If I had put Prom Night in 2008 on the list of the best films, I had not seen any of the other films. I will not be surprised if the DVD is cheap and fast. <br /> <br /> Do not have money or drunkenness to earn money, if you give a 10-year-old 1 star (in case of PS), cheap fears and "zero stars of the night".
