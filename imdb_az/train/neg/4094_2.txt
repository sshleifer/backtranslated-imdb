Despite being released by Blue Underground a few years ago, I do not face this Italian "sword and sorcery" article on Italian television day and night, and now I know why exactly when I see it for myself. It is not typical for her director to be extremely unhappy (there are some examples to be sure), or because carvings inside her are not always overlapped (all these are all set in the Dark Ages)? it's just pretty bad things. In fact, it's the worst kind I've ever seen and I believe I've seen a lot (especially after watching my 2004 tour in 2004) Venice Film Festival! I think the filmmaker's subsequent (and regrettable) career has led to a budgetless budget: Fulci's previous "giallo" 1968-77), to myself (1979-82), despite being told about how the film's failure was explained during the release of the film , and even in the latter case his duty is indisputable. On the other hand, CONQUEST did not inspire at least Fulceni. When he decides to extend the procedure with an unstable constant fog, we scatter it with unusual symbols (fireworks, shadows, people!), an unusual pretext (before we were able to witness the students who were able to feed, their brains were beaten by complicated fluffy antagonists! ) and even some loud unappetizing intimacy between the masked, brainless villainess (ask) and his slimy reptile pet! There are two heroes to find out why: a young boy on a magical summer foot, Andrea Ochchipinti and his comedian friend (Jorge Rivero, ie Howard Hawks' Mace (perhaps short for Maciste)), the time to drop and worry about his little protégé (especially 'unwelcome' boils') Unfortunately, even though the old Goblin Claudio Simonetti's electronic account seems unusual from time to time, such a downturn is so short of material savings. with a hero, brazenly deserted (for his alleged physical force after being suddenly defeated by all the important magic broadcasts), laughably filming with a kiss, and with gratitude unfaded? adventure!
