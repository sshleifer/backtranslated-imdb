In general, I am not in a mood and I really hate this movie if this site could give me this movie. In my darkness, I thought Uwe Boll was the worst I've ever seen, but at least I think it's from 10 to 2.5 (Stephen Dorff raised me a little bit higher). <br /> <br /> If there were hell in comparison to Bloodrayne, Bloodrayne would have won an Oscar for the best film if they were rivals. <br /> <br /> Now this film is the killer of the BTK, which is a beautiful film. We have done better. The starter looked OK, but this was my quickest advancement because of where my death was drilling. I love killer films and even they can get a little cool death. I am not a fantasy film expert, but I believe that if he saw it, he would have shot himself. Sorry, but there is nothing better to say about it because someone takes a camera and shoots this movie .. it's a catastrophe. <br /> <br /> I'm not sorry that I can not explain the evidence (if any), but that was the best thing. Now let's go into one corner and do not remember moving forward and how I was reminded of how this film frightened me.
