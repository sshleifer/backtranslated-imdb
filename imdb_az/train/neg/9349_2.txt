This movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> Clichy has started at the beginning of the film's ending and the beginning of the start. this film used everything as a child with many toys, but just used the tricks box used in this film. <br /> <br /> For this reason, it is called "16 years of alcohol", but it has made a film that is no better than ever. a small drink or drunkenness, and no related explanation of jumping anywhere in the film. The story was badly written and extremely ambitious, and the route was equally poor, and a shameless film that Mr Sanderson had previously made more money for more movies than they knew for a garbage collection and television. <br /> <br /> I saw a great deal of struggle to understand it, but I was suffering painfully in the hope of getting a better outcome, but in fact it was a waste of time.
