<br /> <br /> I'm going to admit it now when I say something that can be a movie or injustice, so I'm sorry for what I do not like this movie beforehand. <br /> <br /> Sums up most of them. I did not like this movie. To be more specific, I did not like the concept of this movie. Cinematography was good. The excitement was pleasant. And the player was gratifying. <br /> <br /> However, this story is unfavorable, unbiased and incorrect. <br /> <br /> I'm even a quarter of a Kree Indian, and for some reason, I feel personal insult at Whitaker's character. First, he is a black boy. And this is not a racist word, I swear. The idea of ​​a White, Spanish, or even native America on a single roof is frustrated by what Katana represents. Katana represents a Samurai spirit filled with spirits of the ancestors who control and protect samurai. For Ghost Dog, Katana is an insult to his knife and spirits to use his weapons instead, and did the heck take any Katana anyway? <br /> <br /> Also, Ghost Dog did not show any honor. <br /> <br /> "Samurai must be one of those reps to be more insulting to casting." Despite the end of the film, he shoots a knight in the back of a window and then kills one person by tapping it with a tap drain. This is not a cowardly way to kill enemies, more like a ninjas way; silent conspirators; <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "> </ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; Do you know what the real Samurai does when he proves his master to be evil or disobedient? <br /> <br /> Kills himself to prove his self-murder. <br /> <br /> Everything about the cartoon was a big contradiction to the true code of the Samurai: Bushido. <br /> <br /> Thus, we have great cinematography, good ventilation, and hence a satiricle that involves the area and premise (which is, unfortunately, the most important aspect), making it unsatisfactory overall film and <br /> <br /> <strong> Bleah
