This film shows that a good movement comes from the good direction, and this is not a matter of Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a great actor, but he is also young. Donald Sutherland is found to be an amateur. Why? Because the scenario is terrible, the adaptation is scary and the players seem bored and bored. The atmosphere of the film is bad - I thought I could understand it and left half way. The director has done a very bad job and I can not read a novel, of course, a missed opportunity. The atmosphere and message and story that you are trying to play this movie do not reach the audience. In short, this is a MOVIE movie.
