This ugly journey, these guys do not fit the minds and arguments of the great adventure they have taken on their first movie. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < BR> <BR> Kids who play a rock concert (and many people watching "free TV" - when can this happen?) No doubt, the writer could do something more creative; See how the random elements of the first film are incorporated in a science-specific presentation and how they connect. Bill and Ted franchise are not in this movie. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <p> A similar infusion of all this structure is weak and for comedy or audience participation I do not spark. ZZ Top has an impression, no reason to blow. There are lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But there is really nothing creative and funny. <br /> <br /> Skip this fake thing.
