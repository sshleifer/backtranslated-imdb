Finding a bickering, western vacation, an American family, a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. This ghost town knows that once the city was a test site for nuclear bombs and that they were stalking them in a deadly presence. I generally love such mystery-fiction films. "Cube", Spilberg's "Duel" and "Birds" are great examples of films that do not meet. As you can see, the writer / director Walter Klenhard of "Lost" tried to make this kind of movie, and it was noteworthy that he succeeded. Personally I think he has half way, then the movie sank. <br /> <br /> Players are simply "ho-hum". They are not particularly bad, but we like the audience do not really feel the fear and react in a real way. Are there any other characters just to explore strange sounds?!?!? At least, give them some sort of reason to do so !! !!?!?!? <br /> <br /> Television films are definitely above average justice. Director Klenhard must be honored to be truly healed for everything that the environment provides, and some settings are striking. The two characters have a really cool area where an old nuclear test site is located, and the bottles are completely melted down the sand as it looks. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, is this true? <br /> <br /> Whatever hell is not an excuse, "creatures" or what these people are after? we have never given a real clue (Mutants, aliens, ghosts or ancient evil Indian spirits really land down for us!) or what they came up with. <br /> <br /> There are many stereotypes here too. Why folklore in such cities is always really dumb? Why does an old man always think that everyone is right? Why? Why? Why? NEW scenario, how to do the nation! <br /> <br /> "The treachery" is trying to be different and clever, but ultimately, in many cases it is very familiar to our fans of direct-to-video horror. Hey, I've seen so many bad movies, and it's not bad to be disappointed? Medium. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
