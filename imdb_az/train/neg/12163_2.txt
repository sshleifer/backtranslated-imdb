Absolutely dirty slasher film does not have recurring quality. Camping counselor Angela (Pamela Anderson, who looks like a murder, seals people thrown away), kills those who kill the youngest who are doing the least bad or who resist the good conduct. We run a drunken, clich√©-murdered boy with a Freddie gloves, a chain of guys, a boy who is looking at a girl who has just dug a girl (full of leaking). <br /> <br /> <strong> If you do not want Valerie Hartmen to watch his chest (playing prostitutes Ally). The vast majority of violence comes from the screen, not even satisfied.
