I do not believe I spent half an hour watching such a weak film. <Strong> Robert </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Robert </ b> All this makes him unconscious, and ultimately leads to such unconsciousness ... <br /> <br /> First of all, I do not think I can find any sense or great ecstasy trace in this movie any character. If the director evaluates what I see in the last few minutes as a big wish, it should be said that this is not too close. <br /> <br /> The use of cinematography is also not competent. Often I did not see the actors' facial expressions and did not feel enough to influence the body language. Perhaps the crew was so tired that they made the camera to adjust everything to the settings. <br /> <br /> Everyone except the audience is happy. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> We can move less than 5 minutes in one and half hours and at other times Only people walk, speak, and act. So, I'm not really going to work here. <br /> <br /> It's a great choice of music in the last few minutes. <br /> <br /> I have never given this movie, but this movie is of course worthy (at least you laugh when watching fright). It is a film that is extremely disturbing to the auditorium about an unsuccessful attempt to describe the problematic young people. You will not fall into any group.
