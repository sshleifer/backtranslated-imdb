I could have been interested in this idea and could have been an interesting story, except with such an interest. It's hard to watch, weird strangers, strange stories, heroes' delight, all of which is a terrible dull waste at one time. I just could not get into it and did not care about what happened to the characters - even Ian Holm could not save this movie. If you do not need a treatment for insomnia, I'll jump it. 3/10, and it is generous.
