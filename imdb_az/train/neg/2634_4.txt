The above common supernatural voltage should not be mixed with "The Sentinel". Sentinel was a great movie for me, did not achieve success, and several critics gave back. It seemed to me that everyone had cut it down and only had to earn enough money because it was very popular for a television movie. The Sentinel is in the rehabilitation of several good movies like "The Fire Of Fire," which has no originality and is a negative feeling in my mind watching Michael Douglas running around. The main problem should be at poor speed, in addition to its inaccuracy. When I watched this movie, I often got confused, how long it was, and then once. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas is a credible actor, where he goes through obvious actions. He does not agree as a runner or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was off, too. I'm a great fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here's OK, more. She tries to come across as a gruff, but she was more gentle and then able to do something else, and she did not seem to be interested in being honest. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. She was dissatisfied with her role and was pure-eyed candy. Kim Basinger is pretty scary as 1st lady. She looks tired of tears and her role is a shot, then something else. In the end, Martin Donovan plays a big role, but it does not matter to me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Sentinel is still another political tension that made me cry. Very old, very tired, and most importantly, the effort is missing. <br /> <br /> 4/10
