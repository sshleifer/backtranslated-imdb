Since Christopher Lee puts a punk sunglasses and wants to enter a punk rock club, you know there's a stinker in your hand! This movie had the potential. Without an exciting film underneath all the sludge, there are remnants of things that can be prepared for a decent film. But the final product is a real confusion. My dream II is a ridiculous excuse for a horror film, in addition to unmatched nudity and many attractive women. Christopher Lee resembles this reliability, but can not even lift him from the crap level. <br /> <br /> This critic, who has not seen any of the other films in this series, will have to face. This is the true continuation of the events in the first part. We started at a funeral for one of the original characters, and in the first ten minutes, we find ourselves in Transylvania with a small group of heroine ready to fight ourselves against wormwood. The film is directed to a very good place and there are not many dead places. There is an event; not just a good movie. A brilliant point is the music of a punk band named Babel. Although their song is played very often, it is very appealing. <br /> <br /> There are many problems with this movie. First, acting is worse than pain. Christopher Lee is good enough, but it's the end of it. These two Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe do not want anything you want for such symbols. Writing is unhappy, editing is unnecessary and direction is amateurish. There are several nice special effects gimmicks, but weigh them a lot of cheesy ones. Sybil Danning likes to look but his performance is satisfactory. Judd Omen looks at the part that he plays, but his voice and his players are unsatisfactory to say the least. Most of the dialogue is in a language that can or may not be in Latin. <br /> <br /> I liked the general ideas for the story. I always enjoy the forces that are not lying in the stories of the true believer. A small group of good guys is exciting, even in a scene trekking with a dark forest and shooting down many kurtades. Whom. Perhaps a bigger budget or a better director could make the rest of the film a little more attractive. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> Babel song while playing a few times overlap! Capture it whenever possible!
