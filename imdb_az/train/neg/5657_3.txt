I'm a great fan of Lon Chaney, but the screen of this movie did not work for me. The story is strangely discarded (I have learned that it's not part of the movie) and the characters appear and disappear with sudden irritation. Some of the intertitles are over-explicit (for example, "Why not, you are no longer a child!" - for a long time to draw a picture - "You are a Woman!" Yes for the first time), but there are several conversation sequences that cater for invisible explanations. (Let's hear the argument of Luigi and her girlfriend!) Where the intuition desires (if not technically technically) are difficult to watch, the area where they are concerned. This problem was considered a problem for the writer's loan, and the May-December match is not described as a survival and a good failure of some of Mary Peakford films (eg, Daddy-Long-Legs). Chaney gives a good performance as usual, but I think he has been better off in the past - he has thrown IMHO over here a few times. I enjoyed the clown series and was very impressed with the beds. Loretta Young was surprisingly young, though. The film has moments, but still the least loved Chaney photo.
