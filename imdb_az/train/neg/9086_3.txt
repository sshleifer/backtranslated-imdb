Rohmer's admiration for his delayed works, which he thought to be the greatest cineasts, and normal audiences were generally regarded as artistic failures (like Renoir or Chaplin's recent films, yes, there is a black side in "politician auteurs"). However, with the Les Amours d'Astrée et de Céladon, Rohmer himself can be his last film, Urfé's "L'esttré", in the Perceval version, Rosselini ' (parody of aesthetic codes), which appears to be a parody of one of the latest films. <br /> <br /> Rohmer's true scenes are to re-transcribe something that can be a classic description of medieval items. The chaplain changed his mind when he attended the XVII century and was the movie actors who read the ancient texts of 1,600 villagers, sometimes surrounded by their trees and landscapes. But everything looks ridiculous than Luchini and fake trees. The story itself is not ridiculous, but the way to mix Rohmer's nature with craftsmanship is so unusually funny that it looks like childhood and amateurs (and I'm not even talking about the pronunciation of the actors, it's also annoying and sad humorist. /> The radical aesthetics of the film is, as a result, a joke, a mixed-looking joke - a soft erotic movie for television with oral debate - at the beginning of the film, Rohmer teaches us that the original French site of the story is now far removed from modernity so I have to shoot the L'Astrée in other parts of the country, but I'm sure the film will look more modern and interesting if Rohmer actually captures the same story with the same story codes and workmanship in the modern area, but most cinephiles laugh at this latest and sad Rohmer movie.
