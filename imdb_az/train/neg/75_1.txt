Ned Kelly (Ledger) is legendary Australian law and legend. Like Robin Hood, the Australians listed by Billy Kid love the legend of how they stand against the British aristocratic persecution and unites the subclasses to change Australia forever. It is by accident that about 70% of the subclasses of the time are immigrant criminals. Indeed, in this film, there are several "facts", on the contrary, doubts. <br /> <br /> I believe that the opening of the claim on the opening credits is based on the film "Our Sun". There was no romantic truth in the name of the book, it was there. <br /> <br /> Ned Kelly is a historic epic, though not just one of many verbal legends, but a hard and sporadically brutal version <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Ned Kelly, Overblown Hallmark Channel - a real-life drama drama 'wannabe! This story is an exciting (exciting, because no film is so slowly disseminated). Feeling numb after two hours of quiet, Costnerin is a reminder of the awesome Wyatt Earp. Simply, there is nothing in the film, but for a long time it does not have anything. If the performance was good, it was probably a little bit tougher (because it was not a heck). But if you do not want to play a game at the worst Oirish spot, then you will be disappointed. Following is a flicking-like experience with "Who is a fool beard?" (Hint, ginger for any reason) and a great story with Hallmark, The History Channel, Discovery Channel, and neighbors in Australia, "Nature Lions in Australia." Yup, a lot of time to fill up time (probably an attempt to keep up with the image), the film continues to show inaccurate live images and when all local species are shown once, here is a camel and it is used during a fight It's a rectangular piece of TV, and I can not say a single word about this movie, even when the fantastic Rush is ashamed to be here, and when one of the characters tells him and his palm only two bullets left, I had a weapon to throw every single memory of this movie on myself.
