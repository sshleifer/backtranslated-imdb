This weekend I just watched "28 weeks later" which I just went through. Then I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful horrors. The scenes are inaccurate, no scripts and no plot. The foreign creature was not real. Struggle scenes are relatively soft compared to a school yard. <br /> <br /> A boy named Cody had an empty and bad language, which had not been taken into custody since striking the main film. <br /> <br /> Do not forget this movie; <br /> <br /> <strong>
