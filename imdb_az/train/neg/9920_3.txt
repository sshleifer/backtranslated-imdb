I love Clash music and love Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros music. I was hoping to get the most out of this movie. But I left the theater without knowing a lot about Joe and did it after reading the introduction to Wikipedia. The film really does not reach people, their thoughts and emotions. They were collecting small stuff, gathering bare bewitching videos, and meeting some people in the camp fire about Joe Strummer. Apparently, most of these people knew him very little, or the filmmaker wanted the film, saying that only the more celebrities were "such inspiration for all of us." Like Bono or Johnny Depp (they wanted to keep their pirate costumes to benefit from their current success in the Pirates of the Caribbean). As it turns out, the director would never have waited until the body was still cold, since he did not have to compete with him to sell the version of the "greatest punk rocker and hippie" living. <Br> Of course, I'm delighted to see the band's pictures, the lyrics behind the songs, and that's a similar thing, but at the end Joe Strummer's portrait is easily 60 -90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you see a movie in one, but rather listen to some of Clash's music, or not previously known, Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer has reached the peak of musical development After all, his melancholy melts into a beautiful voice .
