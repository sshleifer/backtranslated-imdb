I've never heard of End Game, but I love political shooting. After completing a research on the movie, I first realized that he was preparing for the freedom of the theater, but instead went to the DVD. After seeing, I think, "it's not surprising." The film is shocked by its frustration. Fields and symbols dominate. However, I would like to note in the semifinals, but the end was a crooked ball. I have to say I did not expect it to be complete, but that's not a point in his favor. The more predictable, the latter would prefer the worse. Probably, filmmakers saw that the film could be predicted and decided to release a movie - even worse the film. <br /> Stay away. I'm back for $ 5.98 and 107 minutes.
