I know you, but Tom and Jerry are two (favorite) violent interactions between cartoon characters. In Manhattan, Mouse Jerri sees Tom leaving behind an adventure in New York and, while I am worried, it definitely does not have a cat! <br /> <br /> Jerry's 'Big Apple' might be for other T & J fans who commented on IMDb, and I did not expect this self-confident litter to end, so I could look at the next cartoon on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Actually, just one part of the whole episode I really love is that when Jerry almost bought 'a farm,' it was the end of a curled candle, hundreds of feet of a light path.
