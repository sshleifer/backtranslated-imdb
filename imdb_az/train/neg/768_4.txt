Most of the fans of Columbo believe that this film is an unnecessary change format. Columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods. This movie seems to be just about rebuilding any ordinary detective drama. <br /> <br /> There are two parts that interest me in this movie: <br /> <br /> Columbo is not an ordinary detective. First, I can not understand the name of this movie. This is wrong. Maybe it would be a better title than "The Vanishing Bride" or something similar. Secondly, Columbo hides the argument without causing it (at least to the audience). <br /> <br /> I do not feel betrayal, I'm just frustrated. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk has gone back to Columbo. <br /> <br />
