<strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> "personal note from the director" for the first time when it starts, requires a "grip" from the audience for "many difficulties" facing a Director. The audio track is so bad on many scenes that the dialogue is almost impossible to follow, and this is from the DVD version. Bad lighting, bad kits, bad photography, poor scripts, and generally a bad movie, are something unexpected. I gave it a bad end after a few attempts and I immediately dumped DVDs I had bought without a fool. I am confident that for the first time there are many problems facing the Director. However, do not try to make palms as a product of this bare attempt. Talking about the details of IMDb, this is only Richard Natalian's first Directorate of Inquisition, and he is alone. This is a positive thing I can say about the alleged "movie".
