Simply put, I'm not interested in the west. Since I have never sat down, I have decided to follow "My Sweetheart Clementine" and decided to see the whole way, though painful for me. It was heartwarming as expected from the beginning. In order to be ridiculous, I found players, scene (standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and painful music and timing flick. However, it was easy for me after the first 20 minutes after fighting for mentality. Focusing on cinematography and making the most boring situation for John Ford (in my opinion), he was able to make some stunning, more exciting. <br /> <br /> As a result, I will say that I liked the film until the end of the film. But it was good enough for me to sit down all the way up to the end, and he was surprised at me.
