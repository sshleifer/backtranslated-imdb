The desire to use science to justify religion / philosophy at a new age is bad. <br /> <br /> <strong> Quantum physics has nothing to do with one another. <br /> <br /> Examples? Quantum theory is a true illusion of ideas in eastern religions. How? Yes, in the subatomic world, you can not necessarily predict the location of particles at certain times. You can only have the exact location at one time. Also, the observation act also affects the incident. Solid particles can pass through obstacles. All this is so precise. But then they said that if you believe you are sincere enough to ride a wall, you really can do that. This is a full poppycock. Instead, the theory can be passed through a wall at our level, but it has nothing to do with casual and belief. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that in order to be able to move to the wall of the railroad, you will have to go through the wall for eternity. <br /> <br /> This is a scientific misconception. However, the narrative that Marlee Maitley plays is an unfortunate photographer who is more bored. More than half of the picture is too complicated to be incomprehensible. Something negative about ideas that leads to drug addiction and self-hatred. There may be some truths about it, but Quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Now, the string theory is something new in today's physics. Instead of wasting your time, I also offered Edt Witten and M Theory-a Newton a series of series of NOVA for PBS, which has a history of physics and history of gravitation. If you want to know that metaphysical embodiment is smokeless, quantum mechanics is very well understood.
