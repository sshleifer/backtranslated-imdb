Must be the most intimidating TV show in the air. It's probably a run for Jim Belushi and all the bad movies. His brother asked his younger brother all his talents. Hopefully, this show will be canceled and never inadvertently exploited. Jim is retired or something. Leave them out of the air. Here, if I throw a joke from the show and wash my eyes with a toothbrush. Take away the Devil rather than watching the half hour of the program. I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running. We all know the depth of it that when we see Jim's face, we want to shoot our TV screens. Finally, please.
