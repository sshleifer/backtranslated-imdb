No one lives like hell of this kind as Joe Swan is a good filmmaker ... or even a filmmaker! Where's the new product of brain and talented filmmakers? <br /> <br /> This movie is about nothing, but the characters in the movie do not stand for anything, but need hell to hell and hell. This terrifying, so-called gene Y, some of whom are filmmakers who are concerned about learning about crafting before shooting. Well, Orson Welles was a filmmaker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker and a similar film. Such movies, no scenarios, no direction, no thought, legitimate "camerawork" (everything is creepy) DV), no editing job, nothing is meant to shoot "rebellious" or "advanced" was arrested. Instead, it is called ignorance and laziness or just pure cinema masturbation (and you really have a "jack-off shot" on your face, so be prepared). Look at the first movies of any "indie" filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee or Herzog ... did something tedious and purposeless . It is still the Swan - what hell is still going to SXSW every year and greeted some kind of gutsy as a new talent. This is a crap! I can not imagine anyone who likes it, and both of these things (as I see everything) are all bad (something newer than one of the most appealing caller sitcom calls). If you are a member of a family or are embarrassed, you may be tempted to look for a friend or family member if you are embarrassed to see a family member or a friend in such a situation. <br /> <br /> Tuber debris. This is not art. That's the opposite.
