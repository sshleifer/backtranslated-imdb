As a child, I believed that my friends and all of them were the most strange, bloody movie of Gymkata. I'm not sure who will start this rumor. Perhaps it was born of dreams of 10-year-olds who were not allowed to look for something else or something else. A few years after Gymkata's release, it was a very late night movie, and eventually I was prepared for the lost time. I've seen scenes from these terrible excuses for many films, and I can always spot it in 1-2 seconds of the screen. However, there are some things in the film, besides the compulsory combination of gymnastics and martial arts, bad dubbing, harsh dialogue, and extreme difficult story line. All this is bad with the ability to see the movie, the sound is really entertaining. No kick or kick before, no less powerful and much volume! Canned kung-fu sounds are sluggish, but the slow-moving and pitched-down music and about 5 minutes of slow motion play are really strange. The city of demented, blood-thirsty peasants is not really tense as it is irritated, and there are quite bad windows and extras, but all are looking at the camera and there is a wave to make that train a little fun. Could it be directed to the classic status? Where is MST3K Where Required?
