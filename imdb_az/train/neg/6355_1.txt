I did not expect to see this movie. I did not expect the movie to take about half a year. All white actors, Woody Allen, have said, "Tell them to say ...". Then, as they tried to imitate Woody Allen, they were telling the lines on the screen. It was very annoying. We all know how Ferrell actually deals, and it does not look like Mr Allen. The comedy part of this movie was as strange as tragic and absolutely funny and even fun. I must admit that I will never be a great Woody Allen fan, and this movie has not necessarily changed. I think the writing was as bad as it was in its direction. This movie will fall as one of the worst 10 films I've ever seen.
