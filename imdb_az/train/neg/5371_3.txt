This film was very disappointing. Very slow, very intense (and very strange) then the movie begins to start. Very little time was spent for too much explanation, and I thought about what I was thinking of leaving the theater. The characters are deserving, the story is not completely convincing, most of them are non-parody instructions, and there are many cheesy parts ... You have to give something similar to a young police officer. Of course, at night and in the rain and should do it only ... yaw! Otherwise, manifestations of "evil" and "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, it's really original. Although it's like the Fistfight scene, mountain views, and some fugitives, there are some nice bits (though Reno and Vincent Cassel do their best), this is definitely not worth it. (From 10 to 3)
