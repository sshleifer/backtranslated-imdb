- A small time headline recommends a large number of local councilors. Of course, the temple director wants his money back and does not think who killed him to get it. <br /> <br /> Pank lists his wife and an old mobster to save his life. <br /> <br /> If it's ridiculous, that's it. The insulated-wearing, dune-driving driving punk, all thoughts that can catch one of Rome's most powerful mobs are just plain silly. His friend can be a good gun, but he faces a number of trained slaughterers. Old mobster is less than funny relief, and there is no real help when faced with this gang. <br /> <br /> - There is a sub-plot about how a friend's father was murdered a few years ago, but it's a little prepared and the movie does not help in any way. <br /> <br /> - Mob boss, played by Mister Scarface, Jack Palance. Probably, he had been named because he looks like a shaving sign on his cheek. <br /> <br /> Some time ago, Palance is ineffective as the rest of the pile. <br /> <br /> Recently, I've seen a few good Italian crime / police missions, but Mister Scarface is from them. Instead, check Syndicate Sadists or Revolver.
