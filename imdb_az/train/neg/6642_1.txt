this film begins with a funeral ... and it's so difficult in the ordinary funeral that I lost my interests for five minutes and started throwing scenes. He does not think of anyone except for death and destruction until he gives me this movie and can not stand the level of trauma in a constant illness. well, I am not one of the darkest guys in Southpark, I do not want a movie that invites me to an exciting story within 10 minutes, I will not sit and wait for something other than a funeral preparation for ten minutes .. my grandma was amazed at the funerals of her late years, She liked this movie very much.
