Flock is not really a movie. This is a wannabe movie, with wannabe actors. Not included in Richard Gere, he performed perfectly well, but one of the actresses really gave himself a character, and the rest was just moving ... the result is as bad as in this movie. You see, the idea of ​​acting is to conceal the fact that you are acting. Claire Dains what was hell in this case? He is the most inappropriate actress for this character. In 99.9% of the film, he looked more than anything else! One thing we do is to ask foolish questions and make foolish faces, like "you really think so." I'm embarrassed by her actor and I love her ... She's a romantic movie, and I did not know who she was among all the actresses there ... When she saw LOL and Avril Lavin! this really made me laugh .. Anyway .. If you want to feel the throw, this movie will do the job for you! I wish I could vote for -5.
