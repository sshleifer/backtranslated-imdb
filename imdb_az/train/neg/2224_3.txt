When I was seven, I saw it for the first time. Well, I thought I did not know what was happening. After 15 years, I remembered with great certainty that the writers did not hesitate to give a summary of the story. There is no space for this movie / cartoon. There is no character development, no back story, no character spring, nothing. Good guys are good because they are good, and bad guys are doing just that. Carefully dissatisfied with the fact that someone who thinks important is dead and at least cares for anyone. They just shake their shoulders and move. There is also a dialogue. If you cut off martial arts and action scenes, you lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Well, you want to see a good animation and for some other reason. Or if you want to look at a small amount of light cartoon shepherds (or little hot cartoon dresses).
