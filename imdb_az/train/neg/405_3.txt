Do you like this movie, surprisingly special effects? <br /> <br /> There are some interesting visions. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the typical nine / ninety-ninth of the 1990s has nothing to do with a superficial look. <br /> <br /> There is no need to distinguish the story. It's like brain surgery on a dinosaur. There is not much to get started. This is not original and very special. Do not go for the story yet. <br /> <br /> As mentioned above, the invisible (and sometimes half-invisible) watching the cleanness of a great circulatory treatment of the man was a little shiny. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is an eye to seeing or not seeing "standard" pyrotechnics. <br /> <br /> Generally, this is a valuable FX movie for this purpose and just doing it.
