As an admirer of horror film, I am striving to watch all of these genres, especially my native film productions. And I can say that "The Power of Fear" (or "Vedma") is one of the weakest films among them. First, even a small child can not scare him, that he's slowly and does not have space for real fear that is predicted. Undoubtedly, it is bad at all points: I do not know why the picnic area (but I do not know why Russian producers / directors have decided to turn into an awkward and ridiculous US-made excitement on the classic story about Ukrainian gambling, the former reviewer is a little excited) and terrible and to the work of cheerful actors. All the actors, such as Valeri Nikolayev and Eugenia Kryukova, who are very popular in Russia, are regarded as wooden puppets or something similar, and in my opinion, they spoke only English lines without expressing anything. Finally, why did they take this flick with Russian actors in English? I think they are in the wrong turn. At least they have thrown some American or English actors into leading parts to make them more convincing. In the same way, I can say with the words "small American city of origin" drawn in Estonia and similar to it. The only positive thing I've seen in the "Power of Power" is the visual effects. They are not good for the Russian movie, they are good. And the music is good, at least not irritating me. That's why I give you two stars. In general, if you want to see a good movie movie? Do not waste time and money on this annoying nakedness. And if you are looking for something that claims to be a fears of Russia, it is advisable to find a copy of the "Wisdom or the Spirit of the Devil". It is, indeed, a wise film based on the novel "Fear Force", but much better.
