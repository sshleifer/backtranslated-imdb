Want to know how to create a movie in a fitness center? Just pad the movie with your favorite women in super tight training dresses and give them a blow and ground as in a gentleman's club. The creators of this terrible film did it, and this little gimmick watched me until the bitter end. This is the worst movie I've ever seen, but every time I'm ready to pass the channel, they add another scene with their girlfriends and I'll put them. As a Slasher movie, the Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of. As a showcase of beautiful girls, this is a success. A strong recommendation to avoid, unless you're thinking of half a movie as a great T & A show.
