Yes, I regard this movie as a star horrible. Nevertheless, it will later become my Christmas movie. This is really good, that's good. This is another K. Gordon reads Murray's production (he reads: he takes a really cheap / poor Mexican film, spends zero on dubbing in English, and releases it in kiddie matin√©es in the mid-1960s). I'm sure some of my life "mood enhancers" will make this a better experience. Many of my other reviewers have not said that Merlin, Satan is a Christmas movie with strong windshields and the most horrible children I've ever seen. I think it's back with the Kelsey Grammar "A Christmas Carol". Indeed, a festive experience in Hell. Now, if I only find the Allnight Goodnight on the DVD, I'll have a triple feature that can not be beat. You need to see this movie. Soon I'm moving forward, especially when I do not want to touch on two dance routines. This thing comes as an expensive bleu cheese, and is saddened by experience. Feliz Navidad amigos!
