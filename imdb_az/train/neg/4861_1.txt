At the time of glory in the 90's (resting on God's spirit), you can visit the Big Comedy Center at any time of the day and see the biggest sketch comedy show broadcast live on Saturday Night. Whpat was a poet's famous show, the original unprepared Primetime players or the second golden age of SNL - Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then all of them went into Hell. A year and a half ago, I was exposed to MadTV, so I should be shocked. How could a fierce demonstration remain so long? There are many terrible shortcomings. I guess I will start with the article. Writing is very scary for most of them. This is nothing more than a nursery bath humor. Casting is basically unlucky. There are some sketches I like some, like my lady Swan and Stuart, and there are several talent in the show, such as the magnificent Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is not a talented player, not a comedian. Though it's a little haunted, it's not enough to pay for this infinite line of this horrible driver, full of bugs. Check them out.
