This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's a "Dreamie Requiem" like a Disney movie. Although technically well-designed, cinematography, music, leadership, and so on. It is good. However, the scene of the final network aggression is the most terrible and frustrating thing I've ever seen, and I really wish I did not see it. I'm scared that he will persecute me for the rest of my life. I think everyone is extremely concerned about the film, and my wife and some of my comrades were in a very bad condition and I did not need a clear message about the horrors they were experiencing. I saw the film at Austin, TX at the SXSW Film Festival and did not take part in any sea or crew. Because they had the opportunity to defend their violence in the film, I felt that I felt too free and unnecessary. The previous scene has successfully succeeded in delivering a mood, but with extreme and open sexual violence. This movie should have a great WARNING tag. Therefore, I do not recommend anyone to see. You've been warned.
