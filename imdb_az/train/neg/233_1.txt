This film is an attempt to calculate cash in the City and the success of the Four Wedding and Funeral. In fact, if they were called sex in a paradise, they might have done better in the cash register. <br /> <br /> But the film stays between two legs and can not rise. These symbols lead to an incredibly brilliant dialogue, but in no way can they be acquainted with human beings in any way. <br /> <br /> So far, MacDowell has earned points to perform his little heart, but the gifts he has done are all stolen by police detective, Imelda Staunton (there is no elevation for them). Ms. Staunton is unable to make a wrong move. <br /> <br /> If Notting Hill falsified you, stay away from it. Phonus bolognus in half ankle.
