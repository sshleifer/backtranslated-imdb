This film was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> I get the opposite opinion of the critics. This is not a financial situation that is not up to the level of actors; where actors (Bette Davis and Jamie Kagney) are not just at the material level. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were great, like Davis and Cagney, and looked at how one night was - classics of all time. Davis proves that he does not have any talent for comedy with a very similar story (this is a good thing for him, it's the only comedy that you've just tried!) Davis's only recorded performance is eradicated, but none of the nuances of Colbert's work came. Cagney, a great comedian actor, has not been compared to himself, Davis. In the scenario, some decent lines and gags are provided, but drama seems more appropriate than delivery comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem sounds like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, a dramatic drama than a comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who has played a similar role throughout his career, has been dealing with a much more similar material. Eugene Palette provides a respectable performance in a very typical supporting role. In a slightly different role as an old western relic, Harry Davenport is very good. But in one of his poorest performances, William Frawley is extremely uncomfortable. Permanent references to the character of his character to so-called cops are a bad act of irony. <br /> <br /> I love each of these performers very much and as an ensemble they will not get more chemistry and Bride Came C.O.D.
