This is a typical 70-year-old basic sexual relationship in the genre of Russ Meyer, though it may seem strange to Meyer's work. This movie has more 'production values' than the modern ones offering more budgets. This plot corrects the B zone for writing, writing, and moving. At the end of the night, this film has become a key feature of the B class channels of the 500-channel universe (like Drive In Classics). If you're in a soft core, it's just as good as the B interval. Do not wait for Polanski, Sarno just Sarno. There is nothing, nothing. Jennifer Welles's performance as "mother" is probably the best player. None of the actors in the film, surprisingly, gained more fame. A young American housewife's confessions are far from its worst example. It is possible to wait, if it is your kind of movie. 30 years ago this would be an avant garde and a risk movie. You'll see more or less the same thing in the Showtime / HBO series these days and at times.
