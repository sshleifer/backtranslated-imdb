I rarely comment on the movies, but I have read other comments and do not believe in people who welcome this celluloid trash. I know that there are people who have their own agenda, but prefer instead; He worked badly, was badly beaten and felt as though the story went as a director. The creators of the film obviously knew they wanted and wanted their audience, because I would not pay attention to the sex aspect of the film that covered little children. We can say that this is a terrible film, the content is poor and the attack is a production amateur and I'm glad I can not shoot a legitimate movie like this today
