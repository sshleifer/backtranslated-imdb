At first glance, this movie has everything that psycho wants: a vampire story of "not younger than 18", filled with hyper violence, narcotics, genitals (including lesbian sex), some fanatic zealots and even a gay necrophiliac! But then, this movie is a bad story (a very kind), a bad toy - a bad Monty Python - a sequel with an unfortunate English accent, if you believe you're watching bad music ('80s hard rock), the video is a real shame to the terrible ending ... The scenes of the sex are ridiculous and not very impressive. And these vampires are reflected in a mirror and are not afraid of the day! It is very disappointing, unless it looks like "Space Mutant" or "Troll 2". <br /> <br /> <strong> </ font> <br /> </ font>
