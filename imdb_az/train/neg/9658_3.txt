God, what an incredible movie! The British officer Ben Affleck says that Mel Gibson's movie reminded a similar scene in the film "We were not soldiers", "They are not lost, they're simply cut." <br /> <br /> Americans help Americans in the United States go to a war-torn nation. <br /> <br /> Put all 3 movies together and the story of the BULLSIT-Transition Battalion to fertilize the entire Sahara desert can be quite true, but the film could have been made without a similar American propagandist jingoist propaganda. There were sounds in the movie theater during the scene above Pearl Harbor (there was no joke) <br /> <br /> Past Battalion really is in its class. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Behind the scenes, , Writers like Heartbreak Ridge, and shoot it before writing a garbage again. <br /> <br /> Director Russell Mulcahy is also australia, God, shame!
