I just do not have one of the great places in this episode - Miranda is very remarkable and there is so much ugly thing that makes you crazy. Some people have stated here that there is something wrong with light waves or ugliness. Miranda is just a mess. The episode is slow, controversial, and very chatting. I do not understand why Colos is an ambassador - why does not the Fed leave Cursed Medusa? I have a part of Kolos's human experience alone, spoken by Spock. Generally, I love TOS and even its lamest, I will always regulate it. Despite this episode - mmm, I would not buy it except $ 3 under a used copy.
