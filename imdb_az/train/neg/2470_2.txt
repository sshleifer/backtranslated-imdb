I've seen many horror shows like Nightstalker, the legend of Wendigo, so I was expecting an angry spirit that caused betrayal to add to the Halloween season. Man made a mistake. The whole film creates a feeling of fear and creepyness, but then presents a very simple fairy tale of revenge and murder in connection with some loss of property. And-ery is scary - not! <br /> <br /> He says the film about Hollywood will be filmed. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> What kind of wizards should pay such a movie? Go back to the drawing boards and do something useful with millions of sources to shoot around.
