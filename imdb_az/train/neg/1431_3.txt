At the same time, Richard Attenborough makes GRAY OWL a dramatic offense by acting a crime. And worse, he shot a very scary movie. Pierce Brosnan has no romantic subplot screen chemistry between charisma and Gray Owl, and Pony (played by Annie Gaupeau on the same equal floor), which is essential for the lead role. Because they do not help Archie with a scenario that does not depict it as an ugly chip, he believes everyone to be fair to the pen. Producers and screenwriter Archie made a great mistake to shoot the movie because of their English - so I wrote "Possible Spoiler", in spite of the delay of the movie, the title character is actually the same as <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Everyone has seen this movie, that's why it is absolutely no surprise beforehand. <br /> <br /> Yes, I agree with everyone that the scenery is a beautiful and deeply ecological message that is not really a new concept. Theodore Roosevelt was the first security guard of the 20th century. We must also remember that except for SOYLENT GREEN (And maybe TWO HEADS you want to classify it as a green message), it's not really a great ecological film. In fact, the most commonly produced films that harm the environment are created, and GRAY OWL has a movie that has a serious problem finding a distributor
