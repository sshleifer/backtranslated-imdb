There is a good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's love! Sorry, but that's true. He did not give a very rare lamp. At least this tolerated tolerance. We see the fungus of another dwarf, but it is nowhere near Lola. And the man, Armand Assante is old or what? Man looks like a shit! The "Result" is the usual B-movie you are expecting. The story had the potential. They had good thoughts, but they did not know how to carry them. Cinematography is simply horrible. Ugly! The director does not turn off and the latter result is a mild tension with naked corners and the actors are washed. Lola Gaudini is a cheap, ridiculous, vixen-like thing, but keeps Consequence from just plain old trash cans that is not garbage and funny trash.
