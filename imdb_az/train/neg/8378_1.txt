This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! The area is ridiculous and all the "Little Man" is like a shit. The entire film is unreal and trifling. We encountered it, it was just a "black comedy". This is a terrifying piece that never came to theaters. These jokes are not funny and the player is strange. Please, I beg you to save your money without seeing it worthless. I had to sit and live with a little man who wanted me to wait an hour and a half. If you would think something like that! Who writes this post? How many actors do they have in Hollywood? They make money from this money!
