This low budget Roger Corman is a horror / creation flick. DinoCroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes. An advanced croc kills itself first, then gets tastes of man and becomes a rapidly growing terrorist. None of the heroes have any depth, but they are not the focus. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is a moronic character trying to use three types, just two-legged dinosaur descendants and the best "killing" dog food and prey. On the bridge, there was nothing left on the ankle upper legs. No real role is played by Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. It is very miserable, Matt Borlenghi and regrettable croc hunter Costas Mandylor. Sincerely afraid of Dr. P. DINOCROC was admired by attractive Joanna Pacula as a pickled bread.
