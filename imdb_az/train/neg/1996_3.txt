This sad little movie resembles Broadway's resurrection in 1971, a nostalgia hit. Keep in mind that Burt Shvelov wrote extensively in his book on this revival. I feel that this scenario changes much more than the original 1925 version. In 1974, staged by 'innocent betrayer' Jimmy Smith, I thought it would bring back $ 1 DVD's memories. There is no chance. Pleased to see the role of "Topper", Roland Young was greatly disappointed by "my" part. There are three songs from the game and very weak. Even the classic duet, "Tea Two", is a virtual solo. Those who are familiar with the 1940s fiasco are not proud of themselves, and star Anna Neagle just embarrasses. If I feel a dollar spends it, I know that the movie should be bad. Another commentator recalls that Doris Day version and the scene game (of course, original) are actually called "Tea Two", so there is a more popular version of those who want "No No Nanette".
