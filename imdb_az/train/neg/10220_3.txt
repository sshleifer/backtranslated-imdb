First of all, this movie can be divided into three segments. A prospective opening with some cavalry shots by Cheyenne. It can only be described as a long dull middle part, with the wretched Candice Bergen and the "Soldier Blue" traveling to reach the safety of a garrison. Miss Bergen unveils any unpleasant four letter words each time without opening her mouth, and she dropped out of the Jack Nicholson movie in the 1970s. That is, zero curiosity keeps zero confidence. In the third and final sections, an indivisible village of Hindus is expected to be totally unequal. It just comes in a long, ugly and defective manner that deserves the anti-war propaganda. Not recommended. - MERK ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here is an idea. Why not really do not be confused by the liberal nonsense of the film you are commenting on? It's not a political site, it's a movie review. - MERK
