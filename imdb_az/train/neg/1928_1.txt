Grinch Stole Christmas is a wonderful little Christmas cartoon movie, everyone can easily use it, so I did not see the reason for a remake. Not a remake of people, but a cartoon was perfect enough, what is the purpose of this film? But Jim Carrey seemed a bit strange to be Grinch. So is he a great comedian, but as a Grinch? It just did not give me any sense. His performances were a bit of a mood and suddenly funny in moments. Some children are welcome and fewer than a few conversations. Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who were all the story finished and not needed. <br /> <br /> In some cases, everyone is preparing for the best Christmas season, which is supposed to move perfectly. But Cindy Lou - They will not be as good as a lonely Christmas, wondering and worrying about Grinch, who lives on them. She decides that she does not want Christmas this year, and that her version of Christmas really needs to steal all together for Christmas to show who's about it. <br /> <br /> Over the past few years, Christmas celebrations have been celebrated for several years. I really, at least in my opinion, is extremely worried about staying in cartoons for a simple truth. The presentation and presentation of the whole film was a little bit to remind Grinchin how to surprise Christmas! more likely to be an animated film, not a version of Jim Carry. At least this version is grateful for the version of Boris Karloff every Christmas. <br /> <br /> 1/10
