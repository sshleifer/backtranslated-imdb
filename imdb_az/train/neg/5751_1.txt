There are scenes that mix with the actors for a single day, the camera mirror and the red pointer, and even the green light of the stage! Fields and lines are even the smallest inspiration (at least as a movie of a tension genre). Everything related to Poe in the film is a shallow and childish approach. The movie is full of flower and not exciting. a relaxing evening with friends, you will love it (like me), but there is no way to take this movie seriously!
