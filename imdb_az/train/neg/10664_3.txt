Burt Reynolds, too tired, struggles with the old employers for some gizmo that these non-heroes are planning to sell to the Iranians. "Silk Stalking" manufacturers offer some decent motion pictures and low-cost scene "drama" on low X-ray video nonsense ... although the logic is lacking and truly terrific dialogue is certain aspects, although the latter is twisted and loyalty is decoded for a better movie could have been an end. Burt has still existed, though it means you feel more and more when your mouths are half-baked "one-liners" unfairly.
