I wanted to see a moving comedy with a satirical twist (like this movie was shot), but it put me in a bad condition. The plot for me was a little confused to pursue, and I quickly lost interest. I'm sorry to be in touch with this movie for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff. I'll be a fan of all of them, but since then he can heal my senses. I can say positively about the movie that Hillary played Jonathan's character very well, even though he did not recognize Hillary. It took me several scenes to understand that he was. Fortunately I leased it for $ 1 through the Red Box; When I paid to see the big screen, I would really be fuming!
