What is always happening to other Dracula movies, Dracula is always on the side of Dracula, so at the end I'm disappointed. Although the person does not want to be a vampire or I want to see something like the first movie. It's very interesting (because you can almost guess how the story will go) either from a priest or from a D. game (we need some stunning places!).
