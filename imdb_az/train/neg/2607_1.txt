I recently watched the movie and it resembles that of the book. I blamed it in a weak scenario and direction. Some parts have been forcibly evicted without any apparent cause (gay aggression). In fact, after reading the movie for the first time after 20 years or several times, I read a book. I read it and found it a bit quieter. It did not make any difference, so different ideas appeared ... apart from the sensational part time. Because you are surrounded by things that are "sensitive", you can see the fascinity you produced at least to say the least to communism. Now I do not see such a situation, or maybe I can see both in a different way now. The film works hard to cover many aspects of the book, the result is a mix of scenes that can have a meaningful effect on a person reading the book. Nevertheless, this is a difficult movie to watch, and maybe it has never been.
