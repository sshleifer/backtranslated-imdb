I did not go and paid $ 10 and bought the original and best fourth season. At least my children love it and watch it without worrying me. I have a teenager and he thinks that the front images are ridiculous and he watches the original. And Jessica Simpson thinks she's a terrible daisy, actually she looks like a whore than the doves. Those shorts could not wear anything. And when the American Pie has a connection with Dukes, there is SHAME on them to put a bad line on sex with a car. He had to get the R rating in the film. The only good thing that can get out of here is the merger with the original. Give all hope. So, people who go there and watch the film see how they look there
