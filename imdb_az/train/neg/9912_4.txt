I'm totally disagreeing with the viewers who have been in a disadvantage for the Oscars in 2002 for "Birds" for the "Best Animated Short", of course, this is not a sickly and ambitious material for anyone. trust in paradise or hell. <br /> <br /> The animation was good, but there is a very attractive shorts. By the way, I love dark humor, but it was inevitable. When it comes to the story here, a man (here symbolism) is surrounded by something that is wandering around and grinning around in a paradise, hell, or a slippery set of television sets (a few hundred meters away). Each time he armed his head and shoots himself after hearing the news. I think it would be funny in two of the three situations.
