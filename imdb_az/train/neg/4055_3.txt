In the 1960s, I had to be a very serious student at the English school, reading the analysis. Maybe if this is true, then this movie is old. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* ************* Like all children who end up fighting, anti-government and corruption <br /> <br /> Yes, they can leave the main heroes, but they are not. The reasons they go about this issue are not logical. There is not enough character to explain why. A group of innocent people does not mean what they are saying, nor is they disclosed. <br /> <br /> This is the last creative expression of the war, perhaps the only revelation that is related to the existence of every single character of the film. <br /> <br /> The heroes who are involved in crime are fighting. The organization only kills people. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> This film is a teenage agenda to fight against the power that actually wounds them, though they are in fact. There is no moral, symbolic truth or meaning; <br /> <br /> This film is just a fantasy that kills teachers and people in "force". <br /> <br /> If you're thinking of creating a flamboyant / school-like technology like Columbus or Virgo, I guess you'll love this movie and those who do not love you. <br /> <br /> If you are like me and this is a man's name against the "man", it's not just blind but rather blind, and if you're trying to create a life for yourself, boring. <br /> <br /> This <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
