Recently, they have tried to shoot this movie on cable television ads day and night. Do not believe in dessert. I am one of those people who fail to see this stinker in theaters. This is, in my opinion, the worst 3d movie of all time behind Mac & Me (# 1 Worst) and Jack Frost (# 2 Worst), but I have to admit that they are all close and all MEN! Indeed, nothing in this movie is ridiculous or unsettled, or anything else you claim will not loose your money. It's the good thing you give to your best enemy. I'm not lying about it. Anyone who wants to kill you or torture you may be the main candidate for this film. This is horrible. If you do not believe me, then you suffer from the pain of seeing it, so I can understand it. Two Needles Down In an Enthusiastic Way.
