It's not a full-blown rock festival, based on a story of Stephen King. Two tabloid journalists, one seasonal (Miguel Ferrer) and one failed (Julie Entwisle), begin to believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) could actually be a vampire. An unusual strangeness does not give a wing to this modern blood sucker's natural path, but it is looking for its victims through a black Cessna. The film is actually scary because of the approach of the film's foolish final. Remember, Mr. King has nothing to do with this movie. I admit that the night is a little scary at night.
