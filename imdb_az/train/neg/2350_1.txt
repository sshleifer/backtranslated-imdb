This show was laughably bad. Writing asked, dialogue sucked. The man playing Craig could not get out of a sack of paper. Although it was Thursday night, it was definitely great to watch with some beers. <br /> <br /> For my fun, cool music, bad behavior, poor writing, all came together. <br /> <br /> This was a drama / unwanted comedy. I do not think what happens in any of the heroes, all of them were elegant and stupid. The first five episodes were the most harmful because they could not explain who the victim was, and they had to write the surrounding dialogue. That is, the boom in the funeral was ridiculous. In fact, all the scenes that occurred these days were terrible. <br /> So, let's take a look. Everything that happens right now is sucker. Flashback scenes, just writing, dialogue, and Craig's practical exercises. The music ruled it though.
