It should really be worth a "O" rating or even a negative one. I watched this show ages and the show jumped around the 7th series shark. This episode proves that the show shark jumped. <br /> <br /> Beavis and Butthead are not worthy of trash, lazy, absurd, attracts themselves. <br /> <br /> Smile and still entertain - Caribbean pirates, wax, Monte Cristo's number - all "fun" movies that are not taken seriously. However, there is something ridiculous in the form of "this is the worst thing I've ever seen." And in fact, this is the worst episode in Stargate I've seen. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is a very unpleasant thing to me. <br /> <br /> In my basement comes a stargate from anyone. <br /> <br /> He wants to sell all the stargate details in the most serious way.
