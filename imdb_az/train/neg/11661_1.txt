In fact this is not a very, unfunny, action / comedy. First, I would like to say that Wayan's brother was enjoying his fear movie (1) and later that it was moments. Unfortunately, white chicks do not laugh at Half. <br /> <br /> The humor is completely raw. If you like wrinkles, farting, stupid catchphrases, you should probably look at it. If it is not raw, it is meaningless. The first 10 minutes of the movie gave me everything, it was completely unfunny. <br /> <br /> When I was a friend, I looked at everything (otherwise I did not worry). The story was undoubtedly subtle, scary, but at least the laughter was fast and stable. Perhaps one of these problems with this film is one of the main problems, and laughter will not come soon enough. Some jokes are dragged too long, first of all, when it's more funny than funny. If you choose a comedy with several brain cells, avoid it. If you want a foolish comedy for more laughs, watch a scary movie, airplane, 1 + 2. <br /> <br /> 1/10 Completely unfunny, Thin story, What is our idea of ​​a film based on a single idea, that is why we're wearing a white naked for a movie?) But there was not enough material.
