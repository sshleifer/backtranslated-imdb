When looking at some caves with a spouse, a doctor ends up with a bat, causing some exciting side effects ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes a creepy atmosphere and some (in some) makeup effects create a terrifying human-beast It was a sub-par. The Bat People suffers from the unforgettable story that aka lives in the night, incorrectly drawn and inaccessible in pacing. The arson will not go anywhere and will not give any explanation because there is nothing in the film, and even can not produce a satisfying result for that. <br /> <br /> I still give some points for the staged song of the movie and the beautiful shooting places. The make-up of the late Stan Winston is also very good, but there is no need for many showcases here. An open opportunity. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
