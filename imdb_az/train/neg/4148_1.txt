I chose this movie with the intention of getting a bad zombie movie. <br /> <br /> I started filming and was soon taken to pain and visual torture world. <br /> <br /> I finally know. what hell is it. This is the movie. For infinity. This movie has no value. There was not even a plot really. <br /> <br /> There are things happening on every stage, but there is no general explanation for something to happen. <br /> <br /> Instead of watching this movie, I want you to run the closest blender with oil and suit yourself. <br /> <br /> It's better than this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even watch it. I do not even see how bad it is. I beg you. If you watch it, they mean to win.
