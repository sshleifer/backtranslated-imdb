It should be taken to vampires prepared by one of the worst people. How can a charming subject transform into a totally unstable story? Instead, it is not a difficult task ... First, the conditions of any vampirefilm are a dark and stupid atmosphere with a nice sexual touch, there is nothing. Very light - spots! <br /> <br /> Every time Dracula came up, it was slightly burned (in order to keep it weak, the script is weak) When it comes to the end of the movie (great dances with Dracula and its new conquest), it's almost worth a look was. First, I'm really glad, Judas-Twist was a peculiar original, but it's not good. Hopefully, the third will be the vampire I like very much in other classics like Herzogu Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or Even Vampire Interview.
