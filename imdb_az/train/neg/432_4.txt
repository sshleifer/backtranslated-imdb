This film had the potential to be more. <br /> <br /> John Kushak is more sensitive than good and bad Night's Midnight Night. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has said that it looks like a walk-in and a salary gathering. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; <br /> < <br /> <br /> Cusack said that the story of a self-righteous Mayor who was forced to look for "the right thing" was "really kind". <br /> <br /> People did not act in this way, and the character of Cusak, in the end, losing, announcing, propagating, and seductive, making the final scene look deeper, but it's completely wrong, but I will not go into law. <br /> <br /> This is bad for a digital movie. it's actually a pretender for the last hour, proselytism, a fair film, and it's better than a pink purple purse.
