This movie deserves another bad review. Take a look at the reviewer's virtues containing "sex, violence or body". Uh, forgive me. Setting up the film was like Cody's younger comrade, living with love for life, and having everything to live, Cody's bleak, bloody body exploded. Given the essence of the war, Cody was almost horrified. <br /> <br /> Violence that identifies Cody's identity is removed from the many tracking memories for those watching this movie. <br /> <br /> John Rambo, his own Cody family travels on his bike. To make a long trek to the United States by name of a place called Nevada City. No celebration, Cody's obvious harm to the goods. We know it, because the CO declares it practically because it commands Cody to take a "little rest" of his death and destruction. It explains Cody's "flat" impact, as no one feels or cares about. This is not a bad move. Post is a direct effect of traumatic stress disorder. <br /> <br /> Firstly, what can we say about the "accidental" kiss? Autumn was an accident, there was no kiss. How did Cody come up with a good idea of ​​'respecting her'? Now this non-family value was momentous. Immediately after this moment, the universe announced its position on YouTube. Undoubtedly, the unbelief of faith and the arrival of Cody to a "woman who wants to marry another" are accepted in the spirit of the "Xmas" season, all of which are the hearts and lips. <br /> <br /> Unless he knows very little about his Faith fiancé, he accepts his love for himself, but does not take a second nano (which can already wait for second thoughts) to accept his proposal, he is generous, she really loves her, believes that marriage is based on compromises, and both have never discussed plans for marriage. <br /> <br /> The soldier is a wonderful player on hill dialogue such as "I love your son whom you love." They say, "We are part of our family," and they have been called Cody for days after a strange acquaintance. Question: This film is cotton candy Xmas powder, which in its main ways betrays itself. . When he applauded Cody's disrespect for his faith, he was most undesirable, physically speaking to him, and talking to him. By re-defining the family, it's a foolishness: a virtual stranger to a family's full-fledged love member because all of us "love you". You know what everyone is doing or doing. NOTE.
