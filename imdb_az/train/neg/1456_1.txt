Simply, this is a naive and one-dimensional film. The title should say that the name "Severe rise" does not mean to be anything deeper or to do much with the character of Hitler. On the contrary, starting with the first moments of the movie, seeing Hitler playing with bad music, Hitler's view of a TV show that was literally wounded in the morning as a cartoony supervilliant in the morning. The film really wants to claim Hitler's bad, but does anyone need a movie to convince them that Hitler is evil? Finally, giving her such a dim appearance is also boring and surprising (how tough she is, how the psychological features of a film's cold-bloodedness should convince a nation to watch it, or ask her to name the Time's man of the year). This film had a great opportunity to catch a person who committed the worst deeds in the 20th century and tried to get into his idea. Instead, basically, only "Hey Hitler was bad!" You may want to know it again and again. The great Iranians are still attacked for the film to offer a very sympathetic character to the character. Give me some time.
