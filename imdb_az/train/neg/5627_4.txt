It is interesting to see how black men are marginalizing while watching this movie. The film shows how powerless the Blackest person is (except the moment of heroism). For many in the film, other black men in the movie (and dark black women) appear in the background but only visible. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams's character was strong and sympathetic. The viewer can easily identify and sincerely explain it. There are also some pretty visible and three-dimensional support symbols that are lightweight and some of the warmth and dignity are some White Symbols. But in this film 99% of Black men are nothing but invisible men. Fuzzy shadows in the background, no results. This is a terrible flaw, but it is unusual in the main press.
