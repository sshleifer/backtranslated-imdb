STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday night ** Sunday night * Monday <br /> James Dial (Wesley Snipes) is a notorious terrorist who is hiding in his peanut in Montana after seizing. Later, the agent approached to London to go back. His target is kept there and under heavy police control - but they just do not want to capture his own man - they want him to be taken away. It's all good, but then the mission is immersed and when the high-ranking police chief Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, he falls into the knife of sin. She is caught as an animal, shelters in a nearby home, and becomes a friend of Emily (Eliza Bennett), a young girl who deals with her problems and learns how to cleanse her name and learn what betrayers are doing. br /> <br /> This is the ultimate Snipes flat DVD escapade nowhere, even for a small thing with such a presentation minimal (I do not remember seeing anywhere for any ads or trailer). After Snipes' duff DVDs, it could seem like Snoop Dawgun would say he was falling hot. But I felt obliged to go anyway. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> This is at least a motionless in a way, at least a little bit of action, a cool dialogue, and Snipes's complete leadership role. Similarly, in a major supporting role, it is clear that Dance only came to check payment, and it is generally something that none of them would throw in hills in any of their pressures. <br /> <br /> Snipes is interested in Sony when it comes to ending with any subtitle EL DVD movie. **
