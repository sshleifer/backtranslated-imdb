Lipstick is another bright film wrong. I'm trying to think of a good thing I can say about the movie, and I'm having a problem. I think Margaux Hemingway is a wearing red dress at the end of the film, and the script is not the worst thing I've ever encountered, but it would be better. The lipstick is very beautiful. His eyes were very bright and beautiful. The cast was okay. The character of Anne Bancroft was the only character of the whole film. It was sad to see Chris Sarandon spend his time this time.
