The worst movie I've ever seen. I thought the Last Action Hero would never do anything, but it's easy. The film consists of 3 single people who meet on Sunday to discuss sex escapes from the weekends. A fourth person is married and speaks of what he and his wife used to be part of the group. Nothing in this movie works. Jokes are not funny, but they are repeated throughout the movie. The big kicker at the end of the movie is laughable. Avoid all costs.
