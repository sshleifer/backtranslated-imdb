What a bad movie! The Worst Worst! This movie is fun as a dead slug. No talent, no matter how experienced an actor, a stupid area. Who wrote this script? Is there a script for this strange movie, or was the director just by accidentally pressing the record button on the camera and then decided to take up the film? Is this a child film or a comedy or something? My friends are in the sixth class and his and his classmates made an amateur movie for a school project that dropped out of this tempting movie. This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! There is no excuse for this flick!
