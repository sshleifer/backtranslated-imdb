The film begins with a voice saying the audience is where they are and who the characters are. And it's the moment when she's not in love with the movie. With all the endless possibilities in the hands of any movie director, I find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice that really makes it clear. <br /> <br /> I really believe that the shadows of voices betray the film's concept. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I believe that the director must find a visual way to convey his thoughts and feelings to the audience. <br /> <br /> But after a bad effect, a very stunning film begins and lasts a long time. The lives of the middle-class family and all individuals can be perfectly illustrated. I think there is a talent for the director to take realistic living conditions. For example, a father who needs to make special calls from his bathroom may seem abnormal, but life itself may seem abnormal and at the same time very normal. I think the director is a very good observer on real life. <br /> <br /> But that's it. After a while, the reality in the film begins to give birth to a story. I really felt like I had a great headache because of the strangely-spoken characters. Actors and actresses seemed to be the subject of the topic and to cut the dialogue. This is really true, but the characters are always "really like that" and so on. Symbols telling each other, or "no," or "you listen to me" have only one headache that is only ten times the one you say. <br /> <br /> I also think that play practice and reading scenes should be more than scenes. I understand that the game and the movie in the movie are very fraudulent, but I think the director misses the point where he should stop showing these scenes.
