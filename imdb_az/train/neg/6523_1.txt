Take a minute to read the EXAMPLES REVIEW. <br /> <br /> I would like to give this movie even two stars. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> The Tolstoy's novel "War and Peace" in the novel, epic film adaptation, historic precision scenes, courtesy of the Red Army. It should be noted that the novel replacement is very difficult, but it is worth to stay for seven hours. Film is everywhere I know. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to watch the version of RusCiCo - it's widely acknowledged as the best version available after recovering scenes from the mailbox and other DVDs. <br /> <br /> However, I'm one of the worst movie shoots I've ever seen on DVD. The picture is dirty and controversial, often strobing. <br /> <br /> The voice is contradictory, noisy, noisy, and virtually many. others are incomparable. <br /> <br /> As for the language, there is a big problem for those who speak English - there are some good actors in the dubbed selection, some of them are really horrible, and some part of the movie is not just dubbed <br /> The subtitles do not appear at the bottom of the image, but on the right - some of the beauty (or abandoned) appear dark in appearance. Additionally, subtitles are often a poor translation (shame that the article has taken pains to approach the actual words of Tolstoy), and subtitles are also partially abandoned. <br /> <br /> So you can maximize color, brightness, and picture settings, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style> If you choose the subtitled * English dubbing, Maybe one day someone will come and restore - maybe I will see a masterpiece - but after a while, I can not just give more than one star, just the first I'm going to watch 12%.
