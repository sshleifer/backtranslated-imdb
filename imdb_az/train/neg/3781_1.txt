(Some possible spoiler) <br /> <br /> I do not think when Dreamworks decides to diminish this pretty tired and naked animated flick to $ 80 million. Perhaps it is enough to see the magnificent animated audience (mostly their families) in the droves. Opening for the weekend was worth $ 26 million and approx. $ 38.1 million. total (an assessment for this weekend). But I thought that the weekend audience I saw, and after spending the word, I saw quite a lot of what I did. <br /> <br /> The movie is about 80 minutes away. <br /> <br /> <strong> feels like a long, but three-hour epic. There are a few neat points for me, so irritating stories are one of them, and this is obviously written. At one point, he runs away from some captives and sounds a talent (talented Matt Damon's voice) to clarify any wrong ideas, even though the horse is clearly scared. br /> <br /> I'm a fan of his music, I'm good, but Dreamworks really can handle the audience 8-9 now, I'm a fan of his music, and I'm finally a spoiler, finally a spoiler, At the point where it splits in vain, it also falls on a horrible sickle (horse). The soul tries to get rid of it (at the center of the film), but both must have a drop of at least 50 meters above the waterfall, and then we see that horse is alive and good at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> I know this is a children's movie, but even this realism can not be accepted in small quantities. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, Vie, guys say they will not love it, but everyone will check the waiting times for this hour. It's definitely the top 10 of the year's top list. <br /> <br /> <strong>
