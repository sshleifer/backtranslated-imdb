I saw the original "Chorus Line" in Broadway, how many times God knows, and the feeling of passion, despair, and joy comes from this live experience of the theater. Michael Bennett did not understand how to do this but to describe the "Chorus" for the screen. If the person who came with the show is wrong - you should answer your question. There's just one live demonstration - with the audience. Nevertheless, it has ended with directing the film, which does not resemble the scene of dance with animals at Richard Attenborough and Doctor Doolittle, fresh from Gandhi's musical compositions. Horrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!), Great songs were released or given other symbols (meaningless). Michael Douglas caught himself up with his competitors. People who could not dance tried to move, and there was a sexy "Leaders" woman, who could not sing, move, or dance - perhaps she realized that she was Gandhi's spouse. Jeffrey Hornaday's dances are nothing more than the "flashdance", and nothing works. I sat there, wondering how something so awesome and emotional could have been discharged. If you go back to Broadway in 2006, if you love this show - look, but I do not think there is nothing to do with this movie, which has been a long-standing music event of "A Choir Line".
