Yes, I want something similar in this movie - it's not a bold thing. Anyone with a dentist knows why. <br /> <br /> In some cases, the motives of the character of Corbin Bersen can give more meaning to many scary movies. <br /> <br /> I'm a worse player, director, script and so on. I saw it, but in the end it's still a bad scare movie. Whether or not you have such a thing, this is the case. I tried to follow it later, but it was exactly the same as in this movie. Once you have been tortured by a dentist, this is a movie for you!
