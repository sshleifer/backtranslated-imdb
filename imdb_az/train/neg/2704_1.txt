I do not understand why people would praise this trash. Its wrong, stupid, unreal, terrible and just about everything. The film is an idea of ​​life, race issues, prejudices and everything that strange in college. This is where it is failing. There is no pain in the truth. Many suspicious scenes in the film, such as <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A black man, The white man was stopped by the same black man and disassociated from the subject of a roof and beat Rodney King, working with a gun. <br /> <br /> Unlike several previous browsers, several brown men were marked as beaten by a few black men. Rhymes Another critical defect in the film is deeply unwelcome key characters. Fear and mixed white people, mean, angry and still right (?) Black people. It is almost an insult to both black and white people. I am not a white man and I know many black and Spanish people that it is wrong to describe the characters of this film and to give them these features only because of their race. <br /> <br /> The story line that I will now explain is around three characters. One is a dark, aggressive white girl asking questions for black athletes, and the second is a mixed and frightened white man, and then blames the problems of black people who later became guilty in the film. All of them have a share of problems and adventures that do not forget sex, aggression, war, love, hate, prejudice, race war and oh yeah education. All of this comes to the end to make a deadly shot. They think, "It is bad to be white" after returning to drill life. Is this sound like a college year? I did not think so. <br /> <br /> This is really a bad, dirty, ugly movie. If you want to see a more accurate look or race issues, see American History X. Leasing College If you want to see a more accurate look of Porkys. Only avoid this confusion.
