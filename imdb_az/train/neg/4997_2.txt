... but of course not worth it. Writer-director Preston Sturges creates extensive features by writing an inexperienced and sometimes unexpected, wise and compassionate dialogue with unusual kinematic effects to explain his stories. (The next film of Coen's brothers will be respectful to Sturge). <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that this area is not there yet; lack of surprise, unexpected twisting, and sudden change of wealth that keeps track of viewers. The coffee slogan is a bad thing to hang in the field, and the final is completely predictable. Frank Capra makes these things even better. <br /> <br /> If you are looking at Preston Sturge, first check the "The Lady Eve" or "The Sullivan's Travels" or the "Morgan River's Miracle". If you have already seen them, go ahead and follow it.
