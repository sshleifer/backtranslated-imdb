The main character, Lance Barton, was killed early and came to heaven. <br /> <br /> When he learns that hell is wrong, he is given the body of Mr. Wellington, who was just dead and white. <br /> <br /> A young black man resembles a young black man in the corpse of old white men. You see it by an old white actor. In this film, I ended up reminiscent of myself: "Chris Rock should have been an old white boy". <br /> <br /> The whole concept does not play as it is meant: "dream" is not good, love story is not convincing. All you have seen is a small black man playing Chris Rock because there is a lot of trouble for the viewers to "stop the blasphemy" if the old white man is to be shown only in smaller areas.
