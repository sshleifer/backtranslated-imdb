This movie was written badly. The characters did not have any depth. They did not film any. <br /> <br /> My 11-year-old son, Hyung-rae Shime, could write a better scenario. <br /> <br /> Only the non-smoker actor was a guard of the zoo. <br /> <br /> I love movies and try to make them doubt, but this is my collection of my number 2 list. <br /> <br /> <strong> Even dragons ... why they called D-war?
