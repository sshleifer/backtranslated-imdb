I did not know anything about this movie, and I went about half an hour knowing everything about it. This was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm a nice person at all, but if someone told me he liked this movie, I would never talk to them again. Anyone who likes it most likely has a very dry, hermit-type personality. And I think they are also smart, like the naked bags that make the sound of the movie. I know that everyone has different types of humor, some may not even be the same, but good; However, I do not think despite any humor. This movie is Wes Anderson's plain and boring as the mind. Go and get ready to go; It's good to get your money back.
