Hellborn starts as a young psychiatrist named James Bishop (Matt Stasi), resides in St. Andrews asylum seeker or 'mental illness facility' as they would call. Dr. Bishop with nearly 600 patients. Acquainted with McCort (Bruce Payne) and puts it on the job, he gets the 'A' cover, where several serious, dangerous and dangerous patients are kept. If not worse than the first round of this trip, Bishop found a dead body and threatened the graffiti messages that splashed into his room. The bishop begins to hear news about bad news from patients and soon he finds stories for himself more than just a truth about them ... <br /> <br /> Cursed shelter was administered by this supernatural horror film, Philip J. Jones, something similar, but in the end there was a lot of unsatisfy elements to get my full pleasure. The script developed by Matt McCombs is very serious and I like some basic ideas of my opinion, but there are a few things to do with it. For a beginner, the film is too slow, the story is very good and does not give up too early, but it definitely keeps its age and I lose speed with every passing minute. I also thought that the end of the so-called twilight was very much anticipated, and I thought it was too soft and forgetful to end it. This story is a shame because we like the character, the reception, and some ideas, but there is simply too slow and frank to have fun on the 90-minute period. <br /> <br /> Basbug Jones is doing a good job, it's a really well-lit and pretty atmosphere movie. I can not say that there is nothing scary here. I do not know if Hellborn was hit by a real man, but I'm not sure if it were not for a big deal, and that the movie might look pretty good. Unfortunately, there is no real defect or lack of movement, there are two hand-wound wounds and a cut tongue, which is completely different. Believe it and, according to your research, special effects are either the worst or the very best, and as a loyal watchman of low budget horizons, I have an impressive suit with a suit type rather than a striking CGI computer graphic. <strong> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hellborn it's a movie, there were good things about it, but at the same time, unfortunately, it's good. I'm looking at the sections I like, but just as a full 90-minute review experience is not always possible to give advice to anyone.
