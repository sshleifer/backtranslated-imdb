"You have to be" is another sign that Hollywood fled from ideas. This picture is about Charlie Hudson, who turned to an old police officer Writer. When Charlie's fianc√© left the city, she was crammed with all of her wedding planning. She spent a week in a hospital and answers Anna Penn, a teacher who just happens to marry. Two men quickly become friends and plan together separate weddings. When the area is elegant, Charlie is in love with Anna and she should choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie will crush every romantic comedy you've ever prepared and just waiting for the end of the movie because you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge really make this movie truly mediocre performances that are more intense to watch the gut.
