This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Again, I made a mistake of buying the movie, because the back part of the synapse was cool and the front cover was also quite cool. (I purchased it and learned the "Malevolence" movie that I saw in the movie). I love fears in the woods or outdoors or in the farm. It probably took place in the forests of Texas, but was probably shot in the back yard of the director. Production was the worst I ever saw. The players were totally WORST. The story does not have to do with the back cover. I even tried to sell to F.Y.E and another "mom and pop" shop that bought the used DVDs and could not buy it. How terribly this poorly-arranged pretext for a movie was. I first saw some bad movies (eg Troll 2), but it definitely gets a cake. I did not think it was a worse than Troll 2. Boy wrong! It's better not to get yourself free without buying this movie, but it's better than being screwed up, no matter what you throw!
