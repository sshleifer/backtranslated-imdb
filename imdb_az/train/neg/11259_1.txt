I gave this movie 1. I do not understand how Ettore Scola, one of the more Italian cinematics, is filming, foolish and funny! The stories of the people involved in the film are unusual, boring and not interesting. Too long, very boring. The only thing I keep in this movie is Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann. I hope Scola will change radical themes and styles in the next movie.
