In 1692, Salem made the lie of a lie about the involvement of a slave in ghosts into a rebellion. Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray are not the suit dreams, nor are the live images of infected hysteria. Written by three writers (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead, and Bradley King), the story elements are quite interesting (especially in 1937, leaving Hollywood). Arthur Miller's "The Crucible" melodrama shown here will not last long. The biggest problem with the picture can be a lie: Colbert and MacMurray are a pair of lovers who do not interfere with magic hunting, MacMurray is a very modern entity for the environment. * From 1/2
