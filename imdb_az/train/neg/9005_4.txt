If Alien, Jurassic Park and countless other philosophy films are cups of tea, add some sugar, you'll take them down. The film begins in England, which shouted around 1100 minutes and then celebrates California Day. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is a new Security Chief and Military Advisor to a Underground Science Lab for 400 meters. He came with a leading Scientist (Carver also a helicopter pilot) and we soon found a cloning lab and they have something to discover in the clone. Dinosaur or what? As with the films above, all hell remains empty and we begin to take our characters. Special effects on the monster are pretty good for the "direct video" movie, and Dean takes care of Cain. But what about the rest of the band? Nevertheless, do not go with high expectations and you will get better.
