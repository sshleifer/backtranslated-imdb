Many months before the age of 7, I did not know that the trader was there for this movie. I appealed to my loyalty and asked my parents to take this film. Because they were wise adults they were telling me, "No, it's a group of garbage." Of course, I was very surprised that I would not be the first child on my blog to see "I am a mysterious man". <br /> <br /> A little time has passed - maybe a few days. I forgot about The Incredible Ergonomic Man and blessed my dream. Twenty-five years passed and my thoughts came to my mind. I discovered this long lost work of a movie while surfing through the digital cable. My concern was pigment and I finally decided to take part in this fruit that my parents had forbidden. I listened to them. "The Unbelievable Man" is perhaps the worst movie for human beings. Def-Con 4, Metalstorm, and Freddie Got Fingered create Oscar-nominated films. I feel it's about two hours of my life spoiling it to watch this bad dirt. even raw material for 1977. How did a movie company convince this movie not to go beyond me? <br /> <br /> I do not make the same mistake. If you are forbidden to watch this movie, listen to your parents. They were right.
