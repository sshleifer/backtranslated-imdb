How can a film be made worse than this. Wrong motion. Bad script. Just a shame around. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are some big names in this movie. Unfortunately, they are not singers and actors. <br /> <br /> This film did not give any money for a good reason. The appeal of black cowboys is not just there. This is a shame that they do not give a good story. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are some big names in this movie.
