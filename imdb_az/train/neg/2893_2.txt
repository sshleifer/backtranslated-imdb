What was this? Fisher King's rebuilding? Why do we look for Sandler's character? What a slow, painful, dull, who-give-a-fucking-about-this-people movie !!! Just sit down painfully, I quit before I finish. It is clear that Cheadle Sandler needs much help; Like I said: Do you say "Fisher King"? How does this psychotic character work in your daily life? I believe we do not have to think deeply. Why does Cheadle Sandler continue to chase her? If they were good friends, how did they leave? If Cheadle is so controlled, why is he looking for advice on shrinking on the street? We are never. Fisher King was so much better at a very high level, and why he just recovered. About 8 average points in 10? I agree. All right. Even the top films are lucky to have such a high average rating, and this crap is not worthy of being in the same universe with them.
