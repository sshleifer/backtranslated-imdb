This is a bad movie, there are only 5 police on HK, there is no use of the gun, and it feels like Jacky Chan movie. They used the gun to just show the suspect. When you kill each other while using their weapons, what a funny movie. In the movie, all the good guys died without a reason. <br /> <br /> They also create a story line, the story splits from here and there and makes people bored. But if I wanted to see a bloody movie, this is just one type of movie, I think the US zombie movie is bloody than this one.
