Yes, what can I say about this movie? I'm silent. How can I keep up with this movie forever, but it really was a shocking experience. Moreover, some people looked at each other as they were stained. I do not know that at one stage, one of the best martial arts films has become one of Fistsoff's anger played with Bruce Lee. If he were still alive and faced with this movie, he was terrified. The rest of the film is totally funny and the tape is lost. Like a tape, a similar film was not shot in the movie. Now I feel more stupid to watch 30 minutes of my life. The only reason I've seen is because my roommate has downloaded her patient's interest. What does this world come from?
