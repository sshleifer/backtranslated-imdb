This is a mute movie. <br /> <br /> After talking about some of the movies, shooting of the film is not very important, but I felt like this movie was deceived and played a foolish game every time. <br /> <br /> With the player I thought any beef, but the characters were awful. Film begins with Clive Owen's character and reminds us how often he is guilty and how he plans the perfect bank robbery. Oh yeah, he says he is in a prison, even though this is a terrible metaphor. Any dragon knows that the best bank robbery can be potentially wrong at least, and he knows that the police go before they can be shown. But Clive Owen requires schemes around the bank to hang around - not for any reason, to put it around, and to fear as much as I can. He also hires hostages, negotiates with police and, most kindly, hides a housewife in the bank's stock shop and hides there for a week (hopefully he has brought enough food) and then leak again. Yes, it sounds like a perfect crime for me, Clive! <br /> <br /> Along with this, there are numerous moving parts: the scenario writer said that the only reason for not falling is that. <br /> <br /> And then there are many unexplained details: why the police are among the hostages of these kinds of hostages? Who is hell is the character of Jodie Foster and why it is so important that he has a mayor in his beck and call and Denzel tells Washington that "he is above the sum of his wages?" He does not answer. It is the voice of a criminal gang who plans a robbery if it does not shake a guy who speaks an hour of a foreign language to the police hours? How did the robbers turn away and why did Clive Owen stay for a week? How did they learn about the history of the Bank's chairman and its safe deposit box number and content? Jodie Foster or Clive Owen for the cops went to hell for what? Can they bring AK-47 toys up to date? How do you punish a pizza box? How did Clive Owen begin to avoid hiding in a safe area during the working hours? <br /> <br /> Does this brave criminal really feel solid enough to cross a brilliant in Denzel? <br /> <br /> None of these questions are answered. Surprised by the events taking place on the screen, there are movies to reach depth, but I have never felt anything like Inside Man. I felt like the scenes telling me that these things were cut off from the movie, or these questions have never been answered and it is weak. Particularly annoying is the character of Jodie Foster, who does not disclose what she's doing but does not depend on reminding us how important it is. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave the two stars of this movie laughed with Denzel's "taxi boards" and "pina colada", and I took his word. kid ugly video game. In addition, there is no free feature in this movie.
