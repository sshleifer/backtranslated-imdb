When I decided to settle in front of a television movie, I came here yesterday, and I turned them into an unacceptable look. <br /> <br /> Firstly, it is important to note that this is a major event, which is also a housewife's day-to-day film. The performances on the wooden floor, everyday housewife's day-to-day movies and bad soap operas are a 'terrible' attempt, and men (and especially soldiers) are basically violent and afraid. The whole movie is related to 'drama' when men are in danger to develop a second dimension. <br /> <br /> Be aware of this if you are susceptible to (or even pleasant). Linda Hamilton's German emphasis, while very good, distracts painfully - for the same reason. Other speeches are undoubtedly a source of perseverance, without being ashamed of the guilty ones, who are undoubtedly guilty of being subtle and clear. <br /> <br /> There are many surprises, but look at the food and drink that miraculously shows the soldiers' bags explaining hunger for the endless supply of Monty Pythonesque! <br /> <br /> I did not expect action, but hopefully a nice or textual or emotional charge. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it resembles an intelligent audience that was a 'noisy' story that was a very bad Christmas. <br /> <br /> Explain these with an explanation: 1: There is nothing else. 2: Predictable "Housewife turns men and you win television movies 3: The only way you can really judge a real story is to make Hollywood a feature film 4: You have suffered a lot of stress because you mix your emotion easily with a complicated storytelling.
