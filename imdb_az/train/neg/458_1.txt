What is this shit? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> My little cousin is obviously a DVD film and title ... I decided to watch with him, he was not bored and I'm sure the first one was a strange player. Emblemed players appear to read the unreadable cards. The supply is sub-par and many shapes. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> formula. I can not calculate the time I predicted the next joke. I took a few giggles from the delicate "subtle" sex ladies. The Cat, The Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? .. c'mon! Stay away from this movie. It's not cute, it's funny, it's not even fool-ridiculous. It's just stupid. Like a PG children's movie with unwanted sex innuendo, vulgarity and violence to unite the MPAA rating. <br /> <br /> "Do you want to walk in my bed?" <br /> <br /> "Are they now calling?" <br /> <br /> In some cases, I gave blood to my nose! <br /> <br /> Yes, they played badly, sir.
