I do not know why, but for some reason I think since Disney has been a binge since then, I just decided to continue and see the 102 Dalmation. Playing the role of Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, the first film of the Disney cartoon classic, it seemed like an exact hit, but it was a bomb. In my opinion, the reason for these films is that 101 Dalmation is a genuine cartoon that works better and is more appealing to children and adults. It's really not fun, because it's the adults who want to act like cartoon instead of people, and I understand they're trying to make sure they're attractive to children, but there are ridiculous things to see the actors do. <br /> <br /> For some time, Cruella De Vil has been in prison, but it is changing when it is proven that she is a lovable and pleasant man. However, his reputation has already been damaged as a puppet, but only a person's shoemaking shelter and instantly seems to be loved and changed by everyone. However, when he sees the Dalmatians of the experimental director, he becomes embarrassed and begins to see the blemishes and loses it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If we are faced with this tragedy, this movie is a funnier than the Qafqaz University made it a very stupid nut. Also, like a puppy, it just works for the animation, it sounds foolish, but cartoons and their personalities are not unbelievable in the confusion. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I really do not offer 102 Dalmation, it's good, but If you admit that the first movie has taken time, that is the same thing. <br /> <br /> 2/10
