At first, this movie was not bad. It was fun ... at least for me, probably all the wrong reasons. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me that this strange Kristofer Rever movie is a cursed village. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, when his authoritative bad guy, received a calligrapher from her long-lived fiancee, claimed that "Summerisle" kidnapped her daughter and hid from other islands. <br /> <br /> Because Cage is a police officer and a tired cop, she goes to the semi uncharted island, which does not leave anybody in the real world. Stupidity. <br /> <br /> Things are strange when lying to the great Amish-esquire women who live in the Alliance and when they lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl. Her fianc√© is not an all-time helpless and tired assistant. Cage is a lucky man who is on the island while learning that she is the daughter of the missing girl and flies to the islands as a sacrificial victim during the island festival of illness. <br /> <br /> Do not work well in this movie. Feminism is a demonstration of a patient wound? <br /> <br /> Some women run a bear in a suit and run around. There were many holes in this film. I understand that the angry women are devoting themselves to a hobby, but it is strange as described in this film. Although many women have been hit and fired several times, it is a form of sexuality. If the roles were restored, I'd hate the movie. This movie is perhaps one or two times to watch. It is not just a strain that should be classified as strange.
