This film is so bad, it's almost polluted. In fact, after the end, there is a strong sense of relief, and the comfort can now be pulled back to the retractor device before the rest of your video cassette is dirty and RUSH returns it to the video rental shop. When I rented it, I wrote that William Hurt's "phone" looks like a kind of movie. I said that he did not work too hard. However, Bill Hurt is actually not in TELEPHONE on a large number of scenes in this movie! The implementation of this ironry was the only pleasure we could get from this mixed confusion. Cinematography and editorials are dark and unhappy, the story is chaotic and noisy noise. There is a slight resemblance to "Falling Down," but the film was a bewitching storyline, great writing and a player, and an attractive soundtrack. The "polluted man" is a sort of breaking old European tourist trap, and this is like sliding in a country that sees an onslaught road. smokeless Do you get the picture? Do not buy it.
