This film became the winner of the 1990 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the past few weeks, I have seen dozens of candidates and buyers of this award in the last 30 years, and I think all of this movie can be the worst - it's still not just a candidate, it's won! I think that 1989 was a terrible year for the genre. <br /> <br /> A superficial character, such as Uncle Festers, appears in the movie. Simple moving elements appear using moving stop animation. They are all the same - the same faces, corpses and dresses. The only difference is a different number drawn on their back. They all stop on a great platform, which is as magical as it is in space. Each has a pole and has a box on their platform. The platform starts to bend slightly and in response, men move to balance the platform. It continues for a long time and continues. Only one relief from this magnificence, one of which is very bad at the end, but it is not enough to keep track of it. <br /> <br /> So the short short KNICK KNACK also appeared in 1989 and I did not know why. was not among the candidates. It was a great short and was better than the year or previous year candidates. In the previous years, Pixar's success contradicted it, but KNICK KNACK was so clever and laughable that it was almost deprived of criminality. Pixar did not enter it? This is not possible.
