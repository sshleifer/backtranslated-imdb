Go right now and rent this movie. Your local video will be on the shelf of your store and will be dusty. No one will touch it for many years. Even a $ .50 can be customized! Ten dollars worth, I swear it! Get it! There are not many films that can be compared to it - in a few years can be the goo celluloid version of the trash. Yes, I gave it '1', but it really deserves a lot. 1-10 scales were not forgotten by such things.
