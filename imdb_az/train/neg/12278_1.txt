While watching this show, you are not entirely convinced that there is a story or even more boring toy. First of all, the episode of each episode is predictable, writers should use every possible clich√©, not just the general area, but the scenes, and the line of each character. There is a collage from every police station there. On top of this, the show's "message" is good, good is good, bad is bad, at the end of the day goodness will prevail and we love each other, better people and better citizens, all in the most prominent way. Players will use their limited player skills as a tool of this message and more: "I am a good carrier" smile, a related look and "Victory our" body posture, Bad guys "I'm a bad guy" "followed by his appearance, and then" I'm good for nothing and I have to get out of society "(this is the overall development of each show). The real story, not the demonstration is garbage, once again proves that producers do not give anything to viewers, and that all of us are thinking of stupidity. Well, this series is all about trying to get you out of the brain.
