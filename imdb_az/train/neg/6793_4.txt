Dry, dusty west of the film, directed by Richard Brooks, who has a long-lasting longing in the genre while keeping all the ordinary stereo. In the early 1900s horse racing draws a low-key cowboy (Gene Hackman), a strange player (James Coburn), a rude boy (Jan Michael Vincent) and even FEMALE (surprising game Candice Bergen). If Gary Cooper is something like that, it's a pretty weak entry, even if predecessors set out (with controversy about a woman's presence) to break this new ground. Well visible, if there is a nice casting of mace verve and the top of the covered piece, still the structure mechanisms are often tedious. ** from ****
