Do you want to know a mystery? This movie is healing. Actually, I do not know because you allow yourself to be plagiarized in original films, maybe we may be surprised by this movie (a plagiarized copy of what this movie did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the movie were based on a typical story setting; A group of cool young people who love their vacations in Floridia and behave like young adults. The only idea we have at this point is the ability of the director to reflect an ambitious part of the adolescent depression in the characters. In the second half of the film, he gains a little impetus and begins to show a start to unprecedented murders. The third half hour of the film is a secret for me. Because I think that the movie can still be an interesting and original show I can overcome myself. Depending on the story, it can easily be explained in several lines. A group of young people are on vacation in Florida. Even though they are busy parties, they begin to kill, because they know a generous mystery (and I say SLOWLY) slowly. Those who are the only victims of murder are all victims are maticulates a common high school. But one thing that impressed me about this movie was how much betty (im not sure in my name ... blonde character) looks like reese witherspoon. Something else that surprised me about the movie also jumped from my seat several times. Is this a work of art? my 12-year-old brother gave me a glass of orange juice because I was "boo'ed" when I ran away from my guest room ... there was a difference between the director and my 12-year-old brother ???? <br /> <br /> Want to know a secret? I'm not sure about you guys, but I do not know.
