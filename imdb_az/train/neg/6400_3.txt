Pryor and Gleason's comedy power could not save this dog from a thin, weak script, horrible action, and a smile on the mix. There are very few memorable moments, but it dries well. As a child, I remember Lucia as a hot tool for these two actors' comedy, but there was something strange about always the feelings and feelings of each area and how it all depends on the field. Looking back over many years, it's a schlock-a-mani crash. I'm not so concerned about racist discrimination until I think of a movie. The most obvious mistake for me is that the scenes are similar to each other, and the 2-minute situation is composed as a series of comedy bits (at least very good ones) and a speaker jointed by a local irrigation pit. Symbols change the feeling and motivation of a dime, change from heroism, reason, between scenes and scenes, and it feels no-one is thinking about leaving the scenario. It is not any gem that starts with it. I feel bad for those who are the two heirs that this tragedy should never happen. Maybe my sense of humor has been very gentle ...
