Let's see what we should start ... do not act badly; I even think of it, but I'm not sure that along the lines of scenarios that can not read much effort. The actors did not even go into their parts and seemed to be quite lifeless and purity. There was no doubt that he had one scene or two naked, but he could not save the movie from the lifeless character. <br /> <br /> The main character is insult to people who really are a rapper. <br /> <br /> Words did not have a rhythm or a stream, and seemed to be more visible along the line of ignorant ghosts. <br /> <br /> Budget? Is there a budget in this movie? They seemed to use less money than they saw in a home-shot YouTube video. Bad illumination, props, silent post production. Bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them. If the story really was of interest, the story would be good, but there was no life for that flick; <br /> <br /> Last year, I saw some really bad fuss, and this is really at the bottom. Do not waste your time or ask for this unbiased review. Check your ratings, and you'll notice that 1's quickly breaks out of the tenth in a row. I wish I had come a little closer before my time was wasted. What a suck-fest!
