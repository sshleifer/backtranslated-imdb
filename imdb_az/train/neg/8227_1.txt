I'll keep it fast and sweet. Five girls on their way home from a soccer game decide to buy a 'abbreviated' part that leads them to a slippery slope of a forest. <br /> <br /> Certainly, good things happen to them, and they will come to their destination safely. <br /> <br /> True, they do not exist. <br /> <br /> After spending time with her husband, she was buried a few days ago. Their screams and shocking voices gave me a headache, and it was written that there were very few recurring expressions and unusual hysterical screams. In general, one of the worst cheap horrors I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot.
