I was torn in DARK ANGEL. The film looks like a "loving" respect for surviving the biggest pin-ups, but there is little actual "content" that the film itself has never thought to be meaningless. I can not see the motivation or the "point" of this movie - because there is very little biographical information in the narrative - Those who do not know much about Bettie will be able to watch DARK and not even know ANGEL ... The film basically focuses on Betty's career marks a few years in bondage modeling. Almost all movies are made up of some "reagents" of Bettie's "popular" photo shoots and clicks. These repetitions are definitely 75% of the film's duration and do not give any idea as Bettie. The film touches on short-term legitimate activities and its subsequent departure from its "business" and its subsequent decision to become religious, but they all support prolonged and re-enactment scenes ... <br /> <br /> DARK ANGEL is a terrible film not - there is no substance for him. Another problem is that the actress playing Bettie is really like it in remote shooting - up-close it's no-go. Another thing that irritated me was that, despite the fact that Bettie had some of the top models, the only nudity of the movie was a short segment of the zoo during the recent loans. The film itself has a very low budget, but it can make a costume suit with restrictions, and there is no silence for me. The actor is incredibly wooden and unmemorable to anyone involved. In fact, the most memorable thing for me is the actor Dukey Flyswatter, who played the real name of Irving Klaw. No joke - check the castle list. I can not say if this is not the case for the Bettiefile companion, and there is nothing to do with it, I strongly recommend it. And if you blush, then I should treat it all the time ... 4/10
