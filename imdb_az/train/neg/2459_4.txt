Obviously, I did not care for the things that come as a follower of many things (aka "form of future things"). That is, there is a good chance you will like me more. In any way, it may be helpful to hear a movie from another perspective. <br /> <br /> As a designer, he has much experience and is driven by William Cameron Menzies as artistic guide. , Is a film adaptation of a novel by HG Wells. <br /> <br /> The film opens in London at The Everytown in 1940. This film was opened in 1940. The war is cooked and citizens of every city are worried about them. It does. This is mainly a decade-old work that destroys civilization. Wells and Menzies continue to spend time to show us different scenes of war and post-war. We see two pilots falling into each other to agree on the consequences of the battles. We are meeting a post-apocalyptic community that is governed by a future war leader. We are meeting with a future futuristic community. We see that technology has changed. <br /> <br /> Finally, we are taking full advantage of the futuristic society of 2036. Here leaders are worthy of sending people to the moon. <br /> <br /> All this is potentially very interesting, but not just a movie. Structurally, the film is episodic, though it is a bit like it. In the third part, I lost interest in trying to follow the characters altogether. But in the first couple of segments, I could fix them. New faces have a constant parade. <br /> <br /> We will not learn anything about each of them. <br /> <br /> With a few exceptions, it is inclined to focus and edit individual segments. They sometimes manipulate - they may begin to feel like a propaganda film. <br /> <br /> In fact, an overlapping section looks like more music videos / industry promotion videos. Features include building a futuristic city, numerous large machines, numerous welding and so on. At one point a man looks like an astronaut waves in a cell with a futuristic glass. Music for this section is between a militarist and an extremely terrible little score. <br /> <br /> Behold, future things are a matter of dramatic concern. <br /> <br /> But the general thing that supports the future of things is that it is a film about ideas. This can be true, but in this way there are a few problems. One is still a movie that does not work, that is, a visual and light dramatic artwork, and there are many ideas presented here. <br /> <br /> What does war and civilizations do? Making a movie about the movie is a good thing. In 1935 (released in 1936) "Things to Commit" were written and shot. Wells has some interesting things about the war, some oppose the usual interpretation of the film. For example, he considers that a final war would happen in another war or at any moment. A tale of general message appears pessimistic. Wells, as we have seen, does not prevent the war, simply "progress", although in fact, the progress is at least fuel. <br /> Of course, it's enough for a movie. But there is more to do here. The scene between the two pilots is one of the more harsh scenes of the film. This is a complicated dilemma. One pilot shot another, but now comes to help him. But the firefighter was now carrying a toxic gas, which is now spread to the field. They also can not breathe gas without harm. A girl comes together. Only two of them are gas masks. The pilot, who was taken into custody, offers his mask as he dies anyway. What should I do? This scene is not enough to extend itself, but to think of a strange complex - a film that helps to hurt one another in the middle of a war and harming one another. <br /> <br /> Another example. In the current apocalyptic environment, there is a serious illness called "circulatory illness", which occurs around possible scenes of warplanes. It's becoming a bit like zombies. The judicial procedure is to sacrifice victims to prevent the illness. This item is operated as before. At the same time, Wells presents the future society as controversial socialist ideas. It was enough for his film. <br /> <br /> Besides, within 100 minutes, it's not possible to engage in something more effectively, especially at least one review instead of dramatic attraction. If you have a fantastic buff all this is a historic film. When menzies have a background, production and design are interesting even if cinematography is extremely dated. Wells is also interested in seeing how or in retrospectively humorous "predictions" are. I especially enjoyed the Moon's picnics, which was reminiscent of Georges Méliès's trip to Le Voyage dans la lune in 1902. I just do not expect much from what's coming.
