Totally funny. If you know something about poker, it will be absolutely terrifying and fun because it is so clueless. Nerd, a filmmaker of this film, is quite certain about a very pious and poker game, but I doubt that he is playing more than 3-6. (I think he does not know anything about golf). In the classroom, I saw a better product in the classroom, the first class of the film. Actors in this film are Queen Momma, Scotty Nguyen and lost casinos. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * The film begins with the opening sequence, the only reason for the film being shot. He is a poker who plays poker and does not have a dialogue line, but the actor is a man who is paying for the obvious film. I do not think to spend more money for this barrier-free production than this person fired. <br /> <br /> There is very little poker in this movie. Often, the fields are spent on useless side symbols, which are not solved the most out of the field. Queen Momma throws her lover out of a window and has a show-theft area trying to hit her brain. Also, the unnamed Arabs in the comfort shop also give brilliant speeches during the discussion of an elderly woman pushing them down or killing them. Their exquisite performances are easily found among the moments of the film. <br /> <br /> As a result, it is absolutely nonsense. The nine out of the outer space were a little more in touch. If you want to be a hero, you play poker. And if you are a Christian, you can do some of the heavy-handed religious conversations that have been peppered as a pepper for the movie. I hate movies created by religious people. Especially those who think they know something about things they do not know about. I'm sorry that Jennifer Harman and Scotty Nguyen have been involved in this travesty because I can not help but think less of them. Johnny Chan needs to envy his involvement in Rounders.
