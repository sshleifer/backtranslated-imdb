Perhaps the best adventure of Orlando fans, Potter, offers the worst way here: he writes, directs, stars, and co-writes music, in fact, including a pitiful love song. The film is like a high school or college project, when it comes to the conclusion that the loved ones loved it and that melodramatic obsessions are so interesting to us. But the character of Potter's is not that difficult for his romantic plunge, and the whole film is unimpressable as a shameful appearance of masquerading as a celebration of tango. Perhaps he could have worked if he did not throw himself. He does not play alone or can not play alone. Yes, passionate, boring and foolish.
