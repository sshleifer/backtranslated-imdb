Lying Slides! This is a fight between the two brothers (Dennis Quaid and Arliss Howard), both of which can trigger fires intellectually; they hit the square on the differences in childhood, Debra Winger with dippy love kept in the middle. Director Glenn Gordon Caron (Television Naked Behind Moonlighting) draws the dark comedian comedy from Vince Gilligan's scenario with a very neat presentation, and the film looks like an entrance to a fifth-million-dollar gift film student. A great commercial property has pronunciation power, but it's a style that does not produce anything except the kooky eccentricities. They are not even characters, they want land functions. The film is a disaster, though it is a good example of the style of the article. Winger is just a stand-out cast that looks really striking. * From 1/2
