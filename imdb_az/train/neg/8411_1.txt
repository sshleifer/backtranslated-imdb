When we go to see this bomb, we look forward to something big. This is Broadway, which is mostly filmed. The music is simply terrible. The movie does not have a memorable song - did any hits come from this movie? You are not, because there is nothing. Some of the music pieces have been going on for a long time so I got up to go to the toilet and took some pop compartment and it was still going back when I came back! It was a good song, but it sucked. Speed ​​is slow, terrible character development. He was worthy of praise because he read the lead, but it sounded like a scream of every song - it was impossible to stand. This film did not offer anyone Broadway enthusiasts who just want to die. No doubt, the most-featured movie I've ever seen in my life. Full time of money and money. Except for Danny Glover, there is nothing to remember about this movie - it does not appear on the screen quite well and has not improved its character. Rent and video the video - this movie was expensive, produced, polished dog.
