I do not understand people. Why is this movie 8.3? !!!!!! ???? This movie had great hopes, but once in half an hour I just wanted to leave the theater. In most of the surveys on this site, people say that they see it (or summer, year, etc.) as one of the best action movies they see, and that's a good result. WTF !!!!!!!!! ?????? Bourne, throwing bikes, throwing and fighting better than anyone else) What do you learn about Bourne's character in this movie? ????????? Absolutely f ****** Nothing !!!!!!! Okay, there are many moves, but how big is it about moving on this movie? I do not like cinematography and movie editing. The challenging camera effect and fast-changing shots were used very often, and they drove me to the old speed (which I was very popular because it was not used for a long time and had not been used anymore). <br /> <br /> This film has no area. This whole film is a 115-minute pursuit. Bourne, who does not learn anything in all 115 minutes of the film, is a perfectionist in everything we do. There is absolutely no development of characters in this movie, you will not know anything about anyone and there are a whole new series of new characters in this installment. Some people have said that this movie is incredible and stable. ??????????? !!!!!!!! What is writing ???? Which conscious ??? There is no tension. Bourne is a perfect thing to do, and I do not think he has something to worry about. If I were the best film of 2007, I would not be able to completely watch the movies !!!! <br /> <br /> Many people say that Matt Damon's performance in this film is the best of his career (not the best). Which performance? How many lines was there in this movie ??? I have little respect for Damon because he has been in films I love and different faces, but a good actor is someone who plays a different role than a movie but can understand from a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie was a big disappointment for me. It is not someone who plays the same role (Damon does not do this, but one example is Vin Diesel). I do not recommend this movie, but I recommend the first two (Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy) and I strongly recommend reading three books (movies are very different).
