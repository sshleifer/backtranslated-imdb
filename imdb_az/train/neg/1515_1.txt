I watched the film "The Flock" in connection with the fall of Gere and Denmark and was interested in the story synthesis. It was one of the worst films I've ever seen (and I saw some Indian stuff). I never wrote online, but this movie was forced to do so. I guess the problems begin with the script which is incredibly enthusiastic. The story is zero, and the dialogue is very complicated. Poor Gere, it's so good. Gere / When it comes to the game on the screen, Denmark does not believe in a minute character because of the terrible writing. I wish you could get back to GERE's negative, there was something impossible. Do not be ashamed to see your talent go too badly, I wish to get me back for 2 hours. (I know what you think, how do you feel?)
