Wow this is the worst movie ever. For the only reason I registered for IMDb, I could complain about this movie. I've never been to a theater or a DVD, but I almost stopped doing it (and I should). but I followed all the way up to the end to overcome with a completely terrible ending. Wow, if this is a bold thing, it can be extended. I have never seen it before and I have not watched it. It's a terrible job with a terrible job. Hey wait for someone to see a mirror. and the sad part is that when it comes to DVD, it's completely blocked. I feel bad for all those who see this evil.
