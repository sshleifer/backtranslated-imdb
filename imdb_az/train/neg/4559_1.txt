I'm surprised that those who are involved in this series are really responsible. The comedy writer must be written by a Canadian Comedy Writer's Union (and one thing!) That has failed the entrance exams. Quit the binoculars you want, but there is nothing in the eyes that does not look like a joke. Ronnie Corbett was demolished to humiliate himself with this trash. The rest of the tattoo has not been the type of activity or comedy that I admire in the first episode - corrections and elections have passed. For those who are interested in all this, we can say that they are very easy to enjoy. And it is clear that production costs should be at least â‚¤ 100 per episode. And if I am interpreting it as a foreigner who does not know English humor, I have to add that I am English.
