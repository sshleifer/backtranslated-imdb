So I asked myself why I was waiting for it? I can say that I am ill with bronchitis and I am too weak to change my channel. :) Words are not terrible for film, not bronchitis. Richard Grieco, who thinks the player is miserable, pushes him into a happy, gunshot-wound serial killer as he puts out the cops to extinguish the police. Nick Mancuso, who has a performance as police watching on the phone, and Nancy Allen tries to put a sympathetic role on the entire film. The scenario is heartbreaking, with blurred lines, "Are you ready, Pardner?" Richard Grieco presents each of his victims. Directional Avoid it.
