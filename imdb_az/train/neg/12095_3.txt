Elfriede Jelinek is still a Nobel Peace Prize laureate rather than a home. Her novel was awarded a Cannes second prize and awards for male and female potential. <br /> <br /> <strong> Gobelen, confusion> The English noise is a conscious link of a Turk. A monumental flop that is measured in a movie world with a box office checks or a critical setting. <br /> <br /> The shameful fear of this widely-broadcast film can not be a regrettable. As it is done to irritate the viewer, it starts very bad. Credits cut unusual scenes for more than 11 minutes. We meet Professor Erika Kohut, on the contrary, the alte egou of a victorious author, a stoned professor of piano. He lives with anger and domineering wax. <br /> <br /> Dad is an institutionalized destiny that has died invisible during the movement. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to look at the Piano Teacher, without mentioning his dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> What we have seen in the film is an actionable, exploitable story, a wonderful story for all I've read in the book. <br /> <br /> Erika, whose name is minimally used, is initially labeled as a person with intense musical sensitivity, but is completely suppressed. It is not very boring because there is a bag on the two-sided scene, because her bare groundbreaking apology has long been apologizing. <br /> <br /> Despite the events in the Caucasus, being a 'low-voltage' engineer, no matter what, and a few A talented pianist who plays ice hockey at times of fun. Elria meets an old concert at a luxury apartment, whether it is possible or not in Paris. <br /> <br /> Erika is a favorite of the heavy workmanship, shown in a short time, showing a timetable for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < She takes her to the ladies and she is dealing with soft sweets and incomplete oral sex. Erika keeps control of her lover. <br /> <br /> Along with this, Walter's jealousy for a nervous psychiatrist who was known before the next concert for jealousy, <br /> <br /> The next big scene (genital selfishness, etc.) indicates that the Erika fills the student's pocket with a broken glass and causes heavy lacerations to those sensitive pianos. Erika shares the apartment with her mother. <br /> <br /> <strong> Erika, humiliated, closed, slipped, and so on. It's going to be. Sensible Walter is desperate for the moment and goes to the night. <br /> <br /> At this point, there's still an hour to go. Viewers are just afraid of the worst. Erika watched Walter down the ski run wherever the ice hockey applies. They retire into the backyard. Lusty Wally can not resist tearing his hands on his pants. His "baby beard" is soon released with other gastric contents. Ho hum. <br /> <br /> It may be unfortunate to have revenge on the ground that has recently been thrown into the ground, but the curve goes back to Walter Erika's apartment. What can happen now? It's not too deep or difficult. Erika is a victim, yes, it's rude. She suddenly locked Maman's room and slapped Erika, the first to kick her face, interact with her, and update her love notices. <br /> <br /> Are you unfair in this summary? I want to watch the movie, but I will not advise. <br /> If everyone is in the right mood, he sees eternity in the grains of sand. I want to reveal myself in a difficult picture of the human relationships that this film has been transmitted. <br /> <br /> In some cases, Erika likes her love, in an unwanted way. <br /> <br /> <div> <div> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > <p style = "text-align: justify; /> In the end, if there is patience to be there, there is a slight twist. Before returning to the final stage, Erika regained her knife in her handbag after reaching the place where the shoulder-toe shoulder was replaced by her weak hands. For Walter? <br /> Yes, you were ahead of me. It creates and creates itself in a life-threatening area. Roll Loans. <br /> <br /> What is the worst of the rest of this post if it gets the second prize in Cannes?
