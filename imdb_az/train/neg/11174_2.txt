Al Pacino? Kim Basinger? Tea Leoni? Ryan O'Neal? Richard Schiff? My mouth was watering. I downloaded everything to watch this movie in Kabel. For 30 minutes, I had trouble staying awake. 60 minutes and I hit the record button and slept. I finished watching her next morning. The result did not bother. What is the loss of a great cast and thought that can be an interesting story of "Life's Day"? If you have this movie, treat it with insomnia. I provide you with at least an hour and a half short duration. Dialogue is terrible. No durability. The camera work was done with a hand held in Super 8 and could have looked better. <br /> <br /> This film was a disaster.
