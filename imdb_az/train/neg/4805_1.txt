I liked Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought it was good at the Top Model and I was really glad when I won it. I also liked Chris Knight, he looks like a great guy. But this show just made me HOT! I'm so angry for what's happening at this show. I do not believe they are different ages, I know that age, love can not stand between love. But Adrianne, you've only been in seven months. He did not surprise me because he did not offer it. And I do not see the case of someone forced to marry you without being ready. If so, why just concentrate on each other's company and love each other and naturally come? It was absolutely unnecessary to turn a wedding chain into a ball and chain, which is a hearty one that Chris loves with a ring or not. And Chris, shame and embarrass you to suggest him anyway! You've had two unfortunate marriages, how can one hurry up to another because she's somewhere? Hopefully, the relationship will continue, but the marriage is really frustrated and I feel all the wrong reasons. Maybe you can now breathe and find the right reasons to marry in the marriage.
