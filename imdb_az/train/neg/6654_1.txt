Normally, I do not think that Hollywood production is inappropriate for the movie, instead I call them "movies". <br /> <br /> This elephant ghoul part is not so suitable to call a movie. <br /> Where do I start? 1. If this is not the beginning of a geriatric cast, it is true. Stefanie Powers is forced to play at least one-half of her, she will play a 18-year-old, and she will TWO FORTY! <br /> <br /> 2. We see a unique picture of Paris and France, a terrifying and stupid, where the symbols of the clich√© are: the characters of the sympathetic treacherous shops, the heroes of the protagonist, the heroes of the models, the old heroes of the main models. This film only respected this Da Vinci Code (caretakers were a well-defined comedy). <br /> <br /> 3. It is a very funny, especially full-featured fact, since there is no nudity and nakedness in a movie at one time, such a common place. Terrifying accent! <br /> <br /> 5. Nana Mouskouri lift-music! <br /> <br /> I can continue, but that's enough. And after waiting for half an hour, I made these observations, talked to friends about surfing and math equations online ... I want to say ... <br /> <br /> I invite everyone to add to my list. :): P: D
