I just watched this movie in high definition on television. <br /> <br /> Please note that I rarely live on a wheelchair for neurosurgeon illness and have to watch several films about individuals with physical disabilities. <br /> <br /> First of all, I found my main character a little elegant and attractive. The message of the society with disabilities and disabilities is about the life and the life they are struggling to integrate into the labor market. And my problem is that it does not belong to a real person. He was a great man. <br /> <br /> This film differs from the diameter of completely hypocritical and propagandistic message, and I knew it was insulting. <br /> <br /> First of all, no one is thrown in a role as a real person with a physical disability. Of course, they were competent actors, but it was completely groundless to propagandize the incapacitated work and really have no disability in the film. On the same stage, a man in the middle of the film was reinforced to see a man walking on a chair overlooking one foot of a man. But CGI is so shame on this stage. Yes? No actual amputation found anywhere in the movie? CGI effects for a 5-second shot had a more prestigious sound, but the ACTUAL amputee was just doing it. At this point in the film, I was so fake and confronted with the message that I was completely convinced of, and talked about it as a miserable cripple. <br />
