I want to be a graduate of a film business, I have seen several films, some good and some bad, but Summer Rain is the worst movie I've ever seen! I chose the film to be a great English classic like 'Mysteries and Lies' or 'Lockstock', but oh so bad that I ended up laughing and ridiculous action with my palsies and the cheese scenario (a 'bad theater' in education) recalled). The main characters Michelle and Gary have begun to push us down. Michelle is one of the main characters living with two friends, one that never tired of slapping, and that Gary (drowned in tears every 5 minutes) has a kind of moisture that at the end of the film, neither of them cursed. All I thought was 'Â£ 3 for this stack'. I have never considered it, but after watching this film, it has attracted me to warn people of this catastrophic production. So, avoid any costs. Thank you for reading.
