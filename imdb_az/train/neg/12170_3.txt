Pamela Springsteen did not refuse to act as a full-time photographer; is a better idea in front of a camera in front of you. Although this film is not interesting elements (hell from hell, etc.), it is superior to defects. In short, Angela, a murderous consultant, appears to be at the same age as campers. An old, more dangerous camp director would be a great deal for the movie. And then there are scenes of crime. Too large part of the budget was poorly implemented (no purpose). But in general, there are more entertaining movies to spend about an hour and a half in your life of fear / excitement.
