Many agree that Wolverine's character is one of the most exciting characters in the history of the comic book. I'm not a Marvel expert, but I've grown up with the X-Men adventures and accept Hugh Jackman's widespread depiction of today's spectacular Logan. I was very pleased with the first X-Men, later found something very heavy and messy, and liked the third as funny book fun. Because of all the films, I'm probably glad to Jackman more than anything else. I thought the idea of ​​making "roots" - the film about Wolverine could have been a better movie than any of the best X-Men films. <br /> <br /> If you pay attention to the first character, I thought it would be a movie that failed to get the second movie failed - not a comic book adventure, which is quite complicated and characteristic. <br /> <br /> Wolverine- Film is not due to failure, because it is tougher than the Dark Knight. Even though this is not a good thing, though it is not for a clear and grounded plot - no, this movie does not seem to be a try. First of all, it is not considered as a good entertainment. There is a lot about this action, which is very often in the film. There are no more special effects or shouting elements, and an event, like the one you've guessed, is almost like a Uwe Boll movie, imitating an action / adventure concept that you've seen before. Of course, nothing in this film is not as terrifying as Bolls, but everybody's clichés, as if they were part of the chain of events that they were standard, provided at least the connection, and that's definitely bad. <br /> <br /> But there is a bigger problem. Even a common action movie is a common action movie, and in the meantime, it donates many field holes and character foolishness. I think you find the most important flaw in your head. That is, "Origins". Really? What do those behind this film think about it? What do they mean? Want to know Wolverine's roots? He grew up with his brother. They fled home in dramatic situations. Then they went to war. All of them! Civil War, World War I and II and Vietnam. Why did they do it? Not yet known. Finally, his brother (Sabertooth played by Lever Shrieber) was bad. "How?" you ask. I do not know, it was somewhere between Omaha Beach and Hanoi. "Yes, but why?" you still ask. I said I do not know! The film does not explain. That's bad! "Yeah, but ... you know," roots "" ... Well, a good source! I mean, duh! In the end, they ultimately end with the super-secret team of mutant elite soldiers. Something with the government, ho-hum. Wolvie gets enough and leaves her brother. For six years, Sevretan is a happy mosquito with her boyfriend. Whenever Sabretooth suddenly appears again, it is a little defenseless around you. "John ... but ... why?" - Oh, shut up! - and Wolvie decided to become a guinneapper for many bad scholars who made him a meat metal warrior. <br /> <br /> The first film of the "X-Men" was found. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This is the origin. You can also find behind the DVD coverage. The actual movie will not tell you anything else. There is no precious scene, no good hero, immorality and generally characteristic (line from my board: Fat suit! Token black boy) O girl, if this girl lives in this movie, I give cash .. Do not be a gambit ...? mmhm, yeah good ... uh-huh, right), a zero line to cover a memorable dialogue and a T-shirt is a line, plus you can generally forgive ...... well, it sounds like a lot of time loss , right? The parties will either check it or not. There is no stopping it. However, if you love the X-Men movies for some other reason, look good again and have fun, and do not blame yourself for looking for the origin because there is no place to be.
