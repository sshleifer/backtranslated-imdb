This is part of the electoral dialogue, chosen by a prominent scientist, a bad, lady's assistant, prior to admitting three incredible college-college girls to the puppet for experiencing behavioral change. At the same time, people at the local bar are drinking and dancing to perform rock music of the 80s. A biker punk tries to rape a virginal daughter, Jessica (Debra Hunter), who is in love with a cycle prostitute on a pinball table in front of a crowd, then another biker (DETEN Midkiff, PET SEMATARY). , in turn, cohort with his assistant! After returning home, take dark bimbos, swimming, shower and sex with men at the bar. A small silver ball (test piece) crashes into the mouths of the victims and turns them into zombies that kill and kill them! <br /> <br /> If this is not enough to entertain you have an exciting theme song ("Nightmare Fantasy"), roller skating, some serious daisies and a psychic hand puppet that warns "Of course danger!" <br /> <br /> Explosions in the US state of Florida are not so rich that it is recommended to moisten a large number of images. Hey, NYPD Blue's Detective Jill Kirkendall turned CNN news agent Andrea Thompson into one of the nude bimbos. Of course! Undoubtedly, it started in 1982 and in 1985 new footage was added to the video. <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10 (I want to say good sense!)
