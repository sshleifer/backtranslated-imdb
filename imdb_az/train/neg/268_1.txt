1 Not everyone interprets each other as universal translators and interpreters perfectly. Did the creators of the show know that people from different places spoke different languages ​​in different time frames (not a modern teacher of Attilla Hun Hunter cultures, not Pyramid's founders today's Vikings)? Can not develop a language similar to that of Latin, Ancient Greek, Danish and French, except for modern English (except for "use") today? <br /> <br /> 2 cultural differences can not be eliminated easily, but they need to be trusted, but everywhere the team arrives without any doubt and begins to set the environment as customers. Certainly, real fans will tell you that they have been accepted as gods. <br /> <br /> The people they meet are shocked by technology and gambling, and so on. Someone should accuse. <br /> <br /> 3 Historical background: no one. Visually impaired Greek or Viking culture can be reminiscent, but everyone can wear a dress for a table or can claim a local costume rental and a partial look for a plastic helmet with horns. A small city theater group is likely to have better requisites. <br /> <br /> 4 Boring! Another cannon canuck, which can not escape for nine decades. A child showed that he could do that, but anyone with little information about human behavior and language could not even watch the first twelve episodes of the season. I did not want to believe that he found a very good show, otherwise I would shut down my computer and clean my computer in the first few minutes!
