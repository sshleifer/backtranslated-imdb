Years ago, after watching a heavily censored version of this movie on television, it was interesting to see the menu version. I was surprised that she was more convincing and good than I remembered, but something really different. I think that other reviewers have also pointed to this, perhaps the nature and motivation of Chris Sarandon's character. Have you ever been harassed by other victims? Is he a totally psychotic or a "moderate" socios? How did she try to escape her attack on her sister? Is this character valid, or is it just more money required? She is almost simultaneously a persuasive, persuasive character that teaches us to be in touch with very young, sensitive girls that seem too naked to engage in a teaching job. It generally appears to be the biggest complaint of the audience. It does not have anything to do with his activity, which is terribly convincing. It is far from the situation that arises between the film's full use and serious interference in the subject, and both regimes are inappropriate. The worst movie, but not the best.
