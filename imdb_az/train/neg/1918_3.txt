The TV version of Twister produces a few leaks, but it is possible to wait. My sister took a Wal-Mart a few years ago when she released her, I thought it was back and okay. Then came the "Twister" with Bill Pullman and Helen Hunt (or was it already? '97) and made a better job. But the "Twister" was more entertaining; this is true with a message. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ "Wild America", "Final Destination" and "Slackers". So, I'm one of the first people to really pull it out. <br /> <br /> "Twisters night" all depends on my personal taste, as I said. A movie with all the twisters depends on what you want: Twisters, or low budget character research. The Twister Night is the last one. So you have decided. <br /> <br /> I give it 2.5 / 5 <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
