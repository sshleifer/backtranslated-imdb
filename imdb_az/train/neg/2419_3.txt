I just give these three because I was hoping what to do with my friends: Have fun. <br /> <br /> I'm not crazy enough to hire this idea, but I'm going to be a zombie movie with Romero or Fulcine's girlfriend, but what I hire is a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie for fun or shoot a movie to shake your head, go for it. This is perfect for young people - fans of "Mystery Science Theater", but only the disadvantage is that it is entertaining. <br /> <br /> I think it's a shame to associate it with the other Hollywood title we know it personally. Because if a film follows it, it has its own genre.
