Are there similarities between Ray Lawrence's "Jindabyne" and his latest film, "Lantana"? a dead body and its deficiencies for an already inadequate life. <br /> <br /> While "Lantana" offers some hope and resolution, "Jindabyne" does not solve everything that the followers do not enjoy, perhaps cheating. The storyline is based on a short story by Raymond Carver - a body that sits on a river in a remote river as a result of a fisherman's discovery. Robert Altman became an element in the 1993 classic "Short Cuts" ensemble. Lawrence uses this subject to uncover a research and relationship within a small Australian society under stress. There are some moral questions in the film: "Will you destroy a good weekend to the discovery of the dead body?" and more harshly for Australians "Does the dead realize that if a person makes a difference?" Particularly praised by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney. <br /> <br /> If all of these are sounded as the basis of a big movie, prepare for a low discount, the speed will accelerate. very slow, and the murder is shown near the start, thus removing the element of the mystery. So, we are staying with this brave life and an empty finish.
