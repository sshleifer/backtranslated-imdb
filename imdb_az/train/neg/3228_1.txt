I've seen another Guinea pig film, a helicopter like Mermaid & He Never Dies, and at least they have some sense of humor (but it's dark), even if they're pretty sick. The Devil's Experiment is nothing more than punking a series of films by giving way to many young torture and violence, and there is no structure and no indisputable value. It's not frightening, perhaps foolish, but it's disgusting, and I'm definitely fun. Now I'm not tasted good at movies and I love my trash and sleaz, but it really was a lot to me. I'm all right to worry about it, actually looking for things to worry about when it's possible, but it's not so. The young woman is thrown out, beaten, with a head-on sound, and then she is full of meat and gut and hangs in the jungle somewhere. You think it sounds great, go for it, but of course I've been more interested in seeing the Guinea Pig staff. From 1 to 10, absolutely heartbreaking.
