I watched this movie in Sneak Preview, and I'm glad I did not pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. Vertical and fart is full of jokes and does not feel proud of the activity segment (eg, shoot at "Small Germany"). <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Dave Foley is a penis. 2. Fart jokes. 3. Poop jokes. 4. My dude was a cat. 5. Gary Coleman does not exist. 6. Taliban 7. Yet they are enjoying Bush ... WE WILL USE IDEOT .. act. 8. Dude has blonde hair. 9. Land. 10. The killing of minors 11. There was Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Now good (little) good ones 1. Dude uses a cat as a silencer as in the game. 2. Many moves. 3. Crotchy (and mail maker) made a refund 4. Uhm .. I do not need to pay for it. 5. What are some "ef" moments? Boll did it again. He made another prank of movie adaptation. Kudos to you, Mr. Boll. 2/10
