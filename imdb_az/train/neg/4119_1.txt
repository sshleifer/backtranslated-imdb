I thank God for the film I did not go to the cinema. I'm sorry for the money I gave. I saw on TV and I do not believe in my eyes. I'm surprised that any movie might be worse than that. they spent millions of dollars on this movie. Horrible action and terrible scenario. I think that other people writing comments are a man working from a movie company;) a great fiasco! Do you still laugh at this kind of movie in 2000? embarrassing ...
