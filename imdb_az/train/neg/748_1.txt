I love movies and watch only one way to watch any movie. Finally, I can say that I have a movie that I can not follow. The player is pretty dark and monotonous, the CGI computer has worked with minimal software in the cellar's mother's basement and ..... only long sights ... picnic !!!! And this movie takes about three hours! I did not even get 15 minutes until the DVD came in fast. Scenes with foreigners are too short. Instead of giving it the name of the War of the Worlds, Ummah may call this a "Long Wave War". You need $ 5 million to do this! <br /> <br /> But in a positive note, it's a scene that must be watched, for the first time, aliens start killing people. <br /> <br /> So I was saying that if you are a boring party, old, immersive movies, here's a DVD collection for you. But I did not write it, I've written billions for billions of people who hate this movie. It is not worth your time or money. <br /> <br /> I know this book is, but the book is not long and I built a complete book / nerd / geek / no matter, but why? Get only the version of Steven Spielberg, it's not good, but this is 10 times better! <br /> <br /> I give it a FAT ZERO, which is larger than 10.
