Wow, this film's first glance was negative, it's no exception. I will try to put it down in some way. Get real! He wants to see a Chuck Norris movie that is not the main character. At the end there was a good battle scene, but the film felt the rest. The old Chuck should do better, regardless of the better way. So much so slowed that he should leave this track and carry it through his whole movie to his reputation? Chuck is a terrific martial artist and we saw a pretty good actor in Walker, Texas Ranger, but the game is both a combination of these qualities and it's not. Norris is a very unpleasant moment for those who love it. Chuck, stay the main character in your movies because it does not work for you ... Gary
