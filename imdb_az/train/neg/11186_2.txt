I wanted to watch this movie but suddenly the funny scene forced me to shut it down. The character does not react to something. Think about it: Heath Ledger goes on a night (I believe it's through the cemetery) when attacking. After passing through this difficulty, he went quietly and met a friend who saw them all. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus is a demon or something, I stopped taking care - ques ion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
