I remembered the title very well. It was Flora Robson's film with Olivier and Vivien Leigh supporting me. The voice of Massey was behind the biscuits. Good Flora Robson was very nice. His next signature would be "55 days in Beijing" for me. The same role, but with various prominent dresses. And the same voice. As for Armadillo, this was a sub-source. I love black-and-white movies. Was everything done every night during the Elizabethan? In some cases it was difficult to talk. Love could not say that he had interests. Was Spanish or Vivien Leigh? And I do not believe that Elizabeth would be a brilliant strategist to recommend sending firefighters to Armada. Apparently, it worked for the empire, but not for the scenario. It could have been more accurate, but Bette Davis was more attracted to the script. I missed the day!
