Do not care about anyone, but I do not know. This is a historic date for a reason. Unity of two heroes from two great seventies fantasy films. Well, one is big, and one is bad. It is a great truth, in fact it's the best. Something bad is really bad, in fact it's the worst. Of course, adults are called Star Wars and his star Mark Hamill, aka Luke Skywalker, who captures Vette, the protagonist of this film, and eventually ends up with a lot of adventure about a kid going to Vegas. (You can call it "Lube Skywalker" because stabilization of cars). On the way, he gets acquainted with a gold-plated prostitute and faces the character starring Kim Crystal, the protagonist of the science crystal film, "Laserblast" since the 1970s. , never made the most sophisticated fantasy movie. Milford plays badly, Hamillin needs to get his car back. I know that nobody cares about this two great fantastic hero, but I do. And I want to say that this is one of the best / worst films of all time. Mark Hamillin is in need of acting, the area needs a large Jedi training, and the nature of the prostitute performed by Annie Potts can never be the most boring character in any movie I've ever seen. However, it's a fun movie to go too late late in the late afternoon or afternoon. This is one of the few things that is looking for something, but also finding it, at the same time, as a jazz-free, simply-existent purpose. And it does. It's not that great, but it's not fun, because it can be demolished within an hour and a half, but you will not be deceived. So turn off your mind, relax and enjoy yourself in this dark ship, and power can always be with you.
