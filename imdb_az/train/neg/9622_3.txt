When I saw that this movie was shown on television, I was really interested in it. We grew up in the 1980s and saw there were more than 80 teenagers and summer camp films like everyone who grew up in that period. So, I did not expect to see this movie completely ruin the genre of movies. What a disappointment! The movie was really a bit of a bad joke and gags something, nothing and no item. And the filmmakers were completely unsuccessful with dark humor - some of the so-called jokes were not as terrible as cruel and offensive. Only good things about this movie were wardrobe, music and actor. It's nice to go with a nostalgic walk and see from 80's all summer dress styles, and it goes for the same music. The player was at the top level: Hollywood's best comedians were all ready. Too bad they did not have a better material to work with.
