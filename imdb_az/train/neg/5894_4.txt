How long will the Japanese / Asian horror films pass through the long haired dream woman woman leave? I admit that they have been able to erase the Ring for a million times and have often worked well - in the genre of originality (or very mysterious and easy to ask?). But this time I found myself somewhat worried, a little boring. It's not a bad movie, but absurd must be 110 minutes long, at least half an hour. Compared to many other Japanese fears movies, there is no OMC atmosphere and excitement. Moreover, the ending is mixed: it does not matter. As for the rhythm tone: Miike could have come up with a more effective melody than this unforgettable one. Though I played many times, I can not remember it - it was scary. When talking about Miike, this is a trade for her, so everybody thinks they can get "Bijita Q" or "Audition" violations.
