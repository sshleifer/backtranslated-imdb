I have never heard of this movie as part of a retrospective of Robert Mitchum in London. At least 60 years on the casting list, at least seven seemed to be trivial - the highest paid Mitchum-public domain; Charles McGraw, Long Killers, Barbara Bel Geddes, a long time before, and still better than Dallas, Norman, known as the daughter of Walter Brennan, Frank Faylen, who does not need any promotion, The Lost Weekend The Wonderful Life a beautiful small town mensch, with Tom Tully and Phyllis Thaxter, has been making Robert Preston numbers for a decade now, from Harold Hill, a musician. Unfortunately, many of them have wasted their time. Since Robert Wise was a bull-length, I looked for an 'signature' scene. He had been filming half a time and still had a style. This story is our old friend. It is no longer a war, and Mitchum thought that Hopalong, who thought he was cutting his teeth, was just a part of Cassidy oats. If Mitchum Preston had been lying with Thaxter, he would have planned to move his father's heritage if you did not count the incredible scene. This is perfectly right, but how did Mitchum know? We did not see or hear anything to show how he found it. Balance should be a lot to this.
