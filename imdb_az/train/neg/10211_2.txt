I can say nothing about this movie except for some nice cinematographers. One of the real issues is the dilemma to remain with or abandon his or her childhood friends in the world of difficulty in heroism. Rich "emotionally strong" scenes do not go into this area and they will not succeed in creating any atmosphere for bad behavior. The director only tries to present Anthony's dilemma and ultimately brings an easy solution. Although the heroes are difficult to speak of any characters, they do not develop ... maybe Sonny except. In addition, actors do not play much, and when they have some, they come as amateurs. I'm surprised that the film has destroyed more: a superficial scenario, throwing down all potential of the site, or doing bad, breaking any appeal that can be abandoned.
