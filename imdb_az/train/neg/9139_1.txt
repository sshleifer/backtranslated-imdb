The director of the film, Sam Mroovic, spoke extensively in this movie in any minor sense. Normally, I say this is an invisible film, but this movie can be the most important of all time. This film must be for the sole purpose of becoming 'the worst movie in the world'. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is not fun, but the only strange thing is Mroovich himself. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
