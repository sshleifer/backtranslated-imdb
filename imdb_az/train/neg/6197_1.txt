At the end of the film, I asked myself, "What is the worst movie I've ever seen or the worst movie I've ever seen?" And the answer ... In fact, after you've seen this movie and think about its meaning, you will not find just one meaning, and you will be able to remember two incredible and useless two aggression scenes. It seems to me that the director tried to put these questions on the head of the crowd: "What kind of crimes are compared to war and fear?" because of the two horrific scenarios that are directly related to the war and the horrors (where you hear from the president's statement about the necessity of the girl who was screaming here at the first stage and the president's war on the first stage), the sword on a woman's vagina on Iraq and on the second stage, II archive pictures are followed, but the truth is that these cheers are the expression of two different people's horrors, much worse than what I have seen and felt (sorry for bad English)
