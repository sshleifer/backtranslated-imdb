The weak Bobby "Pineapple Salsa" Flay and Mario Batali bring it down. <br /> <br /> Flay to be the worst. Without a doubt, a trick pony, I think other chefs can come to this table and pick up like Iron Chefs. This type of dining is actually coming out ... do not think about the original Iron Chef series creativity. I do not think battal is even going to the chef school. <br /> <br /> There are many great chefs in the United States. I'm surprised that it will not only appear on the Food Network. <br /> <br /> This is more regional content and maybe pressure. I like Alton Braun, but this role is a bit flippant / funny.
