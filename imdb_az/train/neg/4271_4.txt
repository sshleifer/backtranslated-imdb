Typical voltage has been repeated several times before. Simple scheme; The police are dissatisfied with Russell's wife, Liotta, and she may be trying to get her. This is not something predictable, but it does not even try to guess, the plot is plot, and there is no thought outside the box. The only reason to follow is to see how this develops, but nothing is really or is not interesting. There is nothing really called this movie, it's not particularly bad, but there's no good point. Russell Russell plays and you know what to do when you see him in a movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has an irresistible Cher-esque voice. I read life style and could see the movie I was in, so clear and basic. I watched it and as I imagined it was in front of me. I did not feel a sense of life. There is no sense in this film, and I have never watched it. Given this, is not it a pretty senseless movie? Nevertheless, for some reason I'll give 3/10.
