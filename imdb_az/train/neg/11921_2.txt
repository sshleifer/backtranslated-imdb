You can use this movie in 20 words or fewer. A storyline with a very ridiculous ability is very advanced, but instead goes straight to the face. But when I looked at 19 words, this flick did not go with just one star, but Julie Bowen decided to squeeze it into two stars because it provided enough eye glass for him to smoke and prevent me from burning out the DVD from the car and pushed it to the M80. My advice is to get $ 4,000 worth of rent to see this movie and send it to me or send me as a thank you for saving the time and disappointment of this train crash. I was charged $ 50.00 for refusing to take twelve quarters, and used this trash as a skeet-taking practice.
