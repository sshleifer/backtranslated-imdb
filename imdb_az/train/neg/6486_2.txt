If anything, you can count on Disney, their unusual ability to make a story and talk over and over again. Even the commercials for Lady and Tramp II were terrifying. Disney will destroy one of the most modern classics. It was even a spaghetti puppet scene. It has been done before! And I'm telling this to the apologizing video (the whole concept is forbidden). Everything is just a rehab of the original film and is one of Bluth's really bad movies. Penguin and shirt (even forgot their names) have a really poor help from Timon and Pumba. Morgana is another Ursula. He repeats almost all the old lines. Songs are very miserable, really terrible. Since that day, I have not heard anything. And dialogue is embarrassing. It's sad and straightforward. Moreover, at least they took the time to make the animation a bit worthwhile. Not all ordinary characters are annoying (or maybe a minus for the Little Mermaid fans) as it had been before. Negative, Melody is just unhappy, it can only be vomiting. I can say that. Do not blame yourself and your Little Mermaid fan. Do not lose your money. True, Jaffar or Pocahontas II is not as terrifying as return, but this is not a little comfort.
