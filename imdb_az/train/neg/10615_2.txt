It may seem like a lifetime while sitting in such a flat, weak driver for less than 2 hours. If a story were as individual as it was for the so-called Sally Potter, did not you have a little passion to show it in its performance? His movement was completely separated and I felt among the tango scenes that should be hot, given the nature of dance between Sally and Pablo. Without a doubt, it would be difficult to make a story like this in the film, and Sally Potter would be wise to take on a better player to make a better player not to fall into his stupidity.
