The Craze of Dragstrip Hollow is typical 1950s in the karga movie. This is not a science fiction or science fiction. Plot refers to a group of young people who want to escape from the "hot stick" club because they can not afford to rent. Once upon a time, they decided to try the old Haunted House. The only saving grace of the film is that it is a "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell, O Creative) suit, by Blaisdell.
