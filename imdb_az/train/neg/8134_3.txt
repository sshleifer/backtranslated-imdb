A man wakes up from a nightmare about bats. She and her husband go out to the wilderness to ride their children. It looks like he has heard a strange noise and is concerned with the eyes of a wound that slips along the walking cover. She wants to go on a cave tour, but she wants the taste of the honey. Refuses. They go out on the tour, but let them drop out. He falls below a slope, where he is disturbed by insects. He is following him. He still hears strange sounds and knows that the bat is approaching. Someone goes and goes to his hair. <br /> <br /> Military operations against the people living in the Caucasus continue. <B style = "text-align: justify; bats or images attacking people, it's frustrating when it happens, and she is unable to drink alcohol without saliva." <br /> <br /> The wife is worried about rabies, <br /> <br /> Some people are killed and we see a part of human being transforming into a bat, as it seems to be a human being. <br /> <br /> It is not his opinion, Although it seems appropriate, it's the same thing as the other man: It's not a good movie, I liked the different places of the desert, cave and ski-slope, and some fuss. In 1999, I did not think Bats was as bad as others thought (I think this is a 5/10).
