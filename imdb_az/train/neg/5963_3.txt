This film begins with the magic and the apple of his mistress. His head is cut and separated from his body ... It sounds like a "dead thing"? Yes, it plays a bit like this but when the body is united, all the interesting and terrible deaths are made, and the film is moving too slowly. That is, the film was just about 88 minutes and I would say, when will it end? Heroes in the film have many parts and are desperate to die for their silly foolishness. He is very bad, as in slow motion and is surprised to see how he is guiding himself to doing everything because he is afraid of jewelry. The only thing to keep watching is that, in spite of many things, he really started to lose track. I would still like to see a horror film, slowly like to move through a very slow lane, such as a soft core flick and a horror film. And as the back of the box reads it as a dish of zombies attacking the city ... There are only three or four zombies attacking a house and so small that they are so easily moved there is no factor in the movie and scenes are quite meaningless. So, on the contrary, if you do not really come across the cheapest price, I'm telling you to avoid this movie.
