As everyone is saying, the player is terrific, no story or no matter poor management. About SFX, 360 degrees, matrix style layout, 1 shooting is fairly stupid, but for each character. So take a break. And all that has to do with these video game scenes, just to remind us of "video game adaptation"? Jesus, who threw those who think about this thought? <br /> <br /> What's On?
