This is a movie. . . I dont know. Why Pippi Longstocking is such a great character and Tami Erin, who looks alike, will never know. Why would I spend money on art and some non-all-out-of-the-bad effects, then I will never be able to worry about correcting correctly. Why the set and costume are sometimes in the period, sometimes not strange, why they have released their bad songs, why the script does not give any meaning (even a fool, a child is not at the film level). . . . what did they think? It's not like there's nothing on this movie. Each part is duplicated (and always weak) with every sound effect is a little wrong, every adjustment is in the wrong place, and each action is somewhat bad. In spite of all the problems, Astrid Lindgren creates an atmosphere that does not hold the magic of his creations.
