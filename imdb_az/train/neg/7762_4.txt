Perhaps I thought of John Doe, the creator of Kyle XY, and I expected his pilot to be very interesting. But I probably had very high expectations. Initially, the hero was turned into a stranger with a naked idea to show his outstanding knowledge to a public audience. After such a scene, I am only entertaining. However, the problem has deteriorated because none of the other features has been properly applied. They spoke very much about John Doe that less interested the story. I'm a little disappointed with Dominic Purcell's performance, because I did not believe John Doe did not believe it. Another problem was the story of the police. It really did feel like déjà vu and it was not a pleasant sensation. It leads us to the worst problem in the group, episodic format. <br /> <br /> Generally, I'm very glad and do not recommend anyone. Considering why the show was canceled, it is now as bad as it is. Sometimes I missed the hero to develop heroes to help her find her identity. It was sad, because there was potential, like a man he met at the club. The quality of the production was also good and the cast was accurate. But if it were better, I know, maybe not, because I'm not planning to watch the next episode.
