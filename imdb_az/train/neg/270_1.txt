Now I'm watching pink (Serbian television station) and this is what I can say. <br /> <br /> This was a stupid attempt to earn more money for the success of the movie. OK. The film was great when it came out in 1994. But serials? <br /> <br /> How do you see the silence of the characters in the character at times? I would like to say that someone was actually paying someone to write, someone in the studio was relative? This is not SciFi. <br /> <br /> The movie was a bomb, sucked the series.
