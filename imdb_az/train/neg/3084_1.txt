this is the result. Even a piece of garbage film that does not deserve to be classed as a film, there is only one thing in filming, which can not mean anything. It looks like a bunch of friends who are thinking of trying to film a movie that will make a little money after leaving and a big fear movie. Here, it is a great horror, it can be a movie. The Hobgoblins have very terrible moves, but the worst is simply Richard, who is a very weak path to the sorta root. Yes, when you shoot a bunch of friends and try to scare the movie, the less the budget, the less it will be. Well, at least the MST3K version was cheerful. But it's still a strange movie. 9 for MST version.
