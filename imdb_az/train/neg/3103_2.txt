So there is an old security guard and a dead man, and then Kevin, the world's greatest man. Kevin is incredibly indifferent, respected, virginal girl wants to surprise AMY. When he comes back from work ... a casual home ... finds his "comrades", sexually striking red, shortened KYLE and really rebel prince DAPHNE. They are soon joined by Daphne's lover, triggered by a happy sex-crazed Mexican lunkhead NICK. And there are major creatures, little heroine puppets who kill people by giving them the will of the people. Kyle's desire is to associate with a creepy, yucky woman in Spandex. The desire of Nickin's heart is to throw a bomb at a class school cafeteria - I mean night club. The desire of Kevin's heart is to knock down a pretty guy with nunchucks. Amy's heart is a disgusting prostitution. Daphne is no longer a disgusting prostitute, so his heart desires. On the way, a really ugly band sings a really strange song. Hobgoblins return to their destination at random, then explode. "Vatan Kane" can not afford the true kingdoms of American cinema.
