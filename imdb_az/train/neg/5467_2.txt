What can you say about this movie? Yes, it's a group of good people with some ill-nourished medicines, and turns out to be criminal traffickers selling more people than bad guys. There are two of those who have become poisonous avenger type and have a negative impact on the fact that her daughter threw some living things in the school basement. That's all about 84 minutes. This movie is pretty bad and needs to be locked forever. While this is unfair, some people love Troms movies and can watch them if they want to. Although the Troms films are for me, there's the worst movie there. I only watched the interests of this disease.
