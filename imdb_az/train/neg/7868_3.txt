I've seen most of Guy Maddin's films, and I liked most of them, but it gave me a headache. John Gurdebeke's editing is very magical, and there is nothing else that hinders the ability of actors to communicate with the audience, except for the tour-force that shows a stunning management team to look at one object. <br /> <br /> Another thing I did not like about this movie was that it was more brutal than Maddin's previous works. Although the films were always dark, the sincerity of the characters gave them a sense of respect for humanity. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < > <br /> <strong> To improve facial expressions.
