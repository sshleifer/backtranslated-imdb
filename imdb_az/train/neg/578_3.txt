This is not a good movie. The player is extremely tough and unsatisfactory. The film does not know if it is a real fright concept or whether to go with camp and kitsch route. I have never seen the first movie, but it does not depend on its essence, there are a few untrustworthy arguments, and the audience is never informed about the importance of the leading female vampire. Tracking is not worth the effort
