My wife is a great fan of Robin Williams. I love him, but in general he should focus on "playing the best of his deeds" and acting on comedy. My ideas have been confirmed by this movie. I totally missed the entire movie. The story could have been predicted. I was inspired by a true story. But I guess that, while maintaining the truth of the story, some may not even interfere with each other or contradict each other. None of the characters were developing well. There was an event about the main character and his partner. These relations could have been further explored. More important, though, would be a deeper investigation of the "boy" mother. She would be interested to access her psychological profile. Obviously, there is a long, untouched date, except the superficial way. If my husband was not such a big Williams fan, we left it for 20 minutes. Too bad, I can not get my $ 20 or 2 hours back.
