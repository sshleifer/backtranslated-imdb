Sorry, but I did not like this document very much. I can think of a million ways that could be better. Certainly, people who do this have no idea. Interviews are not very interesting and no real ideas are given. Images are not very knowledgeable. It's too bad, because it's really a spellbinding movie that's special. One thing I can say is that Isabella Rosselini is much better than the older one. Given all this, it's only '4'.
