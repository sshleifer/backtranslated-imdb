I just finished watching this movie. I'm so excited to be Punk Rock, Horror films and Spoofs great admirer. I was very surprised to see. I knew the budget was low, but I did not expect it to be taped with a video camera. A good song and a great, very weak group, The Horrorpops, sings their songs, where they go, and immediately kills them in various horrible ways. This is a great opening. However, until the end of the problem is the truth that this movie really is. Live performance, death. Another live performance, a death. It's old. Death scenes have a lot of intestines. Why does not the killer use other body parts like legs, eyes or brains? Do not get me wrong, this movie has some awesome parts. Just like the hardcore French band known as BERET, the band called Atticus is a scene performed by members of The Used and Simple Plan because there are not enough bandwidth members to play, and Bowling For Corba's overweight and proud guitar is truly fun I'll survive for future audiences who were killed in some way. But the big problem I face with this film is primarily funny, but after a while the majority of "actors" have no actual talent. Particularly the creator of Warped Tour Kevin Lyman. He runs very hard, but I doubt he would not want to make that movie, but he had a contract or something. In addition, the sound quality is terrible and there is no subtitles on the DVD. The plot of the film is very flawless and very casual. something about Lloyd Kaufman as a magic sword and devil. In the bottom line, this movie has good qualities, but it's not enough to be near Horror, Music or Comedy. Although I have never heard of it, I have to give a loan by turning me on several tapes. Like Tsunami Bombs and Phenomonauts (a crazy, Psychobilly band). I recommend you rent this movie, watch the first 10 or 20 minutes, or watch the next 20 or 30 days. If not, just switch to special features and watch all your music videos and live shows. They rock! Long live Punk Rock and Horror!
