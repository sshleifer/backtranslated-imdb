If you truly love the movie "Resident Evil" in 2002, you should see more than 2 hours of retreat. I do not believe in anyone commenting that this movie is just a cheap period of RE. First, the "special" commando force is the unique protection of an object with a computer matrix having AI and holographic projection. And there's a number of traps to kill a member of the squad inevitably at this "rip-off" of the "Kovan". There are chess names in the code names that are spoken with RE. Though it's not a zombie, Rook is a kind of biodiversity, with many hinges offering necrotic tissue, with many kiborg components like a super mutant like RE. <br /> <br /> He is a wife. <br /> <br /> He is a wife. <br /> <br /> He is a wife. .
