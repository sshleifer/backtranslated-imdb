First, I want to say that only the user comments left me with tears without laughing in my eyes. A statement that bad SF films turn into good comedies is a straightforward sign. <br /> <br /> When you look at the ANGRY RED PLANET from fiction imagination of 10-year-old comic book readers starting in 1959, you'll have this fender. All the elements are: pseudoscience, sometimes illogical, often hilariously infantile. The attitude of the young boy to the sex, the captain of the gigolo (a good call, children!) Is a miracle that makes the bug "a scientist" look red hair, correcting the fire alarms. The ridiculous concept of Mars, such as a far-away planet, shows that everything is looking at the red, yet a wild monster has a mouse face, and a blob has a look that turns as a foreign child's toy. A gigantic astronaut (!), Who has not finished 8th in Brooklyn and has a psychic imagination in his stunning weapon, is a funny relief. And, of course, the truth is that it is badly dangerous. These guys are E.T. If they had met with him, they'd fix it in two seconds! <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong. I appreciated this movie. It's still not elegant (as the scientist is trying to explain everything - just to make all the voices more laughable) and you have to admit that your little kid is in the nap, jumping several times. <br /> <br /> Okay, then do not confess. I was never 10 years old.
