The author has no idea about Phillipa Pearce or any of his novels, and if TOM'S DAY GARDEN is his work, I would probably have little interest in his books as a child. <br /> <br /> According to this film version of TOM MINNAYA SPRING, Pearce writes: "When I'm a kid, I'm really not interested in literary, middle-class children, a story around heroes Tom Long a story that has suddenly turned into a metaphysical discovery.There is no doubt that you have the garden of your own, and there is no subordinate class in the 1950s, so there is a subtext raided in a number of political classs.The romanticism of a young girl called Hattie but still have sex with children with stories of love? Perhaps the worst criticism is in the narrative of excitement or adventure <br /> <br /> This is a child-bearing film based on its source. but I'm surprised by the high ratings of the IMDB voters, and if they are 10 years old, seeing three of the figures, r it would have a high price?
