Alejandro Amenabar's rebuilding Abre Los Ojos, but this time as a founder, with a live, breathable mask. For a suspicious advantage of the English sound track, we have a zero depth of Tom Cruise's silent performance. Yes, the character is determined by his personality, but we generally have some features to keep our interests. His empty postruhu denies any erotic energy that may be between Cruz or Diaz with his character. <br /> <br /> This means that there is a moving movement that involves the use of masks to free the actor to enrich the presentation of the character by word and body. The cruise mask emphasizes its inadequacy as a painful player. Open the Eyes of the original Amenabar in 1997!
