I wanted to hit the TV. Tracking was torture. I hated it. Never watch this movie. Terrorists worry. Adam Sandler is heartbreaking. I usually love it, but that's not it. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the world's busiest movie. The comedy that is jealous is surprising. Only a funny part is a rock that draws all the girls in black teeth. I wanted to flip the television. THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT EXCEED YOUR PERSONALITY. If you love Adam Sandler a little, do not buy it. Only he will hate him. If you see it in the store, hide it to deprive it of the risk of buying it. I paid $ 1.99 for a loss.
