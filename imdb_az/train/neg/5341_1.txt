When it was loaded with great actors, I was more likely to surrender than Deceiver. The area is extremely elegant and manipulative. Add many confusion to flashbacks only. Beliefs extend from the window and end with endless and terrible ridicule. Because you're so excited, I would strongly recommend anyone who wants to rebuild movie scenes at least from the "Deception". Maybe I'm not quite as flat-footed as to get it, but most of my suspicion is the storyline with others and, in particular, the confusion. The line between true and false lies, it just does not work, because the whole film does not make any sense. - MERK
