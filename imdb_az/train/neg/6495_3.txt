<br /> <br /> If Jackson's Pollack combined with David Lynch and Timothy Leary to shoot a movie, that would be the end. <br /> <br /> I do not think I've seen a movie similar to an LSD trip as an episode of the sound street. <br /> <br /> This or other reality and the movie do not reach anything in the last 5 minutes, but it is suddenly meaningful. In fact, my film review, which removes everything, has scanned my blog and I will not do it here. This is a good moving movie piece and the soundtrack is written by Sir Anthony Hopkins and if it has a redeeming feature, this is music. Perfect fit. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed some parts of this movie, really, and when you finish it, you really understand what's happening. <br /> <br /> It's a failure to come up to a precise point through a 2 hour crazy minimizing the effect of this movie. <br /> <br /> I give you 10 to 3 of a simple fact. The real problem with this movie is not problematic, everything.
