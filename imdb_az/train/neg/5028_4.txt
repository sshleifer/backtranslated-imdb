Now with the rise of the symbolic Godzilla series, like any hit movie event, it has become a group of imitators who are inevitably trying to succeed in the great lizard. Godzilla came with a daunting popularity of kaiju (giant monster) genre. Looking after many successes; won a few. Not only did it win, but also a few of the few popularity Gamera. It was a huge turtle that could breathe fire and poured flames from the forks of the boat as a jet flipping tool. Unlike Godzilla, Gamera was sold to all children as a friend, and later fought with other monsters to endanger children, and Gamera became very popular among children. Unfortunately, the only audience to have any appeal for the original Gamera series. <br /> <br /> The new Gamera movies directed by Shusuke Kaneko are beautiful, revolutionary monster films, original series, original series, nothing special. <br /> <br /> In Japan, the first Gamera movie "The Giant Monster Gamera" was a clear Godzilla. The film was made in black and white, although it was produced during the color film. Why? From the 1950s to imitate the first Godzilla movie. Gamera is attacking Tokyo. Because Godzilla attacked Tokyo in the first film. I do not know much about the Japanese version, know the American version, cut scenes, and make new footage with American actors (can it be the same with the first Godzilla movie?) Now, I can not say whether the movie is being added or taken. <br /> <br /> "Gammera is invincible", really putting it like a big turtle itself is not really something else. <br /> <br /> "Gammera is invincible" is a very strange movie. Symbols consist of science-fiction standards, the story is convincing, the monster has no real reason to attack civilization, it's a funny thing, and so on. The only film that differentiates Godzilla from the film is the end of the film, but it's a detective because it's completely fake and funny from the gamer's sting. The rest of the film and many other entries in this genre also fit this description, but this is a terrifying monster movie. <br /> <br /> Although Shusuke Kaneko later turned an interesting monster with the Gameran trilogy, in the 1990s, Gamera was not an attractive display in the original series. He was neither scary nor sympathetic. Swinging in every step, like a small jump, slides around and plays miniature bands. <br /> <br /> Everyone who thinks Gamera is a beautiful turtle wants to destroy Gamer but Yoshio Uchida, a small child (who goes beyond his credit when playing a "central" role). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Even in many other Godzilla-imitator companies such a Gamera movie is not a good introduction. And if my cinema is going to experiment, the rest of the series movies are either dull or bad. Like Godzilla, Gamera will shoot colorful films and fight monsters. <br /> <br /> Like Godzilla, it was cheaper and cheaper than every movie until it was time to revive and bring it back to life seriously. <br /> <br /> This is unique. Normally, I advise people to stay up-to-date with the original ones. But in Gamera's case, my judgment is just the opposite. I strongly encourage watching the Gamera trilogy in the 1990s led by Shushuke Kaneko and to pass through the original series if people are not interested. New films are inventive, well-prepared, exciting, and, most importantly, entertaining. The original series is a long, boring stream.
