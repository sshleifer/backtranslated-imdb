This "FBI" Reed Hadley is a star-star, all-star guest player! The film begins with casual casualties, leads to something and does not show the main story, another one, "Big House, USA." prison break story The story is very easy to say at least. <br /> <br /> Behold, this is a trip! Ralph Meeker sent to prison; Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (reads "Muscle" magazine!) And William Talman ("Detective" magazine reads!). Honest! It should be borne in mind that an early scene shows what happens with the "missing" child and responds to the latter's "rabbit". Do not miss the opening scenes between the "Iceman" and the child (Peter Votrian is as good as a fugitive asthmatic) if you do not want to hang it. <br /> <br /> Great House, USA (1955) Howard W. Koch, Broderick Crawford, Ralph Meeker, Reed Hadley
