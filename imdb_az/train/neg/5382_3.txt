Indeed, the product of young minds, while putting it on every neurosis, can still appeal to nearly 20 people who are trying to find their place in the world. But I can not imagine that we can not imagine that more than 30 narcissistic tortoise, odd humor, or similar theme will be especially attracted to everyone. Another problem is that film artists are vulnerable to absurd cartoons for a funny effect, even though they clearly do not despise anything, and in reality they are not relatively realistic. <br /> <br /> Moreover, it is necessary to use the trick to discover every aspect of the book in order to give some style points to obviously growing filmmakers in the video generation and to build another non-existent plot. There are 2 points to remember here. First, avoid festival festivities. Secondly, though we live in YouTube history, everyone's account of their worldly life deserves a great deal of treatment. But these young filmmakers have the right to make their own films if it finds something to be found in one of the 20's, better. But at the end of this film, I thought that this new generation, from now on, is experiencing so many difficulties and difficulties, how it will be in the real world. Each child is always confident that his or her personality is unique, and their 15-minute exposure, loyalty, and difficulty encountered are not the same as the strength of this generation.
