I was telling you that he was looking forward to finding something that you did not know about the humble people of modern history and that he did not think that history was re-written in HITS: RISE in recent years. Hitler was very surprised by his nephew, threatening one of his admirable shoots. Hitler found a weapon in his hand to catch Ernst Rohm. Forgive me to ask, but did writers mix Adolph Hitler with SCARFACE with Tony Montana? This is bad enough, but the thing that really hurt me was that all parts of the historical context, missing in this mini series. Germany lost its first world war and the allied forces paid a heavy price to Germany. It was the economic environment for one of the German people - to anyone - to restore their pride and, therefore, turned into Nazism. The provocation created by the Alliance forces in the 1920s was completely lost, so HITLER: LIFE EXAMPLE can be regarded as a historic document and I have not said that Himmler and Goering are sensitive because of their absence. There is a positive point in the role of Serisi and Robert Carlyle. Okay, some of his behavior is wrong and his voices are very low (archive notes show Hitler a soft charming voice), Carlyle is a charismatic actor and connects Hitler's charisma on the screen. In the English press, Carlyle Adolf looks more like Hitler's Sparks than a synth player, and he gives one of Hitler's better comments. <br /> <br /> I love Robert Carlyle's performance, but I hate everything that's about this mini-series and wondered why it's the first thing in the world. There is nothing to advise seriously on history fans
