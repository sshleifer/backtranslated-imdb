For those who want to see this movie? I would say: go! Without a story, it can be a very good movie / documentary. But some of the tracks, stories, and storylines are very difficult to follow a skeptical person like me. In many seasons after a few animals, their life feels an animal soap that we follow. But from a melodramatic point of view, it is not just for me, and even if a predator is finally a predator (if an exception is left in the left), then the camera is jammed or jumped to another area. I ask myself, why it happens, if they show the truth, why is a melodramatic fairy tale to cut scenes? I think it is important for the mass of the masses, which ultimately would be a waste for the destruction of this beautiful planet.
