Within 15 minutes, my entire family was killed for the character Goldie Hawn, or at least to leave Steve Mart√≠n's character. In 40 minutes, we closed it. <br /> <br /> There are a few films that we have been trying to overcome for a year so that we can not even get enough time to build a story. <br /> <br /> Usually Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, and I remember the taste of Neil Simon's original. I blame Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Join the author, "The Worst of the Worst Bosses" and "Miss Congeniality 2", and I understand why.
