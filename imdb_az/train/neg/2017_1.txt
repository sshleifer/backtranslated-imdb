The area is acceptable, but it is similar, that is, a beautiful and ignorant wife of a rich and powerful man walks with a psychotic hunter, and then tries to cover him like psychological pins and blackmails. However, things that develop there are very complicated. Despite the resources available to ordinary couples who have money and influence, our privileged hero and hero, only one local, their lawyer and local police (they will not be able to do) say that they are fighting terrorism and escaping terrorism. There are no personal security personnel (only a foolish security system), a home or a basic staff, drivers, and so on. The injuries that can endanger the lives of both men and spouse are single and sensitive in their home. Our hero is described as a doorknob and a brain, like a hero, a magnet, and acts in the most complex and rational way. Production veteran actor Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what they are thinking?) Are frustrated by their talent, which is an insult to their audience. And this is shameful on Living TV to insult the viewers for the insipid proposal.
