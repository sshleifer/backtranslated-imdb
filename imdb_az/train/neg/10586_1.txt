This is a well-known film on PBS Frontline. The point is that Frontline has already done this and has told L. Paul Bremer to approach the story. More worryingly, the director Charles Ferguson won the past thinking, and the occupation sought to become a warrior to the south. What would he have thought? <br /> <br /> Polish occupation was really good, until it was awfully horrified by these nervous Nazis. This film also shows itself - not to apologize for the occupation, to get out of the war itself. <br /> <br /> Ferguson thinks the war will be better.
