In short, this movie was boring. There was no life and spark. There are two major problems. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry. He was boring and heartfelt. The visuals were interesting, but they did not make the scenes. If anything, visuals tend to separate viewers from the screen. None of the action segments did not feel real, and the film failed to create any real drama or threat. <br /> <br /> The film had a potential but better script, better action, and better director. I was thinking about the movie, you know Harrison Ford Sky Captain, Karen Allen Polly, and Steven Spielberg - director. <br /> <br /> Do not see critical acclaim for this movie. I think that critics praise the film because they want it * and want it to succeed, even if they fail at many different levels.
