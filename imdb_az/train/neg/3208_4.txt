This movie was a big disappointment for me. I waited for this movie to come out for years and was a loyal follower of chaos images until they broke. Only they cut half of the story line, but they changed the information. The statement that Lucifer is the father of Umid is wrong. He broke his father, but he was not his father. The sounds did not fit the characters, and when you hear the sound of a favorite character, the sound you hear in your mind will never be returned. I can not remember everything about this movie. Lady Death If you like to watch this movie. Only funny justice ever did!
