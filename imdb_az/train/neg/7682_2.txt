The COBWEB, played in 1955, is a star-studded LILLIAN GISH star striker who ran the studio genre SUSAN STRASBERG. You will be set up in a special psychiatric hospital, what is the high drama that this movie is of interest to you? Physician and patient relationships? Shock Therapy Treatment? No, this will be exactly what to choose for draperies for a psychiatric hospital! Do you think I'm joking? You will not believe your eyes when watching this incredible story turned into a movie! Progressive head shrink Dr. McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants to have patients in all hospitals, design, selection and execution of the new draperies needed. McIver's wife wants to get her 2 cents in this monumental task, played by marble compound GLORIA GRAHAM. For a long time she deals with Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Directed by VINCENT MINELLI, it's really wondering if this is really the case of JUDY GARLAND, because her marriage was delivering accurate details. In this hockey story, talented actors such as LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER and JOHN KERR are spent. What did they think?
