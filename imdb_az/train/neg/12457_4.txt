The salvators can not decide what to do with this movie: some are a very weak tension (and I say very weak), and some try to explore the relationship between the main characters. Both things have been tested in psychological excitement, but in this case, the film can not save everything as a result of poor, superficial, bad behavior and very dark, very entertaining cinematography. I would say that the Salvors were the best in other genres and elsewhere. Without thinking about the characters here, he was free to investigate the characters. Generally, the B-movie does not value your money. Vote: 4/10
