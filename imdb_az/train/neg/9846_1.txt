You may be tempted to rent this movie because Peter Sellers appears here. That would be a mistake. This is one of the most senseless films ever made. I was expecting something funny, but it does not look funny in this movie. Even the film industry recognized it as a very weak film, and did not try to encourage it. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> I also think that people who are responsible for this film are allowed to shoot other bad movies I am interested. Undoubtedly, this movie is the loss of money used to create it, and everyone who is watching it is a waste of time. No doubt, there are high school students who can write / produce a movie as a plot.
