If you like Classics like TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER and BEN JONES YOU AGREE TO THESE SUBJECTS! THIS SUBJECT WILL BE SOON YOUR OWN! First of all, this movie begins with Moon and Moon for Jesse with Bo and Luke. Bo and Luke did not do this in the original series! This movie describes the characters that will not happen in the array. In the series, Jesse's uncle was honest and subject to law. In this film, the governor of Georgia is a moonshine and a cigarette-smoker. Of course, this was an extra advice for the Hazzard Reunion Dukes! and the Dukes of Holzlar in Hellfire, I have a question: Will the film in Hollywood be discussed before the HAZARARD PRODUCTS? BOSS HOGG WAS AWESOME when THE REUNION FILM IS BEFORE 1997! FILM & ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? WHEN OUR FEATURES COME OUT OF 11 AND EARNINGS? If Hollywood wants to make a really good movie, they should not bring James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones, and Catherine Bach as they did in 1997 and 2000, and still do what they have with the original characters disgusting, disgusting movie! If you want to see good Dukes movies, either get the original series and go to walmart.com and include the 2nd DVDs at the Reunion and Hollywood Movies Dukes of Hazzard! They both star the original player and are family friendly! Do not waste time on a movie that's not worth the CD!
