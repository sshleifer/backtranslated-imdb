I do not believe in the ability to spend $ 17 million on this movie. Impressive bad acting, hard scripting and effects on the average PC, incredible scenarios ... a novelist who can get a great job at the UN in novice hospitality. Yes? Not only that, but the message of this movie reveals the feeling that you are trying to hit your head to have a full-size crucifix. All this movie will be promoted and will cause everyone such funny money. The creators of this film would really use money to help those in need if they really wanted to show people what to say about Christianity and actually believe. Now, some people might have really encouraged them to listen.
