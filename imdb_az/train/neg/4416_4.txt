In comparison with the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church, a gentle slack shadow is given to a dark shadow of death at the end of the show. Throughout the show, dark humor, a commonly-asked rhetorical question plays a medium, especially, "If God is very good, why does the world allow evil to exist?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton condemns devout teachers who say "the line of the company" and make the world half burn in hell, with an exaggerated version (some disagreeing). To celebrate his 25th anniversary, he invites his first students to return and celebrate Christmas. <br /> <br /> However, the fourth group was pushing the story by sending a story that had been transformed into a "accidental" incident when Parody Sister Mary's "false" teachings. Eventually, the audience is left with a sick feeling in their hearts. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Instead, watch the game.
