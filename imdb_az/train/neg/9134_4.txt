I tried to love this program; I really did. I first got a pilot movie on the VHS and later DVD. But this story could not be accessed because two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) love themselves for just one thing. I have acknowledged that there are some clever dialogues in the show that is part of the success of the television program, and I appreciated most of this dialogue. <br /> <br /> This was mainly the old vocal comedy films between the 30s and 40s, between men and women. You get many disputes, accusations, shouts, and screams. Many people like this idea, but I hate it. <br /> <br /> Only Ally Beasley, like Agnes, was a fun guy. There was so little time left. The shepherd was on the eyes and likely women would say the same for Willis, but most of the arguments between them finally left me.
