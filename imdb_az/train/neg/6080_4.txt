'Maladolescenza' has a dark fairy tale with the discovery of children's heroes, forest reception and castle ruins. The film is, in fact, an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. Fabrizio's wrestling with a hound that protects himself from a huddle, explains in detail the romantic romanticism of Laura's psychological tyranny, her daughter giving her love, and equally harmful Sylvia. The film's psychological complexity is worthy of the film, but there is no doubt that the film exploits the unnecessary exploitation of the nakedness and sex image. The film's appearance is far more than its original cinematography capability, rather than its coolest place, and the biggest asset in the film is creepy and does not think the child chorus is an enlarged soundtrack. The film is most interesting with its strangely illogical quality but from the same era approaches Louis Malle's surreal and brilliant "Black Bear". Of course, 'Salo' or 'Larry Clark's' Ken Park' is a strange thing than an artistic perspective, unlike many banned films, which are worthy of pornographic debate compared to art. The film loses its ability to shock slowly, perhaps thirty years after the 'Maladolescensa' release, and should be loved for the sake of keeping this power. But only one reason for shocking value is that the film is memorable. <br /> <br /> The film has defenders. Nasism is the same.
