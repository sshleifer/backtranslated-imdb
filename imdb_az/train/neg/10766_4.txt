Everyone who sees kids eating Tammuz knows that he is a filmmaker who can do better. Let's hope that there are many hands in it (Telefilm someone?) And that it is generally a second-case situation. These characters are one-dimensional and already used. The sea decor is very striking and beautifully illustrates the north-western Pacific. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is great. It's as if it's totally drawn, the pictures are sharp and beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie is as sound as it is, there is only one heart.
