While many people here praise this movie, I must warn you. There is no logic. In my opinion, Basinger has a good job on the move, but you can not make a tension if there is no realism. <br /> <br /> This scene is a good picture for your movie: it is followed by murderous murders and she decides to sit and look at a picture she has found in her pocket. The picture is her daughter and she sings, "We love you." Who does such a thing? What's so effective? And when you say that the movie is not as stupid as the other scenes, believe me. Someone said this was a "hidden gem". Yes, absolutely disagree, this movie was hidden for some reason. And this is not a stone. Oh, and I do not even want to start commenting on the red tool box. My brain hurts: D The lack of logic does not bother me, but it's mostly because of the lack of logic. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I still know that logic is embarrassing, but there is a mood for me to the end. <br /> Thus, you've been warned to follow it.
