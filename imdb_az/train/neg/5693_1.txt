I do not believe in the positive reviews of this movie - I thought it was one of the worst, weakest, and weakest films ever to see. And the plot was absolutely funny (sp?). Although he is attached to the cafe, he goes out with him? puh-rent. The worst part was not good in a good, funny way. Just plain horrible - I do not understand why you worry about showing up at HBO. I was ill-advised to Belushi - I thought it was incredible as a "eccentric" person. idk, I can continue - still I'm shocked by the positive. It's interesting to see what's happening, how wrong the movie is and how bad it is. And the latter is not disappointed with silliness! "lives with the sword, dies by the sword ..." laugh.
