I do not think any of Van Damman's films will be defeated by the Universal Warrior, but I will never know it. This movie was good, but it was not as good as the 1st. VD returns a Luc and must fight again. She is here 2 b funny, but maybe it's worth a giggle smirk. VD, this time, has a boy from Ally W, showed a good pic. 2. Goldberg was cool, and I forgot her famous action because I was not watching wrestling. VD & Goldberg had a good fight. It ended up as 1st, but not good. As always, VD is doing the best in your career - HELICOPTER KICK. Although the latter end should be longer. Anyway, it is worth seeing, but in fact, nothing will ever happen.
