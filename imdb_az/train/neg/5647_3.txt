We bought this series of DVDs for all the brilliant views we see here. I've given three stars because sometimes the actor, leadership and writing are bright, that can be a little doubt. In fact, they are so brilliant, we have been shown so smoothly that we did not see propaganda. If someone is sensitive, you will see all the benefits of the radical right wing belief declared by Fox (Faux) News Network. To avoid giving any spoiler, I'm afraid to mention all of them in special cases. Briefly look at the areas found in the IMDb to ensure that the rights of the network to "Infomercials" from torture to arms control are updated by news stories, favorite parts provided by some of the best players, and compassionate speeches in the world. We watched a lot of demonstrations and eventually abandoned hate as a brilliant example of the use of torture for the protection of all of us when tortured by Prosecutor General Gonzalez. The series also has the ability to operate in a sophisticated fashion, using the tools that describe the bad men and women gays. Undoubtedly, the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that America has lost its way in the early part of this century. As a student of history, I will describe this program as Goebbels's propaganda for Hitler and a league with Hollywood's propaganda for the American audience during World War II. <br /> <br /> So you want to use it as a teaching tool to help your students understand how delicate the propaganda is. Simply make a cheap version to avoid enriching ultra-right wings on the Faux Network, which produces this transvestite.
