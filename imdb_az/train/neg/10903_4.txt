Rob Schneider is a famous comedian for his performances, faces and performances "not human". This time he is achivant. Marvin does not call anyone who wants to be a hero and attacks one day, so Marvin should take this job and rescue the attacker. However, when he went to a crime scene, he collided with the car and was really damaged. He does not remember what happened and if he realized that he was the instinct of the animal on the next ordinary day, his life was not the same. Certainly, it tries to reach the main character of our women, but its attempts are useless. It is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. I can use this metaphor is a negative character, destiny. Marvin should learn how to become a normal person again. By the way, animal instincts help him in some cases. Schneider's performance is so-so. The film is foolish in some moments, but as I wrote above, it is one of those films that are ridiculous. So look at the monkey style for Rob Schneider, but this is not one of the best comedies or Schneider's best movie ever seen. He is a great comedian, but this is not his best movie.
