As you can see, Hollywood gives money to anyone with camera and speech skills. This movie was numbingly filthy. Casting was terrible, without words, and the story was filled with holes. Script? Who needs a script? I was surprised that the movie was not as strange as I thought it would be, but I had enough shooting T & A for a lifetime. It was like listening to a 19-year-old street racer ADD (decided to buy a car instead of going to college). In a film that was so poorly written, it was the first two brothers in the movie. The scenes in the rocket, along with the main female actress, continued to think of Herbie: Fully loaded. Grindhouse is the kind of self-modeling movie ... only writers thought they were serious.
