When I first saw the trailer for Prom Night, I had to admit, the trailer looked good and it would be a fun fun movie movie like this. So, I saw my friend with Prom Night last night and got tired of a typical horror movie like an excuse for a similar noise film and I have to say that I need to grow up for being such a ridicules movie. to scare people. There was no tension, the heroes did not care for me? They had no development, killer? Oh, my God, it's probably the most foolish serial killer I know, I know it's a movie, but why (or at least we know) is that nobody kills one's previous one, kills a girl and just obsessed, friends? I mean, would he have been kidnapped or wanted to kill him? <br /> <br /> This film did not make any sense and insulted so many frightful fans and was very right. <br /> <br /> Donna's family was killed in the murder of a teacher who was very dissatisfied with her. was arrested and imprisoned. For three years now, he has some peace in his life, and even goes to his big fish. But the killer escaped and still has his mind Donna, it's a good idea to kill a servant and call because his friend and his friend call him a hotel servant and call boy means he is bad news for his friend so it is enough to see who this worker is will not be suspicious. Donna is in great discomfort, because this murdered man, of course, will not be able to enter homes and kill people silently. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I really like this movie, it did not have a good slasher for a long time, but it was a stupid movie that did not affect me. The only situations were incredible and the actors were also negative. I do not know if it was a PG-13 movie, but I loved stabbing and killing someone and gave only their clothes a bit of blood? Do not mention any knife pit? As long as you're a teenager, I do not recommend this movie to anyone, not for the teenagers, but for the adults, not for the ones who know the movie of real fear, but for those who enjoy this movie.
