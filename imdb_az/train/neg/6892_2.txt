Oh my goodness. It was a great mix of things that could not be helped either. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is still a 29-year-old man who lives with his mother (Diane Keaton) and does not plan to go anywhere. <br /> <br /> If Jeffrey is not a very neat player, then he will get acquainted with a wealthy businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels). At the beginning it does not have the chance to love it and only gets worse. In the end, we plan to love him, but there was no reason why he did not change the selfish ghost of the film. <br /> <br /> Keaton does not seem to work even after 2007 and is in a terrible state. What about shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and what should be said about where their mother and son should believe? Only saving grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris, though they are not too interested. Apart from a few small smiles, this movie is not really worthy of a comedy, because it's hard to laugh! You'll watch the Mad Money or the Smoke, which is much better than this terrible effort in your mood for the latest Diane Keaton whispering.
