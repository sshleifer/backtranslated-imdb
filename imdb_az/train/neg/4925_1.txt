Please do not waste your time. This film reveals the worst of Bram Stoker's Dracula (Van Helsing), Anne Rice's Vampire Lestat (rock music and terrifying biblical references) and Blade (high-tech toys). I love vampire films and novels and there are many good things there. But this is not a stinker. Even movie music does not help this film, but it is reported that the film was taken to classic music with more funny scary than kick-ass metal. I've heard a metal many times; Mostly tortured. Avoid as garlic and christians.
