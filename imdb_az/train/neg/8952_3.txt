<br /> <br /> After listening to Mr Orwell's prophecy, during my lifetime, I am 37 years old, but as I have not read books, I'm just as confused as the things I've seen. I know the concepts covered by the novel, but I am sure that they are the ones that they hear most and their nails. <br /> <br /> Without this limited knowledge, this movie would be a complete mystery and even more than just watching it since 1984. <br /> <br /> Additionally. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is incredible, Hurt & Burton delivers beautiful speeches, and the whole film is dark and painful. <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> at least in propaganda), but why and with whom? Nothing will be explained. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? what does she do? where does it come from where does it work? Why are the news changing? why not on the front line? What does not eat in the dining room? What is your drink in the whole movie? Why is he weak and sick? Why is it not known as the rest of them? What is the contract with her mother and sister? What happened to his father? A little backward story would be nice, as there is no significant twist for those who have not read books like me. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is intertwined and poorly structured and it is difficult and difficult to draw a craft movie that is talking about regular conversations. Big Brother screens accelerate the ongoing dialogue, even harder to handle. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is very good. <br /> <br /> Besides, it has been mentioned in advance, but why all the nudity? <br /> <br /> Personally, I will not be able to obey the way he feels to tell Hollywood story lines. These days, for the promise. We are not all unconscious symptoms, but this is a few steps. I can only imagine that the book is a complete reference to what you read, because if it was not a "spiritual translation" that I really saw so many people, why is it well-understood since 1984? <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <br /> <br /> I think what I need to do is to get a copy of me. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> Generally, I'm really sorry for what I've been expecting for many years.
