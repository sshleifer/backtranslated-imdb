As a Nazis, I refuse a movie without seeing all the shows. This is especially true when I rent a DVD. Syriana was one of those whom I refused. <br /> <br /> This film differs from each other, is boring, mixed and unshakable. The actor was dry and without reliable images. The general area was good, but I did not realize my focus and interest, that it was attractive and boring. Many subfields were often unable to join each other and seemed to be more casual stories than the actual one. Such a serious topic and so great actors are so bad to create such a flop. I can not imagine this movie, which received awards less than any nomination.
