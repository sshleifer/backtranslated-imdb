Totally funny movie. I live in London and conspiracy is investigated so ridiculous. No one can be a terrorist in London Metro. There is a group of maintenance staff, check-ups and repair work every night. Homeless people who live there are equally difficult. Or it is impossible to lock and to use the cell phone at this age and age ... <br /> <br /> The worst case that can happen if someone finds himself after the last train is to spray graffiti on them. Thanks to the massive number of security cameras in the network, it was controlled by another thorn on the side of the story. <br /> <br /> If I were in a city, perhaps I did not know, so I'm ignorant <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ if you have such a rating! Maybe the most frustrating movie I thought as possible.
