It's a surprising movie. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sex among women is only deteriorated by a group of men and women. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fellini's film inspires the movie "8 1/2", while Fellini is not Greenaway, not a titanium. <br /> <br /> Maestro's tactile light does not have the ability to convey emotions and feelings. <br /> <br /> He is ambitious that the movie, divided into a movie, is written only if the viewer is directed to the film alone. <br /> <br /> As for women, only two men, like Palmira, played by Polly It may take a few seconds for the audience not to be long enough to read. Walker and Giaconda played by Natacha Amal. The rest is erased with ordinariness. Both men and women are afraid of the grossness of truth. <br /> <br /> Greenaway wants to think that a certain sex fantasy will not bring happiness. Women are surprised that they are serving money instead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Philip and Storey Emmental and the incestuous relationship between father and son were offered by John Standing and Matthew Delamere. They carry both Giaconda's children, and note that women are twice pregnant, canceled the first fever, and for the second time they were sent to a selected place from a flight guide. Both women have sex with a woman who has no legs (half a woman in the head). The monster, which is played between Amily Plummer and Berry, with a pork called Hortense. Father and son distribute women among them. Women enjoy sexual intercourse. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> was shot when the film was first shown in Cannes. What is more unusual is that the actress in the film has been sorted out to defend it, and still indicates that women's naivety is not a limitation and that women are forced to use it. <br /> <br /> Greenaway's style of directing is ambitious, a film that is accompanied by a discovery of a style that is overwhelmed by the idea of ​​a style. Greenaway tries to achieve sublimity of syurrealism, but only manages to demonstrate similarity of human relationships.
