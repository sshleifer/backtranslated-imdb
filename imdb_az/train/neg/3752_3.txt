I watch and love TNG. I recently watched the ST Voyager DVD a few times, and this episode hated it. Because the difference in style and approach between the two shows could not be more strange. It would be good if Ricker was used as an opportunity to expand his character. This is likely to be treated in VOY. They could not have repetition of old show clips, but could have memories of the audience "new". In this episode, it begins as a clich√© in the beginning between the "memories" and "present" and in transition passages, and becomes very intolerable as it stands on tired patterns. Bar is the worst episode ever.
