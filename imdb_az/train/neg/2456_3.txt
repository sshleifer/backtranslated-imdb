I saw this class in the second class in Tolkien-themed Interim class. Unfortunately, I was sitting near the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a screaming boy - everyone was laughing, but they were not always able to see. Let's take him: Peter Jackson 'The Lord of the Rings' is obliged to film Bakshi. For example, Jackson's version of the Ring's Grant Presentation, Black Riders's attack on an empty bedroom is a complete carbon copy of the scene in the film shot. Depending on your agenda, it can be called plagiarism or respect. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that similarities do not stop there. I will not conduct any research to find out what they are. Because I have a respect for this film. <br /> <br /> This metaphor is a complete train accident in every sense, and many people have died in the accident. I decided to list things that I could remember for a little or a little chronologically - if I leave anything else that offends me, it is my failure to be faced with a wealth of (and at high points, <br /> <br /> Ranoscope's heavy Gandalf is a subtle, clever magician, but he is a terrifying prophet (his hat changes once or twice in the film). <br /> <br /> Saruman Agha is sometimes referred to as 'Aruman' in the film, sometimes without explaining it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The description of friendship with Frodo is strange childhood and happiness. Yes, hobbits are as small as children, but not children. <br /> <br /> Merry and Pippin are never presented - appearing only during a scene change with a sentence interpretation. <br /> <br /> Frodo, Sam, Pippin and Merry are playing with joy when they jump along the road. One of the hobbies provides a lute of at least twice as much behind the back of the hobby - it has just begun with an invisible and typical fantasy fashion, because all of them fall into the la-la-la. AWFUL. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Aragorn is, of course, a Native American, decorated with an extremely stereotypical fantasy tunic (trousers), completed with a large square pilgrim chain belt buckle. <br /> <br /> "Black Riders" are more likely to be more lepers than bad ones. He is the worst sword of the whole film. They run away everywhere they go slowly slowly. <br /> <br /> Before the Black Drivers, Bruinen Ford is trying to cross the frontier, but it does not last for fear, but the horses threaten your horses and do nothing else. The scene was likely to portray Frodo's hallucinatory recession as he put it in his wound. <br /> <br /> Gimli, Troll, Legolas are as tall as Elf. It's DWARF. There is no excuse for this. It also looks like a mischievous David Gnome. Boromir seems to have stolen Elmer Fudd's gold Viking armor from Bugs Bunny's opera episode. <br /> <br /> Balrogl's illustration of Tolkien's illustration creates the most dangerous and most dangerous of all in the film. As you can see, someone with a pink bedroom slipper is more difficult than Gandalf. <br /> <br /> "Showerers" can choose this Balrog, but every day I will get Jackson's version. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are embarrassing and embarrassing. Simply, no characters do not show any level of armor. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ font> all of them. <strong> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> Aragorn sounds are not bad, it looks just like the Jolly Green Giant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> According to my professor, it is dramatically accurate (and more accurate in death in the book). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ambassador said that the US According to the embassy, ​​despite the fact that this film is not really a positive thing, many of the failures in this film can not be blamed on the Baker, or they told me: the project was a tight budget, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm just happy to be happy with the latest product. <br /> <br /> Generally, I can not suggest that Tolkien's classic trilogy's adaptation to this crookedness laugh anyway, unless you read the books and have no own images of the characters, places and events. I am sure that in one place, somewhere, it will choose a copy of it; If you do, keep an open mind and collect something better than what you can do.
