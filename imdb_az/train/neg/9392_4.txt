Ethel Merman buffs also likes her loud vocals as evil witch Mombi, but this animated film, The Wizard Of Oz, reverts fantasy and excitement with noisy movements in realistic imagination as a bad music video. Small Dorotheni turned himself to meeting himself, breaking himself, meeting old and new friends. The most stylish animation is somewhere between less inspirational shows than Walt Disney and Hanna Barber, but many songs, especially Dorothy's "Lain Minnelli," are a good hint of pain. You can count on energy for Minnelli, so shoot a movie around Dorothy. Most are unmemorable and I'm not convinced that baby bumpers will receive a payment from this long since I left the circuit. In a fair way as an exciting matter. ** from ****
