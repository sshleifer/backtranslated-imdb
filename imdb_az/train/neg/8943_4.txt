John Wayne and Albert Dekker are competing for the oil right in India and attract the attention of Martha Scott in the pictures drawn from Utah, USA. <br /> <br /> Wayne & Dekker is a more modern structure that plays old and new Western groups. A story by Thomson Burtis, co-authored by Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell leads the career path of his career. A beautiful secular story is actually the last one in the third place, thanks to which measures are taken and we face something similar to the pulse. The light hearted approach to romantic sticks does not fit rightly and results in a great fist fight between two heroes, making it impossible for the stunt men to do Rogell's work. But hey, stupid people always deserve the moment of glory. Heavy support, as always, comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne, especially when it comes to hitting the pistol, has multiple screen chargers. But, though better than the usual Republican budget, it is only an interesting film for Wayne's enthusiasts in the 1940s. 4/10
