Swayze does not make much convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; the 1952 "Scaramouche", 1952 "Zenda Prisoner" and the "King Solomon Mines" in 1950; Patrick Swayze is absolutely unsuccessful. Sean Connery's "Extraordinary Gentle League" was very good at such a big flop, described by Alan Quatermain. Also, Alison Doody does not have the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of leading lady, and last but effectively Siriaque in at least the role of Umbopa makes it hard for anyone to fill his shoes! For someone who is disappointed by the 1985 version of Richard Chamberlain, if you can not get your granger version, I suggest it at a very high level.
