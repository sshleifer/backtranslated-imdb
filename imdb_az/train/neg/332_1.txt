I'll start saying that I will not be able to get all the way through this path. I took WalMart back on a rainy day like those who looked at this site. I thought, unfortunately, that there was no way of shopping. Was I wrong or what was it? Who seriously approved this project? They have to watch this film all the way to eternity. This is the only appropriate penalty for the release of this bad thing. Shooting is a reminiscent of the movies I used for classroom projects on a large older VHS camera. The player is not the best. I know there are a few cool people. Summer, the blessing ... Shecky Moskowitz is not complete, but the ships' comedy is a big loss. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own a DVD and I gave it to many employees to watch. <br /> <br /> I always say "It's fine now", everyone returns and laughs and says, "I'm never going to add Adam Sandler for 15 minutes." <br /> <br />
