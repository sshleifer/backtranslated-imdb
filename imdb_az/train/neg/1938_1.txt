Where to begin? <br /> <br /> Amitabh's son, Akshaye Hannah played by 30. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Amitabh 33 + years in prison ... <br /> <br /> B) Ask a Pakistani guard to send him <br /> <br /> C) allow secret visits to Pakistan's secret prisons <br /> D) All of the above <br /> E) Producers <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants for Hannah - she's yum, yum, yummy ... and, of course, who wants it, is it true? ... But when his father was thrown, and then he was killed (I think he is a brainwash for blindfolders and a blind spoiler), he is sympathetic to this disaster and at the end of his hat (metaphorically) behind his father he never cries for his loss and says, "If God so chooses, we'll get to know him again ..." mostly "I'm sorry for my father's DD job, and you're sorry - CYA! Buh Bye!" - even stay away from Hollywood standards ... There are many holes in this terrific time loss called a movie, you can drive all the jeeps, go through truck camels and any extra things - really full and total time spent - Oh! There is a great dance sequence (yes, only one dance sequence - no matter what the quality) big belly dances - Mr. Vera Zaara or Lakshya (Hrithik Roshan, who will work early and learn), better Indo - For confrontation films ... In fact, Veer-Zaara was pretty cursed - I would say 7.5 / 8!
