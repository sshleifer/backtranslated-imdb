William Lustiq's adherence to the Maniac proves that without the spectacular effect of Tom Savini and without Spinell's convincing performance, "Maniac" would never become a religious fantasy. "Vigilante" in the wrong direction, with a simple thoughtful scenario emphasizes everything for you and is predictable at all times, and also the mediocre performance of all actors. In the sense of "DÃ©ja vu", this movie was given to me, Lustig was watching it a few times for "Death Wishes"! (* 1/2)
