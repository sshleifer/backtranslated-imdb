Many Orca said that? Killer Whale is a Jaws-off. Jaws' great commercial success is undoubtedly not true, though it is done to man .Vs. The monster stories for movie artists in the second half of the 70s are more attractive. Orca ?? Killer Whale would be better described as a modern stopping of Moby Dick. A story about obsession. On the one hand look for revenge for the death of a whale-wife; an obsessive investigation to kill the honey, unless another lifetime can claim more lives of the driver. Unfortunately, Orca-Killer Balina is revealing a very disappointing film, with its fascinating ideas faded out by virtually unclear performances and fraudulent schemes. <br /> <br /> Shark hunter Nolan (Richard Harris) Marine lifeist Rachel Bedford (Charlotte Rampling) flies over Canadian Atlantic shores. When the Rachel team attacked a large white shark, their meeting ended almost with disaster, but Killer's Whale came to stop sharks. After that, Nolan is increasingly insulting by selling a Killer Whale and selling it to an aquarium. But her plans are, by chance, a man looking at a woman who is pregnant with killing pregnant women. Rachel Nolan'a said that a Killer Whale is an incredibly clever housewife with a strong memory and feelings like a human being. Even worse, the native Will (Sampson) warns that the whale will always remember the grief and will do its best to take revenge. Nolan first tries to forget all the pity, but whale fishing creates the air, and the hated indigenous population begins to demand that Nola be allowed to watch it and destroy it. Does Nolan Killer have to follow Balina in the end? <br /> <br /> Two things are different in this movie: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One is Ennio Morricone ( perhaps the greatest composer of film music at all times, the talent for wasting on various fourteen clunches in the 70s and 80s). The other film is Ted Moore's outstanding wide-screen photography. In every other department, Orca ?? Killer Balina is a film that has nothing to do with improving the credibility of the talented castle and crew. Harris looks very ill throughout the film, makes her hair easier, dark circles around her eyes and the skin is immortal. There is no ordinary activity in his activity. Ramping poses a lot of sexy poses, but does not agree with the long and dangerous warnings about the whales' paths. The rest of the actors are spent on short and undefeated roles, and the most memorable thing is that Bo Derek's feet are ending with a vengeful whale. The field is completely nonsensical, from start to finish, with an unfortunate sequence of fishing, starting to shoot at a fishing village, capturing and destroying a local refinery! It is totally absurd to think that even whales are capable of revenge against a single person's enemy, and that it can be calculated in such a quantitative way, although it is safe to assume that the whales are the intelligent creatures. Orca ?? Killer Whale is really for human companions .Vs. The cycle of animals from the late 70s. Many will move away from the film that shatter their head with disbelief and carry their teeth in desperation.
