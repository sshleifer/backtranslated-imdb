<br /> <br /> Despite this, I'm laughing more than the last few comedies I've seen in this movie. <br /> <br /> Budget actors had a pocket change. The production values ​​are not so low that they did something fun to watch. <br /> <br /> An unfaithful victim cuts his hands and feet on a scene. "The Qadr Night is hard to believe, but the Black Knight scene is more realistic, and why she did not start shouting," Why do not Hijr pass "and" Only one body wound, I'm worse ". <br /> <br /> It was one of the funny scenes I saw last year. <br /> <br /> It was a stitch in "Gladiator / Demon." <br /> <br /> It's really a bad movie to watch a movie. <Br / <br /> <br /> Watching the slow moving auto accident in the movie. <br /> <br />
