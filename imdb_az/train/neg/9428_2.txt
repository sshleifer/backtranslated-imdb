I usually do not have time to comment on how many people will read and see some of the movies. However, in this case, I felt that I should warn all those who are thinking of losing time. I finished watching just five minutes ago. It's just one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. The operation is terrible, and there is no plot and the production values ​​are the best poverty line. I know that it can be a low budget movie, but this is not it. There is something that can save this movie for the purpose of any horrible fan - it's much more like a screen and intensified! This is three times the total total. When it is happening, it is effective and sufficiently worried - especially the last scene - it's just not enough. It was not possible to watch the film with very little content, too much of the weight of the dialogue and eventually watching it. What is happening? To put them all together, three young girls are forced to slip in an isolated area where irresponsible and over 20 girls have been abducted and killed before. Of course, their car breaks down, and they are taken to an old drill house, three of them mad - one is a psychotic killing. All three are finally killed, off-screen, after a boring, slowly appearing forever as a faded calm. As I said, the only thing worth looking at once is a crime. Please do not buy or rent it for yourself, and do not be fooled by the deceptive box art and movie description. Save your money and time.
