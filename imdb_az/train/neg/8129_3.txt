Sometimes I try to try you, and try and try to be kind to all the B thru Z class films, but once a special movie is to ask everyone who is just trying to attract you. "Bat People" (this is what I see under the "Live Night") is a movie. You can not really watch it without thinking that it should be an episode in "Night Galleries" and you are not one of the good ones. <br /> <br /> The film has something to do with a wounded physician and ultimately turns into Were-Bata, who swallows human blood. (In fact, you would think it would turn into a real bat, you would eat mosquitoes by gallop bucket, but this is a cheap, horrible horror movie). There is a giant seizure in a hat's hat and almost every night from a gypsy, friend, and doctor Dr. Moustache Aspen-Extreme claims he has only 'allergic reaction' to rabies. At the same time, the world's most modest and stereotyped county sheriff is suspected of responsibility for a brutal murder and killing of several local girls (and one wino). The doctor's wife, however, is denied that she is a river in Egypt and alternates with her and nags to spread her. <br /> <br /> This player is not too bad - you can say that actors are doing professional level choices and trying to bring some juices and lives into scenario, even a sheriff. (Okay, it's pretty bad, but it's a kliched, the tree is bad in a professional way). All we have to do is put on your teeth and do everything you want, clothes, dialogue, writing, and everything else on the story line, something everyone is involved with. <br /> <br /> I think there was a chance that the film was not an exciting, boring little culinary love, but the director, the experienced actor Michael Pataki Pataki, , not just Dennis Weaver's channel. <br /> <br /> 2) You also need to find a bit more meaningful script regarding the "Bat Bites Man, It's Then A Bat into It" scenario. <br /> <br /> 3) Also, instead of capturing a person from a "little man", there was a need for actors to play an incredible part of the scene business for "episodes". The Book of the Clich√©s Mannerisms. 4) He had to re-run the character of his entire spouse and make him smarter, less noisy, and more observant. <br /> <br /> With the help of Mike and Bots, I will never be watching this movie voluntarily. It's bad, but it's not hurtful, humorous and interesting. It's still better than "Battlefield Earth" or "Waterworld".
