I just found the television show "Mash", its propaganda, the so-called "politically correct", repetitive, ambitious, and greatest blame, that is? It was pretty boring. Alan Alda, like mother ("star"), who is in love with herself and her mind, really worried me to work and sit with an episode. In the original series there were both McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers. I will happily admit that he has given a certain word and style in his personal presentation. However, as Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell, both are singularly and compositely eat together with Wonder Bread and eat fresh oysters. Loretta Swit, myself, did not seem to be guilty either, and if it was not a miracle, Gary Burghoff, who was good at the film, would look and act as he wore on the show. Show me a show every year. Jamie Farr was just a brown "comedy" and it was not really worth mentioning here. The reason I did not give you a rating I read right now is not a subjective challenge, but a relative thing. Television is the same, with relatively few exception. Speaking relatively speaking, Mash has some days of production of quality (television standards) and therefore has two attributes. Rob Ritter
