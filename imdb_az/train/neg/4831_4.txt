<br /> <br /> Hurt Locker is a very realistic illustration of the rotation of a group of soldiers (for most part). After winning all Oscars in Netflix, this film is in Iraq. <br /> <br /> This movie is Plot and Director of the film where I have not been in my opinion. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be out of my mind. Unlike other films like Black Hawk Down, this movie does not have an open structure. This film focuses more on the characters and their different relationships with war. Although Bigelow does a good job of paying attention to the characters, there are many points in the film, where the dialogue seems to be dragged. <br /> <br /> Part of the film was particularly horrible and destroyed the perfect credibility of the films, the sniping scene in the half of the film. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is OKAY, but instead of 7 instead of 6, the reason I was giving was a great rage to get the best picture. Oscar. It would be nice to consider that this movie lost Private Ryan's Best Picture, but it was better than this movie. Other important notes were Black Hawk Down, which won only 2 Oscars. <br /> <br /> In short, it has won the best picture. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a full-fledged war ride, give Black Hawk Down. This movie will be forgotten in one or two years.
