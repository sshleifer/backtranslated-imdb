The fans of Herschell Gordon Lewis should watch the film for their usual buckets of bloodshed in other films because this film is less valuable in bloodshed. Instead, Lewis decides to try and talk about a strange story based on baseline-basement special effects in a double-dose budget, if they produce their pockets for a day-to-day change. Surprisingly, it is inexpensive and very bad (especially by McCabe, like Mitchell), the area is totally shocked. Imagine what this film will do with a decent budget! In general, champagne enjoys a beer budget.
