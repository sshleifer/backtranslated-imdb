Ace way to go! Only one necropolis is a soft, soft, dramatic, exciting, strange story about the cannibal. Obviously one of the two types of film called Dahmer: Horror, or documentary right? What was this? It was not close to any details (in fact, there were no articles). It was really sick or unprotected and did not even want to worry about it. What was this writer / director's attempt to think? We have one of the most realistic examples of any patient serial train, and we have been subjected to bad shots, bad bar roof rifles, and individual alterations in the home of an old parent. I think Jacobson really wanted to introduce (or invent) the 'soft side' of j.Dahmer.
