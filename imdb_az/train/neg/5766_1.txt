It is up and standing in the world press to warn us that we are not in the marketplace with our choices to create a beautiful work of an open-minded society. After downloading the main version, I finally came here (leave the fan on the dial-up modem). Media Player, Mplayer Classic & Winamp could not open my xp box, then Totem, xine & kaffeine could not open on my suse server. Mplayer managed it perfectly. <br /> <br /> If the normal user can not open the movie, it will be difficult to spread this word. Beautiful soundtrack, superb lighting, superior camera work and impeccable texture. Everything looked real. And then moved the two main characters .... and spoke ... And the movie died for me. Everything that is different from lip syncing and two main characters (except for Proo on the dance scene) looks fluid and completely alive. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Two of the main characters are so bad that sometimes I wonder if there is any game on the market that results in less real-life situations. <br /> <br /> What a fantastic frame and what actors move is great. I am really glad that I did not recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <strong> The tragedy that is directly on the screen.
