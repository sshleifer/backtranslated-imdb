The only reason the flick was to cast a shot was because of the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. I can all say that it was the biggest loss of a good actor film. As I know, Borgnine was ONLY actor. Other speeches were terrifying in such a way, but I was amazed that a studio would actually make "performers" appear. As I have a few skills at this level of life, I thought my eyes would begin to bleed after the spread of credits, so you have a perfect kinematic disaster with a story like plodding and insipid. Obviously, the film has been designed to appeal to an audience for the kids and its credit is far better than the original software on Disney Channel and similar childcare networks. But honestly, I do not say much.
