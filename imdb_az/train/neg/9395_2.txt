This series is interesting to watch as a MST3K feature, but for the whole audience today. I was really surprised to see the year of 1952. Given this fact, this is so strong in my book. Used machines do not even look modern, they look like stuff in the 1930s. Basically Cody (Sheesh's word about an insult to everyone, a war of the world, everyone), in any case, it bites two cries against Cody, Graber and Daley in his nipple ring, quite bare, delusional. If you really want to watch a good episode, look at Flash Gordana, it's full of missiles that attack each other and have a good nemesis and good-looking women, and there's not a whole lot. And Flash has been made 15 or more years ago before this shit, so it can give some stain. Something in 1952, something bad, worthy of it. Nuff said. Give it to you that you're watching as an MST3K episode, so children are a bit funny; Here is a pinch of nipples, a pinch and flying! Now, as an added bonus, Bring Joe and his two character bots as Commander Cody Theme song when you put on your love line for eight episodes by Tom Servo and Crow: <br /> <br /> ( TOM SERVO SINGING) IS THE CODE OF YOUR OBSERVED COMMANDER ...
