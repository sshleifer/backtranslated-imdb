Do not spend money or time on this sad part of the film as cinematography. Every third word has been spelled out in words and there is no real field, and many words have not yet developed in the same historical performances and career as the old actors carry. I was expecting something better than the award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision of others, such as Puertorricans, will be misrepresented by garbage, such as Maldeamores. In a movie, a bad word may be used to emphasize a certain point at a given moment, and may be laughable or sad, despite the context (see, for example, Elsa and Fred), but not into the plot. The film is generally a shame, and nothing about this movie is funny or even cute.
