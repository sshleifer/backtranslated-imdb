Here is not a typical vamp story, but a barram stoker or mother rice. really original vampire story. these vampires are genetic mutants that are not disturbed by sunlight. They are pure things. <br /> <br /> The film is not perfect. Most actors are obviously amateurs. The vampire chick with the two cars playing and rallying cars is pretty good. The film is intense, which can disturb some people. it will also find it difficult to understand and load with scientific data that can be boring. I sold on the smart story line and some good output. it was unable to explain how successful this movie could be if it had a larger budget and massively distributed
