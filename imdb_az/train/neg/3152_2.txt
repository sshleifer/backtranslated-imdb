Poorly structured, poorly written, clicks, and straightforward dialogs. A single scene does not shine. Actors are struggling with a painful, boring scenario that fights to escape surprises, plots, or conflict. <br /> <br /> For a movie on the tab there is almost no sense for the city. There is a lot of other indie movies that help to look magic in a small budget. <br /> <br /> If you beat Natasha Henrytti, why not put it on the canvas of the soil? Why should Vartan be boring and blow? Where's the attraction? <br /> <br /> Steven Federer's great success was that he was eager to get people to take this mild film, so that I was watching a sub-Christian movie of the week.
