Now I am a B movie genre, but this piece of trash insults me. Initially film Lizzy McGuire's brother plays as a teasing small child looking for his missing 3-legged dog. I ask you now, please, for a cursed crocodile, I ask for a three-legged dog-made donkey mistake? There is a point to long-lasting thinking, why is Dinokrocu behind the movie box big and really watered? It was a heartbreak if the memory served for about 2.6 minutes in water and was ashamed of only 6 meters high. But the qualities that featured this film were so bad that I almost laughed because it believed in me that bad deeds wished me dead. In fact, this is to create a super-crocodile for a military battlefield, or to create something from the source of everything from the E.V. L. Corporation. And we will not see the symbols that we saw a leap No. 1, like the woman's head and half a chick (who does not know how to act). The only thing worse was the fact that the player spent only 2 hours talking and talking to the heroes for only a long time to kill the dinosaur, and only about 15 seconds after it had failed him and killed him in an ordinary way. All this film was casual with casual opera music in the background, which, of course, is for the military DUH, of course, the most exquisite of all CGI monsters as well as the truth of bullets and bombs!). When Lizzy McGuire's brother escapes to the chair, and the dinocroc eats because of a noise that he can add to her head. I believe you will be better off drawing your eyes to watch the dinosaur. As for leadership, a group of people need to turn their backs on a pantomime to push it out of a bone and push it to wrap one half of my life until it finally dies. to live.
