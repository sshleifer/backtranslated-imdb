Surely, we only went through the lights for two minutes. Just five people before the start of the film. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to buy this movie. The player is terrific (especially Hurley). The script is banal. Impacts we have seen a million times. What we see in the film is the worst. Meandering and disjointed. <br /> <br /> After 25 minutes we left. <br /> <br /> It was too late for her husband not to go hot. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your money on this movie. If you have something else watching in your movie, get some drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and watch some people. <br /> <br /> You have a much better time! <br /> <br />
