"The Incubus" is a good (an exciting killing secret), a bad (cut scripts, ugly resolutions, bad attack scenes) and weird (strong incestuous overtones, strange sleep by John Cassavetes and harsh performance) - this character really is "wacko" means?). No matter how wrong he is or what he is, he is not particularly successful. (* 1/2)
