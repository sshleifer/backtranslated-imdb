<br /> <br /> If I have to give this movie a score on a line, then I should consider it low at 3/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Psychiatrist candidate James Bishop is placed in Stephen Andrews Hospital and is ready to "change the world". <br /> <br /> The movie you know that the hospital is hiding a bad fact, but James thinks it can make a difference, and does not recognize it. <br /> <br /> This story is set up quite well and you are surprised that patients are talking about some resident villains and when and how James learns it. <br /> <br /> In some cases, James goes out to hunt for evil, and you feel somewhat resistant until the "battle" ends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> br> <br /> There is an unpleasant scene in the film, which is done in a very good way. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br> </ font> <br /> <strong> /> What kills this movie: * Stupid special Effects - Plan 9 from Space - a modern version of the evil wolf looks like a terrible person. * Some bad players (or very few movies) - The main characters are sometimes ill-treated and ineffective. * Voice is often cheaper. <br /> <br /> In my film, I would say, "I can shoot a movie with my camcorder in my house."
