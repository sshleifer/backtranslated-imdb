This is definitely one of the 70's movies, and Bigfoot takes the most out of the hottest ten years. Especially when a dark, moody first half replaced everything with a MUSIC DAY, a small part of the horrors, especially for some part of the film, is remarkable (as noted by another user, Travis Crabtree, for a while, turned the wind into a canoe). .. can not be seen again). Now, though painfully written, I still have a fun scary movie to show to children, or anyone who loves Bigfoot Lore or 70's hillbilly culture has to take a shot of it. My favorite thing is that a guy was afraid to jump over a door (!!) and the narrator explains that he did not know the shock. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
