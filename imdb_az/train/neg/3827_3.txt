Stereotyped, derivative, unoriginal and boring Western. Two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) are the ones that are far from the best and give exactly the same speeches; both of which have superficial roles and characteristics characterized by dialogue. Heston is Sheriff, who "loved the world better than before," and Coburn "lends money to a man who lends it and owes it a debt to a person". In addition, Heston is so old that he has a horse-throwing problem, and Coburn does not mean a cold-blooded murderer like some of the smallest and the bad guys. Apparently, filmmakers did not have a direct idea of ​​how to differentiate this film. (* 1/2)
