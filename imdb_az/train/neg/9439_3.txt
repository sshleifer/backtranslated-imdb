Twist ends can be really cool in a movie. Bending is particularly interesting when we are in front of our eyes, but we just do not pay attention. This type of end-to-end ends are thought to be human. Then there are those wrapped around like this. There is no clue as to whether or not you are paying attention. When this kind of occasional twist is revealed, it is a little irresistible reaction instead of shock. <br /> <br /> Three young women will go to a concert, so they look like each other. We lost a journey to the woods and hit a wooden pitcher. They end up at the house of some old creepy lady who hate men and are greeted by her married daughter Marion (Laurel Munson). <br /> <br /> This is not a strange event that happens to be a home for many days, rather than going back home and coming back home. <br /> <br /> This film is very much talked about, and it's always just about a few characters. We have three main girls, a creepy spinster and an old lady, and there are no more than five of them. Nothing is of interest to worsen issues. It's really bad that you're sitting with your conversations. <br /> <br /> We want to know what's going on and instead they just talk, talk and talk (about nothing). <br /> <br /> There are many gaps here. These girls will stay in car crash, probably three miles from everywhere ... wow, three miles! Two hours or less will kill them. Why did not they go to the city with the worker for this house? Is there a single person? Why do these girls refuse to leave and simply stay enthusiastic, rarely control one another? Why were there so many dumb flaws? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2. 79 minutes. R for nudity and violence.
