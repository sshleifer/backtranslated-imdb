I saw this movie a week ago with my buddies and it's absolutely important not to say it to the whole world (or at least to the readers), not to the first five worst films I've ever seen. It has the honor of being number one. I've seen most of the movies, but nobody is so foolish. you can say that you are suffering from watching it ... We apologize for having waited for a few hours and we can not go anywhere else without freezing our goals. I do not recommend it to anyone. At first we thought we were watching some really bad porn movies, but in 10 minutes I thought that there was no problem. not a comedy, drama, not action, not fear, not just horror!
