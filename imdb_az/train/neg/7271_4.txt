It could have been a gay counterpart of the Gone of Wind because of its epic length, but instead provided itself as a great chain of empty episodes where nothing was happening. The heroes look like each other, and there is no other story than a kiss (really no story). An interesting aesthetic proposal, which does not have any dialogue, is nothing more than a film that has been consumed entirely in its own way, by examining its heroes psychology in some dignity and achieving real emotional resonance. Moreover, kinematic snobbery claims to be an "art" movie using the worst naive clich√©s. But if someone could identify with a similarity, that's why it's good.
