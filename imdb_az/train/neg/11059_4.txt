"Dahmer" is an interesting movie, though I will not use it as a "fright" or "tension". <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner describes Jeffrey Dahmer, the murderer murderer who proved to be a murderer, murder, and crusade. The film is based on links between Dahmer and Rodney, played well by Artel Kayarru. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> /> Describing the years of Dehmer's formation is very small, as the events we see on the screen created the human soul and does not think that Dahmer's victims can create a sexual zombie. <br /> <br /> The roles are played well, but the story is subtle.
