For a while, a group of friends, with minimal budget, enthusiasm and talent bags, will create a low-budget masterpiece that leads to the horrors of the storm. Raimi and co. The Evil Dead, Jackson and Pals Bad Taste were able to; and made a mint with Myrick and Sanchez Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> Director Todd Sheets and his shots are preparing to make a long wall in a relatively messy situation if Zombie Bloodbath is gone. A lesson to avoid being cheaper than a horror, this strange effort is a service that reminds many people that most people should not go to the video camera today <br /> <br /> there were no eyes for framing (some camera angles and movements are actually pretty good). is good), on the contrary, a) his unhappy art b) a rich cast and c) does not understand that he is a bad script and cast. That is, the last movie is too amateur and can not be completely monitored by anyone who completes the zombie movie (like me) or cast and crew members (as well as those who provide the movie's favorable comments). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zombi Bloodbath <br /> <br /> So these moments are undoubtedly yucky, they are not particularly convincing and soon get tired. Thus, to summarize, this is really a bad movie, with almost no backlash features. <br /> <br /> Firstly, Larry (also known as a few zombies) has the biggest scarecrow in the history of the film shot by Jerry Angell. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the prince of his barnet (combined with a mustache) is the only reason for watching this movie. <br /> Secondly, there are "pitiful hidden zombies": unfortunate victims walks before jumping off the hiding place to start a weak attack requiring almost no effort. <br /> <br /> First of all, the best-known "secretly hidden zombies" sometimes hide behind the walls or sit in churches as members of the community, to hide behind a door waiting to open it. <br /> <br /> Generally a movie is a bad one for me, but I'm going to raise my rating to level 2/10 when recording Jerry Angell's locks.
