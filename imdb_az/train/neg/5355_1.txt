Now I do not hate cheap movies. I just do not see that you do not spend any money for a movie you can shoot with my father's camera. <br /> <br /> I want a movie to be rent, I want to have a MOVIE, it's a good idea to spend some MiniDV ribbons. <br /> <br /> Maybe I hate it so much. The man in the video store said it was a big deal and was not. Perhaps, this is cheaper because at least the most unusual characters EVER, really really are the most terrible story EVDEN really in film history. Even Tom Savini can not save it. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a full time.
