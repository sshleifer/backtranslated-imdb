I will admit. I think Uma Thurman has made a mission to see this one as the most beautiful woman in the planet and her film (unfortunately the terrible movies include Batman and Robin, The Avengers). <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I've ever seen. (yes, below Avengers). everyone seems to have lost it and is not beyond belief. <br /> <br /> Though you think that you are a goddess like me, I do not refer to this movie yourself. you will hate yourself tomorrow for it.
