I am not an anime fan (with a few noteworthy exceptions) and I generally have a lower idea of ​​otakus because they like their special cartoon brand that they are spiky-haired as a work of art without any other important factors, such as cunning labeled movie characters each movie. <br /> <br /> Otakus and Fatal Fury, this delicate trash, is not much better represented than people with a real taste than Motion Picture. <br /> <br /> As Otaku's grumpy, smart eyes seem to have little to find fault with Fatal Fury - very interesting Japanese-humor, one-to-one duels, some "dramatic" moments and everything beautifully drawn. However, everyone cliched, predated by cliched predictable characters, exited, cliched, predictable ends when finished. The scenes of love have been overthrown in a cunning way - Terri, a "healing" of Sulia, is going to be a momentous moment, but it is impossible to be spiraling into this strange laughter. And of course, the Fatal Fury is not without mandatory cartoon T & A - it's free of charge by the big breasts Mai Shiranui. Since Fatal Fury suspends the same video game series (oh boy), we treat numerous space-related images of any non-relevant or non-related field (all of the problems that apply to them will only disappear from the film just for him). This confusion of the film reaches its peak with an exceptional radical final battle, with all the main characters taking turns in a single battle with all the strongest hostages. <br /> <br /> Some things have always been fun to me. Animes battles do not take part in a single tournament, but they always happen, no matter what they are! <br /> <br / Otakus always touches on the need for anime movies to be treated as MOVIES, just like animated films, and Fase Fury loves those people's anxieties. If it were not for anime, would Fatal Fury be better? The answer is "no" empathic - the attractiveness of this movie, the smaller it is, the more accurate it is. Fatal Fury is an anime, but if the show is still in the air, this Mystery Science Theater would have won 3000 episodes. This is basically - this is nothing more than a malicious bad B-movie called anime epic. If you are a fan of films that are really entertaining, consider Fatal Fury (or Sci-Fi channel) because it's definitely one of them. If you are a carnivore, watch WAKE UP and think that the products you make are good 90%. As for everyone, Get Dreamcast and Fatal Fury: Wolves Mark, but I do not think to see this movie.
