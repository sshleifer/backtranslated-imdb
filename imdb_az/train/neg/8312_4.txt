The Thumb idea is not such a winner for the second time. ThumbTanic was not as good as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons. First of all, I think that Mr. Oedekerk was too little to work with the Titanic shipping. Unlike Star Wars, the movie "Titanic" (still?) Is a cultural myth and there are very few references to resonating with the audience. <br /> <br /> In ThumbTanic, the holes are really some magic jokes that are related to something. For example, it is not funny for a hero to assume that the hero is not clean on the "skip to the end of the ship." Rather, you only think yourself, "Do you miss anything in the original movie?" <br /> <br /> Many of these unusual jokes (arshid) were. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, sending smarmy ship designer was meaningful and funny. Also, it was very funny that everything that requires "everything" in the film was sent in a film that wanted to "walk" and kill itself the first time. <br /> <br /> Such shocks mean something in the context of the Titanic and gave Thumbalanica a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Prime Minister "media", faces and sounds are still entertaining. Attributes and sets and CG animation deserve a high appreciation. In general, though ThumbTanic is proven not to be haughty, in this movie you are still entertaining and screaming to the end.
