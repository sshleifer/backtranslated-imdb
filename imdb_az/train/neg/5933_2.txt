I've been a fan since his first album. This film is a hurt for him. Speeches by Rufus Wainwright and Teddy Thompson are simply terrible. <br /> <br /> Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Antony and Jarvis Cocker are particularly upset. <br /> <br /> One of the allies was killed by McGarrigle's sisters in harmony called Martha Wainwright. <br /> <br /> I did not see that my spouse first came out of the room in a movie and found myself quick. The poorer camera is transmitted through outputs to access several interview segments that are hard to track. <br /> <br /> There are many people who can fulfill the comments of Mr. Cohen's songs, Jennifer Warnes, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Aaron Neville and Willie Nelson, but those selected for this performance. <br /> <br /> that Leonard Koen will have another attempt to shoot the film. <br /> <br /> I hope that,
