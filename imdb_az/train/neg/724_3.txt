The Sarafina concept seems to be a voice outside of the voice. African singers are trying to unite with a story that describes the strange atmosphere and atmosphere in which they were forced to endure when the movie was set up. The contradictions of each of the two elements are very good, and the film does not actually move so fast. If it were just a drama that reflected these conditions, it would have been a good movie, but the scenes of the children who were shot by the soldiers did not sit well with the songs. <br /> <br /> Apart from the poor principle, the actor is not the best, but a middle-class performance like the rest of his castle. Generally a disappointment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
