I was not really impressed with this movie. They first gave the name Sin Eater and stayed in this way considering that we talked about the last half of the film. I'm not sure what any of the first 20 minutes of the movie relates to. It was too slow and chose Robocop (Peter Weller) as one of the key players. <br /> <br /> In some cases, this is not something like that. <br /> <br /> Therefore, in a few days, it will flop and it will come out.
