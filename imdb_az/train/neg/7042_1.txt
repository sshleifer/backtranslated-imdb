It should have been one of the worst films. Even if it's a biker movie, it's under the shelter. The minimal area covers a group of cyclists taking over a small city (original!) And the attempt of urban residents to fight them. Why do not they call foreign aid? Who knows? Fighting scenes are obviously fake. There is also Adam West and Tina Louise, but both are very few, and both are ashamed to be there (apparently) This movie is in the garbage dump!
