Hmmm ... where to start? How did a serious actor, such as Demi Moore, join this bouquet? The "first blood" can be regarded as an ox, but this nonsense is just the point of Rambo with herbs. Of course, this crapstory (Demi Moore wants to prove that a woman can be a part of the NAVY Seals), I think the most stupid clich√©, "GI Jane" is a great movie. Only Viggo Mortensen's film is sad but hell, I do not think Demi Moore is Rambo (especially in the end, it's useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott is not deserving of credit for delivering this film to Equal Rights, which is only the brainless propaganda of the US Army and is more attractive to Moore. Horrible movie.
