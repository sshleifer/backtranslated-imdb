This movie was simple and straightforward. Perhaps this is basically a revenge for a girl who has been harassed, and she takes another man to rape an aggressor. It's a raucous shower, but it's partly blame for the girl. I would like to say that both are in the mood and begin to kiss, but if the aggressor sexually interacts with her, she does not allow the aggressor to harass her. And the look of aggression for the girl is too short and really does not expose or show anything, but when it comes to aggression, it is a long aggression. <br /> <br /> <strong>
