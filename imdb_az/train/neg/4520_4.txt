Irwin Allen was very beautiful. All television shows had a great pilot or first episode. the rest were at the edge of other shows. Several episodes from the Swiss family Robinson came from his old TV show. An episode of the Swiss family is the same as the Giants Land episode, when it needs an additional member of the Party. The show was a high budget and was very expensive to continue. Irwin has been in touch with the television show since the 1960s. The player is strong with Martin Milner. Children's stars, such as Willie Ames and Helen Hunt, begin with this show. a brilliant point when Irwin Allen combines disaster scenes as a typhoon and a volcano eruption dubbed him master of disaster
