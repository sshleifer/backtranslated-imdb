STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday Night ** Sunday night * Monday <br /> <br /> McBain (name of Gary Busey The Simpsons character) ) is an unusual police, but his head is winding up to a rotten thing. At the beginning of the film, the land gets a different shift to escape the clich√© of his killed partner and designates a trip to Mexico where many hidden americans super tank, incredible firefighting and imitation, is smuggled. 80s standards) was a striking career move for Gary Busey as a dull little action movie, and after creating an impression, Alev revived Mr Joshua in the Lethal Weapons. She just acts with edgy and zany without the material to keep her back, as always (with 'badger' trademark put on bad guys), with her cartoon character only. Henry Silva is like a screen-traitor, but he is totally disgraceful like an Arabic leader here (red beret!) And the terrible script really gives clunky lines to some of the truly gruesome dialogue that goes out like a laughing board. He is L.Q. is one of many actor-actors, including actors. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick, who opens but blends will not add anything. After the first half of a very exciting motion, at the end of the work a little rises, but it is too late, and none controls the fun. *
