Based on the original film version of The Haunting, I'm in the top ten movies of all time, "I was betrayed by this adaptation, and I was careful not to be outdated and badly loaded in this movie, all this was an innovative camera business to create a fear of Robert Wise it's a perfect lighting and it's the cause of the case.The novel version is not shameless, it's based on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to reach A-B, and it's simply just the ingredients (like actors like Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) To do something, this movie should be viewed as an example of a studio butcher !!
