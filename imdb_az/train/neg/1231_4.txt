Della Myers (Kim Basinger) is a top-class housewife who lives in a suburban home with twin children and her insulting husband, Kenneth (Craig Sheffer). Della gives attention to twins, neglects his home and his appearance and disturbs Kenneth. On the eve of Christmas, he directs to a local shopping center at night and can not find the available parking space to buy dressing paper. When he sees an old car parked at two points, he sends a message to the owner who says "do not bother". When the shopping mall closed, Della's car was seized by an old car driver and four punks were threatened? Chuckie (Lukas Haas), Afro-American Huey (Jamie Starr), Chinese-American Vingh (Leonard Wu) and Latin Thomas Luis Chavez. When the security guard at the shopping center protects him, Chuckie is trying to escape from the criminals when he is shot in the head. But while the gang raids, the truck approaches a forest. <br /> <br /> Just a couple of days ago, I saw a trailer for "When I was with me" and I did not want to watch the DVD. . Unfortunately, the trailer is better than the movie, and I'm totally disappointed with this dull and incredible cliché collection. Della Myers is presented as a dangerous and indifferent housewife and does not exist as a spouse; motherhood is one of her interests in her family conception. He is being persecuted by four criminals, but defeats them in a box that looks like Batman's useful belt. Therefore, irritating the territory is very absurd. A group of criminals, along with American Americans, was created by the favorite clip from African-American, Chinese-American and Latin-American films. Kim Basinger has a worthy act, but their children are too young to a fifty-five year old woman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> "My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Enquanto Ela Está Fora"
