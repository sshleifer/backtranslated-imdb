Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and is missing something in her life. She joins the Miss France competition against her dear Andre (Georges Charlia) wishes and she won. She leaves for Miss Europe, behind Miss Dostoy. He again won, but asked Andre for his return home. Once returning to life, life is again secular, writes a note to her overnight, and goes on to experience the fame she is expected of as Miss Europe. Andre follows him ..... <br /> <br /> This movie is a silent movie with all the ways through piano music. Both are sped-up as everything seems to be fast. Later, a limited dialogue was added and very fake. The cast is a silent film. The best part of the movie ends, but the story lasts for a while. After watching this, I'm not sure if something big is in the look of Louise Brooks - she has a terrible hair that makes her face look greasy. No need to watch again.
