I think everyone was completely disappointed with this fantastic flick. For something, it was directed by Tim Burton. Something else, this is something that should be classic. I found him boring, heavy and ridiculous. If you see this, you know what I mean. Imdb tells everyone that this is a crap and a boy, right! If not, beware of it. This is a victim. 10 to 1.
