Okay, guys, we know why we're watching the movie "The Invisible Maniac" (just look around!). T and A in one place (with T more T). <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> <br /> <br /> If this is called NAKED Maniacs, I would not have a problem. <br /> <br /> But since these guys are cribbing from The Invisible Man, they need to have a little story somewhere that you know to enrich your mind. However, the naked doctor creates an invisible serum and uses it to crack down, crazy women, and kill many teenagers. <br /> <br /> For a star, T and A, but there are a lot of things for your skin's fans, so keep on Carefully. <br /> <br /> TIDBIT - Yes, this is Savannah.
