Once again, film classics have been redefined with unexpected catastrophic results. As with everything about this movie, the title is incorrect. The period is not shown in duplicate and the roads are very young and too vapid to be very conservative. Arthur Penn film was a scene of style, humor, and was made by talented people. Although this is not a 1967 version, it will still be an unnecessary movie. The 1967 version reveals a glimmered version of Bonnie and Clyde, but it was innovative and innovative in 1967, and it was a series of outstanding performances that made you care. This remake of 1992 seems to be deleted from the original film rather than the truth, and those who are involved in this version are at least not interested. Hoping to skip this all, we hope the 2010 version will be better. Maybe worse?
