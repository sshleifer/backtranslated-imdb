This fragile B movie is trying to masquerade as a matter of sexual dependence, but it's really a poor excuse to jeopardize sexual abuse. The story takes place around the Sammy Horn (subtle name) performed by Michael Des Barres. Sammy owns a restaurant with a classic wife Grace (Rosanna Arquette) and a small child. She has a sexually addictive and has a sensual sex with any woman in the field of vision that will agree with her every five minutes (and, of course, every woman in the planet considers it irrelevant, though she is old enough to collect Social Protection) <br /> <br /> The story is based on a conversation with her therapist Nastassya Kinski, describing her sexually explicit flashback. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a good starting point to unlock the parade of serial sexual acts that consumes at least 75% of the screen. <br /> <br /> To criticize the film, it is difficult to know where this evil is starting. Production values ​​are bottomless. The film is filmed by watching somewhere between a television soap opera (the best) and amateur porn on someone's garage. Joseph Brouckman's direction is terrible with bad lighting, unsecured frame and poor actor's direction. <br /> <br /> Women are generally described as sexually disadvantaged nymphomaniacs, like Sammy, and ridicule themselves by feeding their unsatisfactory appetites in some untouchable packages. . As an example, Grace's sister comes to frustrate that she knows she is sleeping around and knows her friend. The answer is to throw him over the wall and bring him up. Within three seconds, she has an epiphany and turns her beggar to give her one more of her teens. Grace as they finish it and the fog tells him: "Oh, I'm great to see you, I have to run away for Timmy, my mother is Sammy's superfluous words." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Michael Des Barres presents all the depth of rain water, but it really looks like the disgust and disgust of sexuality, but when it comes to acting with Arquette and Kinski, Rosanna Arquette is the most famous actor in this film. is something close, and eventually a perfect spouse is a delicious animal Nastassja Kinski is very kind as a therapist, but at least there is something here. The rest of the rubble is made up of a high body fertility, who can give you thought-provoking lines that you hit me harder, are you the best? <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen, making a suspicious difference to the thousands of films I have looked at. I gave it a very rare comment on 1/10 rating. It can not be seen within three hours of any meal.
