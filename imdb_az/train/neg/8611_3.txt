When Rodney Dangerfield is in a roll, he is not funny. My 5 Wives, it's not a roll. A liners are off the clock, but they are the best thing for the movie. Five women playing women do not add a single actress to each other. The area is very weak. Sometimes it is too weak; There are several jokes about several wives, but the situation has nothing to do with the movie. Most of the film can be played in the same way as Rodney's single character, so the premise seems more like an old man's fantasy than the main part of the comedy. An old man's fantasy: we must admit Rodney's character is an athletic skier <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller should be a blessing to a friend and her name should be hopeless for the actors. <br /> <br /> In the film, the strange nods of political honesty later do nothing to the film. For those who love the films politically, the non-PC humor remains in the forefront, and there is still no apparent apology for it. <br /> <br /> For those who hate a movie cave as a political honest hate, PC add-ons are just frustrating. <br /> <br /> This is the finest R-rated movie I've ever seen. There are some jokes and the bedroom scenes would make a television that shocked 40 years ago, but about it. Perhaps the top guys were joking. <br /> <br /> DVDs make interviews with the members of the film about their depth and importance. I wondered if they were serious or cheating. They may seem serious, but I thought, "They should have fun!" There is a distinct discrimination since the film is actually nothing after the Mormon or the Church of the Last Day. <br /> <br /> The film does not have a large number of religions in Utah, and it refers to Brigham Young. <br /> <br /> In short, my 5 women were a disappointment. I hope for Rodney a roll, but the good thing I can say for the movie is that Rodney is pretty good for a man pushing in the 80s.
