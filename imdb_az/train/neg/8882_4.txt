It would be very ironic to shoot a ghost film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from the bare naked and ghostly outsider, but here, undoubtedly a combination of GASLIGHT (1939 & 1944) through LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); even if it is delayed, it makes it even clutter to provoke a crash instead of the expected shocks. But in the late 1970s, thanks to the terrible throats of the English film industry, such a mediocre script could have made 10 star names - Cliff Robertson (attractive husband), Jean Simmons Jenny Agutter (Robertson's artist semi-sister), Simon Ward (like a mysterious driver), Ron Moody (a very bad doctor), Michael Jayston (as Robertson's business partner), Judy Geeson (Simmons' best friend and Jayston's spouse), Flora Robson (home worker) , I'm sorry to say that David Tomlinson (Simmons will read the will of a notary) and perhaps the most striking perhaps Jack Warner (like a grave sculptor)!
