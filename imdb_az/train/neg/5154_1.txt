This is the only movie I've never been to. bad behavior - bad conspiracy - bad casting - bad orientation - bad cinematography - if they set out to draw a bad picture, they did not do a better job. Hopefully, we are proud of them in Turkey. I was amazed that everyone involved with this movie was recruited in Hollywood. Do not waste your time!
