It is incredible that it will be terrible at the very level. Scenario, player, leadership and casting choices are amazing. The suits, kits and lying medieval languages ​​are also terrible. I liked this movie strangely, and once I did not think it was good at all. People are so embarrassed that they are doing something so bad that they have done so much of a lot of time and effort, in fact they have produced a very good thing (though this is incredible!), But instead we have all kinds of dragons and charms that do not have the charm of other fantasies that are quite awesome and surprising story of knights. The Lord of the rings is a little better! Oh, and David Thewlis's hair looks like O-Man. It does!
