Look at the original with the same name since 1944! This made for TV movie, only god is terrible! Although almost using the same dialogue (almost all), does not work! Is it a moving, poor management? Okay, it's made for television, but why do you have a bad copy, can you make your hands perfect? In particular, as you hit the pitch, you will not like the original as you watch it first! <br /> <br /> There are a few things (one shorter) than it, but it's all bad! Actors playing parts here do not comply with the bill! You just do not believe them, and who can get out of Edward G. Robinsons's original performance? If you like, just look after the original, and even then you will be very brave, if you watch it! This is almost a loyalty!
