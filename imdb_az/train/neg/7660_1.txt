0's Christian Slater, Tara Reid, Stephen Dorff, Frank C. Turner, Mathew Walker, Will Sanderson. Directed by Uwe Boll. Video game director Uwe Boll is trying to turn the game into a moving nail, unfortunately, it does not succeed. Instead, MADE makes one of the worst movies ever! Despite the small popularity of Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stefen Dorff, the movie is as good as a story line and there are no essential basics of darkness and light. The film splashes around and Uwe Boll is not creative. And not to mention the bad CGI used to make monsters. Although they were cool and look good, it was a bit nude. Honestly, this is one of the worst films. My final rating is 0/10.
