... just look at the poor Robert Webber character (one more performance!) trying to hit the sub-machine gun of one of the terrorists. Everything seems a bit wrong in this movie. In my opinion, the biggest mistake is an attempt to give the key difference to the actuality of the movement in the early 1980s (more fictional, forward and therefore timeless Die Hard). The story is a failure to defeat SAS commandos. "The good guys do it, and all the bad guys do not do that, so that they can explode through the name (good conscience), even though masked comoons do not crush the main character, he clothes the same clothes and takes a weapon from their arsenal it is difficult to accept the film seriously, and it just tries to be more than just fun ... The toilet-mirror-signal episode ... <br /> <br /> It's the pactifist movement's pamphlet for the poor and the peace fanatic and settled, but this kind of political commentary is very small and thirsty because the film is regrettable as early as Judy Davies's early performance, seems to have played a major fanatic role and made extensive research on the subject, yet his performance is a lamp on top of others, I feel the film has dropped it down.
