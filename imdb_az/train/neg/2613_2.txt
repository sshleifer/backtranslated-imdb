It is later thoroughly incomplete, incompatible, and has a "coast" (if it really is one) and is dominated by contemporary (ridiculous, era and characteristic 21st-century style songs) and cute (yawaw: belabroured jokes, produced by most of the animals). Actors in the film are second in the field of youth. Even Glenn sweeps through this movie (and he is usually very good), parodying like the original De Ville and Sunset Boulevard! This is not even a good movie to look at. This is a very good example of a bad and meaningless sequel. Even the Basic Gospel 2 was a plot, characterized by a proper function. It is not. This is bad.
