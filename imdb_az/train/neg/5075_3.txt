The animation was good, though the imagery was absolutely original, but the story was too long, the road was very striking and top dramatic. An hour later, I did not wait to finish it. With many characters to support and build elements that are not coming from anywhere or anywhere, this movie is not really a movie, and a shorter series or perhaps two films would be better. If you like this kind of story, you probably love it, but frankly, I've been exaggerating with more creative stories. Rent the movie Miyazaki and see it twice, and you will get more.
