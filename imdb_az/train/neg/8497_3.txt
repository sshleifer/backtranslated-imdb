<br /> <br /> It is clear to me that a rich culture that is so rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) will produce it as a "nouvelle uncertain" kinematic movement. By the 20th century France had a great tradition of artistic clarity and intelligent philosophy. However, they start behaving like a WOOOHOOO at the moment they give a movie camera. PLOT? THEM? PSHAW! ROUND & ROUND WILL BE ROUND IN AWARDING PARK FESTIVAL! At least this is not as bad as Allahard (Oh-la-la, quel artiste), who has an untouched attraction from the back of the people's leaders. No, Truffaut maintains a visual clarity. But the security camera is also a quickie-mart. <br /> <br /> As I put it aside for all movie art critics: I believe that the vein has hit the side of your neck. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you love French literature, you will hate it. People who love this film have probably not read any books other than Jack Kerouac or the "Hitchhiker Guide for Galaxy". Or maybe they're singing the The Doors songs and they're moving in deeper. Whatever the boat is anywhere. True, Truffles, some of the weakest purchases of this film, Balzac, which is one of the best and most meaningful writers in his life. <br /> <br /> Avoid this film as a helper infected syringe. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who loves to think, then stay <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. And back to your body for the pet. You look like cabbage.
