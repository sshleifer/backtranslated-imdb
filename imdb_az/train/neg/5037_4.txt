Earth = Melissa is a new girl in the city, fifteen years and one birthday comes within a week. <br /> <br /> <strong> Melissa is beautiful, so every guy in the city wants to get in touch with her, but few people die to hide her interests. <br /> <br /> I wanted to watch this movie to be honest. On Friday, Dana Kimmel on Friday, 13th, did not get a reason to go out and see a movie. When I started watching it, I realized that Sweet AltÄ± was not a good slasher, it was really boring and boring, and it did not just go somewhere. More than an hour later, there were only three murders and the story was not developed in any way. <br /> <br /> The film is shot in a beautiful way with photography and good leadership, but with the many other slashers since the 1980s, the film is sometimes very dark. <br /> <br /> The life line is not entirely trash, but it is interesting that it is just too much to care for you <br /> <br /> In some cases, Melissa was the only one interested in me, she was stunning and Dana Kimmel was really cute and cute in this movie. <br /> <br /> All pretty dull flickers that do not go anywhere, I would definitely recommend to Slasher fans.
