I watched this unfaithful area that you lost 2 hours of my life. I can make a better movie with my cellphone. How do these actors manage to play in the movie? <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Even though these players' skills could not adequately raise this movie, the rest just got off! <br /> <br /> The type of film we use to torture prisoners is straightforward. <br /> <br /> Worse, I've seen a translation version of this whisper ... Imagine a bad movie ... with the worst translation ... Yikes!
