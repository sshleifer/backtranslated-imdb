Nobody tries to fit Tom Robbins's book for the screen. Although the film is good and the speeches are good, good conversation readers are bent over talking. Otherwise, no one would think that someone else's name was written on the radio on a pearl. In general, the film, the badly adapted Cliffs Notes on the book - most of the pieces are hacked in one fifth of the book size, background and current story, and the latter is unlike the book (and unpleasant). There are many references to the book, many parts of the book, which means the end of everything, including what the viewer wants to say "Huh". Unfortunately, it was not a decent effort, but a book read by the book read, burned, and all actors set out to do something better. Gus Van Santi admits with great admiration, but even one of his caliber could build a decent film without making a miniature of such a complex book.
