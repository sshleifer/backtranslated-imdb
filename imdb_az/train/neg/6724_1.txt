When choosing a movie, I hope that we will consider a factor, do we have actors who use their fame to influence the moral origins of our society in a positive or negative way? It is not a political statement, but a moral issue that society is effective. When a comedian / actor squeezes sexual and racist statements about a teenager and a father, we should ask ourselves (would I support this behavior)? In this case, Mr. Foxx's behavior is tears in the public domain, in which our youth is mistaken, teaches good behavior to the evil, for love is better than hatred. Mr Foxx should remember that he's just fun, and there's a lot to choose from. Sorry, he does not pull it out of the hinge. It does not hurt or eliminate the bad behavior that has spread to youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop supporting it. They do not see anything that is already part of it. We can not change them, but we can stop our fame.
