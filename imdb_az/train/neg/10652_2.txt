You know Jason, you know Freddy and you know Leatherface. Get Ready Now: Security Pin Killer! Indeed, at Killer Workout, once you see, in a slasher movie, the invisible killer sends his (or) victims a huge, innovative security pin. An explanation is the only choice to make sure that there is something right. Of course, the film will not clarify where the killer gains such a thing. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, the aerobics gym is besieged by a crazy killer and everyone is suspected. In fact, the film gives very little clues about the identity of the murderer, but is a potential murderer in the film until everyone is killed. And so only the killer slaughter of everybody is dead, which is really the process of eradication. <br /> <br /> Aggressive, after all the spill has been exposed, aerobics classes are going on seriously. In fact, nothing is able to stop dancing. Though three people were killed in the next room, the training is under way. Death is even a factor; a character will die, but will still be seen in the next training sessions. <br /> <br /> What is the name of the movie "Killer Workout"? Just like a woman holding a scholarship, I was very upset about the end of the Killer Program. Finally, fortunately, END slammed into the screen. Then what happened? There are shots of the women you are hitting. Even the end of the movie can not stop them! <br /> <br />
