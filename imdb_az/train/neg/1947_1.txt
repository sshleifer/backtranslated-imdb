I'm 17 and I still love most of Scooby Doo movies and old episodes. I love the 1990s, and recently we saw Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo, and Goblin King DVDs being better treated, and I did not expect it to be so good. Anyway, get back! I was watching some episodes, waiting for something very well, but I was not surprised at what I was seeing. Above all, I hate animation. Straight, shoulder and very Saturday afternoon - tomorrow - cardboard was easily the worst feature of the series. Even some of the hateful things I had was a bit better animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby seemed to be aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daph for adding Scooby Doo plus a lot of old episodes. I also hated character changes because Shaggy and Scooby now have something to do with a super hero, movie, or Scooby Doo. show The theme tune was also not very good, and I can not even remember it, and the jokes were bare and bent. There was a lot of talent, there was a good material, and we can confess that the real voices were not as sound as possible to man. As a result, I personally thought it was terrible and I'm not trying to defame it, it's my personal feelings. 1/10 Bethany Cox
