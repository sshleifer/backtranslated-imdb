In the 1960s, a poor German emigrant who struggles to raise his son Raymond (Kodi Smith-McPhee) in Australia plays the autobiographical story called "Romulus, My Father" from Munich. The biggest obstacle to the stability and happiness of the family is that her husband, Christina (Franco Potente), shakes hands with others and breaks wedding ceremonies. Despite his unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to give him a divorce, hoping to return to him one day, torturing himself masochistically. Unfortunately, the beautiful and kind Raimond, who must be witnessing all these marriages, is his memory (Raimond Gaita will grow up to be a writer later). <br /> <br /> Although I'm trying to do what I can to "Romulus, my father," though the film has a good performance and serious intentions, it's just a stand-out story and a strange pacing that leaves viewers desperate and depressed is not enough. A dramatic drama of life is something, but less absurd evidence of adultery, madness, and many suicides (attempting to commit suicide) is something else.
