The opening 5 minutes gave me hope. Meyers proved to be a good idea for the rest of the film. The absolute lowest common denominator humor. A painful look. It's a good job. It is undoubtedly written in less than a week, the first. Hook up Meyers and close him in a cell with Adam Sandler and Will Farrell. And do not give it to him until something worthy of a decent script develops. It's in it. The Austin Powers are just embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Goldmember bumps without scratch.
