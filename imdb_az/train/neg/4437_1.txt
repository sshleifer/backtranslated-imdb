"Love Triumph" is not a victory over anything. This is a great torture, a 4-hour torture. In fact, this was less than 2 hours long, but only longer. I am very disturbed to think about the amateur performances of beautiful players such as Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. Supporting players are not terrific. Maybe they tried to stay upstairs, to be a dressmaker, but if so, I did not even see it. Mira Sorvino does not make an impression or another. He is alone (alone). It's better for me to play the same game that Marivaux wrote 270 years ago or more. It could not have been worse. The writer and director of this film, Clare Peploe, was inspired by the latest production of the game. I do not know what to think when creating a bomb. <br /> <br /> Perhaps he was missing in translation.
