<br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> The film opens with a young man, possibly bearing the name of Hazel Motes, who is steadily returning to the army. <br /> <br /> Traveling to a two-storey house that is in an emergency. Going home, walking around, and finally writing about it. This scene does not come to nothing and we do not learn anything about home or history. <br /> <br /> It's not exactly who this house is or where people go, <br /> <br /> The dream is to go to a city. Why - we do not know. Upon arriving in this city, he writes a name and address he sees on a wall of a bathroom and goes to visit this woman, who is an astonishing fat prostitute. She sees that she waits for a while and then she does not seem anymore. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie, and there is no purpose. <br /> <br /> A young man called Enoch tries to communicate with her, but Hazel is not really interested. <br /> <br /> Enoch is not as crazy as you can get. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the chimpanzee and speak insultingly. <br /> We did not know how much Xano behaved or why the behavior of the dream was <br /> <br /> Enok is then surprised by a dressed man in a gorilla suit and manages to get the gorillas. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus <br /> <br /> I got my impression that I was trying to free myself from the evidence of the religion. <br /> <br /> Even though their relationship with each other does not really do anything, then Khaybar begins to end religious tolerance and hurt himself. <br /> <br /> This is a very strange movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, <br /> 2 stars
