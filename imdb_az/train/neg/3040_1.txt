With a theme like this you know that you have a large number of junk. It behaves badly. The scenario is bad. Director bad. Grammar is bad. <br /> <br /> The film actually sounds a lot of noise and music. The film is a bad racist stereotype. What is the hero of the hero, every movie has drug addiction? Why should a hero always dance to succeed? What should a famous rapper always have in a dance movie? <br /> <br /> Hollywood needs a movie that has a brain capable of stopping the audience and speaking the correct English language. <br /> <br /> Give yourself a blessing and do not see it.
