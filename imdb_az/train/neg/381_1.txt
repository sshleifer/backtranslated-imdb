This film is a traditional bollywood surface up to star energy, feeling and love triangle. The film was about the absurd idea of ​​the surrogate mother who really bothered me about this movie. A brothel who has a child with a child (the child's desire to have a family) has a relationship with a man, but not a mother. What she is a good candidate for the surrogate mother. 10 and 15 years ago, I saw indian cinema and television shows that resolved this issue in a more intelligent manner. The whole concept of the film is ridiculous and completely impossible. I do not mean that many Bollywood movies are logical, but they are not the same. This movie wants to emote with symbols, but it can not be done with such a ridiculous, contradictory confrontation. It would be better than Abbas and Mustan.
