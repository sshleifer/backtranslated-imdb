This "movie" is such a bad job! Nothing seems to be even tried and realistic. The field is weak, functioning - miserable, actors are working hard to avoid any kind of luck since the beginning of the year. What a flop! Spend time, money, and effort on everyone, including the audience. Well, as with any tension, there are murders, corpses and bloodshed here. Just a few minutes ago, take a look at a person who has committed a crime with a knife and keep quiet and smiling, and do not say it as a pure whistle, as done by a virtual agent that cuts one's throat. And this murder would have been done by a small, brave woman on a very strong man, and she cut her throat! He asked if he had to bend down for him? The same kind of foolishness continues and curiously abandoned the audience that there was a joke that only appeared to be a bad thing. Sustainability is another problem: for example, the hot girl lying in bed, waiting for the sister to come out of the bathroom and sleeping long afterward (!!!). One more scene, entering the reception area of ​​the younger unit, opens the way to lead the scenery! Is Not Against The Last Night? They spend so much time writing and writing about the "movie" that is so low.
