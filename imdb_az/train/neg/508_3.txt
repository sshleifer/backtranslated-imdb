D.W. an early movie run by. Griffith; a glorious happy King (Arthur V. Johnson) and the Queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the king leaves the scene, the Queen is making music with the palace's Minstrel (Henry B. Walthall). When the King found those who loved, he decided to take a terrible act of revenge for the Edgar Allen Poe. It is difficult to believe that Valentine's not listening to them; actors alternatively try to look at noisy and quiet (cement mixers). Sets puts the "Sealed Room" on the stage. The performances are good and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
