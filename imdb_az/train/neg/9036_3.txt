I do not believe you have spent my time watching this garbage! Because Leonard Maltin rated "AA" and for television movies, this is usually a good indicator of some cool entertainment. <br /> <br /> The act was good, but to any person who needs to go to the printer forever. The area is ridiculous, the motivation of "bad guys" is not completely different, and the different families are mutually exclusive and unobtrusive. For example, Father propagates that a severe reaction to aggression is a BAD, but not because of the "ignorance of deceptive" philosophy, but because of its good tuxedo, it is a "worthy" man. <br /> The only message collected from this pope is that the nuclear family is good and alternative living facilities are bad. Good and bad people are good for people.
