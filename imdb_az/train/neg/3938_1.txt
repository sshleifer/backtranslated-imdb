Even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could not save this dead fish from the film. Scripts for beginners were written for B-movie, but Duchovny (looking for a star on television) and Hutton ("one-two punch" added that he hopes his career after the "People") . Cheesy lines, the great wet napkins (Hadi - the angels who use the class after the class of telecommunications class) on the stage scene, and the plain old bad motion film. Even Duchovny is not immune to this bad film, which is a film. Only Timotey Hutton climbs all the material. I need to feel the pain of Duchovni, he reads the noise lines. When I was convinced that the author did not want to terrify me, he did not prepare me to complete Duchonvey's voices: "If you need a doctor, call 911." If only the studio called 911, this dog would never be created. Avoid all costs. <br /> <br />
