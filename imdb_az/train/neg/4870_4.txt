The movie is bad. There is nothing special - there's nothing serious about just a "kid" movie. Although there is one reason to follow: animal talk. Some of them say it's funny and you can not stop laughing. So you want to hear "I'm Keyser Sose," or another animal that says, "You are a dead cat" and you want to hear a lot of other funny liners. Because there is no good movie to watch. Sound: From 10 to 4.
