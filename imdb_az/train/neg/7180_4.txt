This is a regular budget movie for the genre director Honda (usually with more accurate sets)? although the special effects have a different irritability to them (be sure to witness the huge bats and rodents). He also uses the striking number of American actors: The visionary scientist Joseph Cotten appears mistaken and fragile (but then his character is likely to be 204 years old), a harmless Richard Jaeckel photographer, as chief hero, Cesar Romero and Patricia Medina (both camps ). As I often said, I was watching English-language movies in Italy, but hearing of Hollywood actors in Japan is something else! <br /> <br /> LATITUDE ZERO feels like a younger version of a typical Jules Verne adventure, and it's pretty fun at this level; Indeed, thanks to this brown charm of Honda, the lower brow variations dominate the monsters-on-the-rampage formula in this case. Is there a theft of a well-known scientist by Romero? he was planning to establish himself in a submarine, technically advanced city developed by Cotten (employed by the world's foremost minds). The rival subs is treating many silly battles, but the most entertaining scenes, of course, are raid on the Romero cave? In fact, Cotten has a small number of blonde physicians in the jacket and in the jacket of the 1960s, the Cotten, in the wheel suits (through gloves and flames!) Romero, the other bigger, his element more? Helps with Asia, On the other hand, Romero is flanged by an Oriental femme fatale? But the end of her quest for raw material (the brain's brain is finally transformed into a lion and condor hybrid, among the most spectacular creatures you've ever seen!) As you can see, one of the streets of Media Blasters today has 2 discs!
