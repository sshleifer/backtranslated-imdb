<br /> <br /> After the death of longtime friend John Belushi, his first film, Aykroyd, is very fatigued to draw a character that would be a surprise to Belushi. <br /> <br /> Instead, "Doctor Detroit" masquerading us as a booklet professor Aykroyd but a strange, severe pimp that protects an opponent known as my mother. It's bad enough, but she also has classes to host a dinner for the school, to protect the four ladies of the evening, and to attend a Pimp Dinner (or something like that). Aykroyd could not surprise most of the time. <br /> <br /> In this film, Aykroyd was introduced to his future wife, Donna Dixon. <br /> <br /> At least a good thing came out of this chaotic confusion. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. If you're good Aykroyd, see "Blues Brothers". You're bad, see "Doctor Detroit."
