Another major assassination attempt to blame the US government and the Armed Forces (especially the Army) for every disaster since the Great Flood. Everyone who has never served the US Army sees how this film is fraudulent. Uniforms, equipment, sets and behaviors are completely inaccurate. (And of course, all Headquarters are either corrupt criminals or general immorality.) Clear propaganda, not an attempt to be objective. Most of the theories have been proven in the past few years. He uses every clich√©, rumor and city legend from the Gulf - all as the Gospel. (Of course, some GW veterans are sick and others are as healthy as horses). PS This is not new. The war is not entertaining, and I know many serious illnesses, World War II, Korean and Vietnamese vets. (And the government is responsible for paying attention to all that). Such scenario films do not solve the problem!
