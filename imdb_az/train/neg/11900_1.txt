How nice. A film about a US visitor is probably half a day, one day a piece, and he considers himself a "expert" in the country. Sheesh. I do not go to Germany for a week, then come back and take a film about Germany as a "Nazi conquest". Wim IL boy must come together with Lars von Trier and make a ULTIMATE film about Americans. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all know that to make a "real" movie about America, "we are the world" throws Europe's ambitious left. <br /> <br /> Yes, thanks. <br /> <br /> For a continent that does not start the first two world wars, Europe has many views on America's wrong foreign policy. <br /> <br /> P.S. Do not ask, Wim IL kid, UC-Berkeley Americans have many, so we just love your movie. Of course, these are those who think George W. Bush is worse than Hitler, and a souvenir painting is a "genius genius"!
