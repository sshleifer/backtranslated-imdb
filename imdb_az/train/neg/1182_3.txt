This film is made poorly, the fetish is less porn and it is a lot of things that are considered to be similar to that made at that time. It was recommended by my friend as a "unique film experience". He was right. I think he was like a joke. Not crushed, even if it does not fall into shock. Only mediocre movements and poor attitudes in shock art. Although the cost of the camp is a little bit high, this is what the film makers say. And yes, as with the previous review, a bear is a sex with a boy. Do not spend too much money on it. If you see it, try to borrow. Otherwise I would be happy to sell my image at half price. <br /> <br /> I have to see another movie of a certain director. But if there is anything like this, I still regret that my 2-hour life has gone forever.
