Sincerely, I do not consider this movie to be another effort by the Dominican Film Industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie is a little laughable, but then the film falls when a person's role changes in society (usually men are usually doing what women are doing). Do not be foolish and funny. It puts many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predicted. Roberto Angel has also played his character and his little ones. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, I hope to do a good job, but I'm really disappointed.
