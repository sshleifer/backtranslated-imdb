Ed was very pleased with Norton's face up to his hair. Without having to disclose any plot detail - at noon he built a bearded sport, but the beard went to the same evening and became a very luxurious mustache. She was full of beard than her mustache. Then, on a dark night, he went out with an open mustache and he came out of the air. It was in a state where there was no choice to stop shaving. The discrepancies in this sustainability completely distracted me from the rest of the film and broke its reliability as before. Also, I found a long cowboy scene on the bed, a reminiscent of a taxi driver in De Niro. Despite being respectful, it is very thick for this viewer.
