Shame on Rumin's brilliant group talking about writing together somewhere, perhaps even for MediocreLand? "PP" reminds me of a very tedious, hopeful one who was previously aware of David Kelly (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal) during the season. The naked cases they get are very strange, but they simply cause ghosts or sorrows. And, of course, good tricks make tricks - feelings that you may be scared of dramatic situations. They are not funny either. <br /> <br /> Actors are pretty good, but the cunning lines are dead and can not be returned. I am a therapist and let me know - Amy Brennan plays the most inadequate, unethical, inexperienced therapist. Those who wrote were abolished ethics and transfer / recycling courses at Stanford. Someone should give them Code of Ethics to read (nose bleeding partner episode and therapist work). No therapist is so bad. <br /> <br /> Envy for men who have acted in action has resulted in death, and we all have finished "Sex and City". Addison is unusual in a youthful aggression against his beloved boy - over the age of 40, and this is another talented actress who does not believe in himself and does not deliver it very well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <strong>
