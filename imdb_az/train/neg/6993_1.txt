What a terrific movie. I do not believe my life is watching this reconstruction for 90 minutes. Why Ving Rhames and Mehki Pfifer played in this movie? Mehdi is great in Pfifer E.R. and Ving Rhames did not know what he was doing. I'm scared of them. In the background of music, say ALLLLL is not in line with the story, and you can find those directors who are totally unrealistic in creating a good and balanced film. Hopefully, in the future, no director is so terrific that he can destroy such a great classic film. This film should not be prepared in the first place. <br /> <br /> <strong> "BOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10 to 10.
