It is a film that reflects the fear of the D & D in the 1980s (even today). Fear of people playing D & D (or any other role-playing game) will "come true" and lose the ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and kill, child victims, suicide, etc.). Everyone who wants to blame the problems of the society in lifeless objects sees a great movie, but a game playing, a video game, or anyone playing in a game sees it as an insult to his intelligence. Wargames are what D & D is for computers. Now as a movie, kinda only sucks.
