This movie has not been programmed in Italian cinemas, I have seen this as a "fantafestival" .I have some fear that it is ridiculous because some of the scenes are chaotic and dark in music videos, and the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculous and there is no doubt. movie I have no words to describe music completely out of the story and to describe visual effects. When you look at the first scene, the movie looks interesting, but after a few moments. Story is interesting, but development needs to be fully reviewed.
