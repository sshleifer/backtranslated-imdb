<br /> <br /> This movie could have been really something special. "28 days later" or "Blair Witch Project". <br /> <br /> I was really excited about the first 20 or few minutes of the movie, I did the right thing with filmmaking and mastering, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <strong> Ancient Sayings> In this movie, our "hero" is an unhappy piece, and do not really worry if he or she does not die. As many people have said before, I have rooted the homeless and the black boy. He could give me a giggery or two (whether intentional or not). <br /> <br /> The main villain is kept in the dark for the first half of the film, but I was truly disappointed when it appeared. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that a 10-year-old brother may be defeated in wrestling. <br /> <br /> All this is another mediocre horror. simple Hollywood formula. There was a lot of potential in this film, but it really did not reach the brand. <br /> <br /> In order to emphasize how naked this movie is, the characters of this movie have ended at least five times and killed the main murderer. HIS PROMISE.
