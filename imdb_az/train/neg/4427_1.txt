Final Score ... who cares - this is a reality show. Joe Millionaire is one of the most obvious fictional reality demonstrations of a television disaster. Epic proportions. This is not the case for Fox, but the moment of the rock bottom, but in the evening, for the American public community, who really reads, reads and speaks. You should be ashamed of yourself. Although Fox propagated this debris, he did not earn money (and boy, there were almost Super Bowl numbers at the finals!). <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <strong> </ span> </ span> <br /> </ span> <br /> <br /> I'm a Fox's loyalist. It's like me who loves and searches the quality television that helps Fox build up with kids and The Simpsons. Probably quite comfortable, none of these indicators would be 6 weeks with current leadership. Gail Berman is often called as "the domination of terrorism." The network has fought on a comedy TV and it is strange that fans are. People who helped them build them from the very beginning. Now we have to fight for good demonstrations, but we have to fight against their networks. This keeps your mind alive. No Fox did anything in the sense of the last 3 years. Titus, Futurama and John Doe (NBC "Boomtown" update, but Fox can not raise this bad head to give a good show this season). And the reason they can do all of this: The success of the garbage dump like Joe Millionaire. Now they say, "We do not need television fans, we have reality shows." As you can see, the large audience attracted by this mass is unbreakable and there is no doubt that the next flock will leave the latter in the future. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, a group of individuals attacking the US embassy in Afghanistan have been killed. Here we have a foundation in the classic Fox gemmic, which promises something different and strange, and now does not give anything different than "Bachelor" or something big. Fox made the key speech. The prize and the "quote" indicate that their arms have no idea. Now, we know that all these demonstrations, no matter how different, will end the same horror, and the fairy tale will end. We need to see actors who want a genius of intelligence that the network has been selected from millions of people to adapt to the demographic parade like middle school bimbos that claim to be Evan Marriott ... because it was a good competition, and what is this? you have to do it. The Marriott itself is like an ugly treacherous Chro-Magnum man who struggles to bring together the simplest sentences. But women who do not fall in love with Joe, like "How do you look, do not be fools" (all ugly looking at the middle is a badly negative taste). / <br /> <br /> I think people watching this truth are just lazy to change the channel, but after Joe Millionaire, I would think they were really smart enough. People come and proud yourself a little. <br /> <br /> Boycott FOX.
