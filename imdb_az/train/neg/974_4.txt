The film sounded as though it were entertaining and interesting from its description. But it was a bit lower for me. It's too slow to watch and see what's going on. The film was merged with individual films, and they were merged in the air and connected to each other (not necessarily in sequence). In addition, no results were obtained. I've seen very few Korean movies and realized that a good part of it looks good and requires a reflection on the part of the audience that is different from the typical Hollywood movie. But that did not end me. I was watching the movie for the second and third time and still did nothing for me. I still do not know what the filmmaker is trying to do. If only one person showed a typical secular part of his life, I think he had succeeded. But I'm looking for more. Undoubtedly, I can not recommend this movie to anyone.
