This is one of the dirtiest films of the 90s. If it's a better thing to do, I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This picture presents African Americans as wild, non-invasive, intolerant, inarticulate, smoking-like sociopaths. Fudge (Ice Cube) and its homosexuals are constantly disrespecting others in the country, not just white people, but also Asian people, as well as their discipline. Despite all this tolerance, weeping and crying over those who continue their lives and who are in the path of evil ghosts. In fact, Fudge's influence causes Remmy to contact her skinheads, come out of college, and kill Malik's girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Skinheads stay away from the campaign and generally stay away from everyone. They never burst their music to make people worry and do not insult the police. <br /> <br /> This film has many material, which is almost annoying. or giggled me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Professor, professor of Qafqaz University, says: "One should assume that the weeds are financially related. Although they are pupils who seem to be a particular university, they can not properly line up in English. Their symbols are developed exclusively by compulsive whine and xenophobia. <br /> <br /> Drunk Kristen (Kristy Swanson) knew exactly why Billy's drunken home was taken home. He even wanted to get a rubber to begin. Without a condom, something that he had penetrated into was aggression, but if there were too many sexes, he would be alone. Later, Kristen Taryn (Jennifer Connely) was not responsible for this and jumped to a boy's bed, making sure she was not ready for sexual intercourse, and that she had been exploited by her predator. After a week or so, he came together and slept in a sleepy dream of an ultra-sensitive gift that could not be weakened and brought to condoms. The director emphasized contraceptive. <br /> <br /> This film is full and totally garbage, whipped by black people and making women look foolish and fragile. The accents of Cole Hauser's player and Laurence Fishburne are the only reasons I can think of watching him. The writer / director is obviously a limited intelligence. Limit yourself by watching this shit, but take into account that neurons are not left behind. Just follow the advice and UNLEARN at the end.
