I apologize to the fans of this movie, but it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Slow, bad casting and bad behavior is a failing film to get rid of trailers that have been killed in recent years! McDonald and Parker are unable to deliver real emotions and are lifeless. It looks like they are for any payment checks they have received for them, not because they think it's a good idea. Area DULL! I love great chicken movies like the next girl, and this is not one! This year, if you are afraid of a movie ....
