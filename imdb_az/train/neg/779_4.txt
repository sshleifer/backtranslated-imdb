Seriously, very seriously, I must say that for the first time I started watching the show was good. But the fields have become worse. This story was either too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, and sometimes it is foolish. He has a lot of jokes. His mother is the most characteristic feature of the show. How could the mother behave in such a way that her son would have her daughter in law, but that was her son. This show is only 4/10 because the first few show was a little laughable. Actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha are doing a great job. Do not tell us how these demonstrations will take so long. <br /> <br /> If you were bored like I was and would have nothing to watch, I'd suggest to watch it.
