The "F.1P" curve means "Floating Platform # 1". The film reflects the construction of F.P.1 in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean to use as a "weather station" for transatlantic flights. Based on the modern Curt Siodmark novel; In Germany, "F.P.1 antwortet nicht" (1932), "I.F.1 ne re√©pond plus" (1933), and in English "F.P.1" (1933). Soon, technology has made the non-stop ocean journey even more superior. <br /> <br /> Star Conrad Veidt (like Ellissen), Jill Esmond (like Droste) and Leslie Fenton (like Claire) find and throw in love and sabotage the Atlantic platform. Carl Hartl headed. Mr. Veidt is most entertaining to watch; but it is not convincing in the "love triangle" with Esmond and Mister Fenton. Young co-stars were Laurence Olivier and Ann Dvorak, respectively. Both concepts and movies were not aging. <br /> <br /> **** F.P.1 (4/3/33) Karl Hartl Conrad Veidt, Jill Esmond, Leslie Fenton
