Now, I do not deny that I had high expectations when I bought this eBay. It was a work that I loved from a comedy master. But soon I was disappointed. I do not want to apologize to those who love it, but I found Compleat Al to be very difficult to watch. I have a little smile, but most comics came from music videos (there is a DVD) and the rest are mostly filler. You can say that Alin is not the biggest video achievement (the honor goes to UHF). Honestly, I suspect you will pass through this DVD, so you're an ultra-hardcore Al fan and just get everything from the tape on eBay. Do not give too much money for this.
