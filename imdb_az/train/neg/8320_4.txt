After watching the scene, I came to the conclusion: director and screenwriter Joby Harold organized Awake with a laugh to the audience because the scenario is full of ridiculous elements of the movie. absurd and ridiculous elements (for example, the hospital uniform uses the main character ... puts a doctor's dreams?) The concept behind this film was a bit skillful, but all the holes and unfortunate things are a stupid and malevolent film. Except for Big Lena Olin, all actors bring bad spots. Hayden Kristensen has zero expressions and is the same for Jessica Alba. Extraordinary actress Terrence Howard is very profitable rol.Awake makes the audience a laugh. It is very ridiculous and absurd stuff full of things that can not be taken seriously. My recommendation: skip this malignant movie.
