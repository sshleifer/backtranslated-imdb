Could it be interesting? a story from a Japanese home in the eyes of a newly-formed American family? <br /> <br /> This film suffers from the popular modernization of those native hikes, the problem I face. the spirits show themselves to be worse than any real reason other than what is expected! Besides, this does not give much in the scary section? a giant crab attack is simply silly? in general, spirits live in a special character, and Susan George's diplomats / family-friend Doug McClure and Edward Albert escape from power and cause her to have a full cup of herbal soup soup! <br /> <br /> At one point, an old clergyman returns home to alert Albert to stay there? Finally, he was summoned to take out the buildings. But history has to repeat itself and the tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation that has been set up properly? Albert and McClure, despite the intensity of the souls of the Japanese predecessors, leads to an unwanted funny climb, dancing to a deadly karate duel! At the end of the day, this is a sinful time. only 88 minutes are unbearable, but in no way follow basic.
