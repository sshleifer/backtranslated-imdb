Why did I wonder when I was being broadcasted? Why did Dianne Keaton accept this trash? The film uses trivial, contradictory ground lines to bring trash home to thousands of people. The film is a political agenda for a new level. The film was meaningless and all the credibility disappeared over the stereotype. <br /> <br /> It was clear that Keaton was trying to make this film worthy, but in the end, it's time to remember the old name of the age that you can not stand in one round. Hopefully, do not expect that you are preparing another movie for a new movie for your new year. Now we know the networks are starting to get rid of the trash in the morning on Sunday evening!
