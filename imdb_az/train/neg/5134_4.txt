CONTRACTS are a horrible horror. A group of thieves fears a robbery robbery in Camp Pendleton, California. They coincide with the request to blow a pilot and a cargo aircraft that they steal from their daughter in Mexico. On the way, a greedy robber decides to save money on an area controlled by strange fearers. These are not just a fugitive fear ... they can kill. Acting is better than a terrible dialogue. And the humor aspects are not funny. <br /> <br /> The event features Ted Vernon, Michael David Simms, Christina Sanborn, BJ Turner, Phil Zenderland and Victoria.
