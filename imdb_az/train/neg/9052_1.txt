I acknowledge that this is a very popular show. However, compared with the 1970s, when Robert Altman's creative, sad, rich and groundbreaking film classics, this show is likely to be less-than-average ... If it continues for 11 years, it will definitely not do any good . This show was an integral part of my early childhood (every night she was working and her parents were watching her and laughing), but I'm one of those memories. Now, when I see the movie, I can give a clear criticism of this series. It is not bad at "about 10". However, the characters in this show are not like the movie. Some are technically identical, but they are only named. For example, when Alan Aldan is something like Donald Sutherland? Her humor style is completely different, her characteristic and outlook. New characters are not so great; they serve to miss what you are replacing. New actors (including Jamie Farr) are identical. In fact, the only thing that goes into the series is still a pale imitation of the original, even if played by the same actor. Otherwise? Oh, yes. With a laughter trail (not being used on surgery scenes or not important), it is creepy because of what happened in other settings. And almost four times as much as the actual Korean War, it leads the audience to this strange temporal slopes, which does not work outside of the cartoon world. I have never liked this show and never wanted it.
