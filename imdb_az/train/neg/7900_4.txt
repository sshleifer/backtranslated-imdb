The main creatures opened fire in a peaceful little desert city. This is basically the whole surface for the film, and the scenes dedicated to them are slightly fun (in any way downhill), and the rest is just filling and filthy. A painful Woody Allen wannabe from the "hero" to the ultra-nonsense city police is hard to pick up the most annoying character in the film. At times, they were all on the screen and I thought: "Okay, at least my darling beloved, but why do we have to agree with the rest of this moron?" The film is also packed with pop-ups (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), probably in the early 90's. (* 1/2)
