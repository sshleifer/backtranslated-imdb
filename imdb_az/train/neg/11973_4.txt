This is probably one of the worst films I've ever seen in over 100 French movies I've ever seen. Terrifying scenarios and very mediocre / non-professional leadership lead to weakness. <br /> <br /> One of the main weaknesses of this film is not the fact that these two characters are not attracting people. I did not care what would happen to the audience. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at how this film won the jury award in Cannes, man, and I just love all the premium films in Cannes, but that's not it. A great disappointment for me.
