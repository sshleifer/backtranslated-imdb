The film is a little tiring. It's mostly a silent movie, a massive story provided through a series of sound-overs. Making a silent film is not such a bad idea, it is one of those films that lacks the dialogue and is simply exhausted by recurring early scenes. You do not understand the cause of misery, and it is too late. The first 40 minutes of the movie is a slow Mexican secret porn and something unique to it is porn. Then the first 40 minutes of the movie became known, but it's too late, because the audience is missing. There are several beautiful locations in Mexico's National Autonomous University. I often wondered why more films were not shot. Many of the campus campus has been built on the edge of the lava beds that provide worldly feelings. The biggest problem with the film is that the filmmaker / writer wanted to see the film, regardless of how he viewed a film that did not know the story. When you tell a story, you do not see the audience.
