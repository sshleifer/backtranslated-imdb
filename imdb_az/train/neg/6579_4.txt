"New Best Friend" - another entry in the sub-genre "Steal another woman's life"; the best ones are "Holy White Woman" and "The Five Handle Rock"; It is bad that you can linger almost every day on the Canal for lifetime. For some reason, this identity theft only for women. <br /> <br /> There are only two main ways to play this type of story. You can make the woman's worst and explain to her that her viewers are misguided and that she is using her bad style. Otherwise you use the wrong way to look like a good person because it breaks a series of unplanned events that are invisible to the climatic scene until it is explained to be bad. Unfortunately, the manufacturers of "New Best Friend" could not decide how to play it, and that everything was crashing and burning early. Initially, alicia (Mia Kirshner) and the financial aid department of the college were deceived by scholarships. We now know that he is a bad man and he will be able to watch all his activities suspiciously. But the director and editor forgot to forget that this conscience was forgotten and that Alicia spent the next 50 minutes misleading to think that she was a good man. <br /> <br /> The "new good friend" has suffered the most. <br /> <br /> The "new good friend" is most vulnerable to loss. a very old casting young film cursory to describe high school students. There are really only two major parts: Hadley (Meredith Monroe) and Alicia (Kirshner). The production time was 31 and 26, respectively. He plays Alicia's spectacular version for 26-year-old Kirchner, but becomes noticeable when it comes to Alicia's glamed-up version. Monroe's casting is just a joke, as Nicholette Sheridan is trying to pass as a classmate on "Lizzie McGwire." <br /> <br /> Taye Diggs, who plays the Caucasus City Sheriff, is more than a majority of students smaller. <br /> <br /> The main structure, Haddley and Dominque Swain-21 and Rachel True, are watching two colleagues at the age of 35, colleagues at the college. They share a better and better equipped palace than a mosque in the city of Real University, New Orleans, a more convincing place than a soccer game hosted by students. Alicia moves in the kiosk, and Hadley begins to die. At least this is how Swain finally becomes a roommate of her own generation, so it can be a scene from two lesbians. Swain's supportive performance is "New Best Friend" and his scene with Kirshner is just a good thing, not fitting any of the other spots, because it's cool and great, perhaps a subordinate and cinematographer of a good director. <br /> <br /> An unsettling anxious story is presented in a series of awful warnings of sex and persistent parties that begin with a comedy Alicia shot at the hospital bed. About half of Kirshner's half of the screen remains inactive with a pipe. <br /> <br /> Then what do I know again? I'm just a kid.
