What does this topic mean? The character of Marlee Matlin was always angry, very nasty and very sad. His character was the first mood of William Hurt's dance character. In general, I tried to watch my movie four times and slept four times. I watched this movie with an intention ... to beat my problem with sleeplessness, because all this encourages me to sleep. Sweet dream.
