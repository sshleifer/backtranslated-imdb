Another Priyadarshan / Vohra flashed a movie that was more popular than the real desire for the TP, the only reason you saw this movie is that regulars are not in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others) <br /> <br /> There were fewer expectations from this movie. <br /> <br /> Generally I enjoyed the cast, except Rajpal Yadav has not opened borders again, but he makes some laughs, but this is the original jokes, in fact, this whole movie plays dhol, and I can almost say noise Does it take any talent to do, or even a little time dhol alone plays a good push? <br /> <br /> Dumroo is not difficult to demand any talent, no change, and for some time, monkey dances (like Rajpal Yadav, a good analogy sounds like it), but it's not a tool for a long time to dance or dance like Dhol. <br /> <br /> This film has played dhol and dumroo, sometimes Dhol sometimes plays dumroo, sometimes bringing together, but mainly Dumroo just played and danced on the monkey. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ Strong> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> and indeed very funny)). <br /> <br /> This movie has moments, actors have done a good job, except Rajpal Yadav (who may be, I saw him in Mary Patney) <br /> <br /> Some scenes were really funny. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were really funny. <br /> <br /> But this event was put to use after the end of the event, but the attempts to surprise the daughters of the girls, such as attempts to kill and remove her daughter. <br /> <br /> I want to say that an attempt to make this movie more than a mystery, is that the girl is increasingly tortured by the following 45-60 minutes if she is inside the girl <br /> <br /> This movie can also be extremely predictable, there is a scene that you can not guess and you will not let spontaneous burst of laughter. <br /> <strong> <br /> </ p> <p style = "text-align: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> old and recurring repeat, especially in the last 10-15, and absolutely this MOVIE.
