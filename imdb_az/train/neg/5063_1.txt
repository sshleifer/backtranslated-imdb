Horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Some of Flanders' best actors and actresses are shocked by such a sad film. <br /> <br /> There is something different from the first movie and television series: the same actors, the same prototype characters, the same scenario (emotional pressure, the team under emotional pressure, but everything comes out of the tip-top after the predictable grand finale) . Another constant fact in Jan Verheyen's case is the placement of the product (the company logo is over the team's form and side-by-side, but the internet provider is twice above the commercial (one of the characters). <br /> By the way, Flanders is a commercial television is a rumor to make a second series for the station 'VTM' (accidentally, Jan Verheyen's programming manager for several months) <br /> To finish ... and the golden raspberry award for the worst foreign film.
