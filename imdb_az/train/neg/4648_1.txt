This is a bad B movie like a dignified masquerade. The porn film has nearly a dozen screenshots and dialogues as a feature film. <br /> <br /> The film is actually in need, and there is really no problem. The movie is not funny. The movie is not sexy. There is nothing in the film to talk about pornography. Not particularly foolish. <br /> <br /> There is a sexual sex, although the amount of nakedness for the film R is softer. <br /> <br /> One day someone will be a good mockormen related to the porn industry. It is not.
