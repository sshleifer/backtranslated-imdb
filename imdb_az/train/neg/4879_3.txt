Is there anything worse than a humorous comedy movie? Answer Yes; no interest in the picture. <br /> <br /> This is a pure front man for an illegal business - a potatoes with a bad script and scenario, and it just does not work. 1942? It's hard to imagine. The only positive aspect of the picture is Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as a weaker person who killed Gary Cooper). <br /> <br /> "In the life of a Bengal Lancer," so I do not count it ). <br /> <br /> Could not recommend it and gave it 3 degrees - get a root canal if you have a choice.
