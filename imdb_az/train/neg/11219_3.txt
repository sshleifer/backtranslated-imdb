It was a film about loyalty and revenge. A twin sister with a twin relationship feels that something is wrong. This movie remained eternal for the plot. A multi-story plot. Most of the players were bad. Once the movie comes together, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins who live with an aggressive father. Father loves Ashley, Father Laura gets all the blame. There is a saying that girls will never be separated, but as they grow older, they take their lives in different directions. Ashley gets an overnight job when she meets Barry's married man. Of course, it does not have any benefit. Barry's tinnitus is a way to get his trail. We remembered that this film was better and that it was waiting for a decision, but it never happened.
