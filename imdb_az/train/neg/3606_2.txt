This movie is the worst movie, but it's too high for me. How to have a Slasher movie. This occurs only at a university where there are only a few students. Teachers are doing more than a sack of sacks. This is a good Catholic monk, full of sexual humorous humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so intensified that it is difficult to believe that I have predicted price lines. These lines have some creativity and appear to turn around stabbing people of the same sex. The film is characterized by a lack of continuity in film music and deserving to die because they are so bad that this movie is for fun. Take a cheap beer and some friends, watch and laugh.
