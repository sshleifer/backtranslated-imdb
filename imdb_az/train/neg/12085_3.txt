Indeed, these little glances should start with a plot summary. I would like to say that Shakespeare's Hamlet is for good. Perhaps one of the best-known works is written. I'm not ashamed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet because most IMDb people have? Through Mystery Science Theater 3000. Although the show may not be the best place to use to judge a movie, I can not imagine trying to watch this comedy without quips. In short, this television version of the German language prepared for Hamlet is angry. 152 minutes? In no way! It is very dark and suffers from being something I want to spend about three hours. I have said this a few times, but fun is something for me. This part of the wrist is far from entertaining. But I'm going to give you some points for a few good-looking feelings. <br /> <br /> As we enjoy MST3K, their comments do not help Hamleti to enjoy it. There are a few good riffs here and there, but in general, Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is talking very much to allow comedy to have any rhythm or stream. Although it is very painful to me, Hamleta gives 1/5 to my MST3K rankings.
