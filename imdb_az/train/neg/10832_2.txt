Normally I do not have a problem with movies alone, but it really bothered me. All they have promised. For all movies. (And, as noted by others, obtaining cancer) It was boring, curly, and ambitious. I would not have been if you were. <br /> <br /> I also did not like it, not to love movies. I love Drinking Drink Women and all that happens is the life of a Taiwanese people. But I could belong to them. I did not know anyone who wrote in this movie as "actors" and worked in a construction site. So go figure. William H. Macy turned me into his heart. Once. <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid using Tedium.
