I can vigilante flicker of a sinful taste, but it's just bad. It's not a bad thing to like to see MST3K. No matter how difficult it is, you will not find anything to enjoy it, but it's just nausea. I spend 2 hours of valuable life on this jealousy. You can see that nobody wants to act and that everyone knows that this movie just backs his career. As you can see, "Trip Excitement" has earned enough income so that anyone can get a direct investment from their investment. If it is not the worst movie I've ever seen, it's so bad that I've overlooked the bad movies in my memory.
