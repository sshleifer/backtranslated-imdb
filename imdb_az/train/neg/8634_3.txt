Lucio, who had seen a photo of a man exposed to the zombie attack, hoped Zombi could be up to the old tricks of Fulci. Unfortunately, besides the corpse of a corrupt body, it is very rare to recommend the search for a daughter to find out in this story of a rich man's murder and his daughter's murder. None of the heroes are attractive and do not care when you understand what they did (this twist is at least cool). We can say that a good thing has been more meaningful than the Nightmare Concert!
