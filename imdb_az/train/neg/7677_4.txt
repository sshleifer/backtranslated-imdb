I stopped watching Mom-Lucia and Libby's deaths were unnecessary and lost in this episode because I thought it was really staggering. Then I learned that they were keeping Libby around to die in the next section! Gah! <br /> <br /> I liked the first season of this season, but in the second season, definitely diminished, and I felt a bit worried about Jack and Locke's little religiousness. Rodriguez & Watros's death was the last straw! <br /> <br /> I give this episode 4/10, the legend of Alias ​​J.J. This is the end of my previous great series, created by the. Abrams. Hopefully his series will be so good in the future.
