The small minorities here are praised for this film. At the end of the day, I know people's personal thoughts, but everyone who is more than a few brain cells sees that it's completely trash. It's so bad that it's not right to be part of this franchise. I only think of those who say I am a friend of mine and try to push their career. Do not bind people in every way, weakly, otherwise. Storyline is a weakening of previous records, and the scenario is the same. Instead, attempts to hide her originality by using a girl (WOW!) Do not conceal the lack of film makers and, unfortunately, there is a complete lack of fear. Absolutely no irreplaceable qualities, utter turd. This lucky pair simply gave an estimate of the fact that they just received a badge to borrow a lump sum. They must make more effort than to make the film a reality. Shame.
