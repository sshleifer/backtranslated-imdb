What's going on? This terrible movie was the first time I remembered and last time I finished my computer. Following the classic classics of the first film, Elm St. Nightmare went down pretty much, but everyone doubts that this terrible aberration is expected. <br /> <br /> The worst ANOES movie in this film is that no one is waiting for this cosmic joke of the film. It does not look so bad from the beginning, it's a real creepy intro and a long shower scene with Alice. But then we were at the bottom right at the beginning, with a consistent sequence of events and bad things. Almost Freddy's films are intended to be fictitious and creepy, but this is like a train accident in the poverty line of events and the horrific field structure. It feels as if you're having a terrible headache, not as you are afraid. That is, the directive is completely unsuccessful. None of the worries from the previous sequels and the horror-scarred horror can be found here, and even the death scenes are basically simply gravel and moronic (especially death in food), except for a cool scene prepared as a comic book battle. That's why this movie is a point. <br /> <br /> Story ... naked, naked, naked, LAME. <br /> <br /> I have to remind Freddie that his childhood is a boogie-like clown. ? Is not his native scene a terrible and murderous murderer of a 7-year-old horror as a monster, the one that we know and hate since the first film? As you can see, the arm is wavy and stupid ... ugh. And its a liners too. Throughout the entire movie, they suck. Terrible. A classmate may encounter something entertaining, and Freddy opens his smell in 90 minutes. Hell, a Chimpanzee, Freddy's here with a very fun line could say. Who wrote scripts for this? This movie is really irritating. It looks so senseless. Just like a ghost around your head, nothing will happen. Freddy is now an anxiety. We've seen him many times before. This is not something different and often just wants to get a terrible liner and get out of the television screen. Alice looks frustrating and very neat, instead of a thoughtful and calm girl in the latest film, and it is obviously bound by a horrible, terrifying script with the effect of this movie. Lisa Wilcox may be a great actor, and sometimes there is a crack in the cracks, but she can not keep the movie. Other actors only sucked more. <br /> <br /> Freddie's presence in this movie last 15 or 20 minutes is terrible and embarrassing. Hopefully Englund was ashamed of it. Freddy runs like a dark, laughing leg, laughing like a cartoonist? This movie destroyed something positive for the Nightmare series. Without this picture I can not watch them again; It turned into a mixed confusion of Krueger. He slowly turned down a jockey, pop culture symbol, but this is the lowest low. This stone is under. After seeing this film, no one will ever get involved with Freddy Krueger. She is just a joke, a very late shirt for retirement. <br /> <br /> In some of the movies I hate, why once at Elm St, once I liked it a lot and liked a number of nightmare? The Dream Child represents the death of a legend and the disintegration of the hope that I have at Kabul in Science St. Freddy would continue the low-resistance spiral in the next section, Freddy's Dead (which was more fun), and then Freddy VS would continue to lower the mood in Jason, and finally <br /> <br / > I know why Freddi is now flooded, but this movie is one of the most terrible and worst films ever. . Nobody is recommended, and even ANOES companions will not want to see this one again.
