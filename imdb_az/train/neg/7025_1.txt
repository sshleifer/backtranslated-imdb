I wish I could film this movie from scratch, even lower, because unfortunately it deserves. Never miss an honest movie, but it was a terrible genius that another minute could not stop. Please, please - skip this movie - for humanity. It should also be noted that it has no doubt, weaknesses, treacherous structures, ridiculous dialogue, and is totally impossible in every imaginable way. . Absolutely basic level of entertainment is not difficult. Everything about "Mango Kiss" is so stagey that it is worse than any student movie I've seen. <br /> As it's not enough, the whole movie is fixed (and I mean) sound over the story. The script writer may also have written a novel because they demand everything, instead of showing it. We just think that Lou and Sassafras are the best friends, and we have a special look, though we have a similar look. Also, in the first five minutes of the film, the film continues to present new symbols in the ice cream frame, not the characters, but with the names of the screen. No presentation, no character development. <br /> <br /> This is the most fun movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I am a gay woman watching this movie. my guest room (another gay woman) and both of us found this movie as a surprising representative of queer cinema. I begin to think that lesbian and gay movies are a lot like Christian rock - it's not so bad that people will still be crucified even if they are still poor. Please rent! Instead, instead of "I'm Lying" or "Fire" or "Heavenly Creatures" instead of the gay community (ie Queer for Folk) to encourage the production of GOOD gay and delightful movies.
