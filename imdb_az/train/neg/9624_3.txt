Given the potential of this movement, the truth has caused disappointment. It was always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, but it could not turn around. Most of the activities were predicted. The jokes were mildly entertaining. And the characters were not very interesting. I would like to love this movie, but this has never happened. Ben Stiller was hilarious about "There is something about Mary". Here's what he is talking about. They should have known that something was wrong, even though they had to raise points from "Friends". <br /> <br /> Instead, follow the "50 First Date".
