This movie is just not worth your time. His influence on his New-Age Sufism serves as his only half-fascinating entertainment. <br /> <br /> It has been repeated several times. <br /> <br /> Someone wanted to spend some time commenting on some people's attempts to defend their reputation. driving Their motivation and objectivity are questionable, as they encourage them to avoid film errors, but with a well-intentioned message of New Age. <br /> <br /> So, some Jewish Christians or Islamic fundamentalists can endure positive reviews about film / television supporting their views? Despite the poor characteristics of the production or the lack of truth on any historical basis? I hope that. <br /> <br /> Despite the power, those behind me will say something about flowering.
