Rarely have I witnessed this unlucky power. There is nothing constructive to say about this hopeless swamp of the film. It seems that at the beginning of the film he promised to be less than red bread. Neck Actors - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - placed in roles that do not go anywhere; a film maker produces a movie that appears to be drawn through a coffee-coated camera lens at a genius; a writer who did not see anything (John Grisham) finds new depths of reasoned delicacies. The film has a low, laxative feel about it - but it's really part of the aesthetic level - at the comment level. Normally, I would like to appeal to the IMDb to make balanced, generally evaluative comments. This terrible disaster of a movie wants to make me a prostitute infinitely. I am not, but I do not want to occupy my "mind" with this trash.
