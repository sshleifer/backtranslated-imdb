This film makes itself attractive garbage. Just watch this spoken Gaelic or watch this movie if you like it. Look for another reason and disappoint you. It should be tempting, but not - just worry. It is difficult to pay attention to the heroes and the toy is weak. The stories in the film are also extreme and bad. I was expecting a hearty family movie, but this did not appeal to my fourteen year old daughter. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the movie is currently being set up, it has a look and feel of a cheap east. European film during the Cold War. There is not enough to pay for it in beautiful Scottish sculpture and cinematography. The shameful thing is that it is a shameful movie for Scotland.
