I am delighted to read many negative comments about the Tritter area. Everyone I talk to is the same thing. The house likes nature and intelligence, but they really do not like the ongoing plot. It cuts the real character of the hospital story, and everyone is angry at the police. Everyone in the hospital needs a more caring nature than vindictiveness. There are also many suspicious legal aspects of what Tritter really does. Only accounts can be disassembled and doctors have the power to refuse prescribing patients. It shows that many vindictiveness is also a good storyline to hurt and describe many sick patients in the hospital. I'm not afraid of the story episode, but when I insert the Trittor part, it closes me and the rest of the line hits it, and people hate to watch story lines. Please change. Take the Tritter.
