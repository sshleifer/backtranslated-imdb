<br /> <br /> Sheriff Bart's miserable confusion and painless attempt to transfer Mel Brooks from his "Blazing Saddles" to his weekly sitcom is bad, as some say! <br /> <br /> Laughter <br /> <br /> However, it is more interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: looks like Cleavon Little, shows her embarrassment on every scene." <html> The HBO movie, El Diablo, it was very fun because it was cheese. <br /> <br /> The best and most interesting thing about Black Bartin is the horse's name!
