Very awful, but beautiful and entertaining. The same old story (if you lived in the 80s). Vietnamese veterans are fighting together as anti-injustice in the United States. A-Team darling meets the desire to die! <br /> <br /> Time goes on, soldiers return home, and a few years later a friend faces a problem. No, wait - in fact, the friend died, and this is the father who is in trouble. The first hero, Joey, is a wheelchair-laden warrior, while trying to defend his father's small store from a local "guard" group, killed by a very super-pointy meat trader. <br /> <br /> When Sargis arrives at the funeral, his father is negotiating with Sarge, the leader of Joey's old-time Vietnam association. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Income reveals the tire, <br /> <br /> You can imagine the majority of movies. <br /> <br /> Something that surprises me is that Sarge's men are humble and modest about how good their work is. Joey would not be put on a wheelchair with an armed weapon in Vietnam! When martyrs fight, there are really good things in the city, and they do it again. For some reason, they are completely out of the way and are trying to climb into the network without anyone's participation. Phh !!!! I hate my hands. Insanity! <br /> <br /> All the members of the communication have a suspicious moment in which they are confident that they will try to smuggle their heroine to the network to make sure they are truthful. ONE ANY MOTHER. Hmm .... <br /> What will I do? Wait, in my opinion. The film was not too afraid to watch, but it was an annoyance. There are all these climatic moments before anything actually winds up. The most dramatic events we are launching are the explosion of Vietnam, Joey's death war, and violent attacks on a innocent toy bear (poor Teddy!). <br /> <br /> My mother predicts the beef with this movie, so I feel it's leaving her. Even the surprising subplots with "mystery assistants" and their strange cross-goal motifs are not enough to keep you in the end. But one day they will all be right and will continue later. Ha ha ha ha !!!
