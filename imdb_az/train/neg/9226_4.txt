Okay, the movie festival crowd loved it very much. However, why do the average popcorn munching filmmakers you earn to earn a $ 10 or $ 10 spending on a movie today are surprised by this choice? If there is a "Copolla" stamp, there are good things to do, right? Wrong! This is the story of the movie. But it was very scared. I think filmmakers are more disturbed than the public themselves. It's a cinematic curio, and it's a giggle or two. But in movies and on the TV, it will rise in film boxes and cassettes that will hold dust after it has been shown. Very epochal or epic!
