Just plain good old stupid. <br /> <br /> I'm not really stupid, Killer Tomato or Ed Wood movies are not as stupid as this is probably the stupid movie I've ever seen. It is an insult to Hindus to give this film a golden turkey. <br /> <br /> If this is a future for American cinema and art, it's really better to start World War 3 and 4 simultaneously and let the hamburgers know. then go through the show. <br /> <br /> If you are committing suicide now, I have to be drunk to put this insult on a single brain. <br /> <br /> This is really a good movie.
