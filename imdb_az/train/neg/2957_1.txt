What a mess! Why did this movie happen? These and other movies should be taught how to make "calibrated" films not to film. Children can love it, but those over the age of 10 can either agree or disagree. To make matters even worse, they were totally frustrated in a film where Big Thinkers like Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl were not worthy of warning.
