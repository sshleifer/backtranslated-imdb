I loved their Scary Movie 2 and enjoy White Chicks even. <br /> <br /> The little man was very little laugh and jokes were old. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the joke will turn around Marlon Wayans, a recently-trained fruits out of prison. He and his wife, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond intended for a gangster. Things are going on and the midget should place a suspicious pair of Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington playing. To return the diamond, the midget may be an abandoned baby in the gates of unfaithful couples. Certainly, it is taken and the investigation begins for a drama. <br /> <br /> There are some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live, including Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider on Live Night. <br /> <br /> Special effects were good to make Marlon look like Wayne. <br /> <br /> Therefore, these talents can not help poor scripts and entertainments. I want to say that this is not 100% convincing, but good ... no good. I just want Wayan's brothers to make more efforts to create a script with very good jokes than trying to destroy the poor scripts with the comedies from famous comedian actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> Or television. It is not really worth any amount.
