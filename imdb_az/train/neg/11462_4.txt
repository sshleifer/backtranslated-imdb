I love the wolf films in general. Though true and foolish. But it is difficult to resemble this film, but it is incredible and foolish and at the same time trying to take it seriously. <br /> <br /> Known as Orcas, the Great White Sharks, but when you can not help, it may be very difficult to feel awkward. things that are furious with Shamu. Particularly, when some building that exploded in Orca's building exploded ... and when it burst, something was thrown out of the water and I was watching the show in the sea with fireworks. Before they think it will happen, they kill many fears. Additionally, the JAWS requires several steps. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red; ">. But there was nothing in your JAWS movie. His fear. Yes, it is not clear. Yeah, uh, ugly. But obviously, not the actual or not, the Killer Shark is not as close as the Big White. And poor attempts to develop and write the character only hurts more. Even the JAWS Revenge is frightening than that.
