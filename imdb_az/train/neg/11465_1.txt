Of course, this is one of the worst pictures I've ever seen - when you miss your start ups for a good thing, but when you're still dead, the flip-flop of the mall film studio puts a movie into a movie that you choose! And that's where I came to see this strange bomb ... <br /> <br /> From three decades, I can eat the rotten fish that make up this story line. Unbelievable plot - killer whale respects a person who is not indifferent from the sea - laughs. And all this, except for the absolute "love theme" playing on the end of a film that does not have a story of love. At least Charlotte Rampling is beautiful (in a two-dimensional role), but Richard Harris just creates the d√©cor. He was Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and this is not the "Jaws". With grace, I've saved the majority from the mood and when I move away from the air, I move right away. "Danger, Robinson will be!" Available t.v. ("I love Orca - Orca ...") - it's gone in at least sixty seconds. This flicker represents 92 minutes of my life so I will never be back.
