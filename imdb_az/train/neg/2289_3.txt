Unfortunately, Marry Harron has decided to make a fictional report on Bettie Page life to go along with her problems with men. As typical in all cases, each great man is characterized as weak, bumbling or twisted. To add her art, Bettie Page designs ideas and issues that are not right, according to herself. Bettie did not abandon us, because he thought he was morally wrong or had religious issues (although he was born after his birth, with his third baby). She left her because she was in the late 1930s, her actuarial career did not go anywhere and she lost her appearance. Torture and aggression tips are indispensable and are limited to Bettie's words and are the director's attempt to claim that any woman involved with Bettie has been victimized by men. Harron pointed out that Bettie had drawn his clothes in almost all shoots (not given by the "sick" fetishists). Harron also did not think that Bunny Yeager, who shot many of Bettie's many famous photographs, did not make many "naughty" exiles with Bettie and was not a morally straightforward professional photographer. <br /> <br /> Only saving grace looks like much like Gretchen Mol Bettie. Otherwise, other films and documentaries are more accurate and honest to her and her people.
