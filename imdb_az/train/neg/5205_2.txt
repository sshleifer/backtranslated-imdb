Minimal script, minimal character development, minimal fixed camera. Maximum lenght scenes, maximum headache, lowering the darkness, the maximum characters around the tree do nothing. As fast as you can see three hunters who do not know nothing about doing nothing at 12:01, fast and do not miss anything. To be fair, there's an interesting piece of music in the movie, perhaps a music video that would go with it. Unfortunately, it should not have been and it should have been a twenty minute short, lying beyond belief. Do not forget the "trigger guy" and I'm working. - MERK
