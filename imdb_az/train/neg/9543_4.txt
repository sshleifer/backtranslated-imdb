Let's see - if you're looking for a forgotten 80's STDVD to rent later and expect it to be better than the one above, you're a fool. Wargames: The Dead Code connects to an unnecessary long lasting list of DVD market so easily filled up. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film is as follows: Nerd meets a girl; girl loves nerd; nerd loves girl; nerd accidentally associated with Top Secret Government; nerd and girl go to another country; nerd and girl are exposed by government suits in another country; nerd and girl get acquainted with some important old boy who died at the "movie"; nerd and girl were arrested; Top Secret Government gets crazy about the computer; nerd is hired to defeat the Top Secret Government Computer; Nerd demolishes the Top Secret Computer by using the same old Top Secret Computer from the first Wargames movie; keeps nerd day; nerd was taken. <br /> <br /> The latter. <br /> <br /> Operation, writing, effects, accounts and cinematography are B-degrees. Some introductory faces are here and you should avoid it when you do not have Colm Feore's mega admirer. <br /> <br /> Simply, Mathew Broderick was also very happy, but that's a very good thing. he was engaged in some of the "masterpieces", even though he could not make a second community in a second second. But can you blame him?
