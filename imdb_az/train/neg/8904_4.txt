I liked the name "Prophecy" in 1995. Christopher Walken was as great as ever, and despite the fault of the movie, it was a creepy and very original Horror / Fantasy movie. This post-1998 situation is still worth considering, but thanks to Walken. Walken, in my opinion, is one of the greatest actors around, and he is once again a dying Archangel Gabriel once again playing for the second time here. Once again, war between the fallen and faithful angels is brought to the ground. Gabriel returns the birth of a child, the angel Angela (Russel Wong) and woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child can once become the determining factor of the heavenly war ... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again beautiful as Gabriel. In addition to Gabriel, the "II prophet", unfortunately, includes a lot of boring characters. Valeri's character was a bit tainted and Danayel was more concerned about me. The biggest pain in donkeys was Izzy's character (played by Brittany Murphy). Still, Walken's performance is not a recurring quality of the movie. The whole film is terribly beautiful and well painted in dark colors, which helps the atmosphere. In the Algerian period, the resurrection scene is also impressive and one of the most exciting moments in any "Prophecy". "Prophethood II" is probably the weakest of the three "Prophecy" films with Walken. Of course, a Christopher Walken is an entertaining man-show, but nothing else.
