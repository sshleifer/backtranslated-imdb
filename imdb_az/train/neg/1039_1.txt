<br /> <br /> This movie is one of the most horrible things I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Please give yourself a blessing and avoid this inadequate decision. <br /> <br /> The camera shook and there are some actors who do not consider the method of adoption as the required "direction." The writing was all beautiful, but it was abandoned by a few fictitious "styles" that were evaluated by a few artificial characters, the most artificial way. Br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < it is built.
