The 80s have been great for the great star Charles Bronson once. Beginning with 1982, with Death Wish II, and since 1989, Bronson's scenarists have endeavored to give each other a sense of success in their enduring endurance. "D.W. II", the character of Bronson's character has little to do with the suicide and imagination (the house was harassed and assaulted). The movie "10 Midnight" was a charming movie that was later bought in the bathroom. It does not buy anything about it. Since then, other movies, such as "The Devil of Humanity" and other "Death Words" have been settled with the most beautiful images of cruelty and revenge, between the high camp and the high pulse. I'm not sure if the generals (usually Pancho Kohner), or grandchildren, or elderly, elderly, old Bronson, have destroyed the young, but I'm not sure of the magic (and terrible writing) of these works, which is usually produced by small energy. <br /> <br /> Kinjite - the last of these films - is pretty good, but really gets a cake in cinematic unhappiness. In this film, Bronson: A john is sodomizing; Force a robe clock for Rolex watch; allows a prisoner to be exposed to the aggression of another prisoner; I'm very happy to make incredible xenophobic interpretations among other things I've forgotten. <br /> <br /> What did people think when preparing this movie? What did Bronson think when he decided to destroy his career with these terrible movies? For anyone interested in the best films, most of the films he had taken in the 60s and 70s were " The Mechanic "," Death Wish "," Noon til 3 "," Once upon a time in the West "," Red Sun "," Great Running "," Legend Seven "," Rain Rider "
