The author defines the "path of discovery" of the "roots" of the southern tobacco industry, because he thinks he is a father of a "dazzling leaf" (completely and decently forgotten). It's not his, and in fact it's a drunken family meeting, but certainly not for commercial purposes, even if it's suitable for scanning for a non-commercial release, this is a totally ridiculous and self-blameless, glorious home movie, even a little curiosity. It's a good reminder of why most independent films are not being taken by key studios - because they're boring, uninteresting and not interested in anybody, but the director and his surrounding circles. Avoid all costs!
