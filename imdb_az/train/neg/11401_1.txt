The scenario was weak enough to think a bit about the characters or happenings. The scenario is much talked about, and it is not enough to make a slow paced call. The story comes to the point where everyone is silent and dying as soon as possible, so it is impossible to speak of this silent, harsh dialogue. In a technical note, the mix of music is a great way and it's hard to figure out how much of it is spoken. Again, this is a blessing. In general, this story could have been better explained in a short film within 30 minutes. It would be great if there was a clear "incline" on Sam's face and "Evil Dead" on your face. Cmon, this is the 35mm budget and THAT is the best possible? Still, cinematography, lighting design and shooting really did a great job.
