Since Caligula I've been thinking about half the movie, but then it was only 15 minutes when I thought about it. Unfortunately, I did it all the way. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of a cradle, shocking or intimidating, intimidating, intimidating, or sexually explicit. This is not one of those things, but it still wants all of it to be hearty. Instead, drilling, strangulation, usual, predictable and unusually poor performance (video shot, high school special effects, even the meaning of basic visualization, the dialogue is difficult to hear ... though). /> <br /> This film is a proof to prove that straight-to-video distributors need to draw a line on the sand somewhere.
