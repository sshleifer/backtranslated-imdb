When I saw that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroeder were in the same movie, I thought it was like me! I admit I wanted to see the movie. And it should be said that in the first fifteen minutes or so, it was nostalgic. Then all went down the hill. I did not expect this to be politically correct as a dump of civil rights. They took every controversial issue and threw it into a stupid story. Noah was deceived by this kind of thing, especially in his role. Nobody who has a fully functional brain will accept all the excuses for the Vietnam War. If someone wants to know how communism is, sit down and read a book. <br /> <br /> Because I wanted to see Ricky's body, I watched several scenes here, but it was all about me. Everything else about this movie is frustrating.
