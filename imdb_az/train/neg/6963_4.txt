The Japanese always had incredible passions in fantasy films. They are always ready to destroy cities by means of huge plastic monsters from space and elsewhere. The problem is that they did not succeed in giving money convincing effects. This film, made under the name of "Les envahisseurs de l'espace", is no exception. His enthusiasm is to show the giant octopus in a huge lobster trying to give preference to the three living things. Very enthusiastic and funny, but very nice. After all, these creatures and these films should be done in the best possible way.
