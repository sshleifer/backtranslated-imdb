I just saw it at the Venice Film Festival and I can not decide very much about it. They are not allowed to approach any symbol in order to care for them. Perhaps, we are in a "bubble" of ourselves, but these people have to worry about me or have been shocked by their various abilities. Over an hour of work, the characters did not develop very well. Often it was devoted to the production of plant equipment (forklifts, conveyor belts, winds); and a little creepy-looking baby dolls with a strikingly vibrant look, most of the characters prepared for a life were more direct than live creatures. An interesting experience, but in no way has never come together.
