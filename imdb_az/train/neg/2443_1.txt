It's not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst films ever. It was pretty bad that I really liked it. you are acting, my god, the script, you must be a kidding. ' How can you imagine yourself as a writer? - A child who is preparing a fireworks at school, a strong fireworks, flies a hundred miles and explodes when someone hit him. a girl remains stranded in hangman, the killer is trying to open the door. it takes a boring, but the wire is not long enough. he is an extension cord for the first time, oh horror and then, he then drills through the door, drills through the head. WOW - and there are more examples. oh yeah, and what happened to George Kennedy, he was great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
