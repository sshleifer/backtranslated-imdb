In particular, what's wrong with this movie is that the audience and the bullets do not see in the book of edgy "independent" production of each clich√©. <br /> <br /> This is "real" <br /> <br /> This is not "edgy", but we should never waste the time to illuminate the film. <br /> <br /> Let's say "hip", kids should use words such as Al Pacino in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> And so on. And so on. Everything else that is left to you is a very self-critical attempt at Hollywood that will not affect anyone except for the "rarefied" indie crowd that looks like every bad movie.
