<br /> <br /> Veronica does not need to solve Mars's greatest mystery on the screen. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, the disappointment of these perennial assessments is still in the air. This week, Veronica became rare for Mars: this is a great 6 (soon to be Great 5) 146 out of 146 shows. Yeah, you've read it right. Veronica Mars has been beaten every single show on WB and UPN every day. <br /> <br /> Now hip hypesters will say: but that was just beginning. It was all the shows about Fox and of course all the show about ABC, CBS and NBC. But this week on TV, everything fled pretty much! <br /> <br /> CW intends to choose these proven rating ghosts. <br /> <br /> Some of the errors indicate that he was saved from the UPN. <br /> <br /> Obviously, there is something behind the scenes. <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Perhaps, this is Joel Silver's influence and praise, but frankly, I'll go back to loss. "Veronica has the potential of Mars" <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a great mystery for the media and a very unfortunate start.
