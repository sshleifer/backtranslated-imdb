I'm not the millions who think about Cary Grant, but I do not think it's a reason to recommend this movie. I do not understand Betsy Drake's fall, and if we do not look like anybody, Caterin Hepbern follows Cary Grant to bring Baby, and he admits he is superior. The idea is unsuccessful but unsuccessful. I read how drake was "scary," but I thought it was a very mysterious idea. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Military operations against the people living in the Caucasus continue.
