I love the good, slow acting drama. Tuesday, Chungking Express, Virgin, Bachelors, Road House, Spring in a Small City, Hana Bi, Drinking Man Woman, Dolls, Mood For Love and Spring Fall Winter Season All Delightful Cinema ?? just give a few names. Unfortunately, in the genre of drama there are sub-movies of films, which are of interest to them when trying to walk on the clothes of the good films. Are they called IAN films? "Understandable artistic nonsense". Tsai Ming-liang is the king of this subgenre, and Vive L'Amour is his "masterpiece." In fact, it is a de la cr√®me cream that drowns in the name of "art". People walk around their apartments, drink water, wait for empty phones, hang posters, close the trash together, go to the bathroom, eat, pushup, sex, slap on mosquitoes and so on. I do not joke when I say that the whole film is a complete summary. This is a very important posterchild for a senseless art house trash. There is no plot, no story, interesting and noteworthy events, no emotion, no meaningful dialogue and, most importantly, what? <br /> <br /> The Caucasus is mocking that it is totally unusual and savvy. The connection between the characters on the bed is virtually impossible. Tsai did not seem to have been in contact with anything other than the obvious truths they wanted to "bang". The man at the bottom of the bed is dimensioned and uninteresting. She likes drinking water, cooking with melon and throwing herself. Tsai's "character development" idea. <br /> <br /> The true contribution of Vive L'Amour to the River is probably the most treacherous scene in the history of filmmaking. The first actress takes all the paths from one end of a park to another for 285 consecutive seconds, but then he cries painfully? absolutely no reason? another 356 seconds second. Then the movie suddenly ends. There is no point. No fun. Only clean, concentrated torture provided to the viewer. <br /> <br /> To defeat the dead horse. The main theme of loneliness is a big mistake, the only real part of this film is boredom. In fact, Kiyoshi Kurosawa provides a better demonstration of solitude in the horror movie Kairo. And what do you think? It is really interesting! This film has slowly moved in January as a molasses, but there are better approaches to the concept of loneliness than the one known as Vive L'Amour. <br /> <br /> <strong> Kairo is a wonderful example. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Cinema admirer Tsay Ming-Liang for directing this film because art house cinema is a B-class, a horror prepared for television. Art-house snobs have officially lost self-determination. How does the quality of your valuable genre exceed the Dark Army and movies? rage! ?? Show girls. How do you like them?
