If there is not a big enough zero rating film, this is the bull's meeting. I love zombie films, even the bad guys usually have something to go for, but that's not tyranny. <br /> <br /> When I look at this movie, I feel angry because it's so poor that it's poor, so I think it's acceptable for people who are not responsible. <br /> <br /> There is no plot, with sadism and spanking scenes. People do not react, do not act and do not look like humans in any way. The whole film is shot in two rooms, decorated in the same way as possible places. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can make a better movie than this. It could have been a movie before. <br /> Fourth, the worst movie of all time. We will only mention a positive feedback by calling 10/10 and buying a DVD. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;
