Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes basketball squad as hustlers. Okay, everything sounds there. It creates a lot of room for good comedy and a good story. But after this miserable attempt of a film, there was no such event at the next drilling minutes. This film was unnecessary, delayed and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds. Woody Harrelson is my favorite t.v. characters, Woody, Cheers, and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. But after seeing "acting", he plays with countries that are in trouble. His actor was dull and poor as film. Another unusual actor was Rosie Perez. Previously, I liked the movies with Perez, but I decided that the reason I was dealing with my career was that he was not the main character and that there were not many lines of speech (True Things). But so far the White Men can not jump, it has become a central character with many lines, so the audience is renewed with very boring and vibrating sounds. So, after seeing this movie (soft-spoken term) and hearing Rosie Perez more appreciated, I can say that I'm a white man and I'm going to jump. . . A 20-storey apartment was put out of the building
