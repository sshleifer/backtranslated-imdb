9, the movie I've been expecting for months .... then was a disappointment. <br /> <br /> I was deeply shocked by the lack of nine stories and strange characters. All awesome activity segments in the world do not have a single symptomatic character. <br /> <br /> The strange, unusual sequence was not only from the ground, but they were angry. This story is about robots and scientists ... Why not merge with a mystic character and green magic ghost lines instead of answering a sudden gigantic storytelling? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> Such a movie is frustrating because of the lack of depth. If the story was good, I would watch this movie with a pencil. But filmmakers relied on CGI magic and the name of Tim Burton. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> ">
