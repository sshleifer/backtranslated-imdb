Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, when they were a treacherous, boiling, powerful Hollywood couple who made this stage-scene remix, made in 1972 by Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw's double refugee division. Since McQueen has such a vital presence on the screen, he has worked for almost the first time - even with a silent and tired noise, you can feel the clock cagey magnetism. Baldwin is not in the league of Steve McQueen, but his charm is probably a more versatile actor - if not, this is not a showcase for his features. Basinger is good and certainly looks good, but James Woods is an artificial manifesto with a clever mob-magnetic role. Another pair of captured captured by Baldwin's former partner, the sub-plot '72, was uncompromising, and it's getting even worse. As for the scenes of action, they are pretty old hats, which causes a great deal of surprise: why even re-make the original? ** from ****
