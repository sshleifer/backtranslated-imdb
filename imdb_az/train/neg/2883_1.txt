This movie is terrible. I do not spend anything except a few words that is bad. <br /> <br /> Avoid all these offenses, this is terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the details of the crime is correctly processed. Images of many slaughterhouses. Strange fragments and adjustments. There is no sustainability on the field. <br /> <br /> It was announced that a film bomb was made to earn some money without considering the accuracy of its contents. The camera work is always neat and always indestructible. <br /> <br /> In fact, I would like Dennis Rader, who lives in jail now, to put those horrifying film prisoners in jail. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I do not think about this tracking. If possible, I would give me a negative star.
