This merger is a big episode of a team and justice. Clearly Clark made a major breakthrough for Superman, a young man who was afraid of a fear under control, aside from the feelings of a few close friends who were ready to rescue all planets, like Green Arrow. This is not an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship; this is to solve things that are more important in life, a lesson for Clark. I do not want the sequel to end, but I hope that the episodes will remain committed to the justice that they have done after pushing for a good start of Supermend without returning without any "rewind". <br /> <br /> In this episode we have to see the differences between Lex and the team. Nine stars should give enough credit.
