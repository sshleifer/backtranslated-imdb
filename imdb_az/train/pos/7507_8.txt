Greetings from the darkness again. Mary Heron collects a complete list of films that has been able to look at her specific era. Previous "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" did their best when commenting on the frustration of society. <br /> <br /> "The Notorious Bettie Page" is obviously Ms. Even though it's about page, there's a bit of peak behind the scenes in the world of strange photo shoots in the '50s. <br /> <br /> Both from the standpoint of the story, as well as the filmmaking and technically come together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> B & <br /> Support strong David Strathairn (role in Edward R Murrow), Chris Bauer (like Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is a beautiful talented and unfounded and true Gretchen Moldir. Ms. Mol always brings an edge and spirit to his roles. Jason Alexander directed "Just Looking" in 2000. He is an unhappy Bettie page. Her smile is attractive and her body is impeccable. <br /> <br /> This really has this role and helps to understand that Tennessee's next door can be a strange pin-up queen. <br /> <br /> One can expect the noise of the era. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are two performers. Despite the film's commitment to giving a date to this industry, the film's latest film is preventing pure film magic. But Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page's magic are watching this fun movie and will show the HBO's infinite performance in the near future. Now, is someone going to turn Ms. Mol into the star?
