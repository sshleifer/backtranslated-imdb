I thought this movie was pretty good. Some parts were dark, but they were understood more than 55 years ago. The best performance in the film is given by Michele Morgan, who plays Millie convincingly. Jack Haley is also as good as Mike O'Brien. Although I'm not a big Frank Sinatra fan, I think it's a good thing in this movie. <br /> <br /> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br />
