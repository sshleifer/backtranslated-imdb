It was a surprise. . This film has influenced me in my automatic way of dealing with people and situations. The most striking feeling was a mixture of anger. There may be many things like a spoiled child while reacting to avoiding the path. . If you want longing tantrum. It was the most ridiculous thing I was thinking of hiding this anger from others. What happened to me? Soooo I love it. . bless you very much. Now I feel a sense of unbeatable respect and have a lasting appreciation for life. . When it does not look like life in a special way, I think life or people should be "must". This film has helped me to communicate with others, to feel free from restrictions and expectations. . to communicate with true love. . not by fear of harm. . the first love and affection are perceived.
