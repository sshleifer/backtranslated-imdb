Most of the films I wrote in August are really negative, although the film has not been released at least in the United States until mid-September. Perhaps they were seeing early ships in South Korea. I live in the United States and I've seen it today. I thought it was a trailer special effects. The story was non-West, but we use many similar films. It was not difficult to watch. The actions of the parties were weak, but other people were pretty good. There was humor on the way to life. I appreciated it at 8 because I had a good time to watch it.
