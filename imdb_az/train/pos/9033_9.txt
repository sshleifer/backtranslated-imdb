I was watching this movie without knowing anything in this movie and like Billy Elliott (2000). Both films stand around a carefree father and boy relationship. Both films do not want his son's father to watch the dreams of a better life than mines and their own home. Both children are experiencing problems by their classmates, and both have a strong role model that teaches them. <br /> <br /> The biggest difference I've ever seen with movies is the infinitely more interesting and touching movie of October Sky. Laura Dern performs a motionless performance and Chris Cooper plays very well with his father, while he continues to work in American Beauty (1999). Unlike other directing features like Joe Johnston Jumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001), I was struck by its subtle director. <br /> <br />
