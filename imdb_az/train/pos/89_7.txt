To be honest, I did not know what this movie was when it started. If so, how will I watch movies? No prerequisite. I would think it would be a movie about a stone film in one of these woods or something. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <br /> Another user commented on how this movie was wrong and not convincing, but I did not want to be different. . Such things happen. We're sorry, but everyone lives in a sleeping world where something bad does not happen and the naked cases are "unacceptable." I'm sorry, but the reality of the world is theirs. The creator and actors of this film have done a great job of describing how things can get worse and how people can make really bad choices. Sometimes things go well, sometimes they get worse and this is life. <br /> <br /> I love this movie.
