Yesterday I saw "El Mar" and thought it was a great movie. It starts with a childhood episode in the lives of three main characters such as Ramallo, Manuel Tur and Francisca. After about 10 years, we have three hospitals where we meet again. <br /> <br /> Religion and disease in the film creates anger, love, violence and sexual irritation, and is a tense and pressurized film. <br /> <br /> I see people who are very scary in the film, and I think they have missed the story. It is a violent, tense and sad event. People should suffer. Crying. To be injured. Beware. And I think that what the movie shows is not a very unpleasant way, rather than a good shock. I do not know that some people love their films as "clean", even those who are exposed to violence. But sometimes you need to feel like a movie. It's one of those films. <br /> <br /> Unlike some movies, there were a few films. The movie is all illogical. But it was not a very important thing for the general story, so I still give this movie 9.
