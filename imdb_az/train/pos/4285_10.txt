This "tragicomedy" written by the famous Serbian theater / film writer Dusan Kovacevich is probably one of the best films in the comedy category. And yet, the appearance of a theater game that has turned into a feature movie is worth nothing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two Gypsies musicians read their painful lives, and foresee the future tragedy; In this unusual movie (in the real world Kostic brothers are amateur amateurs, but as Stanojlo Milinkovic gives the real-life indicator of the farmer on the road with the road), he divides and unites the stages. <br /> <br /> The spectrum ensures that a heroic image of a society facing a war is understood by the collective personality of the nation: everyone is aware of the war, but they try to live their lives better, hoping that ignorance can prevent tragedy. Using a simple film language, director Slobodan Sijan draws a picture of a society that has been destroyed by the war (World War II) and successfully portrays his personal portraits: provincialism of a singer, inexperience of new generations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This feature (Sijan's feature debut only) "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako sam sistematski untenten od idiota", "and my other favorite" davitelj protiv davitelja "), directed by the directors of the Serbian cinematography.
