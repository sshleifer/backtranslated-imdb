This movie is incredible, and I also advise children and adults. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is appealing; Better than anything else American studios have done. However, there are several warnings to this statement. Disney Studio Ghibli is a shame that takes back the directory and then takes it to the butcher. My main point, despite Disney's original English version, was very impressive, repeating the movie. With the Van Der Beek and others, the new castle destroyed it and took the most of its characters, e.g. Pazu and Sheeta adventured comrades went to foolish teens. Original music is better than the Disney remix. How did Disney make such changes? It seems to me that, despite the fall of Van Der Beek and others, Disney can attract more money, which is fair enough, but in the process they broke the film. It's still a great movie and I still recommend it to anyone. My main beef disrupts a movie from Disney's favorite and still loved one. I am now lucky to have the original Japanese import with the original English dubbing!
