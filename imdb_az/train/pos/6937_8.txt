The mixed western spins the famous rifle tale of the early western with each other and all coveted. James Stewart is a cowboy who wins Winchester, a single shot he lost in a single robbery. The Stewart story illustrates the pursuit of a certain man through a rifle and a movie. The rifle changes its best if the owner can lose it. There's plenty of movement and durability in the picture she stuck in the Stewart quarry. Here's a great support for Stewart, Stephen McNally, Dan Duryea, Millard Mitchell, John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen. Shelley Winters looks like a misplaced here and his role is very dark. In subsequent years, Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson have their short, but good roles in young hearts.
