This film is worth seeing the beauty of the sight and acting alone, but at the same time is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. Women and singers (both of whom came together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star) are also condemned to fall into roles in China. <br /> <br /> This is the possibility of becoming stronger as a victory over the native culture of a young girl with the old street performer. <br /> <br /> The only problem I've taken with this movie is that it's the only thing that's going to happen. <br /> <br /> <strong>
