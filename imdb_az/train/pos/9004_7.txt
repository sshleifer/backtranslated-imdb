I was skeptical about the story of another diseased story that people with disabilities communicated through honest communication and paid for it. And it's still not on my list. However, the demonstrations and samples of Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branag are almost astonishing, and they end up being another tear. Carter's ALS victim's images are strong, perhaps sometimes too extreme (sometimes his conversation turns to unclear ideas). But the overall effect is commendable and rewarding. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
