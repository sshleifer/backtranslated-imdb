This movie is incredible! Though fun and entertaining, it is deep in depth and eye-catching. I'll be watching her again. Bruce is a man who is dissatisfied with his life. He has a job and a life, but he does not think what to think about to bring happiness. Bruce is sad, unpleasant, and sad that his life is not what he foresaw. As a result of this situation, Bruce ends his job and accuses God of everything he believes to be wrong. God comes to Bruce and gives him God's powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he wants. His life is, in the end, one of the things that he intended to make him happy, with the exception of one. In the process of gaining everything, he really loses a loved one. As the film opens, Bruce learns that it is not the conditions for a real change to take place in his life, but to really accept what is happening there. This film was inspiring and deep. If you pay attention to your attention, this is a time when you are much more blessed than we do not know, and in a respectful manner it is forbidden to look at your life. As my spouse said, "After knowing when you want them to be happy?" and my modest supplement "do not lose the important ones when we try and learn."
