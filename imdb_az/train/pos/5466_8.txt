With Barbara Stanwyck, new, inspired (with Nietzsche labels) gives preference to men to pretend to be immoral, manage sensitivity and self-care. About the German philosopher is not really fair, but it was the year in which Hitler came to power. Stanwyck does not do much for me in this younger version, but of course, it's good to come here, and he's putting himself and the movie. Many of the body here could have been very risky situations and amazing quips and innuendo, not as you would expect. I do not think it's a very attractive look, if it's not a great entertaining, men's exciting presentation, and honestly, gold digging. Still, this is life!
