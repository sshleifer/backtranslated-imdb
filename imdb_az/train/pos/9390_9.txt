This movie opened me up from Nick Cage's coup. It's a story full of twists and turns - a motive and action movie. Of course, Dennis Hopper was smooth, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyn Boyle are perfect couples to catch a person who is not suspicious of the internet. Everything about this movie is good - cinematography, story tempo and most of the end. Cage is far superior to its advantages - not being a hero of action, but being a lifelong person.
