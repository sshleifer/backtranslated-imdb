This is very interesting! After seeing La Roue this afternoon, a short, light hearted little movie, I consider this a real treat! This is very pleasant and this is one of the most attractive pictures I've ever seen. It's a better talk because it's an earlier talk and puts some great pictures that shame the 30th cinema because of its innovative use of sound. It's just really unpleasant and happy to have just been filled with a music-filled and cheerful mood! It would not be difficult for a man to find the leading looking lottery tickets, but the tempo is so exciting that the movie is so spectacular that I did not even think twice. The comedy enjoys many times, and maybe Marx Brothers is probably better than the greatest comic power of the time. This is very good.
