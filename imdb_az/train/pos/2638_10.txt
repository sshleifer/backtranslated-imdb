One of the best films for all ages. You will not be able to look at Lion King again without thinking about the extra story of this movie. At about 40, I watched this evening with my wife and two sons, and for a long time he laughed a lot and did not like it. <br /> <br /> Take your time and watch it with the kids. This reminded me of how Disney would be when you were a young man.
