What can I say about a tale like this? This magic tale followed me in my early childhood, in my heart, like the warm memories. Heroes take you to many strange places where you can ask for more than every scene. In the market, for example, there were very few lore. <br /> <br /> Heyzel's line was beautiful. I wanted to be very happy with Landbury, so I decided to keep the kids and stay with Mr.Brown. <br /> <br /> I'm still a child inside and this movie will not appeal to me as something else. This movie is my favorite favorite of all time. I hope all children will watch this classic and swim and move to another era.
