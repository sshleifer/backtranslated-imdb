There are some nice things about this movie. Marion Davies can move when given the right property; it's beautiful in comedic roles. You can see William Haines move and see why he is one of the most famous of the screen. (Potential scandal, until it is forced from work). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit complicated, but it is so beautifully designed that you do not have it. King Vidor's leadership is one of the main reasons. Producer? <br /> <br /> As you go about seeing the film in 1928, you begin to see emotions for cameras, kits, directors and actors. You see some of the main stars of the day (briefly); even as Charlie Chaplin is capable of signing up. You also resemble Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor and other names and unfair names and old photos. <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the silent, take time to capture this movie whenever possible. This is really a great time in the future.
