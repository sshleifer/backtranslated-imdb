A sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writes a love letter to each other without knowing who it is. Naturally, they work together and do not look like each other. You can guess the rest. It's a nice wizard, a clever script, and totally stunning, all by the cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan). It is held in Budapest and is being shot in Hollywood, but I believe in what I saw in Budapest! Everything is so perfect and like a dream. One of a kind movie. Do not miss it!
