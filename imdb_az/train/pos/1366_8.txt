Who is the only one who sees the connection between the "sisyphus myths" and the discussion of the mary's life? In the Kamus version, one man is condemned to spend eternity with a huge rock, and he must climb the hill. Unfortunately, each time it climbs boulder slips and ends at the bottom for the start. it could have been a bullet wound in his eyes, but now I'm not sure. mary lives in a movie that combines life, unfortunately, every time he falls into everything and loses everything. Perhaps he throws himself into the drunken place, loves his party, and is attacked by lieu schrieber. If you ask the theory that the scene has come to an end as he tries to climb a star, the books do not prevent him from moving anywhere and ultimately does not end. The next morning she was still on the stairs when she woke up.
