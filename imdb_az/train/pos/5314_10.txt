I saw this movie for the first time at the sundiala film festival this year, and because I was a teenager, I found the movie very attractive. these guys are ordinary and unexpected that they should be in this movie for a lengthy time, but with the right dialogue and the movie they have succeeded. I love this movie more than others, but I really appreciate the release and watching of this movie. this is a blend of clever interpretations and cheerful reality. Having captured the essence of the high school, he entered the school list of favorites and hoped he would be given a chance to go to the theaters. I really appreciate all the guys who put this movie in trouble, which helped me burn my eyes in laughter.
