Fred Gwynne, Al Lewis, Sid Cesar and Yvonne De Carlo star in this funny, funny movie. The late Fred Gwynne, Grandpa Munster (Al Lewis), his wife Lily (Yvonne De Carlo), and Herman Munster, alongside his son and daughter, are beautiful. Sid Cesar is surprised by the owner of a wax museum that covers a whole section of the Munster family. Both Herman and my dad's waxes are starting to insult the city's figures. Two people now need to clear their names without being too late. You sound like I did.
