Dostoevsky's film about human psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova), Shakespeare's drama and Hans Christian Andersen's playwright and old Kurosawa's works is a beautiful movie about a brothel in a good fishing village, tragic and festive. Scenario is beautiful, scenes are colorful, and some scenes are really refreshing in my mind. The site is interesting and unexpected - every character is very well developed and interesting - there is also a little action, so if you do not like all your dreams come to your expense. It's not about the secret Geishas and the proud Samurai, but their Bushido is all about pouring them but everywhere everywhere, about life, work and people. A wonderful and exciting visit to Kurosawa is certainly worth seeing.
