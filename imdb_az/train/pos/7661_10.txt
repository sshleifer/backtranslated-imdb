Scanners II: The New Order was as good as the classic scanners of David Cronenberg, Scanners were created in 1980 and Scanners II in 1991, so there are eleven year spaces between two films. The film captures the Scanners style, which is a good thing, and there will be no scanners without a head-boom, so Scanners II has a terrifying head-on scene. Scanners II: New Order has other well-behaved other creative heroes scenes. Scanners II Plan: The New Order is the release of a new array since scanners were used as a neat force for a police chief and a group of scholars, and a young scanner called David Kellum was used and Scanners II: The New Order is a great sequel to David Cronenberg's fantastic classic scanners and must be seen. Check it out. 10/10
