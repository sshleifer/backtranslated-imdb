Take a look at those who took the time to review: This is the film adaptation of Iliad's science fiction. So the basis of the film is whether the references are painful or not. They admit that they admit ... although P.C. <br /> <br /> Great flick, but very short. Perhaps the writer, director or studio did not come as he wanted, but rather cursing. <br /> <br /> A major budget rebuilding will not be fun and can not lead to a fairer scenario. But it is great to imagine the potential there. Although hardly a DVD broadcast with some extras seems to be, I do not think it will play NTSC players. I am not an expert and we are still trying to figure it out. I live with the present VHS embodiment.
