Carloff and Lugosi - again together! This is one of the movies that random fans will pass and is inclined to appreciate it. The two previous twins of this duo are the whole scary movie, like The Black Cat and The Raven. <br /> <br /> The Invisible Ray Director General, Lambert Hillyer, is a filmmaker based in Laemmles's Universal, who has come from the West but has been welcomed in recent days, and this is the latest film by Laemmles, Dracula 's daughter. <br /> <br /> Lugosi, like the wild in the Raven, needs much to say that Carloff's hammer is in The Invisible Ray. Part of the story that is particularly displeased is that Karloff's character, Rukh, is horrified before Rhodes X is poisoned, and he is not really something that begins with a glow. This is very similar to the complaint of Jack Nicholson on the picture - He has an elevation right from the start. There is no real transformation. It's the same here. Carloff has an extra purpose to take revenge on his mind, half-perverted. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Lugosi is totally surprised and gives you a noticeable turn as the Spirit's rival in science. Dr. Benet. Lugosi also has the best lines in the film, including a memorable warning for the police who want to take Ruhu. Together with the horror film writer John Soister - "If he (Spirit) touches everyone?" the inspector asks. Lugosi responds with hesitation, in a way that Luke can only say "Dying". Lugoshi could have been more perfect than any actor, as he could not. Therefore, Carloff and Luigi have a good relationship, because we have fought Karloff's strange antics against the cold logic of Lugosi. Karloff-like crazy scientists would continue to play many times, but a desire Lugosi could have played a more straightforward role. <br /> <br /> Invisible Ray is a fun movie, and real treats to true Carloff and Lugosi fans. It is not one of the masterpieces, but one of the best-looking films at every glance, because of the character and talent of its stars, and how it completes their darker, more terrible formations. Always special effects created by innovative John Fulton are all supported and supported by all actors. Frances Drake looks great as she did in Mad Love and plays a rare case of classic scary movies. Carloff is one of the most exciting moments of the film, when it tears it and does not crash it. Great, entertaining movie!
