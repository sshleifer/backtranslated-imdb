I do not believe they are getting out of the air. Specifically, only a few episodes remain. My daughter, my sister and a few friends loved this show. We were very upset when they stopped doing so for the rankings. This is not an injustice for people watching the show since the beginning. There was a right to see the end. I would like to vote for them three times a year. We can send the papers in the letter and we will be able to give a general vote to all the programs we watch or hear. This can also help promote a new show. People will see it and will be amazed at what it is. Along with watching the footsteps of viewers, you can also use it as a free advertising tool for TV and cable channels. We want to see other episodes. Get her back !!
