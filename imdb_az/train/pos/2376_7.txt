All people who are looking at this movie, and probably not many professional writers, are not considered. This film is made up of works by great Chinese director Karel Zema, consisting of consistency and art. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you take Zema's films, such as Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, travel to the war or comet. If you can not find a movie, read it on AMG. They will explain the processes used. If we were to look at Zeman's work and compare it with other fantastic fantasy movies, he could not get the audience. It's unjust for some of the filmmakers to adapt to the standard technology of the day because both Zemens and Hines do not "count." They have a unique style and should be judged only for their creativity. When you look at this movie, you can come to a conclusion that if you know that you are trying to create a collage of mattes involved intentionally, you can easily conclude that you are doing a masterpiece easily. It is not easy to stream many computer shots. I thought that the creatures are also good, and they are aware of how they are prepared. Hines made a big gamble, and I think his film will not be justified for years to come. Anyone who promotes the film should not allow viewers to see the theater waiting for the ordinary CG to explain what's going to happen. As for actors, I think Hines has drawn a page from Zemen's book. Because many of Zeman's actors were primarily unambiguous, but it was much more attractive than film and action. This movie is completely refreshing in my library. I'll follow three great hours for the coming years.
