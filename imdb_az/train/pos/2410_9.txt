This movie is one of the most provocative Jesus films I've ever seen. It does not want to explain the whole story, but reflects the interpretation of the last day of Jesus Christ. The elements of the Jewish tradition and the modern sacred interpretation are vigilant, entertaining and serious. Judas is not the darkness and the worst of evil we imagine, but something else is more common, but a great mistake is a great mistake in his longing. Chris Saranden's Jesus is excited and serious, faithful and faithful - many people, at the same time, divine. The last dialogue is fulfilled in a thought-provoking manner and serves small debates that only a powerful person can do when he is exposed to only one conscience. I would watch this movie again and advise others.
