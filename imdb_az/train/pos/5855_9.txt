If PS version contains "Spider-Man", you've seen all this. You really need to get the DC version to live it. Simply put, this is a lot of graphics put on the superior game; The tissues are sharp, the levels are easy to walk and if there is a better sound, then this PS cousin. I got back this game back at 00:00 and still continues to this day. Yes, Marvel: The Ultimate Alliance is a superb and strategic game, but if you're a fan of 'ol Web Head', you owe it to yourself so much for the game library. Spidey fluctuates around the city as it's the best in a video game and has never seen the dead. If you have a Dreamcast, this snag for cheap. The DC version is simply incredible.
