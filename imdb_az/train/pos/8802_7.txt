It is a very interesting project that can be quite bright. 11 outstanding international directors and 11 segments each, 9 seconds and 1 frame to create a selected segment; Discovering the 9/11 global reverberations. Without using any spoilers, I would say that Ken Loach is a jeweler of the crown and Mira Nair deserves to be a complete feature film based on a short story (in the real "India") story. Alejandro González Iñarritu celebrates some of the world's best directors today? he simply has a medium that has a deep understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, all 11 parts are not prepared. Youssef Chahine, in his "Egyptian" segment, suggests the Arabic position of collective sin, which may be potentially the most interesting. He is in a bad state. Chahine's short film, in contrast to other superb chapters of the film, is, at least, fairly written and filthy. Despite the inadequacy of quality, I can film 7/10.
