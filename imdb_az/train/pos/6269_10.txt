A pleasant surprise! I expected to fall down the line again: Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an overcrowded movie. Perhaps, this new type can lead to a small number of Bruckheimer's confirmation. Instead of a fast liner, elegant dialogue was really thirsty when it came to decent background / motivation and chase instead of shake-n-devouring stereotypes. Fanboys waiting for Armageddon rollercoaster: Stay away. It's the only one for smarter motion lovers. Even if it did not bother me, Jolie seemed very little.
