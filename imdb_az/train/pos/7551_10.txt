The best animated movie ever did. This film explores not only the effects of the modern world of animation, but also the departments of human mind, soul and philosophy. When a story tells a big brother that a cat is dead, his little brother sees it and ends his body, but when he wakes up, he is left without a soul. So the two cats go out to find her. I've associated these trips with a lot of things. The history of the world, the Bible, the life cycle, and every time I follow it, I find more hidden topics and metaphors. If you are not physiologically involved, you still love it. Animation is perfect and creative scenes will be added to the screen. For example, the ocean, which flew over time, is retelling a strange and somewhat SNM of God, Hansel and Gretel, who ate soups from the ground. To fulfill, Cat Soup is an absolute treat for everyone. <br /> <br /> PS - Includes extreme violence, not children.
