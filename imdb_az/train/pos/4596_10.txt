It's Jackie Chan's best movie and my personal favorite. After the disastrous USS named James Glickenhaus's "The Protector," Jackie conceived and slapped Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Jackie is the most fierce film, and the audience is a predator in bone-strung stunts. <br /> <br /> Movement is quick and angry, Jackie and his team have really made the most effort to design a battle. The bones were broken, and as you can see in the movies, blood has been shed in the process of making this film. <br /> <br /> The scenario is nothing to do with simple police and robbers. movement. <br /> <br /> So take around the Greeks, open the beer and enjoy it. By the way, the movie was nicknamed "Cam Story" by the crew of the stunt. Why? I'll let you learn!
