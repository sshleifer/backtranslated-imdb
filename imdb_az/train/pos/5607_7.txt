Once I looked at the rent and interpreted it as a horror movie. It uses many tropes of the genre: poor apartment, suspicious neighbors, images, secrets, hallucinations. Hero, Trekkovsky's life was covered with bad, and the secret forces tried to disclose it. <br /> <br /> When I looked at the last time, I objected to this first comment. If this film was a scary movie, it was only horror that the Kafka novel was terrifying. <br /> <br /> Polanski pulled three mysterious films in his career: I do not even have the courage to do so because the heroic development of me has never convinced me; Rosemary's Baby, who is saddened by the evil forces of the hero; <br /> <br /> He is dissatisfied with it and slowly turns to it: he wears his clothes and puts on make-up speaks. But does he have a soul, or he has the best of his wild imaginations? This is a disagreement between real and imaginary things, and Polanski will never solve it, which is a very interesting film. Many events in the film may be associated with supernatural easily available for normal reasons, and may decide what the viewer believes. <br /> Although this is not my favorite Polanski movie, it's a good example of a skillful, flawed, and brutal demonstration. And technically speaking, it is very striking. It is enough to say that the co-founder of the film Philippe Sarde and the legendary photographer Sven Nykvist (Bergman DP) worked on this film. Slow pacing and sometimes unattractive segments may make it difficult to enjoy this movie, but it's an experience.
