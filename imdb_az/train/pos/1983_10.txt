I recently saw a cable channel. The movie is great; I saw that one of the few musical pieces is not ashamed of light and darkness. This describes a large part of the age and many of the beard. Most dance shows continue, but I did not know what to do next. One day I'll go and see it on the big screen, so I see what's going on. But it really raises another level, Oliver Reedin acts as Bill Sayks. It's just about to say thoroughly and not dangerous people, there's something else, some internal demons. He gave me the impression that if you pushed it into the corner, he could do everything. It is almost the character of Sykes on the edge of the argument, just waiting for the trigger. In 1948, I saw Robert Newton's Bill Sykes, and I thought he was just a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance frightened me in my living room.
