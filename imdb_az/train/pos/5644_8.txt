When the US entered the First World War, the government forced Hollywood to abandon propaganda films. <br /> <br /> Pikford plays a young woman who has torn between two men: Jack Holt (German) and Raymond Hatton (French), but his decision <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> when it is immersed (think Lucitia), Pickford has a wonderful scene standing on it. Shears and yells in German origin. Of course, he gets into Holt and Hatton when he is captured as a prisoner of war in the castle. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by Cecil B. DeMille in this movie, through a village bombing Pickford and Holt. They go through a church that destroyed only one wall standing in ruins. It has a huge cross against the wall. When they got up and down, the wall collapsed, but Jesus remained in the middle of the air. <br /> <br /> In a film, a very simple and non-cultural movie is a very real moment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was a very natural actress who always abstained from al-wave histrionics from many other players in the day. He is also very nice. Holt is a very good part of the lead role here. Hatton's okay. The list of actors in the "Extra" section includes Wallace Beery, Ramon Novarro, Colleen Moore, Ben Alexander, Hobart Bosworth, Norman Kerry, Walter Long, James Neill and Edythe Chapman. <br /> <br /> Great movie, but it's interesting to see US propaganda at work.
