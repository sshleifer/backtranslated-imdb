Everyone has now commented on cinematography (better than), personalities (greater than life), structure (chronologically, with multiple appeal to culture of the time). What is missed is a big issue of sociological significance: you focus on something that is more fulfilling and rewarding than the main American culture. <br /> <br /> I was a surfer in the 1970s. We watched 16 mm film at SoCal's local schools. On the morning of the day, I'm going to watch my skin with the radiation temperature, the Hawaiian shirts and shorts and the latest surfing at night. Often, a singer was a filmmaker, he read a script from a paper clip. Sometimes a surf band or proto-punk band adds music. I'm so happy. <br /> <br /> The IT also faced a growing sense of social and institutional level, worrying about earning money and money. Staircase, do not keep in touch with Joneses, push yourself physically and mentally for a moment of joy and joy - the answer to the question is "What is the purpose of life?" At least for Greg Noll, Laird Hamilton, and others, they seem to have enough courageous or fair enough to live with their lives. <br /> <br /> If we do what we want in our lives, it is likely that the society will fall, but it's really nice to see people who are really dreams about it. <br /> <br /> This was really a very surprising message to me.
