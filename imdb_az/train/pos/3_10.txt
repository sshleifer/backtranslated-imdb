"The whole world is in a scene and people" - or something like that. Who says hell, is the theater standing in the orchestra hole or at the door of the theater? <br /> <br /> This movie was a great trial: "Hey, this is a story and you need your attention, you need it" Your active participation. "<br /> <br /> In some cases you need to bring some event , and sometimes you need to enter the story. <br /> <br /> You have not listened to anybody, but that does not mean it.
