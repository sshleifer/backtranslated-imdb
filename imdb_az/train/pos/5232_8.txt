This film is a journey into the mind of a scenario captured by his paradoxical philosophy. Who, 'who am I' and 'who am I?' Investigates no question of the question. This is a brave and thought-provoking venture. There are beautiful scenes, paradoxes like Escher inspired by the imagination, a ship reminiscent of a hand or a wreck. What we say from the writer and what's going on in the film is that we look more closely at the writer that we will talk to her husband, who is leaving for Peru and caring for her baby, a less responsive one she asked in such a dilemma as , she is no longer looking at the child. His wife is back in time and takes a scene, destroys his notes, and helps him to cross the limit to erase himself. The stories that are eye-catching and that hurt me are mostly philosophical. This Maya curtain is about the illusion world. The film paradox needs to talk and think too much in order to prove that it needs to stop thinking. For more than two hours from the Prosecutor's Office's beauty and fast philosophy, the film took me to a silent or shorter film. If it were the manufacturer's aim, it was very good.
