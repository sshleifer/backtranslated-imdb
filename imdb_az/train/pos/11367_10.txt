Caution: can contain spoilers ... <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie three times and liked it every time. Once again, I remembered how good it was. <br /> <br /> HBO TV is as good as most of the movies - it could save the Oscars. Because it was released for television instead of for general distribution. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that everybody knows that if you read other reviews here, this is the story of Andrei Cicatilo, a serial killer. He killed 56 people in the former Soviet Union for 8 years. (3 victims were buried in the ground and could not be found that he was convicted of only 52 out of 53 crimes). The story is in the center of attention, in fact, because the court analyst Victor Burakov played Stephen Rea perfectly. A person exposed to torture must be convinced that although part of the party's hacks he is cautious about finding this murderer, despite his additional obstacles. The film has a scene that touches the end of the movie. In the United States, investigators are denied consecutive murders 18 months after they were unwilling or unwilling because of weak tension and frustration. According to Burakov, Burak has been taking his first break for more than five years. He completed his job three years later. <br /> <br /> In this scene, Fetishov, the supreme conqueror played by Donald Sutherland, says he really admits his self-sacrifice and often apologizes for not knowing that he will give it a break. <br /> <br /> Rea's performance is not something she's doing well, she does not miss somebody, does the scene, or does anything to keep her from painting a man wrapped around hell to find her killer. He is a passionate man, but does not look the same as described in detective films. It sometimes gives rise to explosions when it climbs quietly with most of the time it can stand in such a condition. Rea does lots of things with his face, eyes, does not give much preference. He simply * * * - His character is so deliciously focused on frustration that he really does not find any of them 3 in a year. Of course, that means he does not want more people to die, he just wants some tips to catch this guy. Rea feels like this for us. <br /> <br /> A mutant, who produces such "monsters" during the childhood of Ã‡ikatilo, is convinced that a mutant understands what such a horror and emotion means to live. Characteristics of Cicatillo are well-worked by Jeffrey DeMunn. Perhaps, (perhaps impossible, it is impossible) creates a little sympathy for himself. Perhaps he was worse than us? In either case, his performance is very good. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland, Colonel Fetisov (later upgraded to the General) also works great. Burakov was not much interested in helping the investigation, despite the obstacle. But in the end, it is more than just a helper, he really is helping Burakova. <br /> <br /> Although this film deals with illness, strange and violent, Max Von Sydow has a very nice kind of go to help psychiatrist profile. <br /> <br /> The story is really much more than the killer's killer. Around a very good movie, which is a beautiful exit and a great scenario. Scenarios are able to do the best of this kind of film: give actual events and put them in a dramatic frame inside a meaningful place. <br /> <br /> From 9 to 10 stars
