During the Second World War, Stalag Luft III was the true story of how three British soldiers escaped from the German POW camp. This is the same POW camp, which is a scene for the Big Fugitive, which has killed 50 captives officers by Gestapo and is also a very successful film. <br /> <br /> While the other prisoners of Stalag Luft III were working on three major tunnels known as Tom (known as Tom, Dick & Harry), two entrepreneurs were thinking of setting up a British prisoner wooden horse. placed near the compound wire fence, shortens the distance to be released from this starting point. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​creating the first and subsequent version of the Troy horse has come to them while waiting for "classic" escape attempts and some reverend. Two captured horses, wooden horses, can become complicated and placed almost in the same position near the bazaar. When the volunteer POWS sank on the horse, the runs were under a wire, under the wire, and placed in the woods, with a tunnel under the horseshoe horse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The government says that two of the three cars encountered in Germany were exposed to the danger of invading Europe after leaving the tunnel. In fact, he was fired in three prisons where he was trying to escape (he succeeded in his home). Wooden Horse is a very powerful and realistic feeling and gives you a breakthrough breakout event. The film was shot in the actual locations along the route along which the two escaped escapes. Designed with less budget than The Great Escape, Thriller is more realistic than the Big Escape, Wooden Horse is more realistic and can never be able to hold the edge of the chair for those who are laughing to improve their escape. <br /> <br /> The storyline is crisp and functioning rings are accurate and it is sufficient to completely remove the tension through the film. Wooden Horse is on the same title as one of the sketches, and Eric Williams is the best POW escape story ever made on a movie. Some of the true prisoners were used in the film to demonstrate their existence as a prisoner in Stalag Luft III. I give this movie a good shot.
