<br /> <br /> I did not wait to see the last copy after being able to watch some of the shooting at the Slavic Village - Broadway. <br /> <br /> Last Thursday I was not laughing while watching this movie on Cleveland Principles for a long time in a comedy! It's a great slapstick. The Russo Brothers directed a wonderful job. The whole tower performs the best comedic activity ... No slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors, and he's great as a cut off cut off in this snipe. I was the most characteristic of "Riley" by William H. Macy and Michael Jeter's "Toto," which kept you in "stitches". I believe the whole film is the most fun role.
