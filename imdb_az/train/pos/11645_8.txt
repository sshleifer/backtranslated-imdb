I've been to France on March 5 and love going to this Film Festival. I knew about this Cinémas d'Amérique Latine de Toulouse, but never did. I decided to go, and then I held Cero 4. The film was very surprising. <br /> <br /> This film is a satire on city violence, theft and murder on the streets. In Mexico. A portrait of the city. From a Metropolis. Secure Express Express with Secure Express Express, the dangerous Mia Maestro, was a line of kidnapping, but it was almost a but more serious tone, and I think there is a connection to Cero y 4. A, sort, return story, and how much? At the stunningly powerful Atheist, man was not a satire, but a portrait of the Mexican streets. Nay, it is Hell. A movie that is very intense and hit you in it. It's like the Ethical Suspects, there are some seats and queues, but that's more convincing. Solution: A movie that is very shocking and believes there is no safety on the streets. Stunning dialogue, impressive direction and stunning performances. Cero yo 4, a movie that will soon be forgotten. Shattered and surprised.
