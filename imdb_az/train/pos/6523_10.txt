Of course, the history of this film was "Hollywooded" - but not the only end to history for the masses. In addition to Lafitte, he considers himself French and, therefore, hates the English because it is not just a feeling of patriotism of a nation that Orleans recently took; violated his consent and returned to smuggling, causing his wife Galveston; he was a smaller offender and obedient than a hero * or a swashbuckler. But who cares? This is a fun movie, and we want to see that not all of us, the governor's rude girl, go for a charming fairy tale. Brynner is rising on a more mediocre post to give a charming performance.
