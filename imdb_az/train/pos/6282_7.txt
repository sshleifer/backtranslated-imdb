Nick Cage is a retired car thief who has been struggling to save his brother's life, Giovanni Ribisi, a night when Randall Raines completes his job by stabbing his 50 brothers. He has to bring his old crew together so he can help him to get his slaves out of the Netherlands. Cops were superior to him, so could they take it? He was one of the great candidates for a movie because he was far from an original classic. And you will not expect it too much and distract your brain's thinking, so you do not see the cunning pit, just take the movie for what it takes. You will enjoy the trip. <br /> <br /> Check out the double-invoice with "Fast and Strange" for a high-speed hijinks night, just do not buy your car for a spin later. <br /> My grade: B - DVD Extras: 7-minute Jerry Bruckheimer Interview; Bruckheimer Bio / Filmography; Action Overload: Tap on the view; Big Chase; "0 to 60" feature; "Wild Rides" featurette; Move the Stars; Jalil "Painted in Heart" musical video; The theater trailers for "Shanghai Noon", "Marsa Mission" and "Coyote Ugly"
