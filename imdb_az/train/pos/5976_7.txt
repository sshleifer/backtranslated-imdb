Trick or Treat, Quickie Review A movie turns around this zany romp's 80's heavy metal and horror movies culture - two things I love. So, as you can imagine, this movie has appealed to me very easily. Of course, for no apparent reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a propagandist. <br /> <br /> This film is about a popular high school youth who has been drowned in the "evil" Heavy Metal world, like all our victims. His beloved Metalldude dies, and, of course, is miraculously resurrected - playing his last album back. <br /> <br /> In some cases, he is something he owns. There are many surprising good qualities. Exactly fine special effects, very short nudity, a decent atmosphere, acting nightly (like radio DJ in Gene Simmons) ... All this is actually a good movie movie. But what's really cool is music. Ironic, huh? Well, this "uber-bad" Metal boy rejects the most striking, high noise, crying planet, the Motley Crue planet, and "Metal" is less than the Pop / Hair Metal of the 80's. She is on the lookout for all the clich√©s here, like a gay fairy, "Rock and Roll!" King Diamond is a high enough area to retch. This is really good, besides the ruined musical representation. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
