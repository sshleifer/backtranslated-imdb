I also watched this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was a great movie about adult family relationships. Paul Reiser wrote a film and included a number of similarities to his family. It was entertaining, warm, moving and moving, entertaining. Such a movie would be very good with oral reviews. I would definitely say my friends and family to see this movie. Let's hope you will only have a chance. I regard this movie as one of the best films I've ever seen. No violence, no action scenes, no offense, no sex, so distributors ask if they can not get it or not. Believe me, there are people who usually want to see a movie that costs a lot of typical big box office cash-straps.
