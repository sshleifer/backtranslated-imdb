I have read the Kerching review on the IMDb and have not been positively reviewed. In fact I love Kerching. Kerching builds a website called rudeboy, about a teenager named Taj Lewis, to make £ 1,000,000 for her mother. Only if Taj and his two friends, Danny and Seymour Taji, are deprived of the suspension if the website offers only a few interesting things. I think this show is very funny and I'm very glad to watch it. Player O.K., but it is better, the heroes are funny, especially the Tank's friend Danny Spooner, making her foolish. and another friend of the Crown Seymour. Carlton also said the café's owner was "The Chill." We never see him, we only hear him. Tajin's younger brother Omar and his older brother Missy are also very laughable. Missy's best friend, Kareesha. Almost a few times Taj has almost been exposed. As a comedy, drama-like love and loss of loved ones in Kerching make this program great.
