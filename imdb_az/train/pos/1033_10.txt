What can you say about Schmaltz? The beauty of this film is not American. Some Americans are a moral aspect called to a higher purpose and rising on this occasion. <br /> <br /> The most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelline (Bette Davis's mother and brother). <br /> <br /> Fanny says we "shook with magnolia." <br /> <br /> In the political climate of our day, the features of the people who are lying to us and of course the worst of all, have sank into the 9/11 killers to seek thirst for blood thirst. Despite all this, Mr Bush can not be blamed - we allowed him to lead in this direction and even let his lies be re-elected after his disclosure. <br /> <br /> Today we are watching this movie with a new consciousness: the rise of the power of the speakers in Germany is caused by a defect. The German character, however, is a flaw to humans, which enables us to rationalize everything that will justify our honesty and misery. I do not compare George Bush with Adolph Hitler. <br /> <br /> I simply stress how the leader can be confused by treachery, hatred, and hyper-nationalism. Unfortunately, even though they are immoral, the leaders of our country, those who support them and deepen their heads in the sand will be unhappy even to vote. <br /> <br /> A movie like Reynda Watch reminds us of what we are once more fortunate - a force to improve humanity and we have to achieve even higher goals. > <br /> Geoff
