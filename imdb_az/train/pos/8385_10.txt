This film leads to a bad critic for no reason. Probably by the massive population. Anyway, this is really a very interesting movie. The film is actually a budget-funded movie, an interesting story and beautiful scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie may be for everyone though. If you have Sci-Fi fans reading this, I really would like to read this movie well. The film has crazy ideas. The setting covers countries traveling to war with GIGANTIC machines that all countries have spent on! The world is divided into lands. Everyone can challenge any battle, or rather, 'robot-duel'. The method of war is more pure than the nuclear war, and now everyone wears these masks. A certain thinker is a movie. <br /> <br /> I love movies with small budgets and actually working.
