SIDEWALK is deserving to be a better movie directed by Otto Preminger, who lets the world into the world. And this time, he has the same co-stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENI TIERNEY. <br /> <br /> <strong> It should be said that Tierne will not be used here unless he has more support role. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is a tough night used to engage in a group band until it is accidentally killed by a person during the arrest. Whenever a taxi driver (TOM TULLY) falls, he goes along with the murder investigation, but feels supposedly because he fell in love with cabbie's daughter (GENE TIERNEY). Meanwhile, Tierney looks a little too elegant for the girl she plays here, and does not fit the story's backpack behind the backgrounds. <br /> <br /> The story is a strange turn as an investigation. it was deeper, and there was a silver plate that served as a corner of the head of the murdered man. <br /> <br /> Later, Andrews becomes the essence of morality that develops conscience for his crime. <br /> <br /> This is of interest to the movie Noir, a powerful supporting force. Good access to the Noir field, strongly managed by the Preminger and well played by Andrews and Tierney, despite the slightest easing of his character.
