This is a very good movie. These ideas would have been repeated by Mamet, but never said anything like that. This is, of course, lack of trust and human status. The film thinks we are all criminals, and nobody is innocent. Do you have this game in our society, anyone who has never seen anyone? The film is structured as a Hitchcock thriller. Besides, there is no innocent character. The world is now completely polluted, destroyed, and everyone is involved. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the sound mode. This is beautiful.
