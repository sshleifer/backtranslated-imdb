It was a beautiful example of how to make an interesting movie without great stars and great effects. <br /> <br /> This film tells a true story about the struggles of two African-American women in a ugly century. <br /> <br /> This film reviews our personal prejudices and people are not white, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Good movie with a good message.
