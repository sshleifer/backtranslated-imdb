The tourist season is set on a remote island off the coast of Scotland, and begins to winter, and residents, both people and sheep, live in peace beforehand. Former paratroopers in the English army, Michael Waffel, a local dentist, is not an island where he is born, and his relationship with local artists and cartographers Fiona Patterson (Celia Imrie) is always a little scary, not terribly intense, but dense duck that goes beyond protective instincts The people are for their relatives. When Gafik went out for only one golf tour, the calm of the islands broke down and he found the headless remains of a murdered woman. Now his horrific findings for Insp Inskip (Maurice Roëves) in the Inskip Islands police station to deliver fugitives to the local GP, Dr. Goudry for immediate investigation. A quick search for a murderer, as a missing local woman, is ineffective. In the evening, Michael Gaffin and Fiona, a dead woman, know that Sheila Anderson, a woman from the continent who lives on the island during the winter months. Dove Cottage, a fast-moving home in the home, proves her body's remains to be a murder, but why did not the killer drag a mile over a mile? The suspicion immediately falls on the island somewhat strange. Also, Colonel Howard (Jonathan Newth) is the last person to see when he meets the last ferry. Goudry asks Gaffikin, for some dental practice on the body of the victim, indicates that he or she is shattered with something stronger or something, a dental set of the body appears to point to a human killer, another kind of unknown animal . A sheep predator was found and then a Canadian ornithologist was killed. The island, which spreads through a heavy fog, has fallen away from the mainland and has no possibility of any help, the radius will not work, as it seems, and the phone lines have been cut off. NFO reports and a camouflaged soldier's engagement reveal a secretive mastery behind the rocks on the beach and become complicated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Nightmare Man is based on the novel Vodyanoi Child by David Wiltshire, directed by Douglas Camfield, who has been inventoried by Dr. Kim and Blake's 7th screenplay Robert Holmes and is also experienced in Sci / Fi classics and film experiments. Ship experts genre. Night people, in short, are a well-prepared piece, even smaller symbols, along with the development of solid character, laying out their plans, giving them a solid foundation for a solid foundation. The island setting is probably a genre of a genre used, but one thing I love so far is the fact that the siege is always in the atmosphere, and here's where it is supplemented with an overflowing fog to block all efforts. In such a variety of genres, judicial proceedings are a very easy way to resort to foolishness and melodrama, but giving credit to Camfield always emphasizes credibility. There is a truth about the processes, and victories also speak to Gaelic to further develop this point. If there is a negative thing about the murderer, we are given a reasonable cliché for his killing, but when it is seen with a red filter and fish lens, it just leaves overcill and the film a bit. However, it will be difficult to guess the outcome or identity, or the clues given to the type of assassin are given, but this is an entertaining and very good moving piece. Local Scottish shooting is exceptional; local bamboo Roeves and Cosmo are particularly complacent and like to look at. Imrie, I did not shoot any of the other works, is also very good, and as if in Hammer's production, she showed her body. Getting an ugly, perhaps unhappy outcome, can expose some viewers, but in some cases I'm disappointed, but if you think about it, there are even more horrible additions.
