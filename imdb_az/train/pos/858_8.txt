This film has a rotten core of agile morality and still has a strange sense of justice. Many of us who regularly go to Joos, wanted to "raise" MAN. In this case, "MAN" is represented by several different characters. Mr Keller, who reported on Carla's office. Later, Mr. Paul Martand and the club owner have 70 big debts. And then there is Paul's Parole Officer. There are many questions about this last character approach. The reviewers say that the ping-pong between our two heroes is weak in another well-grounded underground game, increasing dramatically until it's dramatic change in their lives. They are looking at each agent of MAN. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film there is a sense of relief. <br /> <strong> Carla finally slept. His boss is forced to crush. Mr. Club owner is a waste of money in his own bathroom. They get $ $ money. And ... his moral weakness leads him to plunge his crushing husband into the basement (or whatever the police do to catch him) because they do not have to worry about reporting to the Parole Officer. This is a critical subconscious trigger for a locked pocket, which creates us intensively. Do not ever think that another person can get Paul's file to control his freedom; because they are free! They can even escape from it! <br /> <br /> <strong>
