Freddy Krueger, the sleep stalker of science strides from science, continues to come back hoping that the great character actor Robert Englund's 5th dream, dream child.i has the correct number. Rosenne Barr (after Arnold) Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp (who was the first scared in 84), Alice Cooper (Freddy's like a teenage-like teenager) is a family guy (creepy) The effects were very funny and creative, and Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) breckin Meyer in the castle (alien, live and dying) and Amanda Donahue (father well known) had escaped the first 3d wave in 1953 (still not born) The second wave was in 1983. Like all Freddy movies. Freddy has become a new monster of the 80s and 90s, and this is one of the best that does not count the first ones that are completely bright. Jason voorhees, lucky, with Micheal myers and the skin face. If you imagine a movie with all this, I invite you to Freddy's fans and fans of fear. Freddi is such a person from 10.
