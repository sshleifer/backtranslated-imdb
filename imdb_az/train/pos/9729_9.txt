Weak start, solid middle, fantastic workout. Anyway, this movie is my impression. Simon Peggy liked him in two films: Hot Fuzz and Dead of Shaun. His role here was totally different. <br /> <br /> His "jokes" and minds are not really painful or difficult moments. The character of Bean plays Rowan Atkinmson as much as. There are also some other comedian actors that feature similar characters. <br /> <br /> But be warned that you do not like smarmy and maddeningly bumpling fools, just like Pegg shows such features. the third part of this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> Hmmm. Can be. The story of the movie stopped hustling and became the summit of the last third "little boy". <br /> <br /> I do not need a movie to make the film sugar and light, but by chance, as the movie gets better, it's getting even happier. To see the old love, Jeff Bridges plays a very skillful role. I liked the "Iron Man", but it was sad that the nature of the bridges was a villain. Undoubtedly his personal taste, of course, was perfect. Nevertheless, he was surprised by the visionary, the Sharps publisher. <br /> <br /> Generally I like it! I was only 40 minutes late and I missed the start.
