That was the reason why people scared this movie! That is, the purpose of the film is that some people see it. When I first saw this movie, I was scared and did not think about life and religion. This is not a blood and a horror film, but you think there may be things that can happen as the film is written. Of course, non-believers will only say a fantastic movie. Truth, this movie should be a must have for a tension collection, even if it's a religious look. If you are an admirer of the classic thriller (Omen..etc), one of them and it must be. Finally I saw (Far Thunder), but I believe it remains where the movie ends.
