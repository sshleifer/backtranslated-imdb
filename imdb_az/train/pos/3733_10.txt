There was a brother who committed suicide after serving in Vietnam due to mental illness after his return. So when I saw a portion of a movie on a night pay-for-view channel I was curious. When I'm ready for Vietnam, I want to know if my uncle crosses and feels. I went out and rented this movie, and I have to say that this is the most heart-stretching film I've ever seen. I got the DVD immediately after renting. It emotionally draws me in a very different direction, and it's something I've never experienced in any other movie. As for the Vietnam issue, Plato is considered one of the best in spite of the second second. Besides all this, I think Colin Farrell is the best actor in the world. I love her, but it was incredible in this movie. I gave these 10 ratings because this is one of my first five favorite movies.
