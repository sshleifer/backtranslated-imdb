I love this episode of Columbo. Perhaps, it is as beautiful as Abigail Mitchell, who is in Ruth Gordon and the American version of Dame Agatha Christie, a successful writer. He deserves to be regarded as numerous, beloved writers exposed to the terrible loss of his brother when he dies in a drowning accident. He blames his nephew, his nephew. The police plan to kill his death after leaving. I would love Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I do not love Hartle personally. And, of course, when he asks Colombo to give Veronica a belly dance class, she laughs a bit. Ruth Abigail himself is a clever line, and with Columbo he always sees ideas that are beautifully played by Peter Falk.
