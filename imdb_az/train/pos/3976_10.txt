I've seen the drug years on VH1 and love it. I think it reflects the history of medicine and, most importantly, sends a strong message to all generations. There are mosquitoes, Joplin, Hendrix, and Jim Morrison are dead, there are many examples of drug use and drug use. It covers both the time and the development of drug use in America both in good and bad ways. In my opinion, this documentary work is good and I congratulate its creators because there is a need to play on television lately. I'm waiting for DVD release. You Must See It !!! This movie is stunning - ALL TIME!
