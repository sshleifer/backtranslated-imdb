Lost, probably the best t.v series ever did. The story is clever and when all the questions are answered while watching an episode, more than 100 are raised. it can continue its magnificent ways if it is lost and is not too far away, then the best show will be the staple. The victims of the plane crash are forced to live with each other on a remote island, a new, dangerous world, creates a threat to their own. How can you be interested in this idea on earth? and heres replies, SO FAR of every season has always been full of surprises, always self-questioning why it just happened and every time what happens, the very unexpected thing happens and the story goes beautiful SO FAR! The series only sludges you, is very calm and very addictive, making everything from beautiful creators and shooting spectacular performances creates a very convincing story. Lost is simply incredible, incredible, highly entertaining, top notch, t.v in the best way. <br /> <br /> All the other defeats that have been lost have lost a landslide. And do not know how to watch t.v or watch a drama if you hate or criticize Lost. Lost would simply not fail, thinking that you can not get a lot better than a longtime running. But it does! It's just something you just want to think about. "Everything happens for one reason." And this is really shown in the series. Finally, you'll reach a point, all the tips have happened, and anything else that has happened or done has been added. You will notice how the heroes have changed and how and why everything is going on. <br /> <br /> A 10-minute excitement: If you see something you do not come up, something great happened on the character or the island. There is hope for somewhere. You'll see a huge twitch that can change or change everything. You've heard the tale of your thoughts, what will you be next? Your heart is beaten. 30-Minute Shine: If you see flawless scenes, a tension building, you hear beautiful music by Michael Giacchino. You see a great flashback, an effective player. <br /> <br /> Everyone is addicted to it, can not get enough, is surprised every minute and, at least, say the next episode, talk about 24/7. Too many and many of these series. Lost. Once you start watching, you will not be able to get enough. Developers did a perfect job. Lost is completely unique and original, so you will not see anything. "Flashbacks and flashforwards" and thoughts of something big and different in every season, thinking your mind. Would they ever make a series like "LOST"? Something is interesting and you will always remember it. This, t.v. He was surprised when he shot. A new generation of dramatic / exploration. <br /> <br /> <strong> "I do not believe in you," he says. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The characters start to be very unpleasant, and if you want to see Lost in more detail with your critique, learn how relationships between characters develop and explore the problems of the island, and how to solve problems - all this is a great drama and a flawless sequence. I do not think there will be a decline in missing episodes and it will go away ..... So, if you are not missing, read it from above, and change your mind .I will never see it until I begin to explain it .I believe this witness strongly come to LOST! Start watching!
