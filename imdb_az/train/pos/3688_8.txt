Today is a movie by some of the best directors in industry. <br /> <br /> My favorite segments: <br /> <br /> 14th Terrain: Carol (Margo Martindale) <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> br /> <br /> Loin du 16ème: A view of Paris that we know well since the Cités riots. Anne (Catalina Sandino Moreno) takes more time thinking of himself as another child (taste). <br /> <br /> Quartier Latin: Gérard Depardieu "tenancier de bar" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is very good. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is a very good thing. Ludivine Sagnier is also. <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie wants me back! <br /> <br /> Barcelona (another big city) was on March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
