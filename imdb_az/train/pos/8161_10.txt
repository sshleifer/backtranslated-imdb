When I saw the teeth, I thought it was too cool. But this movie has many heroes scenes, not everyone, especially people who do not like scenes like a dentist. That's why it's R18 rating. Here is a doctor, Dr. Alan Feinstone, about a hilltop that finds his wife Brooke cheated by a pond. It's good to go to your dentist before "watching it." But if you do not like to go to the dentist anymore, it's best not to watch it like you've been extinguished all the time. The dentist has the best bloody revenge he has ever seen. Anyone who sees a movie with no dental surgeon (Spoiler) pulls his teeth off all his treacherous wife and cuts his tongue through anesthesia? Generally awesome flick, but not for everyone.
