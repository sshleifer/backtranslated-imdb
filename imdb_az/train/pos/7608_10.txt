I watched the first series with enthusiasm, but wondered if I would go back again after a long time. Nevertheless, I was rooted in one of the episodes of Series 2 and still had a curve. This is really a great wire; Things that fall into the ground like mission: it is not possible in the 1960s. The heroes are well rounded up and expanded while they continue to series, they change as they fit - they are relatively new to their new circles, but they are cleverly characterized by the fact that it is like you do not ever think that you will never apologize for something really crushing . Hopefully, "Lost" will be many years to wait - and if I never answer all the secrets, I do not really think about it all!
