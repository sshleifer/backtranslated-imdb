At the opening night of the vantage, a woman was found dead on the stage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> According to recent events, unfortunately, nobody gave me information about the music that I did not go to. Numbers, of course, despite Hollywood's fame, may try to move around, but they can interrupt the film because they stop dead. If the music were semi-pretty, it would not be so bad, but not. There is only one good song. There is a song in the studio, and we have to endure four versions of cocktails knowing it's two songs. Dance, great production, Vanities finale and music in the background accidentally. I do not think Spike Jones and his City Slickers have played so much. The rest of the film is perfectly fitted with Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie. Charles Middleton is so funny that scenes like an actor who is in love with his wardrobe love. <br /> <br /> If you think you can pass through musical numbers or scan them through. Their entertaining movie, they will not do more.
