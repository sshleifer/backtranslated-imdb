Seven young people will go to the forest looking for a bear. Finally, they were assassinated and killed by a bloody Vietnamese veteran. "Trampa Infernal" tells me that a lot of "The Zero Boys" are moving forward at speeds and have good death scenes like neck throbbing or ax. Unfortunately, there is nothing strange, so fans of grand-guignol will be disappointed. But if you are an admirer of slasher movies, give a look of this rarity The sensational appearance of the horror of the place is quite dark (I just do "Alucarda" and "Do Not Panic"), therefore there is another reason to see this nice slasher.
