I was watching this movie accidentally, I was interested in a trailer on the TV. I like these films when I find small, similar stories about ordinary people. Despite the last disaster, the "man in the moon" has some funny moments that have been described by the Court for the first time with the innocent and basic lover of Dani. This is a beautiful, moving love story with 3 high points: Reese Witherspoon is the true soul of a beautiful filmmaker with the fantastic frontman of the "Old Lion" Freddie Francis and beautiful James Newton Howard's fantasy account in the cinema world. His themes (deserving the Oscars nomination) are very simple and lyrical, so they have turned the scenario into music.
