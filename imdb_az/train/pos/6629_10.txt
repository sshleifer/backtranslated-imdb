The best Treasure Island ever did. They can no longer make films like this or that. Nobody likes this movie. More than just a novelty, this movie is funny, sincere and attractive, but moody is mysterious and intricate. This is one of my favorite pictures. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a kind of remembrance of the good ones. But this is not lazy and straightforward.
