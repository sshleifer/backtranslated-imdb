"October Thunder" is a movie that stirs up your heart, surprises your mind, and lifts your spirit. Homer Hickham's tale and the desire to create a rocket, in the first place, seems to be primarily simple when it is put in a mining town where the film is as clear as the pieces of coal in a coal mine. But Homer can not follow the footsteps of his father. <br /> <br /> Like the real life story, Miss Riley (friend teacher), along with his father's crew members and friends, tries to realize Homer's desire. There are many stops along the way. Director Joe Johnston puts us into coal mines that are witnessing the cold state of miners put under the coal peak. People with burning helmets and bent ones resemble more alien insectoids than people in the dark. Miners' hacking coughing and dark faces were a constant reminder of the dangers facing workers. <br /> <br /> Homer and his friend have rocket launchers compared to the lugubrious load of mine shaft. Under the blue blue bowl, rockets are placed on a pad and thrown into the stratosphere ... When you see Homer Sputnik for the first time, nothing is in the scene. <br /> The frustration is between the characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man ... but he has a soft side. We see that he loves his son despite many arguments. Miss Riley's love and support are also evident. The best movie, worries. It does not fit everything in a beautiful summer. He tears you up. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete job. At first, I was disappointed that the film did not last Homer's life. I did not want it to end. Then I realized ... what is a good movie about a man. If you do the job, you will not want it to end. And the "October Sky" is just doing it.
