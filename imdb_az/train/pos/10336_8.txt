As we have seen earlier, it is difficult to follow. Considering the horror films that emerged after the Second World War - Dachau's "liberty", it is beautiful. As in the midst of war, we knew exactly what happened to the Jews. The consistency of a "transport" is based, in fact, on an actual newspaper (the Nazis wanted to write their own oppression). Nazi peas are brilliant. Describes the course of Nazi career. This description says that when it was contrary to the reaction of the other Germans, he first laughed at Hitler, then incredible and finally helpless. On the contrary, a young Nazi officer can be convinced of the "conversion" to the "anti-nazi" position. This, as a witness, had several attempts against Hitler, in particular, the Staffenberg area, which took place in the film. A powerful film that accurately predicts Nuremburg's paths and others that can occur after the end of the war.
