17 years ago, I showed it to the 6th class and the students loved it. I liked it too. The story of Termites and their interaction with the environment are quite beautiful. The creations are deep and they all feel good. The battle between the two cold-wing titans is really classic imagery. <br /> <br /> Alan Root has done some amazing camera work, and it was the best documentary Oscar winner. I do not have Orson Welles called Derek Jacobi, and it is not called "Clay Castle", just "Clay Fortresses". <br /> <br /> He thinks that Velles has been added to the starry power and the Oscars. <br /> <br /> I'm lucky enough to find this VHS lately and is now a favorite movie of my kids. They brought the Disney movie to the latest family gathering. You can find this movie really lucky.
