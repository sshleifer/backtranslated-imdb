The painter's magazine's photographer Adrien Wilde (played by Michael Callan a bit heavily) has terrible nightmares that brutally killed his models. Adrien is worried that a murderer may be killed when the pretty women actually die. Writer / director William Byron Hillman explains a staggering pace at a staggering pace and creates a reasonable amount of tension, providing a series of terrific effects of single misogynistic violence (a woman with a naked bag and a rubber garbage bag placed over another rates, definitely emphasize the indicator), gives fresh attention to beautifully drawn and exciting characters, gives a basis for everything in a more acceptable world of daily life, and tastes beautifully nourished by the delicate woman's nakedness. Joanna Pettet is a sunny, charming lover, Mindy Jordache, Adrien Couleur amputee brother BJ James Stacy, Seymour Cassel, Adrien's psychiatrist Dr. Frank Curtis, Don Potter Gay Assistant Louis, Adrien's feisty, Pamela Hensley is a heroic murder detective Sergeant Bulaga, a heavyweight police chief like Cleavon Little, and a sweet, bubbly model, like Bambi, like Misty Rowe. R. Michael Stringer's polished cinematography uses impressive time breathtaking panoramic air strikes. Jack Goga's failure is also a trick. An extremely fierce female freestyle wrestler, B.J., is one of his opponents in the ring, Katie Shower, and one of his standard older women's roles, such as the Frances Gulf, Robert Tessier as Sally Kirkland. Solid and pleasing picture.
