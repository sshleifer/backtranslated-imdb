One of the joys of collecting the last Bela Lugosi collection begins with the beautiful movies like The Invisible Ray. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi filmed a meteorite and radiation film, and science was totally absurd (especially Janos Rukh, the camera technology used to designate a meteorite site) and did not hire a laughing film because the movie was totally pleasant. Effects are good for the time, the actor is good and is extremely powerful. It is reminiscent of pulp fantasy novels and novels dating to the 1940s and 50s, with ray guns and funny science. You need to watch this movie!
