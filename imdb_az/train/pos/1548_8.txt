Fortunately, I do not know anything about this movie, I'm really interested in bandwidth on television. And then the tape fled just five minutes before it ended! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There are always submarines and a few foggy puppets, and there are many cold and even brave moments. Taking into account the production of 1969, some brownie flavors should be raised. Surely, it does not surprise anybody, and these scenes can actually look pretty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < strong> Very effective. Ideas from both opponents give the whole story a sense of confusion and depth throughout the movement. This is only a heroic story of a winner, but it shows what is behind the good and the bad. <br /> <br /> This is also important for fans of composer Ennio Morricone. His work is always excellent, touching, but never over. And I have to try to capture more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√©ulein! Let's hope this DVD soon, so I can take all the movies in my collection, and more and more people will get to know this very little ship.
