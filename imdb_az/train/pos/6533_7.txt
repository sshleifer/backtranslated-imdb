I say that it is not very interesting to talk about fashion and strange ways to solve a mystery. A little too simple, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... it's fantastic! I really liked this part of the movie ... <br /> <br /> Corky is not quite funny ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) looked really desperate ... she should have been more <br /> < br /> Here's a movie and a masking fashion. Anyway, this movie comes only for summer entertainment. Encore Nancy is for fun only. More teenage spy movies by Emma Roberts .. Remember Spymate ...? This difficult detective is getting better.
