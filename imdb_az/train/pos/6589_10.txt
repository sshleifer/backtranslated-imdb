I liked this show for the first time, and I was always interested in watching every episode every week. Fields, characters, posters, special effects were outstanding! Then the scientific philosophy channel again began to bend and abolished a very entertaining, well-written show. I tell him to return it, I know that all actors will come back. I would like to buy DVDs, but. Hopefully, the leaders of fantastic channels will take the words of these comments and understand that they need to be more involved with their audience. I'm just watching a show on this channel (Ghost Hunters), but I am sure that they will soon cancel it.
