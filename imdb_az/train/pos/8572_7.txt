The first movie was beautiful, but nice and attractive as I found it was not as good as the animation classic. It is less then, but not worse. Undoubtedly, the slapstick is much, the script has weak points and there is nothing scattered. But the dogs here are very sweet and cheerful as Eric Idle macaw. The film is beautiful with stylish cinematography and eye-catching suits (especially Cruella's) and the music is pleasant. The player is very good, Ioan Gruffudd applies and Gerard Depardieu enjoys Cruella's assistant when he performs well. But the best asset, as in the first movie, was Glenn Close, with a superior performance like KÃ¼lyella, even worse than before. Generally, it is beautiful. 7/10 Bethany Cox
