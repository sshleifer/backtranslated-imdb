] Did you see this movie? Did not you even hear this movie? It did not surprise me. One of the few "independent" films produced in the last decade did not believe in any studio picture, and was never chosen for basic distribution. Independent Films Company has provided BOESMAN and LENA with virtually no campaigns, and most of the major film critics have not had any difficulty reviewing it. <br /> <br /> Imagine a movie based on some acts, playing a bunch of apartheid, and the impact of two people's experiences in today's market - really a loss of intelligent movie lover. It should be noted that both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover won the Ocsar nomination (such as a cinematographer), but the film has not been blamed for such an academy that has accepted such a flaw. This is a difficult, thoughtful and heartfelt film, and in fact requires the audience to meet their requirements. Given this, it's definitely not a movie for fun fun. The director Berri cleverly does not try to decorate Atlet Fugard's game. Of course, we have given some torn flashbacks and some breathtaking scenes, but BOESMAN and the LENA movie version are generally two stories of people living in an inhuman environment. <br /> <br /> Their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) did not have anyone to attack each other. The third character is a little bit attached to them (Willie Jonah plays a very quiet role), but the theme of the movie is never dependent on the headline characters and what they do. Bassett and Glover can give brave speeches as a broken couple, simply spells that can not be developed. BOESMAN and LENA are worthy of re-opening their intellectual and emotionally powerful and cruel, home-made videos. Hands down, the best film of 2000.
