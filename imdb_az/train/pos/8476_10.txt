*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> When I was 3 years old, my father charged this movie for me. By the time I was 5, I was watching over 400 times. I just watched and watched it. And still I am today! Hero's mother was killed by a monster - a very emotional scene and wants to be like a monster like her. Years later, the lamb is looking for something really bad. He and the wolf travel to the old warehouse, but they can not kill the lambs as much as they like. <br /> <br /> He killed the wolf, but can no longer be regarded as a lamb by his former comrades and can not return to his previous lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Art is beautiful, there are songs. <br /> <br /> You only have to * see this movie, it's a great work. Although it is hard to find today. <br /> <br />
