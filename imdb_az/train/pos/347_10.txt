My darling is now one of my favorite films. Death scenes are complex and most actors are good. Marley Shelton was beautiful as a female presenter (better than Jennifer Love Hewitt in "I Know ..."). The main reason I saw this movie, David Boreanaz played very little, but played well. Exception to the list of good players is Denise Richards. It was terrible too. The only scene I enjoyed seeing him was SPOILER * his death scene. All this is a good movie to watch. You should definitely tell before watching again "Scream" or "I Know ...".
