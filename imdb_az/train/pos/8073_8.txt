A brilliant portrait of Victor McLaglen, Oscar-winning performance, with his own conscience. McLaglen's Irina plays an IRA rouge that betrays her leader for a reward during the Sinn Fein rebellion. Scenarios and movements are very realistic, focusing on despair in individuals. Lack of hope for a better future looks like a fate worse than death. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford creates a dark and tense atmosphere rich in foggy and dark images of the Irish landscape. Max Steiner's dramatic music star adds cinematic taste. Oscar Winner for Best Screenplay, Best Picture Award This is one of the Hollywood Classics.
