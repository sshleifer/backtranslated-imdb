One of my favorite films. There are all the coolest 80th stereotypes - Eddie Clark, the former Motorhead, the loads of movements, the laughs' burdens, the absolutely ridiculous plot and characters - noisy noise. Eddie is like a good man, Leslie (as old as he is), Nuke (Edge), Eddie's mother (Rogue), Roger (geek) and Ozzy (who are in America?) Who want to remain alone? Then there are boys (rich, bad and stupid) and girls (idle, empty and stupid). <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-size: What is the guitar that fires rocket? From here, Sammi comes from the TV screen the old lady pulls it down and crashes it .What is Roger doing? Why does Tim Hainey, my favorite scene, get a long - delayed prize from his finger with a plug - in magic? <br /> <br /> If you've been in the rock in the 80s or you love ridiculous movies like me, then check it out on the DVD and treat yourself very cheap (trickery).
