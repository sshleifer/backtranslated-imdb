And I'm Nicole Kidman fanatics. I'll pay for reading and hearing a phone book in Moscow. As far as I know, he could do this in Russian when he was in the movie. <br /> <br /> Four directors are wise, but the film itself has many good images and good scenes involved. <br /> <br /> While one is always ready to stop the blasphemy, while watching a movie, it asks many viewers. <br /> <br /> It could have been funny (in those parts) or pretty scary (as it was on stage), but the director did not know what to do.
