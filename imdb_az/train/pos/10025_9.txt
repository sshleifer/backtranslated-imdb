This should be the unique twist of the two genres. Giant monster movie genres in the genre of live mummies. It is a unique, unique and compelling story. TOM BOSLEY, I never knew, had never been in a horror movie before. Impressive is a giant mummy idea full of cute and tiny mummies. My only complaint is that we just saw a giant mummy, but then I think it's another job. The dialogue, characters and story were perfect. The act was amazing. This should be the best movie to go out of this fantastic channel. You've heard the best movie to go out of my science career. I give FALLEN ONE 10 10.
