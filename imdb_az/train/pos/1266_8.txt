I read some of the previous comments that this movie has lost steam toward the end of the film and also ended up similar to Cape Fear. Completely agree. There will be a simple review for those who are watching the normal movie. I thought the cast was perfect. I thought Ed Harris was one of the best performances. What a bad psychopath! After seeing his performance in this film, I have a great respect for his performance. It hit me during the movie. If you like the mystery, this is definitely a movie you want to see. I also saw the young Scarlett Johannson in this film. This movie is populated by top stars and I strongly recommend it!
