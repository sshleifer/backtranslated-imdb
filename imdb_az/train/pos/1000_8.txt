I liked the movie. Some of the moving scenes were very interesting, tense, and good. Especially I liked the opening scene with half a truck. <br /> <br /> Some transition scenes have been drawn with interesting pictures, such as time patterns, unusual colors, or interesting angles. The film also consists of several parts. I liked how the bad guy was described. I would give the movie 10 to 8.
