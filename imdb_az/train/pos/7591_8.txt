A mixture of genres, but basically based on Stephen Chow's works of art. There are several mouth melodrama for magic kung-fu, college romance, sports, gangster movements and a topping. <br /> <br /> In this movie, it's easy to miss many flaws. <br /> <br /> A baby is left next to a basketball court. A homeless man brings him to the Shaolin monastery in the center of a city and conducts a special kung fu textbook for a homeless person reading but can not read. The old priest teaches the boy, but when he tries to bring up a special technique in the textbook, it ends. The school is run by a fake kung fu masters, supported by four unreasoning monks. The new master is saddened by a 20-year-old boy who is no longer acting like a wounded by weak blows and throws him overnight. The boy throws a garbage dump at an incredible distance from a man who brings him to the gangster club to play darts. <br /> <br /> This is a big fight, the boy's removal from the monastery, and the boy's decision to turn him into a college basketball feeling. <br /> <br /> This is the first 20 minutes, and most of the first 10 minutes. In addition to the extreme scenario, we also know little about our main character until the first problem comes into the movie. The guy who uses the boy is sharply identified when he first ends. Territory takes a new place, except for the film's terrible movements. I am convinced that you can imagine how crafty monks will look until the end. Impacts, photography and stunt work are all top notches and are prepared for areas that are not cluttered. <br /> <br /> Stephen Cow's composition and comedy writings have a better command, and this film will live in his shadow, but there is no good reason to ignore it. Something even fun with a devastating shot. Recommended.
