I felt that this movie was thrown out well before hitting the theaters, and I did not have great hopes for it. I thought some nice dance moves and a strange actor were another "You Got Service". I've been to the theater, and in the meantime, I decided to meet Spartans and chose it. I was surprised that the player was not bad and the movie was really good. The fact that you have fewer ratings than you've served is ridiculous. Instead of listening to the trash here, I come to see a movie showing this movie, so you do not spend too much. I think you will be surprised at how wrong it is about everyone. As for dance films, this is certainly one of the better ones that works in comparison to others. See the movie and the referee for yourself. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "> </ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; More than 1000 people are a little too high, giving 9 degrees to this degree, but at least reducing the noise of at least 1 voice.
