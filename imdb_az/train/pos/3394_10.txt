On Omega Man DVD, I took the B side and watched the movie kindly. The Omega Man was a bit of a frustration - the original, the rest of which is clear after 28 days, except for the start, just TV movies. Soylent Green is in another league. I think this is one of Tarantino's favorites. There are at least three scenes in the film that I have never seen before. Heston accidentally came into bed with "furniture" while discussing something else completely incompatible! Many people are protected by a fleet of mechanical sparks! A confessor who admitted and admitted by a confessor. Probably perhaps because of this - but there are so many sequences of original films. And what is the heck between Heston and Edward G. Robinson? Is this the most difficult gay couple, or what? Fortunately, I saw this movie without knowing it ended - it's rare. Then I watched it and loved all the little tips that made long early scenes. A very nice script - and some great sets. Just when you think you see everything. . .
