This film is likely to have no sheets on the radar screen, but it's a bit of a quality. It's pretty lively, but you think "it's just a movie." Duvall and Close people describe common people, and even do not realize that they are already the actors of the great name. As you can see, this story is a bit old to follow Eugene's girlfriend, but it is possible. The child would go from Montana to Nevada, but I think it is possible. In this film, you may think that family problems will never happen in your own family, but it is possible. Like Glenn Close, "What you're doing is the most difficult part of your life, but it's not."
