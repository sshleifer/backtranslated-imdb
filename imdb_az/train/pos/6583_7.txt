This is a fierce affair with Charles Augustus Milverton, a long-time episode, surprise, tension, mystery, and anxiety associated with the ideas of Sherlock. This is a very long time from Jeremy Brett Holmes series. <br /> <br /> Although it appears to be Holmes's author, Lestrade and Hudson, in the film, it is the biggest villain Charles Augustus, although no Moriarty. <br /> <br /> This intrigue, excitement and excitement with unnecessary yarn rope, an exciting last bending. This is a special Sherlock movie, but we are in love with Holmes a slave, kissing, crying, and even peeling. In addition to Irene Adler and Bohemia's Scandal episode, Holmes is the only outcome this time. The best note is Brett's performance, along with Peter Cushing, the best Sherlock TV, and the film is Basil Rathbone forever. Brett acts as decisive, proud, angry. Here, Dr. Watson is not a cunning pawn manifested by comic, botker and Nigel Bruce, but a delicate and cunning partner by Brett's perfect contractor, Edward Hardwicke. Casting is obviously a great thing, Robert Hardy is a very awesome blow. Hardy, known for the role of Cornelius Fudge at Harry Potter today, is a veteran actor with the 10th kingdom and Winston Churchill, forty years of career and many successes. Additionally, Nickolas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon, and others. The film is beautifully viewed in a colorful atmosphere, London Street and the 221 Baker Street House. The film is best managed by Peter Hammond, the director of various episodes. This is for Arthur Conan Doyle fans.
