Jane Austen's Emma is an extremely enjoyable story from the worst, and the story of this story is the best I've ever seen. Kake Beckinsale's Emma is flawless. Gwyneth Paltrow, with the help of a good scenario and excellent cinematography, can effectively empower the comedy, Emma delights. Paltrow's hair loss just looks like a "wrong" part (and I believe in the era) and empire line dresses as a positive disease. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, easily controls the comedy, and can still show what Mr Knightly really is doing (Jane Austen's most romantic characters). Mark Strong is a remarkable Mr. Digital, with beautiful images, proper mix of proper age, affection, compassion and gentlemanly conduct. Emma and Mr Knightly are backed by the support of good actors and generally enjoy the production.
