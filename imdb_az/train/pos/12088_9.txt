Hardcastle and McCormick feature an excellent TV show. <br /> Yes, it's Hazzard, Hunter, A-Team, and so on. and others as predictable. <br /> <br /> This show is just a good clean television. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite entertaining. They often shoot an episode several times each other, adding a lot of humor to the show. This is followed by a few cars in almost every episode, but who does not follow a good car? Especially with Coyote! <br /> <br /> I just want to have such a clean TV today!
