Despite this standard "Revenge Price Plots", this movie is my favorite work of Vincent Price. Gallico has a quality that is missing in so many fears film characters. When you look at it, you feel its disappointment, the injustice it has done with it, and you agree with it when it comes to revenge, though it is a little scary with its original anger. As the film continues, his character became active. He committed the murder, but he had to kill him to cover it. And to cover again. And yet ... your stomach is like a bone, and your beloved brother turns his head into a title. Even though the story of Revenge is old, the devices themselves are genuine - Gallico uses the tricks he uses to kill more inventive. A shame will return to this home.
