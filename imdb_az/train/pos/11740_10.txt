Critics do not doubt that this film, especially the artists in need of laceration, has stopped the fartsys. This is a great tool for Abbot & Costello or recently the Don Knotts tradition. The world will not shake or change the movie. We look forward to what to do. Everything is the most important thing when it is said and done. Follow this movie and forget about your difficulties. There is even an extra free and simple message. I always loved Elvira's television show when I lived in LA. He really did not steal more than Vampira himself, more than Theda Bara's Vampire. It belongs to everyone who does the best of mythical character; & Cassandra Peterson is doing well. Long live Elvira; We need more such films. There is never. Dear, William Morgan Sheppard was also excellent. He is cleansed of beautifully treasured betrayal. I could not find any technical shortcomings. Impeccable as an executive art form. My director James Smith and my whole crew are my deepest praise.
