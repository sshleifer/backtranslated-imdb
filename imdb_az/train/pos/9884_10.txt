Rawhide was a wonderful television western series. Focus on a group of traces of traces led by Trail Manager Gil Gil. The most episodes were really character investigations from Fevr and his men, especially from the first three seasons. The guest stars came and went, but unlike Wagon Trail, they managed to rarely manage the episodes they had emerged. Rawhide was a true, strange western, and made him look like a memorable character that would not be forgotten. The show was a massive hit because of Eric Fleming's speech. Of course, good players were supported by Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, and Robert Cabal. All of these actors have left their mark on part of television history. Rawhide had the taste of the West at that time, so no series gave me any sense, so she managed to do it. The next season tends to share potential and give individual story lines. For me, this was an unlucky time - a livestock driver and regular best-selling stories. However, there were still some classic stories and Rawhide had a high pull job. Black and white photography, in addition to a strange part, has rarely been able to capture the other western series. Rustlers, Indians, Commancheroes, angry heroes, serial murders, all of us have exhibited heroes problems. When it lasted less than half the last season, it came to the last series. The reason for this was that Eric Fleming set off and Rawhide was already an absurd head - a strange reality, Gil Gilk, commanded respect and leakage - he was not groundless and made him even more interesting. We will never see him again. Always watch an episode, rarely disappoint.
