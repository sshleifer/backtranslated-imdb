Jack Frost is about a serial killer who was sentenced to death. On the way to death, he is a prison machine traveling with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that has been transformed into a liver, where a molecule turns into snow. A killer essence that will make him a murderer snowman. Jack now wants revenge on the sheriff holding him. <br /> <br /> His wife, Jack Frost, has the chance to become a terrible classic, but I do not think like a fun flick. Just wait and have fun with your brain, but do not take it seriously.
