A striking rendezvous at a local video store, I was delighted to find Oliver Stone's worthy media satire to challenge the "Naturally-Striked Strikers". And it is almost unsettled. In my opinion, at the end of 2004, I watched the Republican car watching the majority of American television channels watch. "Are we really manipulating?" Raises the question. <br /> <br /> This was definitely my idea. The story of Christ - a great divine question that led to provocation. Can Television be so addicted to speech and conversation as to creating a Christian? Is the story of Christ exaggerated? Can it be totally fabricated? The film is a very sensitive light.
