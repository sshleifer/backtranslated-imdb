A film in which Charlie Kaufman is pleased with himself, like "Synecdoche, New York," comes in a difficult movie to watch a three-important movie the same way. "Frownland" is a love crew of actors and filmmakers. Its completely original, REAL follows a person who can not communicate with the Brooklyn world. The people you see are a step beyond the stylistics of the "mumblecore" movement. They are real people who are suffering from painful neuroses themselves, who do not want to change. The real world of them is their deception, and this is a film about people who are not very dissatisfied because it is very difficult to watch. It is not possible to capture 16mm movie, light, money, or other factors that make the movie "slick", but it is not possible to clarify its honesty, giving a person a full-fledged workplace and Richard's award as Linklater SXSW. It remembers movies like "Naked" or "mumblecore". It's not a movie for everyone, but it's a growing problem for you to watch and think about.
