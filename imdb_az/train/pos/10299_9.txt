I'm a great Jim Carrey fan. Lias Liar and Ace Ventura laughed at my ASS. I love him in his serious films, especially at the Truman Show. It is a cross between the very funny side and its serious side. She is, of course, very funny, but very serious parts in this movie, and it draws her very easily. <br /> <br /> I'm happy with Jennifer Aniston's players. In my opinion, it's more than just a few beautiful tits and big donkeys. Morgan Freeman is very cool God. As for Steven Carel, his limited scenes, especially in the plaque, are very funny. <br /> <br /> Generally, I should evaluate it. 9. A good toy, a funny script and some very serious cases are a good movie.
