To be fair, I was waiting for the car to follow the movie. There was only one truth, but apart from that, Freeway was a great movie because I owned a DVD. The only major names in the cast are HOMICIDE's radius psychiatry and Richard Belzer, who presented Billy Drago's Revealed Freeway Killer, infected with B-Movie. But the remainder usually gives good speeches. I particularly liked how Darlanne Fluegel's character, Sunshine, had a little courage. <br /> <br /> Russo, I'm scared that it looks like a wooden chair, but then the character he plays is, Frank, keeps it in a backyard story, not a very good thing. Sunny is given by the former commander's officer. The sound of danger is greatly preserved throughout the film, and at night only the LA autodetection atmosphere is a great way to create tension with a killer who has long been in his bad gray sedan, and the music used to subtract the film has been suitably designed. Why are some people hating this movie? I think different strokes for different people. But it's completely "Freeway" and I can definitely recommend it.
