I will soon solve the film's theme: A very interesting event about the devastating features of all the passionate passions; a young Italian woman who was imprisoned with a political radical fianc√© (whose approach to apolitical relationships and tolerance for life) was unable to emotionally sympathize with a new young lady with a sense of passion and passion. Anxiety, anger, sensitivity and passion around the story world are equal to the invisible silence that eases the two reasons. The film gives you the spirit of anxiety emerging from all the political collapse lost in the audience (even if you know Italian politics in the 80s). I found the film to be compulsory ... an oral sex scene that smashes her a little, does not simulate her and impresses her. There are other scenes in the film, so I feel that the heroes are talking about their madness and loneliness, but the oral sex scene that I feel is the focus of the actual story. It did not float smoothly until this point and it was like hitting a machete once a stupid sex scene (which led to a day). It's crushing and unnecessary, and I believe the movie will not be damaged in any way after it's taken off the stage. Unfortunately, this scene prevents people from watching this magnificent movie. I believe it's worth watching, because there's so much going on in the subtext that's under the surface, with feelings and more confusion. <br /> <br /> Generally, a beautiful movie is a barrier to sex scenes that do not need much.
