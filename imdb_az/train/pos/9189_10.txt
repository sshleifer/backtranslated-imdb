Let's start this episode for the first time after watching on the DVD on P.M. at 10 pm. <br /> <br /> One day I can not go up at 3:00 pm. <br /> <br /> This short review can be spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of The Sopranos for a long time, and I can say the best episode I've seen safely. I can not say that everyone should feel this way, but I am. <br /> <br /> This episode was the same as my last weekend with my family. <br /> <br /> The episode starts with Tony in an alternate way: he has made a mistake for the identity of a dealer named Kevin Finnerty. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes went by, I saw Tony dream or watched another show. <br /> <br /> Anthony (or Kevin) is a physician with a flashlight through the "helicopter ribbon" and through the 1st instance. <br /> <br /> Tony just came out for a moment. <br /> <br /> Tony once realized that his sons A.J. at home and Carmella breaks through the corridor, escaping from stress: a moment of signature in episode. <br /> <br /> We have crossed the real world for the rest of the episode: the potential family <br /> Therefore, the negative result of this coma and the alternative reality of Tony, both in his mind and around him, What is happening in the real world is parallel. <br /> <br /> He approaches Tony and reads the best line of episode: "Anthony, do you hear us?" he said. In the Tony world, he enters a dark room and illuminates it. She takes off her shoe and goes to her phone. He tried to call, but he tried to say something to Carmella, but physically could not do it himself. Not yet. <br /> <br /> She sits and looks at the window. <br /> <br /> Moby marries perfectly with these latest pictures. <br /> <br /> Now again, throughout the episode, a glowing light repeatedly appears to call it on the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10. PS: See the next episode. You know what the light is. This is beautiful.
