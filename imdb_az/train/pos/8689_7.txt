Perfect for a few people drama. Simon is dead, but somehow resurrected from abroad. What he saw there is shown as blank spots designed for a magnificent account of German avant-garde composer Werner Hensen. Simon abdicated his death, but on the other hand he comforted with the support of the dead men he had seen. His girlfriend tries to keep her alive, but fails, she decides to follow her after death. Very touching and moving, deep psychological but somewhat slow and somewhere even boring.
