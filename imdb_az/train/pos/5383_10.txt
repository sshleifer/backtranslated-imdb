For Corrine and Sean, I thought this movie was good. It was full of action and a bit of romance, but there was a point where Corrine did not speak too openly (when threatening Sean with a gun) and he compressed his teeth ... maybe he was? I know that Joseph and Sonny's roles were well illustrated and there was a clear contrast. I'm sure I watched the next action star, Corrine and Sean, making their stunts very beautiful. They're waiting for another movie of the pair, because they can be a great team, or maybe bigger ', this time about Carmen .. Get rid of it! Perfect!
