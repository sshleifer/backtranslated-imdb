I do not understand his objections to this film. It's a surprising, surprising extension of the character created in "basic instinct". <br /> <br /> It is at least part of life that only part of Sharon Stone's character is still in prison today. 1) The character of Sharon Stone kills all these people because he is insane (Depends on Risk); 2) David Tewlis's curriculum vitae Sharon 3) David Morrissey's analyst kills these people for revenge, but most people do not see any of these theories as "real". " , In 2001, is a splendid set-up in the spirit of Space Odyssey. "WHAT IS HEALTH? The blonde is really crazy, the police really croaked and the analyst really wants revenge.

Get him out!
