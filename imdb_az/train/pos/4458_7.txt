There are some excellent points, but the length of the film can not keep the gable subtle plot. Astaire's "Fleet" is not as good as "City", but another sailor in the release film. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is soft, but Kelly and Sinatra work well. They organized the song "Suzie you performed" for their performance. "I invited", having fun with Sinatra showing how he managed to climb. Sinatra's solo song is boring and is not part of the story but is added to show that she is reading. Kelly is the star of the film, though actors such as Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton are likely, but imortivable Jose Iturbi. <br /> <br /> It's interesting to see the third billing and interacting with Astaire's never-done children. Dean Stockwell, Kelly plays a child who wants to be a navigator and latches character. She also came to a children's school, telling her a wonderful story about her life in the Pomeranian (!) Sea, leading her to a beautiful dance with her charming Jerry Mouse. On another stage she is dancing to an attractive Mexican Hat Dance, sublimually funny little girl, Sharon McManus, that is intrancing and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very nice, but a little too long. A confirmation of better music.
