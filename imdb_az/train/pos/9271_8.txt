<br /> <br /> Has metaphor for a selective game between girls (or a wider, free thinking group) and power? What Does "Future of Germany" Believe? <br /> <br /> This is the most memorable cinematography experience I've ever had - regardless of cinematography and structure, but gently working (although I'm leaving - I'm looking forward to amateurs). Funny situation was captured well. I can feel that deep disappointment does not ignore a game (a woman and a football fan) and I can not stop thinking about a convincing mask. <br /> <br /> The film is very cleverly made - a beautiful name, a very nice theme. Spitting, spontaneity, and shooting in different ways is a very important but inaccessible game, torchlight and stadium sound, van, and the uselessness of the stadium associates the masses outside the mass that exists inside. I can feel the comfort of radios, drinks and feed, and, of course, to everyone else's kindness and care. During the last loans no character is named - he is just a "soldier" and he is amused only to have any "girl" or "sister".
