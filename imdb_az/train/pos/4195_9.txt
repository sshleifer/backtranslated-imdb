This movie is a spicy little movie of Sam Fuller. Richard Widmark gives a chance to showcase his best, most determined role as Skip McCoy, a small son of his time, on the secret of soldiers. a good sugar (Jean Peters) pockets in a busy bus. <br /> <br /> Leader, motifs of the Shahdeniz party ?? In fact, at first he thinks he is a "comic", and goes to spit his face with an awesome gesture. But is there a true question? What happens with Skip? What are his motives, and why does Candy like it? Why do we (the audience) want to love her so much? Generally, filmmakers here create a very striking "personal fatale" in Widmark's character and performance. As the male body is prone to think of the length of a movie like "Big Sleep" or "Glass Key" along with the fact that a woman's face is reliable or not, filmmakers are a problem similar to that of women created here. Widmark is a handsome handset and its a boy's insouciance charm? but the first two times she meets the leading lady, she whips and then slaps her face. Finally the question is? Moye (Thelma Ritter) would take a reverse signal to sell his country for $ 1 a dollar (if he shouted at me, "he could tell the police, or we can question ourselves) or take revenge on his death? <br /> <br /> The nature of Thelma Ritter deserves a special note? has created a truly indestructible character here. Fuller is not afraid to give a lot of "work"? in the form of physical objects he uses to attract the audience around the world, especially his connections. <br /> <br /> Another example of Fuller's "job" would be the scene with Victor Perry (a player I saw elsewhere) using Candies to scare them. <br /> <br /> Watching Moy Skip's relationship is one of the most sensitive "dignity among the thieves". In fact, Skip has the same kind of convenience as the Capt Tiger (Murvyn Vye), who respects himself, and has the same kind of casual relationship with the police. When I called them on behalf of the police, I liked the scene and offered a beer to them when they came to take it in their own chest. Are these details really real? <br /> <br /> Some say that this is an important criminal film that reflects the best and most lasting features. "Film Noir" film art school. A predictable area is set by many colorful characters (well-developed), and cheap gangs feel that the film is rapidly inevitable, and that the final product is more than likely to be. This is the best movie I've ever seen by Sam Fuller and helps me because of being viewed as a good mastermind? Here, I think he's working hard, but in the end he did not look like empathy style and really ignorant movements in other films like The Crimson Kimono and Shock Corridor. Did I see that Widmark is one of my favorite speeches? and Widmark can not be compared to Alan Ladd or Humphrey Bogart (based on a few unusual films I've seen together), though he did not have many classic films.
