'Iphigenia' is a great success of Michael Cacoyannis. This spectacular game is magnificently adapted to the screen and can be awakened by a beautiful castle. Cacoyannis was not available. He was able to capture the tragedy of Greece to appear on the screen without losing its effectiveness and importance. The magnificent Greek cast helps him. The new arriving Tatiana Papamoschou is extremely impressive, like Iphigenia. The Irene Papas, which is equally impressive, is sometimes very realistic, sometimes from the top. <br /> <br /> A beautiful Greek movie perfectly adapted and managed by Michael Cacoyannis with a perfect musical score by Mikis Theodorakis, ideal for every scene. <br /> <br /> P.S. Undoubtedly, the movie lost only the best foreign language movie Oscars with just one vote!
