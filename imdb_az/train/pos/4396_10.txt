<br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (misspelled) and Jewel were prominent in their supporting role. Like Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire, as he knew he was going to die without a procedure, had to act as if he had to amputate his best friend's arm. <br /> <br /> Pay special attention to good afternoon coaching with good dialect training. </ strong> <br /> <br /> Why this movie just swept under the carpet by Hollywood promoters I can imagine. I have strong doubts. Which makes me more attractive. <br /> <br /> I gave the DVDs a lot of excitement. <br /> <br /> Completely abducted movie. Rent or buy and pay full attention for a few hours then judge.
