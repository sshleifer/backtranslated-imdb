I just watched this movie on the DVD and thought the player was very good, but there was something on the whole story. This movie has the same tissue and panic look in the Needle Park or Pharmacy Cowboy. It is difficult to believe that people live in such a way of life; <br /> <br /> Val Kilmore: "The general existence of this society is the absence of serious drug use, crime, violence, gender and self-esteem." The old "old" porn star is John Holmes's role. Support for the party is also good. But it's a terrible, dark, uncomfortable and emotional movie. Murder was severe, but the daily life of these people was cruel. This is not really a movie to see if you are not interested in these murders or are not a "fanatics" of Hollywood. If you want to see a documentary drama about crime, Truman Capote is better than the Cold Blood movie starring Scott Wilson and Robert Blake in the 1960s.
