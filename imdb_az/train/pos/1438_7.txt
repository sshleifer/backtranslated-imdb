Full marks for Pacino's showing his dead son's coffin; Shakespeare's Mark Antony would be shamed! <br /> <br /> Was Ken Lipper Paul Schrader or should be imitated in remarkable dialogues? If you love movies with good scripts, they are rich and intelligent and worth your time. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to talk about in this movie; Even John Cusack played a better role. Interestingly, the film is directed to many men - women are just additions.
