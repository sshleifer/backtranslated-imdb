I love this movie. song and story lines are great fun. and "I say goodbye" always brings me action. What a brilliant thing to bring puppets for life, in fact, a piece of fabric and piece and everything that takes care of these things. great sounds and great talent. Why are all the other muppet films that are so exciting, moving and funny? this is mr. Henson missed too much?
