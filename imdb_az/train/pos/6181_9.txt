It's a very unpleasant movie that can help you track old music / secrets. Aqatha Christie or even Thin Men's secrets can not be approached as a motion picture, but it is more interesting than a typical "boy meets a girl" or a "show off" suit. As a music, Busby is not a Berkley or a free unit, but it can push the classic "Coctails for the Two" and strange "Sweet Marijuana". The film takes place at the time of the scene, at the opening of the night "Vanities", at a time when a murder - and soon - the back cafe was discovered. Did the killer before the curtain drop? Of course, although the search is somewhat entertaining, it can boast of the explosions of the comic relief (fortunately in the form of the godfather of Toby Wing). Stupid police are a bit too stupid, a bit too unpleasant, leading lady, a bit too much grace, bit pricy donna bit bity little bit of bitumen and enjoy a little dedication, but stereotypes are pretty stylish. At the same time Busby Berkley has a bevy of really beautiful choir girls who are better off than girls, and sometimes tends to be a bit on the full side. Yes, this movie could have been better, and Duke Ellington is a shame, but if you dive into old movies, this will be a great tantalizing trip.
