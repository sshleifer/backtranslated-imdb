A company I will not describe here, did not delete a few pan and scan DVDs ("Clean and Sober", "Star 80" and only three names) that did not seem to want anyone to see it. this is in a dangerous format. <br /> <br /> Some disks give the audience 16x9 or full screen choices, while others have 1.66: 1 freedom of the theater. <br /> <br /> "Dithrap" from my chest is a fairly funny picture. My only complaint is a long-term account (a frequently-shot film for the films shot in France in the 18th century) and Diane Cannon regularly screams.

Because hellish stubbornness has become their final deatrap, the two are equally large.
