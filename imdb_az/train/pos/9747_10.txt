When I first came out in 1982, when I saw this movie I remembered it. About four years later, I gave Luciano Pavarotti a privilege to read in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City (Tuscany). When I see this film ends, it reminds me of a great night. What does not matter about this movie? Music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was the best and still looked great. The story is really partially ridiculous and is still one of the funniest I've ever seen on the 'food fight' scene. The hot air balloon flight in Napa Valley was beautiful, and so the song "If we were in love" (Pavarotti sounded several times in English) sang. And we heard Santa Lucia's duet beautifully. Get the real people, it was a film about the opera singer Georgio Fini, which was just being played by Pavarotti. The roles supporting Kathryn Harrold and Eddie Albert were excellent. <br /> <br /> I'm very glad that the VHS box of this movie is still tired, but I especially love being released on DVD. Pavarotti is no longer with us, because it is in Nessun Dorman's best performance in the film today.
