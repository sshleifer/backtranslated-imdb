It took me a while to catch a movie in Brooklyn - it's hard to describe the podb; There are many unreasonable characters, but it just made me laugh a lot, and I would say it's a difficult time to choose where I can not start. Even peripheral roles are well written and well-functioned. <br /> <br /> There are numerous small touches that make it unique and very happy, with a few "fixtures" open and another sad layer is added. Freshen up to watch; It's not some recurring thing I've seen many times before. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Misunderstandings and misunderstandings that make the final move and dramatic results when this movie reaches a wider audience. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with a heart tone; A story that soon touched with a bench comedy. Definitely worth seeing!
