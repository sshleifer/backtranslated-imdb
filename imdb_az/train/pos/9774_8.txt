<br /> <br /> The film is not a good thing, but sometimes it's a dialogue, sounds, sounds, sounds, sounds, lighting (the only amateur amateur and player I've seen in the group). <br /> <br /> How good is a very original story, a very intense atmosphere <br /> <br /> So, you have to look at it, or maybe even love all your fears and admirers.
