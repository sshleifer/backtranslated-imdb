This film is directed at Gerard Gardens in Liverpool and is a response to the UK's "Blackboard Jungle". The film is good enough with time testing, so far (or more) is full of all moral stories. The film performs some outstanding British actresses such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. <br /> <br /> Bakr plays Fenerbahce police assigned to the youth's related positions. Perhaps, if you keep children at an early age, you will be responsible adults. <br /> <br /> Freddie Starr-Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria) in the film. Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play an arsonists network grabbing brother and sister (they are real-life sibling and sister). Tsai Chin is still active and can be seen in the film 'Translator' in the recent Nicole Kidman movie. <br /> <br /> In a violent playground, there is a gun at a school, and it's hard to figure out after a similar incident. In Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I was living in the Gerard Gardens, where the film was filmed (we were not born at that time) and the region had a lovely memory. I recently had a documentary on Gerard Gardens and a small British movie called "Coast to Coast" by Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The houses here were destroyed after the collapse of 1987, and helped keep the movies live. <br /> <br /> There were several complaints from the residents in the filming. <br /> <br /> If you're a little gem of this movie, I advise you to do this
