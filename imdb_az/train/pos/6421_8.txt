"Glorious Men" - a true story about the proud and enduring black sea divers (incredible Cuba Gooding Jr.) is definitely a touch of both sides and is a part of the absolute cremation of this new millennium cinema. A nice toy is the main reason for making this movie really special and pretty enjoyable. Charismatic Robert De Niro is a rude, violent and humble head like Billy Bazar - the role is written for him. This is one of the latest proof that the movie is still one of the best actresses along with fantastic "15 minutes" (2001). On the other hand, "Honorable Men" has been one of the most promising young black actors since Boyz n the cap, performing well from Cuban Gooding Jr. "Honorable guys" go straight to "Jerry Maguire," "As Good as It Is," and "Instinct". Cuba Gooding Jr., a talented and fantastic player, and I am ready to get even more horrible movies. The "Glorious Men" also has the most exciting story line and the most exciting dive sequences in film history. This is a great, exciting movie, and I can only recommend it.
