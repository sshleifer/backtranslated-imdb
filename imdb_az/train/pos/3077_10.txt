I missed the whole season of the show and started watching the ABC website in the summer of 2007. I'm totally crazy about the show. I think all the players are good. This is one of my favorite shows. I checked the ABC program for this Fall and did not see it in the table. This is really sad. I hope they will bring it back ... Maybe Bridget Moynahan is waiting for her baby? Or are you willing to think? <br /> <br /> Reading some of the comments about the show and seeing many brilliant words like me. I hope the ABC will review its decision or hope that another station will receive it.
