In 1985 (birthday), Steven Spielberg directed an emotionally powerful and unforgettable story about a young African-American girl, Celie (Whoopi Goldberg for Debut), following a difficult day. The story begins since 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old. He had two children born to his father. Celie, an inseparable man, Nettie has a little sister. A widow, Nettie, looks at her eyes, but her ancestors give him Celie. This is the beginning of terrible abuse and steady control. Women are less than men, and especially African-American women, whose rights are less than zero. The story of Celie is a true healing story. <br /> <br /> Color Purple is Spilberg's masterpiece and scandalous film. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg as a ravingly funny comedienne is well-known, but the role played by Celie as a beautiful word that can really take on a dramatic drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly bad, "Mister." I have never seen him in that bad role. The talk-show icon Oprah Winfrey is brilliant as a mighty Sophia. <br /> <br /> Warning! Prepare some tissues with you while watching this movie. You really can join the story of a strong brotherhood. <br /> <br /> Mr. Spilberg has great applause! Especially if you have a close relationship with your brothers, as with my brother.
