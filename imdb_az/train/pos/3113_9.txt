The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon's best roles), a new spy boy in the block, tries to end CIA's ultimate hero software with Super Blackman to make super-killings. <br /> <br /> I've been watching yesterday and today's predecessors. Identity was brilliant as I remembered, and Supremacy remains weak (yet still happy) for a weaker area, and the tracking of this movie is easily accompanied by a car overlapping, with less activity and suspension <br /> <br /> Hoo boy Ultimatum's suspense! When you know that Bourne will get rid of the authorities (and the boy takes care of the police in these films in a considerable way), it's still bright. <br /> <br /> The $ 150 million giant robot in Transformers is much more mind-boggling to think that they have 10 grams of stability and mopeds than anything else. <br /> <br /> Give it to Paul Greengrass, though the CIA headquarters draws symbols away from places where no one is allowed to pass through a camera within 10 miles, but stedicam a la documentary film. It seemed that he had listened to my various complaints with Supremacy, because he was less afraid of the actions of the Ultimatum, with weapons like candles, various additions (I do not always look the same way), and an electric fan (do not ask). <br /> <br /> Famous actor improved the development of Julia Stiles' "Nicky" and put her in a position. a new sympathetic light. Demon is a careful yet competent signature player (little sounds but Matt Damon seems to have seemed like the CIA and Interpol is something like that), but there are still striking moments when trying to find humanity. This desire for his real life could be boring and almost Supremacy, but Ultimatum (good script) works better. <br /> <br /> I recall the scene of the "Goldeneye" (only in the best Pierce Brosnan Bond film) by Seine Bean, James, who silenced the screams of all men martinis killed. Bourne regrets all the people he has killed, and he considers the meaning of the action, the meaningless meaning of life, or how the government has turned people (or at least me) to the sources. <br /> <br /> Borne has never thought of smaller attempts to conceal her identity or create new passports, despite military intervention in Saudi Arabia, CIA, Interpol and Police. Maybe sun glasses? <br /> <br /> If you have more money and love movie than Bourne Ultimatum, it's for you. Hell, this is probably the best film to go out this year. Of course, at first you would be a fool to see others without watching. It draws a close touch to this end, but I almost feel attractive to consider it. <br /> <br /> This summer for the first time this year's "3" movie, at least in the match, is overwhelmingly original and says something else. <br /> <br /> A-
