An old saying says: "If you have problems, visit the hospital." Refurbished in recent years, "If you have problems, watch TV show, especially Jerry Springer!" This movie is one of the worst, it's good! So I gave it to seven - it's good, but it's not good. A good way to spend 95 minutes, such as the promotion of a daily sex show, "You will not be back in the hour of your life!" All the topics are here ... loyal husband / man, the wildest audience on television, women who extinguish Jerry and so on. Molly Hagani, playing shockingly normal sweet characters ("Seinfeld" and "Hermann's Head"), was watching. a romantic garbage mother, and like Jaime Pressly ("My Name Is Earl"), fulfills the sexual morality of every person they are in contact with. The man (including the crew) was presented as a worthy lynxhead for what men earned. I do not want to break or disclose everything, but the movie plays like a daily show. He returns here two hours every morning in Phoenix, and then everything seems pale. Again, I give this movie seven times ... well, but not good. Jerry Springer receives a good hourly dose.
