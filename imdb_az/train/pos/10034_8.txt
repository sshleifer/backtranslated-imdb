I had a little problem with this movie, and I heard a lot of criticism about it. True, it's more than three hours, but I'm surprised that it's going to go very fast. I do not think it's overrated, and the IMDb rating is perfectly worth it. The film gives a great look with beautiful costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron is rarely ignored. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack and is as beautiful as Kate Winslet Rose. David Warner, a great actor, stole every scene he's in. The story is a very rich feature and a characteristic of character development. The film is a bit slow. The last hour is extremely whipped and I will admit that I'm on the edge of my seat when the Titanic sank. I'll tell you that it's been moving in the last five minutes. James Horner's music account was my darling, though my heart was not a big fan. In 1996, miniseries was good, but suffered from unexpected scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Generally, I give Titanic 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
