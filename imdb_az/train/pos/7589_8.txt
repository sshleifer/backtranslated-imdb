Jay Chou is an orphan in a kung fu school, but after a fight with a bunch of bad guys he is thrown off by the general director of corruption. He is trapped in the young man's abilities by the cunning Eric Tsang, who immediately sees the potential for money. Basketball is a selected street for wealth, and Tsang offers a university team to give him a place and introduce him to the media. <br /> <br /> Some players lead to a really bad opponent team, led by a basketball championship and a previous same betrayer. <br /> <br /> Behold, a little Shaolin Soccer, I declare, but not very interesting or ridiculous - approaching the conventions of the sports film, and provides all the elements that the congregation expects to be set up. You've seen it before, but when it's done well, it's the ones that are about to see again. Fortunately, really good work is done here (some of them may say "surprising" in the director's chair with Chu Yen-Ping ... I'm waiting for a good helper) - a scenario is given and the presentation is elegant and elegant. Jay Chou is pretty much unchallenged, but it's his style, and he can have a pretty good comic effect on a flicker way of feeling. Eric Tsang is compensating for more than a lifetime that he has played a few times (for example, in real life), the most emotional moments in the movies. <br /> <br /> Because the movie is around basketball, it's good to have fun playing scenes from basketball matches. The cast shows some realistic skills, including Chou, and some good telegraph and CGI add geometric real kung fu skill elements and make the scenes more entertaining (thinking of such things) and justifies the presence of the movie <br /> <br / > There is only one important scene in the film, but it is unbearable in the style of "multi-faceted". Jay Chou appears to be a part of his actions and is quite impressive - he's pretty powerful and realistic, and Ching Siu-Tung's choreography makes him look like a true master of the battle. <br /> <br /> Many people living in the Caucasus will end their lives.
