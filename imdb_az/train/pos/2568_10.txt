In the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and sharp Jerry Lee opposed the crime, but this time they were very well acquainted with another detective (Christine Tucci) and partner Doberman, Jerry Lee non-Zues. Dooley is not very familiar with new partners. The film continues throughout all the changes. The film is really a man who wants to kill Dooley because he has treated him in the past. There are some dramatic scenes that tell Dooley's wife about the death of the film, the sequence of activities, dog poop jokes, fart jokes and bad poems about dogs in a certain area. I do not know, it seems like a little humor, but some are really laughable. I did not see this movie for jokes, I saw it for two reasons. First, I'm a great James Belushi fan, and the second is the series of activities. James Belushi is more entertaining and moving sequences than the K-9. It would be good to see more characters coming from K-9, but still a fun movie. If you have a James Belushi fan, you will love this movie.
