Despite some negative comments, this movie is on IMDb pages, a story about survival and friendship between two different men who have different mentalities in a Panamanian mission. <br /> <br /> Peruvian director Luis Llosa takes us to watch this retreat in Panama. The film, like Beckett, has a good time as a veteran sea, has recently shot a man who recently came and was sent to eliminate a recently-unpacked cartel head and a corrupt army of generations who might be the next president of the country. <br /> <br /> Miller opposed the infiltration of the arrogant man against the war and the war between the military and drug lords. American intelligence trained a valuable lesson from Beckett. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> </ font> It is the right of a few words. <br /> <br /> Miller, while playing with Billy Zane, can do with her a role that does not give him a reputation until the end. <br /> <br /> For those who love action movie, the Sniper offers a 112-minute action. a decorative film would be a more enjoyable movie.
