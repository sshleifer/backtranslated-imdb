One day, I suddenly stumbled upon this movie on television. In the middle of the day, it was broadcast on a channel that is not popular for good cinema dissemination. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong> "October Sky" He and his friends are starting to build rockets. His father's sons are not happy with their new hobby, and can be seen as a coal-fired or brother-in-law soccer college. <br /> <br /> The story is well written. Maybe it may be more predictable, but it just does not pay too much attention to these parts of the story. It is an important part, but focusing on movements between characters, where this is evident in the inner movement. The story is good. There are some stereotypes, but OK. This is based on the actual event, so you can not release such clich√©s. The characters are really good. Symbols are removed where the story is down, and is maintained to maintain the high level of movement and movie quality. You recognize these symbols and receive sympathy for them. <br /> <br /> This is a good-looking movie. The sets and 50 styles are thorough and the pictures are well-designed and well-lit. This film is very well organized. <br /> <br /> Acting is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal presents a good performance like John Hickam as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper. The remainder of the rest is good. <br /> <br /> In some cases, I'm happy that this movie will be shot. After seeing, the first thing I learned based on actual events. It would be even more interesting if I saw it when I saw it. October Sky is a beautiful and exciting movie. I believe everybody can do a movie. This is a good movie. Not too bad!
