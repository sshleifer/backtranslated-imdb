I was reminded that the trailer for Zu Legend was quite impressive, and for being a fan of "A Man Called Hero" (my all-time favorite), Storm Riders have decided that I have to follow it too. I know that Ekin Cheng is a very critical way of driving anywhere, but still one of my favorite Hong Kong moviestarians (better than Nicolas Tse) and one of the factors that benefited from this film. Undoubtedly, this movie is a work of art from the beginning to the end. I even thought that only the actors were real and everything was a computer that was created until the end of this film. They need to do a lot of things and have a good credit. The story of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a thought story that Ekin Cheng easily drew out his daughters .This story is not too intellectual and deep, but it is not what you expect while taking a motion picture. I wished to have more martial arts action with fists and punches instead of fights with magical skills, but good that is life and you will never go the desired way. Why did they finally call the supersonic airplane in the sky? This is a very funny way. The legend of Zu can not tell the hero in my eyes, but it runs like a videogame, and that's not a bad thing. If a company decides to publish their games in this movie, I will not be surprised to carry all the video games elements. Good job. Please do some more fantasy movies like this
