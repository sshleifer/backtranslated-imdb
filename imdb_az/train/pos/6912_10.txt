Paul Mazursky, Richard Dreyfuss, a great comic fortune player, Jack Nuha, plays a very successful player - a similar Latin American banana republic Parador, Alfons Sims, appointed by the Fascist, unfortunately, later has a heart attack film. Have fun in many local cocktails! Raul Julia is playing a police chief who is keen on Noah. Sonia Braga plays the glamorous love-lover daughter of the dictator, Joe, to teach her how to behave as a dictator, to pave the way for Jonathan Winter to become a CIA man, as a hammer seller in Parador to connect Just to the destructive dictator of Noah. Can Noy Parador win the people? and prevent the rebels? And give it a lifetime performance without losing it in the process? Sammy Davis Jnr conjures Parador's national anthem in a fun way, and Beguine, one of the Frog's numbers (Fernando Ray appears as a kind servant, Charo is also a busty girl.) Maurice Jarre, excellent.
