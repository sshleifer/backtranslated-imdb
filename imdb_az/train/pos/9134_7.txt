"Purple Rain" was not a critic of any criticism, but it is a classic classic - and worthy. <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Believe me or this movie is not just to read and dance. There is a very intense scene and it's heartfelt. Sometimes it is funny, but if it works, it really works. <br /> <br /> Everyone works on the Prince's side as The Time and Vanity 6. Still adds glamor to the movie. When the prince appears on the screen, he illuminates it and enjoys seeing it on the trade peak. <br /> <br /> As a result, if you like a person like me, go and see. If you are not a fan, this will make you one.
