Cheech & Chong's Next Movie (1980) is the second film for the double lover, Chechen Marin and Tommy Chong's lover. Smoking is a favorite room. They are looking for ways to smack more and just living in a convicted building that lies all day long. However, Cheech is "responsible". She has a job and a constant girlfriend. One day, Cheech wants to get him high, so Chong is trying to get out of the house. Another problem arises, Cheche's brother, "Red" (Cheech, another role) is in the city and wants to hang it. Cheech, who claimed that he could kill two birds with one stone, sent Chong and the Red Dots. How will you include Chong and Red adventures? Cheech will get his amazement? How will Chong go without some smoke? <br /> <br /> Tommy Chong then takes over directives. RELATIONSHIP AMONG THE BEST. Perfect, but not as good as the first movie. However, Cheech and Chong fans will be delighted with it. Followed by NICE DREAMS. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
