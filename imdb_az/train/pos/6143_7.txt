This has never seen the 1971 movie and has made a great deal of fun with this great product created by Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations. Angela Lansbury (Eglantine Price) was a lamp that played a great role as a woman who took a witch's craft course and began to fly over a broom. Eglantine discovered many recommendations and made a trip to different parts of the world. However, Eglantine missed his final exams to become a successful witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne (David Tomlinson), Eglantine was a saleswoman in this gamble and was trying to help her find her solution. Eglantine has a purpose in its crackdown and is to stop the Nazi's departure from England. Great family fun and we need more movies today.
