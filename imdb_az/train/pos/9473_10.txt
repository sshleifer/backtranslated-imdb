<br /> <br /> It was lucky to be pre-selected last night (October 20th) and I was incredibly amazed at the beautiful plot and really was in the heart. <br /> <br /> Very new, the story emerges in a way that feels fresh, unique and clear "indy". <br /> <br /> It's not something that can easily be compared with movies of the past, it's a unique tool for a love story similar to classic middle aged depression. <br /> <br /> I was hit by the film's fall. In addition to each end of the family, it was a beautiful and talented game. <br /> <br /> Three daughters did a wonderful job, the talents were split evenly between them, and none of them could "shine". <br /> <br /> It was really a delightful movie for all ages and was laughing at a high-level comic though really touching and heart warming. The recent films have a good break from sex jokes and nudity.
