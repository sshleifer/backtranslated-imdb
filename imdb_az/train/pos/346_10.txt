A strange movie! A very surprising end to your fear, good action, well-written, beautiful series, interesting characters, very good direction and a smile on your face. A popcorn horror that can not betray these terrifying fans, but still (still) one of the best exciters out there today! <br /> <br /> I advise only a few admirers: <br /> <br /> <br /> 1) In the horror genre or 2) The actress or actress sounds. <br /> <br /> *** ***** came out of the stars! <br /> PS - I'm a sick person and I'm afraid of people who are comparing it. What do you know, they did not want to be like weapons. Everyone "Oh, they copied SCREAM!" Whom. Yes, I did not make a mistake, Scream also copied other movies! In fact, almost every horror film was copied from the previous one. SCREAM was a good movie. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> <br /> <br /> <br />
