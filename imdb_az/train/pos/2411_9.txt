This movie is one of the most successful attempts for some nagging questions that arose in the New Testament on Passion (Christ's suffering and death) accounts in New Testament. (What did he encourage Judah to do in the profession? What could the Sanhedrin meet on a high sacred day? What was Pilate's dress?) This is a movie for a serious Christian thinker: "The passion of Christ" is surely disappointed by the severity of his appearance . When it comes to myself, I see portraits here - when ordinary people are interested in their own interests, they are prepared to sacrifice common interests - more realistic and deeply worried. (He is hesitant at the moment in the Christ's wrist, looking at the face of the first nail, as it is in the film, "not engaged in my business"). The film has no "originality" claim, but the settings and the costume feel more "right" than the ones that are highly appreciated. This is a slow film, but if you accept the limitations you put yourself (ultimately, "Death" is not life, it is not "Christ"), ultimately, it is very rewarding.
