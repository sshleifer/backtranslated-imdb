Sensual and tough Maria Braun. (Hanna Shigula) married a soldier in the middle of the Second World War and spent half the day and night with her. His marriage continues until he is wounded and then loses his prison. A successful businessman can only be sensitive, but clever, ambitious, and ready to use sexually explicitly: "I do not know anything about the job, but I know what German women want, and you can even say that I'm an expert on this subject." Despite his excellence, he always remembers his husband, Hermann (s), and convinces himself what he is doing? for their future happy life. The style of "Maria Braun" reminds melodramas by Fassbinder's favorite Hollywood director Douglas Circus and represents a part of the survival and survival of Germany after the war. <br /> <br /> Hannah Shiggle feels as if she is on every stage of the film, and she's fantastic. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
