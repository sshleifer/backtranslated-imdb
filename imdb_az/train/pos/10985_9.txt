This is a very funny and incredibly surreal-documented part of the GREY GARDENS - it's really a Fox or Lynn of a stranger lottery, giving it run for their money - it's silence and distraction after my first glance. I pointed out how these women (from the eccentrically clinical pathway) were the most striking way to find out, and I'm surprised that the retreat in the world is beyond life's scarcity of the unreal blue blood, possibly some abuse, or perhaps simply spiral from her own control has been a lifelong accusation and a strip of rebellion. This could be one of the worst-caseed films ever exploited by exploits - While edies did their job, I pointed to something like empty goggles in the bedroom bedroom, the racoons from the holes in the walls, and the final scene seemed pretty sad - serious wrongdoing as a child's birthday he went. It is worth seeing and looking for - you will not forget it, but it is very uncomfortable.
