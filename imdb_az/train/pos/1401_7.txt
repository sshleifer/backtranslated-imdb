Okay, we have Verhoeven severity (not as Verhoeven leaks), too many sexes and nudity, but something is missing ... Oh, yes, Paul Verhoev√© has no idea about his fantasy films. Unlike most Verhoeven films, though, he does not have enough humor to fall into the genre of comedy, even though he is familiar with the Verhoeven symbols and their sense of humor. <br /> <br /> Not the best film of the movie "Hollow Man", but rather the cast, or the character, but rather the special effects that will make the film. It is impossible. The crew really did not look like an invisible man, using pianos wires and a slippery hinges that were dependent on other practical effects (effects on the set). <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon is invisible and does not appear to have the most striking effects scenes while Kevin Bacon is invisible. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story of this invisible man deserves to be more imaginable. There are many laboratories here. If I had seen Kevin Beco robbed a bank or face it, or if people could steal something from their bags, or if I had such a thing. But the thing shown is enough to make Hollow Man a fun movie. Level: B
