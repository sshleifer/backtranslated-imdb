While these beautiful artworks use the kinematic words of Syurrealism, it is not actually the case. It is a political and cultural allegory of Colombian odyssey after Mexican history. <br /> <br /> In contrast to "water for chocolate," Erendira expects the audience to do little or no less than half the way. (A good starting point is to see the grandma of Spain as: proud, dull, sad, and above all, a weighty-historical-history). <br /> <br /> The last act of the hero is dark because the "outcome" of the history is always dark, because we are very close to him for honest evaluation. <br /> <br /> "Erendira" is beautiful, it is the only real choice of the director considering the ambitions of the film. A great screen experience would be ideal if you are closely acquainted with the choice of a local art house or university. But if not, VHS is better than ever.
