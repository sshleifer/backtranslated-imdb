It is to tell me a story about a movie and a toy. The story of David and Bethlehem is a tragedy that can be perceived deeply by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account. In this film, I thought that the stories prepared by Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward are the best. He made this story even more attractive to know and understand David's story and how to become King of Israel. You can feel the lust for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the real man of this man, who was greater in life than in her life. Susan Hayward's fears, reluctance, and obedience to the authority of the King, as well as his description, were beautifully described. Uria may have felt the pain of David's passing through the door instead of the house. Both were killed in battle and sadness. Raymond Massey's strong and influential condemnation of the King made me angry. The sets were fair and the atmosphere believed. All of this is one of the best films I have ever seen. I gave him a rating.
