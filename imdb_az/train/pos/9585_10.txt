They put together a beautiful place ... Someone wish to pursue their lives and celebrate the lives of the missing, I want to be a follow-up to this documentary ... a part of it ... a fact. I would like to know how far the film creator is watching! this is important for the community circle .. if you read it, consider filming such a documentary ... I have not heard of na√Øve writers; We really need to get into the heteroser's eye. This film did not bother even worrying about HIV or AIDS, and I was very glad for that. Indeed, breaking and praise also appreciated. Thank you for allowing this movie to exist.
