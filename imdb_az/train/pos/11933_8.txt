I think this is a beautiful family movie. There are many hilarious scenes and heart-warming moments throughout the film. Players are great and their impacts are very well done. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who plays the terrific baseball team "The Angels" and is great throughout the movie. Both the fantastic young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is as good as 'The Angel' and the effect is great in this top notch Disney movie. A touch and heart-warming film that everyone can enjoy.
