... what was so terrible that it was necessary to cut them out of the original film in 10 minutes? For three years we have been in the movie production ... Barbara Stanwyck played in the original game, but here Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Co-star Fred MacMurray is likely to be known for "Double Hiking" along with Stanwyck and his hit TV show "My Three Sons." Wait for a young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope's films) and very cheeky Franklin Pangborn. Of course, he works on the ship in the beauty salon! Add the perfect Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. A good time from the beginning and a clever joke. Maggie's friend Ella's "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey" are best performed by Jean Dixon. In Swing High, Maggie meets a soldier who left the tourists. Maggie abducts his ship when he leaves the harbor and walks with the soldiers. At the local bar in Quinn Panama, 20, there is a small scene. Here Johnson (MacMurray) played the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth) and the Skid group are working together to understand how they can return to the states. A good performance by Lamour. Cecil Cunningham is a wise, helpful owner of the local hall in Panama, which operates well (but short) as "Murph". While others were praying for the first half of the film to be fraudulent with the fraudulent Central American local setting, he was not so scared and even a little exotic.
