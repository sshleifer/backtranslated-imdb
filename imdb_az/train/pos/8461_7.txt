Since the title is in English and IMDb lists the primary language of this show as an English language, I will review the version of Gundam Wing in English (2000), as Bandai's DVD set provides. My original source for the whole series is IMDb's "Shin kid√¥ senky Gundam W" (1995). <br /> <br /> Depending on the difficulty, script and characterization, the English adaptation has changed little. Indeed, the choice of language in this show depends on your language. Purists want all that they want in Japan, but I suggest the English way since all the characters except Heero Yuy. (most of them are Caucasian with a few non-Japanese Asians). First, the characters' characters are more "direct" than the "Japanese" version. <div class = "justify"> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> "Spouse" bad behavior "<br /> <br /> Heeron's personality is very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < She is the best actress in the entire show she has performed magnificently by Scottish McNeil. <br /> <br /> Trowa, the pilot of the Hugarchy, is the only single soul that has so far been only a goal. a battle; Despite his desire to establish a relationship with the surrounding people, he knows not just to kill, to be friends. Kirby Morrow gives a strange but realistic performance like Trowa Barton. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Quatre Rebarba Winner sings by Brad Swaile, who has no problem preventing the carnal nature of her character and her innocence as she suffers her horrors. first in war and death. <br /> <br /> Guatemala is no longer a girl (yes, a Japanese woman sings by a female actress), but the 15-year-old guy is rude. Wufei Chang, played by Ted Cole, may seem a bit overwhelming, but he has a stronger roles than Heero and Trowan. Relena Darlian sounds great in English, sounds by Lisa. Ann Bailey. <br /> <strong> Zechs Merquise </ em> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Zechs Merquise can be one of the more serious sounds in comparison with the Japanese version . Both sound can bring different sides to the same character. His Japanese voice is commanded to respect high, humid and high-level status and charismatic character. <br /> <br /> Brian Drummond's English voice emphasizes Zechs' secret nature, emphasizing his secret nature and hidden beliefs about his secret agenda, calling it "more like an unusual and" snake ". <br /> <br /> OZ members are mixed bags really. Treasury Treasurer's speech in Kushrena, voiced by David Kaye, is more realistic and down-to-earth than the Japanese style rather than life. However, as Lady Une, in Japanese version, split his identity contrary and Lucrencia Noin just sounds ......... is boring often. <br /> <br /> <strong> Alliance pilots and military leaders can not even speak. <Strong> Maganac Corp. sounds were generally dull, but could have been more intense when they were given an average Middle Eastern accent. Members of the Romerfeller Foundation also sounded better with some stylish European accents reflecting the status of nobility. <br /> <br /> Despite unsubstantiated action from side symbols, the underlying shooting has resulted in a show and the results are generally presented less and more in the Gundam Wing scenario. He is very loyal to the original Japanese writings, keeping all the thought-provoking ideas and themes about politics, war, and human nature. Unfortunately, this keeps the defects in the original Japanese text.
