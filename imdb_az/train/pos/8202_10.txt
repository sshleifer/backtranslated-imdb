Undoubtedly, it was the best dirty Harry series. I'm in the story of a revenge on the opening credits, a hard hit and a hard worker. Sondra Locke is a woman who is a traumatic trauma. Eastwood has many "outsider" sequences that have nothing to do with this area, but has shown Harry's worst deeds. Small roles are loaded with unforgettable symbols, carry this movie, and serve as a standard for detective / motion flippers. It's a Dirty Harry craze with raw and any "bush" nicknames. I can do it again and again (good, not in a sitting place) because it is happy for the "revenge". Speed ​​is fast and most of the scenes are unforgettable. "Pray - make my day ... luck, Punk?" By saying that the classic Eastwood, just like Eastwood, can make frightening sounds with angry, rubber phrases and crushing.
