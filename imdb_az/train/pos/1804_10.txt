First of all, as a child, I was not afraid of these stones (on the other hand, the Little Mermaid). My head says that I still love teenagers as one of my fav children's films. A wonderful, painful film about a German shepherd named Charlie (who was murdered by Burt Reynolds in a fantastic way), murdered by his boss / partner in the murder (name ha, ha Carface). Charlie is sent to paradise because "all dogs go to paradise, because dogs are naturally good and faithful and kind, unlike humans." Chalie is sent back to the world, because his best friend, Healer, and a small orphan girl compelled Anne-Mari to put more time into life. I always looked like a child and I'm still watching it. Anyway, as I said earlier, a beautiful bitterweet movie can leave a tear in your eyes ...
