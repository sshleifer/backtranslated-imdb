I wish many people on this site to come out on AG's DVD. Yes, I got it on the DVD. Though it's great to run this horrible show in a box DVD format, I am angry (Schoen Cassidy's "Pilot Episode") and episodes appear to be the same on the TV as I add too little to the extra "way" The missing episodes that have not been displayed before running on the Sci Fi channel are packed in the box, but they are shot on the last DVD If you get a DVD set, you will get a real order and will be happier (you have to change them inside and outside the DVD to players) <br /> < br /> S
