A group of band members travels to Belgrade on a horrible bus stolen by a drunken conductor and his eyesight driver. Many ridiculous events that describe the fall of the nation's spirit in 1941 and even today as general jokes are cut off by their mockery. The man who stole the show is a peasant with a 4-meter-high peak with his four sons, twice the older. In the end, the film takes a dramatic turn, and picnics are nothing but the swords of a country that does not die.
