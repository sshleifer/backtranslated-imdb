Oh, that's so beautiful music. There is a bit wrong - Frank Sinatra is in a complicated situation as Jewish Nathan Detroit, though it is only a clear Jewish song, "Sue Me". Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut one of the best songs from the show in the form of "Adam's Day Marriage" and substitute it with the low Sinatra show. Given these two flaws, the movie is another spectacular one. Jan Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando does not care about hazelnuts, but it does get it anyway. Stubby Kaye writes the role of his Broadway (written for her) beautifully. Damon Runyon's language and pacing and humor are pretty good. This is my every chance - to see me.
