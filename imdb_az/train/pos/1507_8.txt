British manufacturer Amicus is generally known as experts of horror anthology, and this massive mass, called the "big blood circulation," is undoubtedly the best Amicus production I've ever seen (though, of course). The "bloody house" consists of four amazed macabre reminders, all of which are the same exciting mosque. These four stories are brought to you in a beautiful Gothic environment and create one of the best ensembles. Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee (both of Cushing and Lee's two most beloved actors), and Denholm Elliott, and Ingrid Pitt starring in this movie - is it possible that this true Horror fan can miss? No one, of course, offers more than just a great game. "Blood-stained house" is surrounded by an ugly village palace that strange things happen. The four-part film tells the story of four different heroes. <br /> <br /> The first reminder, "Method for Murder", with the wife of the Horror novel, Charles Hyller (Denholm Elliott). Once the writer moves, suddenly he sees the scene by the manic of his creations ... The first segment is a great start to the film. <br /> <br /> On the second floor, Waxworks, home to retired businessman Phillip Grayson (Peter Cushing) and suddenly feels that a mysterious Wax Museum in the nearby town ... Great Peter Cushing once again is a great performance, and the rest of the performance is also very good. <br /> <br /> The third story is the fourth story, the fourth and most brilliant fourth story, called "Sweet To The Sweet". John Reed (Christopher Lee) moves with her little girl. Mr. Norte is concerned about Mr Reed's special teacher and taste she has hired to train her daughter and wants to learn more about the dad's employer's daughter and to learn more about the father's protection from the superiority of his retirement ... the best segment keeps a terrible atmosphere and a real cowardly plot . Christopher Lee, as always, is outstanding in his role. Nyree Shafak Porter is very good as well as a taste, and special mention goes to 11-year-old Chloe Franks. <br /> <br /> In the fourth episode, Horror-actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee) is moving home with her sexy mistress / co, this is just what the spectacular segment film is to see for a true Horror fan. - Carla (Ingrid Pitt). This fourth story satir, in fact, is not a Horror. But there is a very interesting satiric and there are many allegations for other Horror films. At one point, Henderson, indirectly, addresses Christopher Lee, the stars of the previous third segment ... <br /> <br /> All four segments have a humorous and beautiful atmosphere. As mentioned above, the third segment is the most boat and the biggest, but the other three are the atmosphere and often macabrely humorous Horror tales that should appreciate every horror lover. A magnificent atmosphere, a strange feeling of space, a true durability and a brilliant cast will be a vision. In short: "Blood-stained house" is not an excellent Horror-omnibus, the British fear lover is unable to wait. Highly Recommended!
