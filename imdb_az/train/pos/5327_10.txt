As a talented fan to know, I made this movie a loyal and good act. When I was 11 years old, I heard some friends talking about a new sense of music that caused the girls screaming. I hmmmm, if the girls liked them, they should look like this. My only notes are Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. After a while after a family vacation in Ischia, I read a song (then learned "Love Me Do") and made a difference between each song I heard so far. I heard my brother's 'Meet The Beatles' album, and I was playing for life. (By Davis), when I read the definitive book of the beginning, I was surprised that this movie watched the facts, except that this film is not using sex and some drugs (except that it uses the metadree / dexadri). >
