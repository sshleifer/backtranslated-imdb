This movie is a great fun for watching your spouse or girlfriend. There are laughs here, and here's a very interesting little nudist story. All actresses are very interesting and able to watch their natural beauty. Maslin beach life is full of different nudists and personality types. Australian beach decor is simply wonderful to see. What to say to visit, at least say, may be one day my asylum. I really like this movie and every time I watch it, I love it more. I would like to see more of these characters and always think of them. Although the plot is slightly soft, this movie is certainly a great excuse to sit on the sofa and enjoy the beautiful and popular Maslin beach with these beautiful nudists and their personal stories.
