If you are tracking more than once, you refer to it as the Animal House (and yes, I love the Animal House). Put the top 15 funniest movies. Adults in a boy's military academy are paranoid in which every child is bad and they want to cause anxiety (in this film he is alive). He should be sadistic, uncaring, cruel and low.
