Great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are beautiful, and dance is a special word for Portobello Ballet. As for the animation section, the match between animals has become classic immediately; Due to the luminescent luminaire it is dragged and interesting. I recommend seeing a revised 134-minute version or at least a 112-minute video. In Italy, we only have a 98-minute version, although the original version of the movie is provided with 117 minutes of work. If possible, you can also watch the German video cassette: it can run for 98 minutes, but it's missing out on each scene between the Second World War and the English people and their fascist invaders!
