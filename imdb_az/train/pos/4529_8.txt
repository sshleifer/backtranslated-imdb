Among the long-haired young people, who are incredibly fond of Herr Graf's silent guarantees, aristocrats set out to travel in hot and memorable places, as well as to capture the armies of the elite. <br /> <br /> Even so strange trips around the world occur in the "Three Centuries": <br /> <br /> Of course, this German number is most popular, because of the proximity felt by this aristocrat in ancient times The first period was directed to the Stone Age. It prefers the second period of Roman glory (the demolition of the Roman Empire, that is, the barbarians or the Germans). Of course, the third segment is in modern times, but the Teutonic aristocrates thinks it should be even 100 years old. <br /> <br /> Hilarious events that make Herr Keaton and his comrades strange and in three different ages are a very complicated issue for aristocrats who prefer to look for money. It is a pleasure to watch a comic, witty silent film of a work full of laughter and gadgets, puns, pratfalls and acrobatics (even for a serious German countermeasure) whenever the "Three Centuries" is shown at Schloss Theater. <br /> <br /> <br /> And now if you allow me, I'll temporarily get my permission <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <strong>
