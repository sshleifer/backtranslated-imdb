I know what to expect before seeing this highly stylized piece. It could be a cure for total colds for the zombie virus or anything I know. It started with great images, small pieces that attract your attention and cause your imagination to be wild. As I was continuing, I quickly learned what happened. I felt that a few little neo-nyir stories were not a few minutes away. Initially, small clues to the audience with visual impression give them a sense of success, as they bring them together. Finally, it's a cool package, along with a nice curl. Though the score was bad, the movie gave a feeling of almost a music video. It only took a few years to add something to add the story line further. Some shows are very dramatic, but are perfectly fitted with common sense feelings. I'm very excited to go away. As soon as I received a lot of information, but with a great editing and noisy work, he ran or pushed me. Great job!
