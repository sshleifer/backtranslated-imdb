One of the best Indian movies I have ever seen is unhappy song and dance or dog dog movies. All actors have shown the right feelings at right intensity over time. A good sign of a movie that should return to the audience and explore the subject, which is what I have checked on Harilal. I always love Akshay Hanna's sophisticated style, and I did not want to be as dramatic as Gandhis, and did not wonder how she was helping build this character, but she had a very complicated relationship with her father, Vinod Hannah. For anil Kapoor, I was amazed at the direction and 2 bars to prepare such a classy movie.
