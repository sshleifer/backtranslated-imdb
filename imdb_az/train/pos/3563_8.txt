Here I am interested in a strong sense of grace (or sympathy) against Sinatran in other assessments. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < A charismatic successful gambler who has made a major mistake when he enters into a bet on a Cuban Stevie Army at Sarb Sarah Brown at a certain time or not. Is not this money? It is proud, but he and he meet the matches. <br /> <br /> Nathan Detroit, for many years, has to sacrifice her granddaughter Adelaide, trying to find a fun game that will enrich her fiance forever. <br /> <br /> A series of short stories by Damon Runyon: this is his unique dialogue, and this is his great character names, and this is horse racing / nightclub / late night gambling world. Then you turn to music and you never feel like you're in the movie's form. Is the camera incredibly static and pretty? and is not welcome? straight and childhood. <br /> <br /> My absolute favorite thing about this movie is the performance and movement of two non-singers, such as Brando (the sky). and Jean Simmons (like Sargeant Sarah Brown). Certainly, putting the producers in these roles would have earned better music; but something unusual is that these two great players have brought the party something else: their vocal abilities are gusto, mobility, and patches, patches, patches. You go with Peace, as Sarah argues with the judgments, stability, pipe, and security. You enjoy Sarah's relaxation under the influence of Cuban milk. You can feel the passion and passion of the scenes in the yard at an hour's intervals before the rings call and go to the yard. The sky is rightly called "chemistry". Pro singers ?? Whether they are Broadway belts or straight crooners? it can not be absolutely certain that it will happen. (And, of course, they did not.) In one place, I read somewhere that criticized Brandon Sinatrani himself as Nathan Detroit. Sinatra, in turn, was angry with Brando's four-way approach. Brando fan (which shows it?) I have to take the other side, but imagine if this film is not Brando and Simmons today, today would be a classic favorite, with their wonderful chemistry; Brandon's unexpectedness; Simmons' face was ashamed of all the pink cheeks and brown hair, a drunk and cobble bar. Beautiful. If I do not always feel good, I want to lie around one copy of this movie. Some of Nathan's (dream) conversations, though, will forgive me, even if it's 100% brush, is not it? Do not you? Oh, keep calm and have Mindy's more cheese!
