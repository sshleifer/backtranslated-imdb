I gave only 9 out of 10 because I have to rethink, there is a fresh perspective in a more intelligent mindset. The thing I remember was an incredible psychological tension that dazzled my brain and my eyes while watching. Every time I was on the agenda at HBO (probably 1990 or more), I would watch it every time. <br /> <br /> I also wrote that name, but I'm sure that the notes have already passed. <br /> <br /> I wrote to GreenCine and still do not carry it to get that name. I hope we can find her at a local video store. <br /> <br /> If you look somewhere, I advise you to try it out. At least it's interesting. If you use movies such as Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Gummo, or something like that, try this one.
