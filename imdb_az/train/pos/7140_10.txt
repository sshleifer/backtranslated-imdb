From 20 to 10 this is a really nice story about the war evacuum and groom carpenter Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is embraced by Tom and it is clear that he has serious problems when he sleeps on his first night bed. Williams is illiterate and afraid, but both are loneliness. We see this as William's ability to have an artist, and we see Tom's talent as a lieutenant colonel in an entertaining interpretation of Jerusalem. William Zakarias is a friendly guy from London, a young Jewish boy and a friend of both Tom and Zakarias. He learns to read, write and feel part of this smaller knit community. By the way, William was summoned back to London by his mother, and we see why he is so nobly. His mother is a mentally ill patient, and when Tom does not hear from William, he goes to London to look for him. Finally, she finds her dead dead and closes a basement. After a while in the hospital, Tom realized that he had to kidnap him and take him home. It is said that my son will be accepted by Tom, but also an unfinished plant, when he learned that his best friend, Zakarias, was killed in an air attack in London. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving scenes for me was while Tom was officially talking to the Home Office. <br /> <br /> I love it, why is it worthwhile, and I think I love it too. <br /> <br /> It's not better, does it?
