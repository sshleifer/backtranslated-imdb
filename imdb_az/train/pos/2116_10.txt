Is there a more attractive movie than this movie? One of the reasons why everything is good is that the actor's group really looks alike and can affect each other's life. Its center is the "romanticism" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullava, who can work together and can not be confronted, but with an anonymous pen penalty. But there are also supportive characters, and unlike most romantic comedies (including "Got Mail", the latest update of Shop), you just do not get the potential and support for their needs. Everyone is a complicated part of Ernst Lubitsch's glamorous goblin. One of the most heartwarming scenes in the history of the film is when tragic Frank Morgan searches for a Christmas meal with a casual and casual man. A must! **** exit ****
