When I started watching the show, I said, "Oh, no, Elfen is as rosy, not bloody as Lied!". <br /> <br /> But this is almost the same as a single young boy living in a large house, and then directly into a fantastic adventure, where the similarity stops. Love story is as subtle and intricate as in Inuija, but children's words and behaviors are very few. The magic structure is a little dark, because seven people are fighting for the Holy King, one of all servants, half of all masters of the same school, the rules of engagement and so on. <br /> <br /> I actually watched all 24 episodes in one day, and I do not compare with anime I like, but I have to say that I'm very satisfied with other genres.
