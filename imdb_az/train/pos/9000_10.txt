For the first time during the Hawaii International Film Festival, I first saw SAMURAI in PRANIYA. HELP! WOW! Blood blew us only with transparent verve, haemorrhage, vigor, tear, excitement, bizarre, frightening and more, and all this is GREAT FUN! Specifically, for all those Japanese speakers, who use samurai and ninja movies, they are NOT READY.
