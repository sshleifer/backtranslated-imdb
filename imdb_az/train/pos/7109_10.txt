First, let's start with the negative points: 1) There are big questions in the storyline and there are questions that can not be where they are approaching the questions; 2) The film is not for everyone, so sensitive audiences will not be worried and will begin to start filming. <br /> <br /> The two points above are important because the film is very quiet. In an old-fashioned theater (as I went), you can even hear the rim of the projector. I liked it. The film does not deal with music or effects: it allows you to think what's going on. <br /> <br /> Generally, there is a rhythm deficiency that creates an unpleasant atmosphere. The same kind of atmosphere arisen at Eyes Wide Shut by Stanley Kubrick. <br /> <br /> It is a great thing for cinema artists. Those who are grateful for a single story movie will be disappointed. Then the type of story you need to create in your mind. (My version is pretty tough, but probably not too exception!) If you capture the movie, there are so many cool parts: when two police chat with each other on their mobile phones. Indeed, the ultra-cool sound effect puts you at the moment. Hats for the person who intends to do so.
