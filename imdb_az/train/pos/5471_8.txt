In 1933, this film was a lot of shooting, because the story was so great, and Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) said he would do everything to get the great wealth and power. Lily's father forced his 14-year-old daughter into prostitution and brought up a city with very weak people growing up in a steel mill, and her father brought every man who opened his eyes to Lily's house. . As the story progresses, Lily sees a man after man and eventually finds a boy with everything and is a playboy bank president. This picture was produced by very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr.), who was only 25 years old, and Jimmy did not even go to Lily for the first time, even for lunch. In addition to Barbara Stanwyck, very young George Brent (Coutland Trenholm) stars and both gave outstanding performances. Created by Darryl F. Zanuck since 1933 and has been locked for several years with a flaw, and recently featured on a silver screen, is a great movie. This movie is relatively soft on Hollywood screens today, but in 1933, it was not so good to watch such a movie. Enjoy
