I appreciate such films as intelligent and well-designed, entertaining, swallowing, good motion and beautifully directed. No one, even Pacino, strives to distinguish it from the stage; <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive moments of the film (Aielo's favorite ramp) was longing for the withdrawal. <br /> <br /> PLEASE, Mind your mind with eyes, ears, and hearts. <br /> <br /> You know, Pacino is doing it on a special stage, but it is precisely what's needed. There is a great scene.
