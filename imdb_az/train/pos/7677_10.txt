Wow, this movie has had a great impact on me and it has moved me. This is an incredible story about Cambodian girls selling sexually. I can not stop thinking about the fate of a little girl named Holly. The film is realistic, the film is eye-catching, and I can not imagine getting away from anyone who wants to help change with this scary problem. <br /> <br /> The film has acted very much. This was one of the best films I've ever seen. Playing a Hollywood <br /> <br /> A girl doing a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The film tells me a tremendous message that requires me to hear around the world. Everyone should see this movie. I think that this movie will be different, I love it!
