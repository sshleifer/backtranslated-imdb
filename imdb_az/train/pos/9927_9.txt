Domino is a great movie. The name of a young woman named Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley), a gambler-hunter, due to her lifestyle of boredom. He merged with two friends hunter (Mickey Rourke & Edgar Ramirez) and begins adventures. The scenario is good. Very low-to-earth and realist with movie tone. <br /> <br /> The problem with this film is not to be the Domino character, but to concentrate on the different things we do. <br /> <br /> However, Kiera Knightley gives a fierce performance. He shows this performance in the right amount of anger and selflessness. Mickey Rourke is watching Oscar-Worthy's performance with a harder man in Sin City. Edgar Ramirez really does not talk about Spanish for some time and does something else at Kiera. Delroy Lindoi provides a good supportive performance. Mo'nun was himself, though he was surprised at a special scene. <br /> <br /> Although the film is the best thing, Lucy Liu has a great chemistry with Kiera Knightley on her stage. Tony Scott's fast paced style really brings the film to life. Cinematography is the best I've ever seen. Draws a normal movie and puts acid. All black blacks are darker, the nets are brighter and have a kind of green shine on it. Operation scenes are enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Worldwide: If you like Sin City & Man at Fire, you will be like Domino.
