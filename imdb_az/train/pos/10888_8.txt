It's one of these little Christmas movies for everyone. Scrooge, Ben Affleck, thinks that money is not enough, so HIS hires a family living in the family's mind. OK? <br /> <strong> Now, Affleck is a hunter and a usual this entertaining, when we go through the OMG, when we recall ... break down as in the last stages of a neuroinfectious disease. But that's good, because this old Oracle is hoping that if all of Ben's sides are getting better, there are still hopes. Fortunately, the rest of this store - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - make the shimmering Ozzie-Harriet Christmas alternate, pleasant, comfortable and warm. <br /> <br /> This movie is a kind of jumping and wondering, and when you go back, everyone wants to return it to show that you miss him. <br /> <br /> This is a happy movie and it feels good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. It's really something for everyone.
