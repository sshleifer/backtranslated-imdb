<br /> <br /> I've just recently and always enjoyed watching one of my favorite movies on the DVD. <br /> <br /> I'm from Hazel O'Connor and to this movie just watched me in tears, especially "Will You". A clean nostalgia trip for my youth. <br /> <br /> <strong> The second best rate for Quadrophenia (played at Phil Daniels). <br /> <br /> A great soundtrack and a great landscape in the UK's Thatcherite grew up in my 80's. Just a few hours after the film's end, I'm like a dark baby. <br /> <br /> I'm wearing this DVD again and I can watch it again and again. <br /> <br /> Despair, you're saddened to hear your dad's lover. Allah does not annulize all of you. xx
