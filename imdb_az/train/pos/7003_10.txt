The emotional effect of this movie does not reflect the words. It is spacious, delicate, beautiful, and scattered all over the clock. According to Will Smith, he reaches the full range of player abilities. Who knew? When I saw the desire for happiness and thinking, this blockbuster, in turn, must be a frost for actor Smith. His performances in both films depict Smith, another dimension, the sensitivity of the talent, the selectivity of scripts, but I'm not sure, but now I see it differently. Seven Pounds is one of those films that have to stop believing to get full pleasure. Do not explain by the field, according to the fragile state of the human heart, both in word and metaphorically. This man is a story of sin, consecration, love, and sacrifice.
