<br /> <br /> I had seen this movie for a long time, but it was wonderful, and I was never surprised at this day. <br /> <br /> A beautiful film that describes the accounts of some Australian comedians <br /> <br /> These comedians are held in a flat dress and are spied by Japanese prisoners. <br /> <br /> Any Hollywood WW2 movie that I see is something that has not been studied much. <br /> <br /> Close and friendly relationships between captives and prisoners are developing. The Captain of the Australian military captives begins to respect each other as best friends with the great Japanese prison guard. This is the most beautiful part of the whole movie, and it really carries your heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Aussi captain, <span style = "color: red;"> "will remain calm because it can lead to the whole group, but the captain remains resolute to admit it to the Japanese government." <br /> Finally, the Japanese government <br /> <br /> This is the highest Honor given to Japanese prisoners of war. <br /> <br /> This is the most awesome part of the movie waiting for the deadly death of Aussie's soldiers, and the friendly Japanese monk <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A fine work, one day a day Take it and surprise.
