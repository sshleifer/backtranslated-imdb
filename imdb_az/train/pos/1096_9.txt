I first saw this movie in the afternoon in 1980. After many subsequent tracks (and video capture), I still laugh at me loud. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's the remains of another age - a local comedy created in a rich middle class - but well executed. However, this is a document of his era: post-war optimization, baby boom and new consumer age. This movie is not a "guilty" pleasure. <br /> <br /> Three magnificent actors - Mary Melvyn Douglas; angry Cary Grant; <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are, "That means we're in an explosion" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little piggy". <br /> <br /> Love.
