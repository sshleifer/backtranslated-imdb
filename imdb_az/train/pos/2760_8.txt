Everyone we see affects the way we think, transforms our ways, and drives us to a few people. "Eighth Day" draws on this subject (compare "Rainmaker"). In this film, Harry (Daniel Auteuil), a business psychologist, meets with Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a child with Down's syndrome. And the victory of these actors, as well as the power of this film. The opening sequence is perfect at Georges' conclusion, which connects the theory of the world with the world and on the last eight days determines what God has created. There are some moments in the story that is very frustrating for Harry. For example, Georges, which is completely uninhibited, requires a few expensive shoes and does not have enough money. It's such a scene that you laugh at your tears. The Down Syndrome team liked a scene in Art Gallery on a bus ride and the collapse of the Paradis fun park. The most spectacular part of all embarrassment is the scene where Harry and Georges are horse-riding and retreating on the highway. Georges gives the driver a rough welcome. But there are also some exquisite scenes that are especially effective in using hands, sun, wind and rain, hands extending, hands extending, and hands that are stuck in love and friendship. This is a real movie touching the heart. Georges has many moving scenes suggested by Nathalie, where Georges holds Harry's head, where Georges calls for his dear mother, where Georges Harryi teaches laughs. I felt a deep message in the film that there were so many wonderful herbs (do you know that when you cut it?), Over the trees, birds' song, and little insects - the miraculous creatures of all nature. If we go back and watch around us like Harry and Georges, they all love it ...... A beautiful movie.
