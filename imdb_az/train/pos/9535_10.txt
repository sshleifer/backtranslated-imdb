The release film has since been neglected. The Oscars were the second work of Sam Mendes (and, in my opinion, the best work), the Oscar, three years ago, but very controversial American Beauty. <br /> <br /> This is a mild film and at the same time extremely horrible and sad. <br /> <br /> depression difficult days seems relatively rich and happy family story, Michael Sullivan, local mafia boss father, played by Paul Newman Leading a man, the great Tom Hanks (I'm not a fan, but I say it ) playing with two children. After a long-lasting ignorance, the great-grandfather Michael Sullivan Jr., his eldest son, played by his eldest son Tyler Hoechlin, knows what his father's work and his family were. Wanting to know his dignity and truth, he accidentally witnessed a crime committed by his father's son John Rooney. Such a discovery invokes an innocent soul and has led to numerous events that change lives forever. The atmosphere of the era, all the backgrounds and ornaments are perfectly created, corrected and filmed when the film is written, the cinematography is almost impeccable. The main line of the film, the main factor in the success of the most important moments and film scores and bad times, difficult relations with parents ogllu. They are deep, strong and convincing. Tom Hanks is not perfect and has one of the best performances of his career playing an extremely unusual role, and is outstanding in all squad. Finally, Paul Newman is worthy of a very good account and ultimately we get a wonderful job of all the people involved in this wonderful (but more sad) masterpiece. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10 in my 10th grade
