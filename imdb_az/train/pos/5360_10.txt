Where a standard liner type moves and movement is checked at the door, this movie is at the top of the classroom. It would have been even worse if the casting man put "good" players in this flick (you call yourself "do not move", except that Richard Dawson is really good). I love this movie! Running Man is probably God's gift to man (okay, perhaps only men). One of the most popular films of the time we are dealing with our favorite line is: "A rich example of life is part of Brendan, and use it in a better way." Ahh, maybe we can imagine that more people are called "Brenda", referring to this film.
