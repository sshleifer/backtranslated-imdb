Recently, I was looking for a new Wide Screen DVD, FLY AWAY HOME, and I have never heard of an interesting topic: GRAY OWL. It's my focus on being Richard Attenborough Film (responsible for beautiful films such as GANDHI, CHAPLIN, and SHADOWLANDS). I realized that the script was William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This "Special Edition" was full of exciting sounds and it was only $ 10.00 - I followed it up and bought it. HELP! WOW! What a beautiful movie. Pierce Brosnan acts as a real life-style singer, Archie Gray Owl, who works to protect and protect the wild lands in Canadian 1930s. Brosnan (who takes part in a James Bond film), like Annie Galipeau, gives a shady, warm and powerful performance, especially the strange - a young woman who likes and feels for the living creatures. A beautiful account by George Fenton (THE CRUCIBLE) and beautiful photograhy by Roger Pratt greatly affects the effectiveness of the film. And the extras on this DVD are something else! In the 1930s, together with Real Gray Owl, Attenborough and Producer Jake Eberts have two shorts designed with audio traces; 2 features; Many other nice PLUS options for those who have access to a PC with DVD-ROM features. GRAY OWL has been released directly to the DVD in the United States - Richard Attenborough is concerned with the fact that Hollywood has not been interested in spreading something that has not been loaded with violence or sex. This is a movie that creates something to think about as well as information and entertainment. I've had a very warm feeling in the movie's results - a new love and understanding for the violets! GRAY OWL is a very nice movie - check the cost! This is a desire to share with others.
