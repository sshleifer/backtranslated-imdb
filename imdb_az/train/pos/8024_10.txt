When I saw this movie for the first time in 1980, I was on an average age and thought myself to grow in the "Susam Street / Muppets" period. Honestly, I do not remember if it liked it in time. But once again, I watched this movie in college, and it was going to my personal Best Films Ever collection (and left). <br /> <br /> This movie is full of humor, from above and beyond. Muppets would be expected. I would like to say that the Muppets have always appealed to adults and children because there are humor against both. But come ... Janice accidentally speaks to one of them: "I do not take my clothes for someone to work" ... a father has a joke if his son falls in love with Kermit then the frog then does not want to hear it ... Gonzo, mouth oral resuscitation sp?), and then says, "Now we think we're busy." These and many other moments in the movie shook me. Add this movie to this very intelligent dialogue, a very clever New York / Broadway humor, a hugely popular community and some really delightful "child-friendly cheese". a work! I do not throw the "10" shot on a regular basis ... but it's worth it. For more than 20 years, this movie has been preserved, perhaps more. Muppets have never been and never will be funny and smart and just as straightforward as in this movie. --- Q
