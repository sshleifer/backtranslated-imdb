Sometimes Lady Luck smiles at me. I prepared and copied for the first time - this is a VHS cashback of a wonderful TV presentation. <br /> <br /> Recently I subscribed to a digital cable, and while searching through upcoming movies, there were some movies for me. surprise was a live broadcast of the movie. But this time I made a copy of DVDs and did not have a chance to repeat my mistake. <br /> I finally had to watch it again after eight years. I saw it for the first time. This story is of little significance to me, with the first reference to "Pandora's Clock" by reading a book on a public radio. I just started out to go to dinner at the broadcasting station and I was hooked at the first taxi. <br /> <br /> After a few months I learned that the book will be broadcasted on television as a movie, and after a few months I learned that <br /> <br /> First of all, the film, in contrast to the opinion of another reviewer, I would like to say that it is very accurate. <br /> <br /> Second, I agree with others about casting. Captain Holland could not think of a better choice than Richard Dean Anderson. In essence, the key role could be the accident and burning of the film without the proper disposal. Anderson has never been better, and we have not seen him anymore. <br /> <br /> For me only one complaint - and the book was the attraction of the "terrorist plot" to arm a private business jet. airborne missiles and pilot horns, and hit the jet. Basically, we are talking about performing and implementing such a plan for less than 36 hours, and this is not just realistic considering all participants. <br /> <br /> <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this movie, do it all the time.
