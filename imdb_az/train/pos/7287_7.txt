Brain, who did not want to die in 1959, was considered terrible because he was demanding a few interruptions and three years before being released in 1962. Today it is difficult to imagine how much everyone was involved in 1959; <br /> <br /> This story, of course, belongs to a doctor who has an interesting experience in the transplantation of the signs - and this is also lurid and levd. When her girlfriend was killed in a car crash, she was driving her head to a secret laboratory. A few phone cords re-energize their heads with the help of a few hooves and looks like a neat cooking pot. But is it grateful? Not too difficult. <br /> <br /> When planning to place a prison head in another body, it's especially about something that's all about. <br /> <br /> As the life goes on, the physician is a choice about this new body: he wants a place built for speed and he is looking for women who challenge the sidewalks of the city, shaking the ribbon joints, walking through the beautiful races of the corpses and boosting their eyebrows trying to hunt cheesecake models in search. But after returning to the laboratory, the head has a psychological contact with one of the physicians' experiences, which is so bad that he keeps it closed without the need for a laboratory lab. Can he work together to get rid of painful and harmful labs, get rid of a doctor, and rescue a woman who has been abducted? Can be! Leading lead Jason Evers plays a roguish doctor, as given a great Spanish flicker; Leith, Virginia, shouts and abstains despite the fact that she does not have an unhappy head, no lungs, and perhaps even a tone of voice. Sometimes fathers enter an incredibly nudisted music, actors make ineffective character changes from the line, the dialogue is more invulnerable and a calculator is needed to add consistency. <br /> <br /> Generally, it's NOT THE OTHER LIKE the Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Director Joseph Green is trying to keep all the stuff in a pretty good movie, Films that led to the release of the film have been lost forever, but cuts for television have been restored in Alpha version and the film and sound quality is not particularly good. <br /> <br /> Now, one of these films is incredibly boring or dull You can find fun, so it is very difficult to give a recommendation. But I will say: If your taste is Ed Wood or Russ Meyers, then leave it to work as soon as possible! Only four stars for joyful enthusiasm! GFT, Amazon Reviewer
