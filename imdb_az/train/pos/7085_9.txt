I just bought the DVD and want to say that Terry is doing it again (after seeing Brazil and fears in Las Vegas after a hate). Without being a fan of Monty Python, Terry Gilliam's genius Bruce Willis plays a wonderful role as James Cole, and maybe my favorite character, Brad Pittin, Jefferey Goines. </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Instead, by the "twelve monkey army" in the past the survivors are saved from a disease intended to eradicate the human race. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is back in 1996 to learn about the disease (the emergence of the virus), so scientists can find his cure. Before leaving, James Cole lives in a subterranean society and dominates the world because of the illness that animals kill. Probably, when it was sent back, it was actually sent back in 1990. After he left, he meets with Jefferey Goins (Brad Pitt), who is mainly responsible for raising the race. He also met with Comrade (Madelein Stowe), who was sent to the team (Madelein Stowe) to rescue him in the world with Bruce (who sees his statements correctly in his testimony), and he was sent out in the past in 1996 and then asked for his health after the last quarter of the film's decline and then he is a little shocked to stop the person carrying the virus (actually, not Brad Pitt), and is replaced by the murderer as the killer escapes by the police.
