This film has many parts of the great biblical epics of the 1950s and 60s. But perhaps this is the first thing that really bleeds the biblical characters. The best thing about this is that it does not diminish them in the eyes of the viewer. <br /> <br /> This is a unique and complementary balance that helps us to understand that even the great people, such as David, are defective in finding people who have faith and greatness despite their imperfections. Actors in the film for the first time, like Gilbert Barnett David, was like Bathsheba with Susan Hayward as the ultimate Absolom. Hayward does his best in this film. Better than life, it's bigger, it's home. <br /> <br /> Raymond Massey does a great job like the prophet Nathan. When I first saw the movie, Massey really was talking to the Lord himself and had a wonderful look. No doubt, along with the 100 films, the great music created by Alfred Newman always made great achievements in the other biblical epics like "The Robe" and "The Greatest Story"! Leon S. Shamroj's cinema photography is well-designed and in addition to its size, it has also become the closest to the film. Henry King, who is really a baseless filmmaker like William Wyler, never reverts in any genre, never sees the love story between David and Bathsheba and his devout struggle with God at a speed that is ever greater than life. The road that took place in this movie could be very hockey, but the King is real and exciting. In addition, we will never lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand God's will, just as David had struggled with himself. At the first scene where a soldier killed, he tried to escape the ship's destruction. David is not pleased with Nathan's answer (no one can understand God's will). <br /> <br /> Finally, this film belongs to Gregory Peck, who is as beautiful as King David. His conviction that David was able to govern a country violently, but he was a loyal singer. <br /> <br /> I do not see this movie much more on television, but when I see it I do not have to watch it. I think it is also very good today.
