A guy named John Voight Joe plays. Joe shakes with an angry childhood. Because of his traumatic baptism, there is strong fear and hatred for religion. He leaves his job as a dish and goes out to become a hustle for rich people. He responds with a mistake called Ratso (Dustin Hoffman), and the latter responds to the relationship. They come out and work together to help each other. They are thieves. The two are very close and can not live with each other soon. But Ratso Joe has nothing to do with it, and it can destroy any of these cities together. This is one of the biggest films ever made. This is a heartwarming portrait of many people who have nothing to lose. Their story is destructive to watch, but it is very important for the outcome of the people. These characters are sometimes seen as crazy people looking at the street. Difference, this movie is one of their perspectives. Their lives have been shown to us, and in this film the pedestrians see them as dirt, especially when they see that we are one of those people. But the film does not try to walk around you. Instead, it shows you the rough side of the hustling lifestyle. Like many Hollywood films, it's not as pleasant and easy as lifelike illustrations like MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN. The lifestyle of men being hustler is an ugly, angry and ugly life, and people like Joe have humiliated themselves in this film. I was most excited about this movie that I went on in 1969, and it was a great time to stop. Today's audience will still find a great deal in this movie, and still loves it and will not like it until 1969, when its critics and audiences are everywhere. The film is rated X, but I'm different from this movie, which is described in a more honest, realistic and effective way. Everyone in the sexual relationship knows that hell can be as exciting, cheerful, and intimidating as possible, and this movie does not go away. The sex of this movie can not be as graphic as it once was. People like X, Midnight Nightclub, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, GREETINGS, LAST TANGO in Paris and FRITZ THE CAT, appear to be surprisingly surprised by shocking things today that may face R rating. MIDNIGHT Sex scenes in Cowboy seem pretty powerful, but of course not sexy. They are not graphics, but they are realistic, and if people see this movie, people need to be taken into account. The language used in the film, especially the word "faq" is used and is inappropriate. Violence is a shock to watch today, but still needs space to describe a hustler world. I'm really glad to see MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and, though not much, as it has in 1969. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this classic enough and I hope the audience will continue to find it because it's really a very special and memorable experience and will soon be forgotten. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - John Voight and Dustin Hoffman will both watch and surprise. They have not played a role like this before or since, and they are quite different from normal. You will not forget anyone who plays them in just a few minutes! <br /> <br /> <strong <br /> <br /> <strong>
