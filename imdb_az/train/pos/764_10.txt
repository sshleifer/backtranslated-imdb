Without a doubt, Beat Street is the best film about the breaking scene. Everything about it is stain, clothes (puma), music and, most importantly, a dance! This story is fundamentally basic, but what is it to tell a story in your life? The whole point of the film is to show what children are doing at that moment. This shows that adolescents are generally good at music, dance and friendship, which is important for children everyday. After watching the DVD, I was surprised at how good the trial was! The dresses did not look at history (probably Puma has a great recycling), music is still sounds and dance is still attractive to watch. A film of 10 to 25 must see as part of a youth culture.
