I'm very picky about the movies I've seen. I heard about Moon Child completely about the crash. I've been an admirer of L'Arc En Ciel for a while, and I'm just an admirer of Gackt and Mizer. <br /> <br /> Finally, I learned that the movie was re-released, and that's the second idea. <br /> <br /> As I'm critical about movies, I acknowledge that moving scenes can sometimes be a bit hockey ... but as another user suggests, they are also supposed to be from the storm taken from Gary Oldman before the storm without pretending to spoiler, the film hit me hard because it's bound to be boundless, as it often says, is true friendship loyalty and loyalty. <br /> <br /> Hyde and Gackt are able to make the depth of their lyrics so profoundly he performs speeches demonstrating he can, and his passion for music is on the big screen and in the process. <br /> <br /> As seen in the film, the movie creates an exemplary film that will reach the soul and emotional answer. For the first time, I figured it would probably be up to heavy rotation as I gathered. If you want to get away from the Hollywood trend in the movie, I would like to encourage everyone who reads this post ... it's a completely new direction with the classic Yakuza movie elements, and how can you go wrong with a community? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> 10/10
