If you like the genuine comedy comedy, or when you read your answer, you love "wedding celebrities." I can not believe this movie is not rated as highly rated. Basically Meadows plays a character that is different from Austin Powers. There are many ingenuity moments in this gagara. Out of ugliness - Leon used to eat on the patio with Leon, an ex-boyfriend eats food. . He is excellent. Endangered lunatic-clown type, Broadway routine, over the sound. Meadows is very good as a kid, but very sweet Leon. Some great lines "do not blame wang" "very freaky deaky sex world". . . Why this movie is a great mystery. Great comedy.
