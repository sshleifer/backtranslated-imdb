EL MAR is a hard, harsh, brilliant, brave act of kinematic art. By adapting Agustí Villaronga, Antoni Aloy and Blai Bonet's novel Biel Mesquida, he created a film that traced the effects of the war on the minds of children and explained how this impact affects adult lives. Although attention is a terrible weapon of war on children, it is clear that the soldiers and adults seem to be affected. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the most important anti-warfare documents without resorting to leaflets: the latter result has a bigger impact on native story after the juvenile procession. <br /> <br /> A small group of children threatened with the Spanish Spanish Civil War, the delays of the citizens and the night-time massacres. Ramala (Nilo Moor), the Tour (David Lozano), Julia (Sergi Moreno) and Francisca (Victoria Verger) witness the horrors of the assassination of men and the revenge that killed one and committed suicide. These wide-eyed children are all those who are exposed to mental illness and pressure in their minds. <br /> <br /> We then face three adult men who are all confined to tuberculosis sanitation. Ramala (Roger Casamajor) survived as a prostitute, protected by her 'john' Morell (Juli Mira) and hiding her lifestyle. The tour (Bruno Bergonzini) was a gentle gay controversial gay man who was covered by the Catholicism and the slander of self-injury / chauvinism. Francisca (Antònia Torrens) became a nun and served to sanitation patients. The three become a re-environment in a sanitary environment and slowly expose wounds in the childhood experience of each of them. Ram loves Ramallah's love, wants to be free from Ramala Morell, and faces the inner needs of Francis with the habit of white. <br /> <br /> The sanitation system is played between life and death, loyalty and love between love and devotion. It is an imaginary kind of cruelty that can be overwhelmed by the fact that a more detailed film destroys the individual viewer, but it is enough to say that graphic sex and full nudity should be ready to witness to the audience and the audience (still in the most strikingly cunning pictures). These scenes are extremely important for this audience, and Director Villaron should be applauded for perseverance and courage to soothe this story. Both actors like children and adults are beautiful: Roger Cassamoor, Bruno Bergonzini and Antònia Torrens are in pretty good roles. Jaime Peracaula's cinematography and music recording by Javier Navarrete serve the director's vision. This tough movie has recommended only those who can not endure the horrors of a battlefield and its consequences. With English subtitles in Spanish. <br /> <br /> Grady Harp
