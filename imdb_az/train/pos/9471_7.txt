Steve Carell, Dan Burns, stopped the pain of the newspaper and played his only father with three girls. <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Done to be in a large family home on the sea Dan meets her perfect woman, and only to find out if she is in contact with her brother /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , made him very successful in his broad comedy acts. If you can not accept it, do not be afraid, "Smart Get" will be next year, but for the record I thought it was very good. Dan In Real Life is a typical, casual, family-run drama, but it's funny and funnier when it comes to frustration with Carell's condition. Massive is not original (but if you only watch movies with genuine ideas, cinematic collection would be really small), but Dan In Real Life is a fun and good cast (who will not fall) <br /> <br /> I hope Steve Carell pushes himself and does not work. Something more interesting.
