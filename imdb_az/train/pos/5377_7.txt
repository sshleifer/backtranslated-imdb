"College Girl Murders" I first met Edgar Wallace's writing job? generally the first real acquaintance with the movie "Krimi"? and I want to say that I was moderately affected. These things are really fun, though I would never expect it? fugitive! The film has an exciting and chic place, with a healthy dose of humor, luxurious twists and incredible inventions. There are some James Bond types in the bad mastermind? always attract the prisoners to kill certain girls in a private college with a new type of poison - sitting in the shade and in front of a large monitor. There is also a painful monk with a whip, dressed as a communist KKK member, getting rid of the remaining heroes, extravagant teachers and a strange police commissar, who continues to solve the problem with such a psychological approach. Seriously, if I knew immediately that these Crimean films were very colorful and naked, they would still gather them all. The pretzel area really boosts more questions than the end answer, and the Scottish Yard Inspector Higgins has a bit of fun to load at the expense of comic gimmicks sometimes, but it's a lot of fun because it does not care. Even the funky 60's soundtrack remained in my head for a long time. There is an option in Italian Giallo, but with slapstick elements.
