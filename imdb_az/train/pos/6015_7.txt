Many of us who accepted the hippy / acid / alternative culture in the early 1970s understood that the general society would not change in the way we think. For me, this movie is "what now?" Determined tension. Most of the people I know I then felt. <br /> <br /> Do we lead the public and create utopia's vision or promote radicalization and change? <br /> <br /> Radical rhetoric with police from unhappy actions, love from Pink Floyd's music. Desert scenes and explosive images - many there. It holds an important moment in time.
