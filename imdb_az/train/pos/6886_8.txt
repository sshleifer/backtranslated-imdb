This is no different than any movie, and the closest thing I can compare is a Woody Allen movie ... But as with Woody Allen, human beings are constantly trying to find a way to handle it, to make us better or worse an invalid insecurity that works. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the case of Louis, the root cause of her stuttering can be the only childhood vascular traumas that occur with spoon. <br /> <br /> There are some strange neurotic people in the world and I believe that everyone is worthy of a chance to survive, though after the diversity of human nature has created such an exciting place all over the world, perhaps it is beyond our nostrils or breasts We should not repair the neurosis. /> <br /> This is an indie film shot in a long film, but the film's scope is as much as the scope of its production. I feel like a quirky gem of the self help market. I really hope to see the future of this filmmaker, I can imagine a career along the line of Woody Allen or Albert Brooks, although a guy like this usually goes off and "X MEN" and humble quirky roots are soon forgotten or they are .... X Men are a bunch of freaks aout if I remember properly :)
