When I read the story of Armistead Maupins for the first time, Gabriel's drama, drawn by people interested and loved by him. Almost, we have given the movie version of an excellent story and we look forward to passing Hollywood glow ... <br /> <br /> Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have truly succeeded! <br /> <br /> Only with the right amount of limit, Robin Williams takes the fragile essence of Jabriel and sees the struggle for trust in the world (Jess) and the world around him (Donna). <br /> <br /> We recalled that as we have seen with these drama players, nothing has ever happened, and that the smallest event can change in a lifeless fashion. <br /> <br /> The requirement for a young man to review a book makes life changeable, helping to find the strength within Jabrail for progress and advancement. <br /> <br /> It's bad that many people will run away from this movie. I just said that the average Americans "Robin Williams has a serious role, it did not work before!" Give SPECIAL FILM DOWN! Robin Williams touches the darkness inside us to become good people. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Advanced human appearance and screen in 1940 presence. <br /> <br /> <strong> S ~
