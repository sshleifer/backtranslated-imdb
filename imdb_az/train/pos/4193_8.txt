Director Sam Fuller has a cult following, especially in Europe. Most of the films are unforgettable. However, he shot a really horrible film in the "Pick Up in the South Street" film.

There is a scene in which Jean Peters is bouncing by Widmark. This is really shocking. <br /> <br /> <strong> The Caucasus
