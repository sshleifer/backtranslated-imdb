I watched the DVD The Babysitter as part of the BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics (composed of Crown International Pictures releases). <br /> <br /> This film presents many stories for a very short time. Hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual impropriety, blackmail and murder are all in one place! <br /> <br /> The chief actors have a reliable job. <br /> <br /> Along with this, I found the ink-woven evidence to be convincing and interesting. <br /> <br /> Along with this, first of all, if you are asked to provide more support for bikers, especially in a few words. Perhaps, the actors used real bikers instead. In particular, several characters were quite convincing. <br /> <br /> Music honey is a must-have for centuries, tempo and story to move forward. I found the true treatment of musical music. At the opening of the movie, I saw the music of The Food, I googled them; but did not find anything ... <br /> In any case, writer, producer, and actor in this film, George E. Carey loved this idea (married man, a trial, a trial, and, of course, a less helped) wrote, produced and played with "Weekend Career".
