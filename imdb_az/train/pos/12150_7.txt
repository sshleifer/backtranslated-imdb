This film is one of the many Kung Fu action packed with cheap sound effects in the early 80s in the '70s. But, unlike most films of this genre, there is a decent area and great comedy. When a staff member of the paint factory is dismissed by Manchu Bullies, they hire a gangster (Gordon Liu) to scare them. When his failure fails, he includes a Shaolin Temple to learn to fight for real. But instead of making him a Kung-fu student, the Master orders him to build a pier to cover the roofs of the 36 rooms. Well, he performs these tasks to learn the skills of becoming a Kung-Fu expert (bumbo poles and stacking)! Like Karate Kid, Mr Miagi taught Daniel the basics of karate, teaching him the daily work - "Wax on, wax off" and cetera. There's plenty of great comedy from beginning to end, and Gordon Liu is very active at the end when he faces his Manchu tormentors again. "This time is not just tricks - it's true!" Liu says proudly boasts his chest. If you love classic Kung Fu films, I do not want to miss it!
