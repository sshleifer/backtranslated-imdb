The premiere of this anime series is about bread, to justify everything! I really laughed. The main character has special bread, and he goes to the bakery school. I've decided that the DVD is available, whether it's subtitled or dubbing - it's okay. Even the single song theme is funny. At one point in the subject there is a African-Japanese man with a horse Afro, a samurai uses a French baget as a sword. These images will not be logical until you see anime. You laugh until you hurt yourself. Undoubtedly, the most unique anime I have ever seen.
