When I heard about this movie, I had to check it out. Yes, I heard about it, then I found the trailer. After that, I have to see it. And I'm very glad. Want to see classic TV with mixed-up zombie? No? <br /> <br /> FIDO is a different film than anything I've seen. Well, in fact, that's it. This is something like the Lassie episode and the Zombie movie. When combined, it feels totally new and original. FIDO, a new boy named Timmy and a new Fido man. Well this new pet is no squawking parakeet or some potty training puppy. A deadly dead man ... a zombie. A great radiation cloud led to the rise of all the dead that caused the Wars of Zombies. Reinhold Giger, thanks to the genius of the genius scientist ZomCon, will destroy your brain, the zombie will be destroyed, and thus will defeat us in the war of Zombi and win. Despite the long-term radiation, anyone who dies is a zombie. Especially problems with the elderly. Zomkom starts again with more improvements, especially with Domestication Collar. The linear zombie ceases its need for human beings and therefore destroys them as pets. <br /> <br /> It is a fantastic idea that FIDO brings to life. <br /> <br /> <strong> FIDO -. An all-star cast and great article FIDO climbs above the comedy / horror genre. Indeed, there are many funny and original situations that amuse me. After seeing the film, I think the film will be better in black and white. In less than 90 minutes the film does not last long and moves from the field to the scene in a good way. It will end up being a cult-classic of some sort, because it does not really laugh at a classy comedy or even a horror movie. A comedy / family / zombie movie shot in 1950. If you think of anything I said here, leave this movie. But if you are still on the fence, leave your foot down and stay there. 8.5 outta 10
