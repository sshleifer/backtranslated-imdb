Amazing! Wow. It's a really fantastic "travel" movie, with black, pretty strange feelings, about how super-surreal images, dark intentions and cartoon animals should look at the world. It is packed with a very beautiful outer world that differs from each other, looks like one another and flows through tightened backgrounds. With all the cool fantasy, the browsing structure is the second to the viewer's vision and we follow a cat and zombie brother as we encounter. deaths, spilled water, elephants, swords and samurai swords. I have never heard of it, but now I love it - it probably reminded me of the work of the American animated film; Bill Plympton. This is a demented delight for fans of amazing, wonderful things and I was glued to the screen for fear of escaping an incredible thing. Just "Hello Kitty" without "o".
