This movie will not fit well with some, but it should be a look. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Some of them have sometimes recommended for discussion, in fact, African-American couples are trying to unite, and most of them are African Americans tried to stay as a refugee. <br /> <br /> This small Showtime movie is almost like a Spike Lee Joint ... you have an African American guy working on the HARD path through traditional white legal profession positions (Danny Glover) in the 1970s. As with any American, he has forced the family to adapt to the above mobile status, but forgot that there were still many problems. At that time, the only African American in the neighborhood was a girl. Do you own a house? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then the mix started. His wife, Whoopi Goldberg, is called "Engage", because all the other women in the neighborhood do. After thinking that the man himself and his family are "in", another African American came to see the next lot of "Lotto" (Mo'nique) and had nothing to do with his eyes because he did not want his neighbors to resemble one another. It is, of course, a better caliber, not a new neighbor, not a "ghetto"! <br /> <br /> This film shows how great the pain it needs to adapt to this family and how they lost themselves in this process. It raises the question of where the race begins and ends ... and with whom. Whether you like color or how much money you are, you can extinguish yourself from the real world and help those around you. And these African children, when they are "confused" in such neighborhoods, change themselves around them (complete with yellow hair and blue eyes!) <br /> <br /> Behold, this movie is for people, but in general, What kind of racism does this movie have on your neighbors and against each other? How do you feel that you have more money than others? <br /> <br /> Again, not for everyone. <br /> <br /> Look for yourself and be dominant. <br /> <br />
