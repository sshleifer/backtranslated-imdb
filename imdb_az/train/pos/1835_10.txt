What an outstanding film is not the words to describe me. I do not know how the movie will be rated 7.3 this should be 9.3, but in any case this film will not be able to act and acted by Akshay, the second half of the film will only make it, and the movie really is a good unexpected ending. You have to watch this movie once, twice as good as I think. Anyway, I love this movie and it's not just sad and funny, it's really good, and I think it's one of the best films in the history of Bollywood. But I know that the choice of the people is so great. The only thing I do not like about this movie is good background music, but if the song is not good, AR Rahman is a music director, I think music will be better, but we can not do anything about it anyway.
