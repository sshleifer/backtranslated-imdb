After fleeing a fox Friday afternoon between Fox cinema and this movie, I do not think a better way to spend a lazy Thursday while worth the two cents. Specifically, you are thinking about the absence of user comments. Does not each movie have more than four good or bad comments? And this movie is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> While watching a movie like April love, the first thing I need to remember is to remember the times when it comes. The films were quite a very happy medium. To avoid the gray look of a badly worn box in television, the cinemas full of screens and full-screen Technicolor films were deprived of tragedy. <br /> <br /> In some movies, there's something similar to each other. after being tested for the kidnapping of a car, sent to live with Teyze Henrietta (Jeanette Nolan) and Uncle Jed (Arthur O'Connell). As you can see, Teyze and her uncle lost her son (Jed Jr.), so Jed Dad was lucky to live. Henrietta's wife, Nickin, hopes that she will be able to get on the farm, so she will suddenly pull Jed out of her dump. While the story lines are like this, Jed and Nick really do not care too much about each other. Jed's neighbors Fran (Dolores Michaels) and Liz (Shirley Jones) continue to meet with Templeton. She is immediately shaken to Jed Fran and, of course, there is no need to say that Liz Jed is suffering a bit. Since the death of Jed Jr, he has a paradise called Jed, who has become a paradise and knows no one will let him in. Perhaps you can fill everything that happens at this point, how do you see it? there is no real surprise. <br /> <br /> For a few days, it's been a movie for several days. Note that Boone Nick is astonishingly a good work. Of course, the role does not require much depth, but it's still a good job when you wait. Arthur O'Connell as Jed is the perfect choice for this role. It is cold and early in walking distance, but if slowly slows down to Nick, we see that he is a very nice person. Jeannette Nolan is a great entertainment, as Henrietta, who is constantly playing a mediator role between Jed and Nick. Shirley Jones has a break from Rodgers And Hammerstein and has taken several opportunities to grace us with his victory victories. Like Liz, it's nice to look at it, it's great to listen, and sometimes it's funny. <br /> <br /> <strong> Values>. There is no real deceiver in everything. Everyone may look strange, but you can not use the movie. I really worry about you and enjoy your summer trip with your friends. Imagine music numbers, a little bit more plot, and an old Andy Griffith show with Technicolor on the vast screen. The songs are a mixed bag, while the title song April Love is the best. I really liked that, they did not use the blue screen screens during horse racing, and they are so entertaining and interesting. In fact, you will collect all the pictures in beautiful pictures, and it is nice to see that you are not in this department. Chemistry is good between Jones and Boone. <br /> <br /> Describes the dissatisfaction between Nick and Jed, the best of each and every attempt to be respected as everyone else. <br /> <br /> This movie is not mixed with great movies. Sometimes, instead of going to Disneyland, it is sometimes necessary to have a nice ride in the park, this is the love of April. <br /> <br /> My Degree: B + <br />
