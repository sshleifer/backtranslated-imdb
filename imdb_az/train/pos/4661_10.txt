Here I can only recall the definition of other assessments. It is a pleasant movie with a sensitive factor that you can achieve without feeling a sensitive sensation. Naturally sweet - no additional sugar. <br /> <br /> A small point: as it seems to me, Ustinov's character is a genius / poet of Pendelton's kind of thing, to be able to defeat and defeat the security of the system on Pendelton. Yes, the film was a bit of computer illiteracy, but I showed Pendelton's "learning computers" in my apartment, and I thought that her gifts merely allowed the subject to go all day and night. <br /> <br /> There were a few moments when Gnatpole appeared in some scenes where Pendelton was trying to test the information and tried to call her bluff. <br /> <br /> We did not believe that Pendelton had come out of this situation or had enough knowledge to carry out the tests - it was a little clear. <br /> <br /> Of course, she had to know enough to set up puppet accounts. Undoubtedly, Wallach and Ustinov were relying on a very foggy idea to understand how computers were operating and what they were doing in the days that they needed to know what their concept was. They knew that they were important about the 'procedures'; they thought that 'intelligent light' could control the security rather than the state; <br /> <br /> In their opinion, the dwelling of the user's terminal would have a strong impact on the ability of the user to do the same on the mainboard. Despite the graphic features, I do not see myself. <br /> tried to get away from the subject of actual computer operations and they did it very well. <br /> <br /> I do not think that giving them a little artistic license, their efforts will not be worth the record. <br /> <br /> CD
