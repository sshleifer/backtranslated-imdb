This is a moving story of the Scottish legendary hero Rob Roy and his feudal landowners. Like Braveheart, which is often compared, is not very historical. Despite their primordial nature, I would highly appreciate these films, and it would be difficult to choose between them. <br /> <br /> Mr. William Wallace, the 13th century, in Scotland, is far greater than the national figure of life, and in the early 18th century, Rob Roy acts as a glorious but ordinary Scotsman. , Robert Roy McGregor, his wife Mary and two young children live in the Scottish mountain resort. After the film begins, he and his clans hunt some thieves who steal the goods of the local lord. Rob Roy then wants to improve the living conditions of his people, as he encourages a local nobleman to borrow a thousand dollars from the Montrose Marquis to buy cattle in the market. He temporarily submits this money to his friend, Alan McDonald. When both McDonald and the money are missing, Rob Roy faces Montrose and his respected prosthesis, Archibald Cunningham, and his gripping factor, Killearn. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mont Roze is tested for his rival, Rob Roy's honor, while trying to give a lie against the Argyle Duke. <br /> <br /> Charismatic Liam Leeson is an intelligent, unmanaged and noble hero and a sense of respect that is important for this tale. Personally I feel that this is Neeson's best performance, his brogue (although in Ireland), adds the truth to the average viewer. Rob Roy is a stubborn, proud, brave and honest man who believes in his word. She is loyal to McDonald, a loving husband and father, and also a friend who accused him of robbing him. <br /> <br /> Tim Roth essentially describes his main rival, Archibald Cunningham, who is undoubtedly one of the most terrible and sadistic cinematographers. Many want to or can not, but most of those who do the basic work to curse indigenous women are betrayed. Desperate Cunningham claims he is always unaware of his father's identity, although his murder, aggression and theft make it difficult to do his horrible deeds. Additionally, after retiring with a child who committed suicide, Betty leaves her young servant girl aside. <div class = "justify" <br /> <br /> <strong> Roy and Mary. Those who question the presence of passion in marriage should look at their spouses! I believe that the phrase "How nice you are to me" used by this couple, of course, is one of the most beautiful expressions of love in all cinema. <br /> <br /> The most attractive performance is probably by Jessica Lange as Robin's wife, Mary McGregor. The lack of makeup has a beautiful but natural look of a healthy peasant wife and mother. The actress brings great courage and dignity to her role when she is harassed by Cunningham despite the seeming disgusting appearance of Killearn. His dialogue is spoken in a simple way, but full of pride and grace. According to Hollywood's decision, once he had suffered enough to reveal the aggression in the aggression, Mary's pain and humiliation, but nothing to dishonor. Their relatives, Alastair McGregor, suffer emotional distress when learning about Mary's aggression and suffer more when she says she can never conceal her offense by Cunningham. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie has a beautiful d√©cor in the Scottish Highlands, as well as attractive period costumes and relevant musical scores. There is no great battle scenes as in Braveheart, but it is a constant struggle between Rob Roy and Cunningham in the final duel, and in particular the curvy sword struggle. It's a charming movie with a tense movement and a beautiful love story.
