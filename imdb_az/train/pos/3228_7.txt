David Webb peoples meet Paul Anderson ... If you have something strange for you then you will be alive. <br /> <br /> Peoples are well-known in their writings of moral and moral influences, the value of life, and so on. ... These issues were covered in Bladerunner, Unforgiven, and most scenarios had something in these lines. <br /> <br /> Paul Anderson's first successful film was a violent tension. Not surprisingly, there are all other movies! And here's a fierce tension with moral influences! <br /> <br /> In the first half of the film, the people's script looks pretty clear. Soldiers prepared for birth have learned to kill and have never had a normal life. Instead, better, genetically engineered soldiers and one of the original soldiers, Todd, were left on a planet and left dead. There is a group of refugees who want to hate him, and there's an interesting drama here. But then ... <br /> <br /> ... New soldiers have traveled the planet for a military exercise and are trying to kill all people. Huge, violent, loud moves and peoples' writings become the Anderson Movement Festival. It's hard to believe that the scenario was originally written in this way, but the final product is better than expected. Though it is somewhat thoughtful, thoughtful and exciting after the excitement begins, it is fun. 7/10 Rated: Very Violent
