Except for a few exceptions, many of George Bernard Shawun's works have left the theater today. To speak a lot, to talk too much seems to be a general rule. This BBC version of one of the most funny shows of the show does not deny this verdict. This, of course, is arch and talking, but this is beautiful. Thanks to the quality of the English theater, along with the perfect actors - except Helena Bonham Carter - most of us probably did not hear. Carter is beautiful as a professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) shelter and then a Bulgarian girl who is in love with her. It is possible to argue with the terrible interpretation of the Balkan cavalry officer Sergius (Patrick Ryecart), who led the war to the enemy line and succeeded only because it was a wrong war for the enemy machine guns. However, the role is over-acting, and Ryecart has been explicitly explained to many movements. The other players' letters are perfect. Carter, of course, is in the center of the game, which is dramatic Bulgaria's "aristocrat" and a Swiss soldier like Torrens, and they are beautiful. Yes, the film "Weapon and Man" comes as a game. But you did not see a Shaw movie that did not betray your origin. Fields are generally clever. However, Shaw is all about dialogue. The action is minimal (at St Joan) and sets are not significant. Enjoy it for what it is.
