Great movie. With everything you want in the movie. Great battle scenes and many other activities. Suspense and a romantic love story. <br /> <br /> Like the old swashbuckler movie. From beginning to end is completely entertaining. <br /> <br /> The edit was fast and you're never bored for a second. The story is a classic story of the problems in the Royal House. The actors are beautiful and spectacular sets. The suit is magnificent and the stunt job is creative. Special effects are also excellent. <br /> <br /> Gary Stretch is as beautiful and striking as an actor. It looks like a bet for Super Stardom. <br /> <br /> John Rys-Davies is usually as good as it is. <br /> <br /> And Cindy Burbridge, Ex Miss Thailand is perfect and perfect for the lady, and even the English accent is also a great success. <br /> <br /> I've learned that the film has won numerous awards, and I can see why. <br /> <br /> All this is an incredible Independent movie. Be sure. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend it. And Give a TEN +!
