Although Paulie seems to be the most cucumber, lacrimosa and syndicated trash, it's really better than it is expected. <br /> <br /> Paulie is a parrot. If you are curious about it, cunning can easily set the tone for the entire film, but in fact, in many other ways, the movie is attractive. I got it for a little girl with difficulty in speech, Paulie gets her best friend and goes everywhere with her. He sits on his shoulder during speech therapy classes and ultimately becomes a super intelligent speaker. However, Paulie is being abandoned by the little girl's mother and spends the rest of the movie she wants to go from NYC to LA. <br /> <br /> So, why does it sound terribly susceptible to a movie? First, it has some interesting and effective animatronic effects. The latter (and more importantly) has the courage to cover his ludicrous premise, and tells the story of a really often moving, often humourous story, without worrying about the obvious drawbacks. Third, there is a few strikingly powerful performances like a clever crook, like Gene Rowlands, and Mike's Cheech Marin (yes, dope-smoking Cheech Marin!) Music immigrants like Jay Mohr. It can not be classic, but Paulie is a fun entertainment for children of all ages.
