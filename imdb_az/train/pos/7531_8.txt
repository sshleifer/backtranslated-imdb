I liked it ... just ... I liked it, not like the cartoon series ... I love it !!! This being less attractive leads us to compare and do not appreciate, but this cartoon was awesome, but I really did not like it. There are many people talking about Bruce's cold, but everyone in the criminal gang after 5 years will be angry and dark, so it's not a flaw. Batgirl was really a suitable place, because Dick Grayson does not like a robin, but the batman needs a good teammate, not like a new robin, he just does not trust a child and a child. However, the hadiths did not work: New craft ... it's not terrible ... it does not work like a bat. It's a dark character, a maniac killer as a joker, so you can not cope with this kind of art in this animated film, Joker is not a bad design, but still as a former joker (but it seems to me the best joker) so this joker is not good. A good thing about the joker is still the voice of Hamil. My favorite character: Harley Quinn (love for her) So they put a wise episode: Mad love (me the best episodes of this series). Here, I finally feel how Harley Quinn came back and how his joker bent his mind and felt how charming, a dark, happy ending, a charming (but very short) battle. how was the whole series. In general, I did not love Harley's series and did not like it ... they were laughing at everything, but laughing, punching, ridiculing, making mistakes ... It's a funny thing to laugh with it ... and Here's a good sequel, it's upsides and downs, it's better to compile (like I'm good! Kill CATWOMAN !!!!) Beautiful sound effects, as well as putting it ridiculous (as I love it's madness and the only episode that does not worry about reptile) beautiful music, beautiful sounds and beautiful episodes: My favorites, Mad love, Millions of jokers, Old wounds, Father's sins and Cold comfort. If you like Batman: TAS can watch it, but do not show how much you do not follow TAS, do not follow the first watch, and then really love your TAS: D
