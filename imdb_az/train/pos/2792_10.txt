I love this movie. It is a great movie, combining English and Indian cultures with issues of feminist issues, as well as for girls who want older sports for men's sport games. It shows both the cultural barriers and the struggle of an Indian man who wants to break women who want to go beyond the UK's restrictions on sex. <br /> <br /> Unlike other ideas, I do not think this movie is something like Dirty Dancing or any other chicken sound. This movement is loved by many men, men and women, young and old.
