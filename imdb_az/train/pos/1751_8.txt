The 40-year-old girl is about Andy Stitzer, a 40-year-old man who works in the electronics store and is not a part of social life and is very concerned about women. Some shoppers in the store invite him for a night, and Andy is still saying that they are planning to help them lose their sister. At Andy's store, one day she meets Trish, gives her a phone number and, at the end, Andy is quite bold enough to go on a date with her, and really looks alike, but Andy is still very worried about that sex, and Trisha he is very embarrassed if he can have enough courage to say things before it starts. The 40-year-old Old Virgin is in good shape, a good script, a good comedy performance, good cinematography and a good movie. The film's stars and writings by Steve Carell make a very good comedy release, and the writing for the movie is very good. I like this movie very much. Sweet, funny, entertaining, entertaining, pleasant, smart, kind and good time. This movie is as good as Toy Crashers this year and two of the best comedy that have seen a bit of both movies. The 40-year-old girl really exhibits a lot of talent and puts it in good use and works as a comedy and romance, and is sweet and very entertaining. One of the greatest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
