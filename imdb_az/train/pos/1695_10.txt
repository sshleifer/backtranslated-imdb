Usually, the best way to get rid of me in the film is to refer to Orson Welles. But here's a fantastic comedy that has released the War of the Worlds .... and gold! A small concept of scornful, aggressive, and stupid aliens is a spectacular one, such as those in Halloween dresses. Do not be fooled by the fact that because it looks like a child's movie, it's undeveloped - there's a lot of hidden treasure ... A stone!
