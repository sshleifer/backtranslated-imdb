I really enjoyed this movie because I was interested in lake monsters. This movie is worth seeing. If they were so terrifying, they would check good films. The effects are really good, I just think, "Land of Lost." I first watched this movie as an 89/90 at a local channel monster show called Morgus Presents early in the 90s. I was scared, but I was only 8 years old and B felt like something more. One year later, I saw a local DVD on the DVD and immediately bought it, with 9 Monster Squad and Gremlins heart there. Beautiful B movie for all ages fun.
