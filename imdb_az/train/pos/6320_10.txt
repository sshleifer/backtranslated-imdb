The main reason I wanted to see this movie was a nice cast. In a movie, one tone of my favorite actors is really beautiful. But this movie took me from guards. It was not what I expected. It's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember losing it! And that's not a push for me. The scenario was strange. Everything did not happen every time that was expected. There were many twists and turns, but it was appropriate to fulfill the whole tone of the film ambitiously. It was absolutely beautiful with the cinematography kit. I can not say anything really bad about this movie! Expand, I would have a bit more screen time on Andrew Davoli!
