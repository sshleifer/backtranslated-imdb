A horrific script, and some low-level demonstrations with Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and some good film shoots, boost this beautiful TV movie about difficult times in the hearth. The blue collar workers are threatened by everyone: management, owners, their wives and children, when the conquerors approach and the union does not work. Strauss is totally convincing in his role and Pamela Reed is always as beautiful as ever. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus is sometimes used to be a frightening, but cinematography by Frank Stanley, especially mill scenes.
