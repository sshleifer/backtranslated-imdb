Great fun from start to finish. Spectacular performances by Belushi, Beach, Dalton and Railsback. Some twists and multi-scene scenes. The movie was prepared for me! Scenario with spectacular lines, good music. Dalton is a challenging sheriff and like a "red-haired" like Railsback. I must recommend this movie to every action-adventure fan! 10/10
