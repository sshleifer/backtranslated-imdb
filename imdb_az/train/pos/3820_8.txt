This is a story about Shin-ae. Miliang, along with her younger son Jun, will start with the accidental death of her husband. Her husband is born here and she opens a piano school, and has ambitions to own a land with her insurance money. If it is about the movie, it's likely to be a Hollywood movie, some of which are falling into the native boy and happy in his son's new home. But not Hollywood. It is known that cash was withdrawn from the settlement as kidnapped and killed by his son. Attempts to break the horror process, attempts at action, and attempts to purge guilt are all accomplished in an astonishing manner and the leading actress is superior. There is only one warning and it should be stated that this is a surprising film. You want Shin-ae to go with a ghost and find some happiness. Yet Hollywood, not in Korean and Korean cinema, especially drama, will not be punished. Life comes to your head. Great toy, because of the marches, to watch a sometimes challenging movie. If you stay, you will be rewarded. Do this.
