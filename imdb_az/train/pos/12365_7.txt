I do not recall that there are still two versions of the same movie. The lion's share of the shooting is the same, but here they differ: In a version (the version I see in most broadcast channels), a group of religious figures protecting transparency is a "destructive" breakthrough group of "Brotherhood of Savers", church and brothers. In another version I have just seen on television, the clergyman defending Gateway is described as the monks of the Church, ie the New York Archdiocese (or perhaps Brooklyn). However, in the old version, in most of the scenes, clerics are called "brothers" (and in some scenes you see lips say "Father", but "in any case, these two versions are either less or partly seen as part of the "Protector Brotherhood" scenes or "Archdiocese" scenes, or the other one's re-shootings (reminiscent of Raymond Burr's cut scenes in Godzilla), a television version of which was not broadcasted. Can the story burn a bit more behind these two versions of the film?
