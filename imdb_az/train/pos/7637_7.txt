Actually, I love this movie, though I love James Belushi. In this film, you can actually see a few names in the rise; Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox; Caine was certainly great. The plot in this movie is simple; like his sliding film. But it was explained in a light way and I love the comedy moments. They tried to keep my important moments alive, for example, if I made a movie for a girl, and others, and so on. He tells me that people around us could play a different role in our lives. minute details should be changed. It also reminds us to pay attention to what we want. As we have always thought, life is not good at all; Maybe it's the best thing for us now, everything is thought out.
