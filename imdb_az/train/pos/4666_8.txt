It is very sensitive to about 60 views of the movie. Humor is exquisite, but has grown more than I expected. The cast is the first degree and they spend a good time. Ustinov is walking through a movie that is amazed at something very funny under his breath, and all of this is exquisite; I'll take the movie after leaving the DVD. The plan is something that Ustinov was released from prison as a computer fraud and an American company's release from an office in London. Maggie Smith has been his secretary for some time and is part of the fun while watching out a lot of dismissals. Bob Newhart is from his usual deadly personality and has had fun as a dense and sleazy executive in the London office of Karl Malden. The end is comic and beautiful.
