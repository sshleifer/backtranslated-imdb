It's one of the few films I've watched twice in the theater. I love this movie to tell the story of its atmosphere and tragic hero Esteban Trueban. He makes so many mistakes, but he gets the chance to get back. <br /> <br /> When I first watched, I thought about the end of the movie after winning - I did not know my book. Thus, the dramatic peak is still the boy's wrong! <br /> <br /> With the true power of the last half-hour of the movie I was away from it. <br /> <br /> Many people here do not like this movie. I can not understand that a bit. Perhaps those who read the books for the first time - often with the adaptation of the novels - simply disappointed that many things are unprecedented, unprecedented, and unexplained. But the story of a family, the rise and fall of a man, the deep compassion of a woman, the power of love, and the evidence of hatred (and conservatism) - this movie is simply beautiful! In addition, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the stones are beautiful - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> So definitely one of the movies that have been invented for movies!
