Robert A. Altman is the Finnish version of the Short Cuts, in the small town of Altenoski. Episodes offer a kaleidoscope of endless events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deceit and disappointment, despair and death. Especially affected by two episodes. First, a young waitress is a story she has been trying to create for her employees romanticism: a great deal of love and life. Another episode presents, and the old man and his wife who died in a hospital die dishonestly while trying to help him. An especially remarkable old man is the way to fight the humbling practices of the hospital and the arrogance (despite the signs of infectious empathy) faced by the crew's "routines". Compared with Altman's classics, this movie is perhaps less professional, but it's definitely a big part of art.
