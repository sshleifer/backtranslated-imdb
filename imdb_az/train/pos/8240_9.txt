I was in my hand at the Toronto premiere. It was a comfort I thought I would not be able to come to see my first choice. Well, I'm completely blown. When I come to the theater, we can remember anything other than the main part of the film (yes, I really forgot who it is inside). Terrifying speeches from all shooting. Carrie-Anne Moss Trinity was a great departure from his days. As for Billy Connolly, I do not think that Ch√°phini is not a player who plays in any such line. The kids were also great. <br /> <br /> Let me note that it's been a few days since today.
