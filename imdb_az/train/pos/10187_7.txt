Yes, I will be honest: this is not a complete Cholay. You can not get a Sholay every week. In fact, you can see the separate signatures of "My Daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. However, as well as the most "inspired" movies, this has been well-developed, well-designed and well-organized. Nana Patekar, as usual, is trying to overcome his hysteria, but all others deserve it. Particularly About the Sea: After a long time I saw him, but he had not lost any of his grace. In fact, he saw better than I saw him last. <br /> <br /> Generally, a nice watch.
