Darius Goes West is an incredible documentary about Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and a young (Weems) and one of his 11 companions who took her to a trip to check her wheel pallet for the Cross Pimp My Ride. <br /> <Recently I watched this movie at the Solar Day Film Festival. She performed twice in the festival festival. This film is an incredible story about the spirit of the soul and the spirit of Weem's friends. I often say about this movie, but after watching this movie, I feel the migration to do something right. This film took part in every film, this movie won some sort of prize. At the Tribeca Film Festival, London and Athens will go to Greece. I would not be surprised if this movie went up to the Academy Award. It screams from control. If anyone has a chance to see this movie, he plays everywhere! Take as many people as possible and get it! It goes to the New Orleans film festival, then to Atlanta and to Palm Beach, FL. Darius is in Georgia, so the tickets for Atlanta will not be sold anymore. Please watch this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> <br /> - Kick
