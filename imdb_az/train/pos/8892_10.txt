Great, big, great! It's almost all about the movie, but I need to ask for at least four-line text, so I'll work fine. The game was great (Jerry O'connel soooo cute!), Music (the best music of the 60s was imho), the historical material was interesting and they acted in the 90s Actually it looks like it was in the 60s. And most importantly, stories of key characters have brought tears to my eyes and the size of any drama. But in a word: GREAT!
