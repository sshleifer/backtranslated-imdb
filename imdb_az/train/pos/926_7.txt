<br /> <br /> Some people do not know why they criticize this show. <br /> <br /> This is a great, funny show - maybe not the right material for the main prime time, but still ... <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the family are funny, on the contrary, the most comedy at the show. The protective characters are not completely fun. <br /> <br /> Individual episodes and often Siegfried & Roy jibes' plans are only moderate, but often there are subfields or loungers that are laughing at places. <br /> <br /> <strong>
