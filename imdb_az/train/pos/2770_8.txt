Watching David & Bathsheba is a better way to get the Bible Lesson on Sunday School. The film is very entertaining, despite the fact that the movie is sometimes funny and funny. The studio system incorporated its own mistakes, but did not spend anymore when it was needed. Peck describes King David as a luxury, but poignant poet, to suit him to kill Susan Hayward. As the Nathan Prophet, Raymond Massey provides the usual saturn and fierce performance. Silent screen star Francis X. Search for a ballerina such as King Saul and young Gwen Verdon. Hooray for the Old Testament and Hollywood.
