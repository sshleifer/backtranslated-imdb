I first saw this mini series on British television a few years ago and was immediately surprised by the story. I'm not a big fan of 'Jane Eyre' or 'Wuthering Heights', and it surprised me; <br /> <br /> I think the hero of the memory is a righteous hole, and the last piece of work covered everything. <br /> <br /> Like some of the above-mentioned works, the "Wildfell Hall Tenant" is a bit challenging. The dark part of the film depends on Helen's excitement, Yorkshire's breathtaking uniformity and beautiful view, and Toby Stephens's sexual magnetism. <br /> <br /> This film describes a frustrating limiting lifestyle. All the women of the time. At best, they were a small domestic violence, as depicted by women's treatment at Markham House. On the other side of the dimension is Helen, who is married with a wealthy man, but has been subjected to cruelty and insult for a long time. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is very good for a long time, she runs away and gets a little free, but as a woman living alone in a rural community, she is inevitably indifferent and turned into speculation. <br /> <br /> Help Helen Markham. Not only is it incredibly beautiful (despite the finest hairless hair), it is also unable to play a central role in the movie as well as the most beautiful cheek bones. Tara is sensitive and at the same time, it allows Helen to see that it is still dangerous. Rupert Graves, Missing but Attractive Arthur Huntingdon - After seeing him, I can not imagine another actor playing this part. Pam Ferris deserves a special mention for her role as a humble mother of Gilbertin, Simon Carter, Simon Carter, a nephew for her sister Rose, and a nanny for Good Things in Life. Finally, I could only watch this movie for Toby Stephens; she is very good looking, firm, sexy, sensitive (but not a heartbeat sensitive). <br /> <br /> I am not sure if my hormones are a good actor because I can not objectively object to my judgment. <br /> <br /> If there is a mistake about the movie, it's the story's stream and a little confusion. <br /> <br /> Other people who watched this movie have also faced these problems, and I had to explain that certain scenes were really backward. <br /> <br /> I am very grateful for responsible people for this film. Not only did I break the video (a rare event), but also brought it to Anne Bronte's perfect novel. Of course, it was better than a movie, but with a narrow margin. I advise everyone interested in watching the film and reading it in the same order. <br /> <br />
