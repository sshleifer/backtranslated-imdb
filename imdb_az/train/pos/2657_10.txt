There is nothing in the room in 237, but there is nothing to do, stay there. <br /> <br /> It did not seem like psychological horror as it was in this movie. This is the highest rated scary movie and, therefore, the right way. Jack Nicholson is a perfect actor, and this is one of the biggest speeches in the film. <br /> <br /> About a family that goes to a hotel with a 5-month isolated and damaged winter. Then Father (Jack) did not have the horrors in the hotel. <br /> <br /> The direction of the cubs is not perfect shortly after. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, there are constant references to danger, death, and horror. Red is used on EVERY scene. Is Kubrick purposefully red? Of course. <br /> <br /> This is Kubrick's classic film, and this is the third of my 10/10 film. She is a perfect person in her direction and you can see her in all her films. <br /> <br /> I'll talk about this movie months later. <br /> <br /> As a result, this is the cornerstone of horror and tension. Terror masterpiece 10/10
