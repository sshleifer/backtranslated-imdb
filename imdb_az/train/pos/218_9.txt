Walter Matthau and George Burns, playing on Jack Albertson and Sam Levene Broadway, play a vintage vaudeville comic book for a group of Joe Smith and Charles Dale tradition that appears to have a different appearance for their lives. /> <br /> Walter Matthau can not stop his work, the man did not relax, take a little time and smell the rose. Behind his best days, his nephew and agent, Richard Benjamin, is a slavery old cuss who deals with finding fewer or less jobs for him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < A worker like Matthau can not understand it and can not take Bern's individual decision. <br /> <br /> Benjamin is hitting a brainstorm, reuniting children, and making a special national television. <br /> <br /> Sunshine Boys is also a sad, painful story about old age. Matthau comes to the screen most of the film, but it was Burns, who won the Oscars at age 79. <br /> <br /> Burns has brought a little personality to this movie. As we all know, Monty is a plain man of the comedy squad of the Burns & Allen comedy, which borrowed a lot of Python band. In 1958, Gracie Allen retired for health reasons, and George continued until he was 100 years old. Or at least close to an active player. <br /> <br /> If you like Sunshine Boys, Smith & Dale and Sunshine Boys, I see Two Broadway Tickets for looking at a couple that has been pushing the American public for fun last century. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think the Sunshine Boys will love you.
