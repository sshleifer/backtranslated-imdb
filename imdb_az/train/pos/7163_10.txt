Seriously I liked this movie ... The book began to read and I loved it ... everything was set up and everything had a purpose ... I think that this movie is very good, because Louis Sachar wrote the script. of course, led by Andrew Davis ... Shia Lebouf gives a great performance for the first movie ... the story is very nice and interesting ... there is humor, heart and intensity ... it's very similar to the book .. if not found ... I absolutely love it ... and encourage everyone to read a book ... all in this movie is put in a very good place and carefully prepared ... two in every way for me
