For the first time, director Tom Kiesche becomes a film that won the dark comedy. She hit a shirt budget and still enjoyed the early Coen's film Blood Simple, and some of Monty Python's perfume scarves! You need to be able to see more than once in order to evaluate all the elements that take a scene to the next. We look forward to something better than this writer-director-actor.
