On the surface, it is a brilliant, bright soap opera related to the sex functions of a Texas oil family, written "on the wind." But above all, it is a deep, public comment that has taken place in the 1950s. Director Douglas Sirk again collects points with Univeral sudser. Robert Stack is in love with Lauren Bacall. Problem Stack is your best friend, Rock Hudson, loves it very much. When he understands that Stack is sterile and Bacall is pregnant, fireworks flies. And all of a very good Oscar for his portraiture of Texas's largest nympho kidnapped by Dorothy Malone Hudson. Good epic soap opera.
