I saw the film at Nashville Film Festival. In a beautiful way from cinematography to actor. How to evaluate each other during the story of a father and a son and a family crisis. The film, written in a beautiful way without shaking, demonstrates the ability of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk to play in this remarkable game. The film, which begins with an old father (Peter Falk), is trying to figure out why his spouse (Olympia Dukakis) left him. At the door of his son and mother-in-law, his father declares himself unaware. Father and son begin to look at some property and stop the classic journey the next day. They play fish, pool, watch a baseball game, get drunk, take part in a barroom suit and dance with strange women. But more importantly, they are against the tension that can not affect every family. This is a movie that touches the heart and evaluates the closest ones.
