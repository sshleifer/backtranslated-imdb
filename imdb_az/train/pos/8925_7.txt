The set was a city with a supermarket and a cinema which would be packed for a Friday night half show.

All the characters have identified us - teenagers, parents, old men, doctors, nurses, mechanics, boys, slaves, and even the police - were sympathetic to us. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it was only a terrible monster. The victim of the first victim "hurts ..... hurts" and we believed and frightened. The danger is constantly growing throughout the story.

Everyone I know has seen it.
