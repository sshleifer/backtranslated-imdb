<br /> <br /> A $ 200,000 budget film about a father and two sons of "Xizhao" or "Shower". The father has a traditional Chinese bath in a traditional Chinese village, where locals and many older men are going to have a rest and bath. The father has children: a 'delayed' son living with him and a son who lives in a large modern city and is visiting it. <br /> <br /> This traditional village, bathhouse, and its 'late' brother seem strange and bored, but this is changing throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Story can be played with cheese or clich√©. <br /> <br /> If the really great speeches, especially the father and the 'delayed' son (sad, I do not know their names), are a tactile and funny story. <br /> <br /> This movie has a chance to see it. <br /> <br /> Hollywood cinema is a great alternative. <br /> <br />
