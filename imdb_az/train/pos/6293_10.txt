Buster is certainly the only thing I can see in the episode that I'm looking at at the end of my career, which makes it famous, the physical (and silent!) Comedy. There is still a shock to hear his tough voice in the Talkie sequence - his voice is the only thing that Buster is not concerned about - but the ability to pratfall is still unmatched. He repeats some of the rods used by Roscoe Arbuckle in early two reels. <br /> <br /> I would like to express my deep gratitude to Rod Serlin, who presented us with this episode and gave us the full genius of Buster. He did not have much time to do this (an episode), but it is a tribute to Hollywood's greatest genius.
