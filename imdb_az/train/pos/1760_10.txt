The 40 Years Old VIRGIN (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Hysterically hilarious high-concept comedy about titular Andy Stitzer, an electronics store in South California's state-of-the-art shop (a stratosphere for the A-list, made her well-behaved by the perennial second banana Carell in a truly unusual funny breakthrough activity) they looked at the trio, but the unwilling friends (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, after funnier to some degree) decided not to pay for their friends. Here is a very warm hearted romance with the possibility of a living mother (here's a funny Keener) that leads to more fuel fires in Andy. Surprisingly good inspirational and unapologetically romantic comedy; director David Jones, director Judd Apatow and a spectacular observer script called Carell, describes the funniest, delicate exact David Caruso joke, homophobic debunking ribbing, "date-a-paloozas" and the genus war. Real winner and immediate classic; funniest movie of the year.
