Slaughter High started as any day at Doddsville County High School, where little minx Carol Manro (Caroline Munro), living nerd Marty Rantzen (Simon Scuddamore), cheated on the boy's dressing room, with a great surprise, to draw their daughters as they put their daughters in the joke of the April Fool's Day. The school's sport coach Marc Smith keeps Marty and punishes the gang that Marty harshly blame, and only this time they will decide on what's going on, and Marty is bursting and nitric acid splashes over him. Over the years, the whole group is now invited to a class meeting at the school where they are now in, all of which are just there. <br /> <br /> As they return to Marty and take revenge on her mouth, they quickly come to where they are learning. <br /> <br /> In fact, April Fool's Day was shot down by another writer and director, George Dugdale, who wrote three other slasher films called April Fool's Day (1986), the three-year-old English-language co-production, , Mark Ezra and Peter Litten (after seeing a movie three times), I saw that the director was Jean-Claude Van Damme flick Kickboxer (1989) for two weeks, and though I had a pretty bad smile, I really had to say that I love Slaughter High . One of my favorite things about the scenario is that it has a clean slasher flick, does not want to be anything else, and only accepts genre rules, shorter revenue and tops, and is given to them. He basically gives what he promises, killing a murderer, blood, fungus and father. I thought the character was good, the story was good, though it was an excuse to get the burden of young people in an isolated place, so some killer can interlock them one at a time, and I really do have a lot to do for Slaughter High anything. The first half starts a bit slowly, but the second half moves along the knot, because there's another killing of another crow. <br /> <br /> Some situations and characteristic reactions are somewhat meaningful, but who can be said about any of the filmmakers? <br /> <br /> Most of the film, despite Slaughter High's three-credit director. There are several photographs of Carol's various corridors, which are put together in an exceptional atmosphere and are well-visible, with a good storm and especially extremely effective, long-lasting staidam traces. street school. Of course, it is quite nice and professionally prepared, especially if it is not stylish. There are people burning in corpses, acidic mellitus, stomach explosions, body axes, and bullfighting, as well as someone drowning in drainage from feces. <br /> Of course, this is very important to me. <br /> <br /> <strong> Though it was released today, though, I thought it was a relatively low budget. It is supposed that in America it was shot very clearly in the UK. Harry Manfredini sounds like all of the other musical scores and is basically the 13th (1980) issue on Friday and created the next one. Anyone living in the UK will likely recognize Billy Hartman, who plays as Frank, who plays Terry Woods as Emmerdale Farm (one of our best soap operas). The most feared fans will play a rare visual role in the sexy Caroline Munro. Legendary exploit producer Dick Randall has done the job at Slaughter High and actually appears as a porn movie producer in the film ... talk about typecasting! <br /> <br /> <strong >? I said that I liked a level of individual and I'm sure that the reminder proof and lack of story are probably put off by many, so I can say that I want to do what you want. If you do not decide if you want to check it then make sure you follow the uncut version. If you are not a fan of the Slasher Flick genre, Slaughter High will not change your mind, but if you are looking for a simple and effective slasher, you can do something worse than that.
