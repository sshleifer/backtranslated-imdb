Taking into account the lack of art with African cinema (or Black American cinema). Idea provides a multidimensional view to a community set for hoods and dealers. But a funny thing is that it's not a short topic or even a topic. But it is not an ambitious claim of independence from these issues, which are most relevant. This genre is not a typical expectation, it is unique. This is the first time the eye sees it, twice. The film has aesthetic quality, which is dedicated to cinema. <br /> <br /> And this is a true art that is extremely rare in Africa's voice. The film is not copied to reach its message, it attracts, innovates and frustrates gentle stereotypes (racist, characteristic stereotypes). The film is brilliant from a writer. It has very fast messages that reflect character development. Let's remind, this film is less than 10 minutes and tries to create a character very quickly. The use of color invoice and music will also be emphasized. But following the 500-year activity of director Owen Alik Shahadah, music is expected. But in terms of a theme, this idea seems to be a walk, but the satir is indirectly using a social problem!
