This is a beautiful Sammo Hung movie. In fact, this is a big part of the Hong Kong action movie. The story tells the story of pedicab drivers in Macao, looking for love, and mixed confusion. The performances are perfect and the characters are all unpleasant and well-known. The story is attractive and inactivated enough to hold a wait between enough romantic, drama, comedy and martial arts. Sammo Hung says here is the best choreographer in the business. The action is simply stunning. fight Lau Kar Leung and finals. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are incredible. We should look for any side of the move.
