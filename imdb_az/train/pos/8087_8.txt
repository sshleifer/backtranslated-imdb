There are only two types of this movie on the internet. Those who hate them and those who curse the name of Ralph Bakshis are those who love him and call it genius. I have to be in the middle. I have to admit most of the criticisms of this movie (for example, the story's cruel cutting, bad rotor sweets, and so on). But I still love this movie. Rotoscopy (when taken correctly) adds a lot of excitement at the end of the movie, and the final battle scene is fantastic. Nineriders sad Frodo's time is transparent and well executed and musical account ... scenes behind the steering ... magic. Unfortunately, despite the bad points, you can bring yourself to film, this is a great movie. <br /> <br /> (Undoubtedly, I will be cursed by an angry mob who hates this movie after this post), ah good, such a life)
