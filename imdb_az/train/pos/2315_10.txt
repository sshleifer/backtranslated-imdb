This film is very valuable, and it is difficult to know how to start with praise. Let's start by expressing my admiration for a perfect illustration by Reese Witherspoon. The performance he performs at a perfect pressure is truly a praise. Robert Mulligan has rarely been disappointed by his works. Each frame of the man on the moon is the best evidence of filmmaking.
