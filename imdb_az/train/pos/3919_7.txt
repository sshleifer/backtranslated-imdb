In the Carmen repertoire of Bizet, the middle-aged choreographer Antonio Gades performs the leading role of sexy Carmen (Laura del Sol). Antonio is in love with Carmen, an independent and attractive woman. When Carmen connects with another dancer, Antonio becomes genuinely engaged in artistic works by consuming jealousy like the genuine opera D. José. <br /> <br /> Carmen is a trilogy of Carlos Sauran's three-year trilogy. Flamenco dance. The story of dramatic love is evolving through the lives of artists who are contrary to the characters they are preparing and it is unclear whether the events happening with the truth (dancers) or artistic (play). Paco de Lucia is a charm of this original version of the famous Bizet opera based on Prosper Mérimée. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red"> "Carmen"
