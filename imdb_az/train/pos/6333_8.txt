I just used this video and watched last night. The player started very badly (hey ------ hey ------ curly), but then suddenly passed very well. The tornadoes are very fake, and most of the CGI effects are terrifying, but the scene and the blurred content inside the house were split apart and were similar to films like Twister. Scattered scenes were also performed very well. The story is very well written and it's been shut down for 30 years to see a movie as it's getting away from the old "disaster formulas" of this genre. <br /> <br /> There was a very strange mixture of FX and the quality of the film, which is worth my A in my book.
