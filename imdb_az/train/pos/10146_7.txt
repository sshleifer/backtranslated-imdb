As we all know, a romantic comedy is a genre that ends. There are two ways to come together. I was late in the third action, I tried to figure out how this would cost and how it would end up. From the beginning a tip was given from the start, but you will not understand it until the end. It's a simple bush, but it works. You have to be, you've covered a lot of ordinary places, but you get a new spin whenever possible. I liked all NY symbols and liked the places. This is a NY card. It was nice to watch a movie and not to attack anything. If you want a good old romantic movie ... this is for you.
