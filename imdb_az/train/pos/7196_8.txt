As the series goes, "Zorro's Legion Fighting" is one of the best series of 1930s. <br /> <br /> In 1824, President of the newly created Republic of Mexico, Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) tries to put his new country in a solid financial position. To this end, he encouraged the city to send rich gold transportation from the San Mendolita mine to the capital. <br /> <br /> Members of the local council are hoping to build themselves as the golden armored deity of Mexico, with the help of the Local Yaqui tribe to steal the Don-del-Oro transportations. Don Francisco (Guy D'Ennery), who is opposed to her, is a local lieutenant to help Juarez. When don Francis was killed by Don-del-Oro men, a stranger, Don Diego (Reed Hadley) came to the city. Diego aka Zorro takes over the legion with his friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster). <br /> <br /> Both Diego and Ramon sit on the Local Judge Council. It soon becomes clear that some of the other members of the Council are with Donald del Oro. The first is the chairman of the Council (Leander de Cordova), Miles Manuel (John Merton), Chief Justice Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzalez (Edmund Cobb). Zorro suspects that one of these men is Donald-Oro, but which one? <br /> <br /> There are several haircuts from Zorro and Don-del-Oro supporters who are fired by her associations. At present, the collapsing rope bridge has the usual assortment of crumbling, explosions, fires, coaches and wagons, or over the cliff, between the two cliffs that can only jump to Zorro's safety. The princes are governed by the best squad of the republic, legendary Yakima Canutt and Yrigoyens, Bill and Joe. Canutt says he has signed a group of illegal horses and then falls next to the coaches of the same year John Ford's "Stagecoach." <br /> In any case, Zorro restores peace in the valley before finally putting on the goddess Don-del-Oro and chapter 12 at sunset. <br /> <br /> If you look closely at other floodplayers like Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden and Don-del-Oro from Charlie King, you can spot the future serial star and Lions by Lone Ranger Clayton Moore and Stunt Canutt. "Greater Jim Pearce, Tarzan, Tarzan and Gold Liom (1927), and Tarzan's creator Edgar Rice can play well to marry Joo Burroughs, daughter of Burroughs in 1927. <br /> <br /> Comprehensive pleasure.
