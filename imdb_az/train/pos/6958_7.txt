Here are some of the previous comments I have with Edyarb. He had the potential to be comical with the story and script appearance, but in some places he failed, but failed in other places. You can see those who want to make a joke, but none of the audience laughed. <br /> Yes, this is very important to me. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie. I liked it; enjoyable night out and did not feel like a cash loss to buy tickets. The best jokes are those who come out of their expectations and who are mature enough, like the character of Matt Wills, who are asking for a super chick "P * or bed". <br /> <br /> In some cases, she said she was going to bring a "new thing" after laying a wild night lying in bed when she was "lying on a mat by stretching". <br /> <br /> I agree with bgs1614 that if the film could earn an 'R' rating, nothing in the film would be justified. Some sexual acts Yes, but there is nothing, only humor and no nudity. (Maybe he was a prescreening that showed more than that?) I want to compare two new films that went to see it with no expectations: Superman Returns and click. I did not really expect anything - I was a great admirer of the original Superman films, and the trailer for Click showed only the potential chauvinist (not against me). Superman really made me feel good (goosebumps!), Seeing his first heroic job, seeing a long lost friend and feeling happy about it. But for the rest of the story I would like to watch Super Ex-girlfriend, at least, some surprises. Click, once the TOTAL surprise was about five minutes deeper than the trailer and really great movie. <br /> <br /> As a result, the only reason I have compared these three films is the best three points for me that I've seen in a very short time, and because of all that I did not expect. Click on it, Girlfriend, Superman.
