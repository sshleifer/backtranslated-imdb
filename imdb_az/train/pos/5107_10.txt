What's the 80's soundtrack? I think that John Travolta sang some of his songs, but while watching the movie describing everything that happens in the 80th Cheese. Obviously, the films that rely on mechanical bull, bartenders and immature relationships were in style. The best was his bad Texas story. Compare the lights on Friday night. I watched the cocktail and really recommend Crazy Stir to dance the movie. It's also a very bad film, like a note written by Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg in the United States. I was shocked to realize that I have never followed it. A more strange film of this genre will combine Cadilac Man with Robin Williams. Remember all these BIG stars play a great role in these CHESES films. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, and John Travolta
