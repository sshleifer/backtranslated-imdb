"Moonstruck" is one of the best films. I have a movie on DVD! The film deals with a New York widow (Cher), who is in love with Danny Aiello's angry brother (Nicholas Cage), a lover of a bakery. I am very glad that Oscar won the Cher movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are also very large. Norman Jewison (directed by Fiddler On The Roof) is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is a beautiful movie for everyone to see and laugh. A must see! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
