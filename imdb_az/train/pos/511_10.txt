For the first time, I see this movie 21 years ago when it was an ITV (before cable and satellite) Matin√©e. I was off School with Mumps and I was completely twisted into the movie. I bought the video for about 10 years, and I want to get a DVD copy. David Niven is the most beloved actor of all time and I think he is a travesty of what he's looking at when he comes around the Oscars. Though I do not have more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins, I think the queen should be a knight, as she easily did for the film industry. the film is black and white and the way back is a good way to see it, and the film has early appearance from Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and Richard Attenborough.
