Gives a simple, sensual & emotional punch I regularly shoot short movies and it's always nice to come up with something simple and clear. <br /> <br /> A boy in the school should attend classes when he is a friend. <br /> <br /> Unlike the shortest movies amongst children, the most important lesson in her life is given to her in the event of a school violence. These guys are the actors themselves and that's convincing. The soundtrack completes the emotions of the beautiful piece, and the film's punchline works well.
