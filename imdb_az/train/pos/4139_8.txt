I'm interested in how this show is played in the United States and in the rest of Europe. America (and especially the White Americans) is self-confident. This may be a major cause of some poisons and vitriols expressed on this board. <br /> <br /> I love the show, but there are some reserves and I feel that the Spoiler Spoiler has made an easy trip: <br /> <br /> The collapse and burning of everything at the end of the second season. Julie hoped to revitalize her show if her protector did not keep it in the middle of a few farms. Who knows? It was a funny, modest and sometimes horrific show.
