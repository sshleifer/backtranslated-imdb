These films featured William Castle's life and epoch. In the 1950s and 1960s, he made some low-budget horror films sold with gimmicks. In the "13 Ghosts" you need a viewer to see the ghosts that were colored, the movie was a b & w. "The Tingler" was a theater seats fitted with a buzzer jolted by the audience when a monster ran into a movie theater. "Marabre" gave all its members a life insurance policy despite the fear of death! The movies themselves were pretty bad, but the gimmicks were in a hurry to see them. This document talks with film directors, film makers, and actors. She also enters the housewife and is kind of man (with all her accounts, she was a great man). Documentary film is full of love, very funny and ultimate. Very short (less than 90 minutes) and there is no hard time. Must be a place for castle fans and fans of the fear film. My complaint - there were very few sequences of pictures. There is only one thing out there.
