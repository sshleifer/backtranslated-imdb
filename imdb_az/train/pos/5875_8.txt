One of the movies that does not require any brain or thinking is a very funny time pass on the next hour or forgot. I really am really surprised by Mr. Abraham's acting as a gangster on the face of immorality, so he is fully engaged in reversing and successfully implementing it in parallel with the comic geniuses, such as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also surprised by the three daughters of Akshay because the roles do not require much talent, but most of them hated Akshay's dignity (other girls) because they managed to manage the organization and the actual personalities and you can distinguish between them. The good thing is that most of the songs are good and will make you happy Sunday evening, so colorful and entertaining.
