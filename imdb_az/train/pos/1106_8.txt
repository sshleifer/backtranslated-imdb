If you're an admirer of Altman's great ensemble, it's undoubtedly the hallmark of HealtH at that time, as is shown in big films such as MAH, Nashville, Gosford Park, and A Wedding. The president is centered around a Health Convention that deals with two women: HealtH, Altman's Paul Dooley, Carol Burnett, and Henry Gibson, including the last 70 of Altman, Lauren Bacall, James Garner and Glenda Jackson. Like many Altman ensemble films, there are plenty of subplots in this movie, but it's not as timely as Nashville or A Toy, but rather the M.A.S.H. It has a more focused focus. or Gosford Park. Everything, like Dick Cavett, is an open line in the health movement, full of top, strange, contradictory characters, giving a comment on everything with the guests. Underlining the entire election process, Altman is characterized by pessimism about politics and the public's appeal, but the most interesting thing about this film is the appearance of most people. This will be one of Altman's latest films for a while!
