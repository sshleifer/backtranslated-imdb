Something surprised me about this movie - it was really original. <br /> <br /> This is not the same old recurring shit that comes out of Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I've seen this video with the video because I did not know it before I saw it in my local video store. If you see this movie - rent it - you will not regret it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
