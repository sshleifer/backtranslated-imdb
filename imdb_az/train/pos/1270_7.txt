This movie is really a mixed bag. On the one hand, the film's story and concept are really good, tense, and therefore have some nice backgrounds. On the other hand, not all were too slow, stylistic and inadequate. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, Sean Connery's role was wrong. Hence, he is not as incredible as the mother of a main hero and a young girl (this way still played by many young Scarlett Johansson) and husband of Kate Capshaw. I feel that it was just too old to be truly trustworthy in this area. But Sean Connerey is, of course, a great actor, and that is still the only reason he can keep the film so well. But, of course, with a strong support from actors such as Laurence Fishburne, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lynne Thigpen and Ed Harris. All actors are really good, but some will not be used simultaneously. This is really a shameful opportunity. Particularly, Ed Harris is totally great in the role of a psychopathic serial killer. He really does not hesitate and works perfectly. Normally, these films play a crucial role, and this is really a surprise. Only his performance is enough to watch this movie. However, as the story is explained by the fact that it is not very stylistic and not multi-shaped, none of the characters in the movie really work well because it feels very far away. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this is the way to the story, killing all the film's potential. Arne Glimcher controls the film in a small style and keeps the speed slightly lower. For this reason, we will not engage in any relationship with the story or any character as the audience. <br /> <br /> It's really bad, because it's more than enough for Just Cause. A nice toy and a unique story with some unexpected curves and tricks. The only reason why cast and story is still a mean tension above is probably still the genre's admirer. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <br /> <br /> <strong> 7/10
