The "Party Girl" invests in Parker Posey's great attraction. In fact, sometimes the movie seems to be a tool that Posey can play, because it is usually in real life. <br /> <br /> Daisy Von Schers is the director of Mayer's film, Ms. Posey is a cure for supporters. Mrs Von Scherer Mayer takes us down to Manhattan down the coast to show us this inexperienced spirit, which constantly encourages us to have fun at different clubs. This is a period that is more naive than the area and neighboring Meat Market. At least there are no claims in the movies, and if we can say that way, we look at people who normally live their lives. <br /> Parker Posey is incredible Mary. For Parker Posey, we enjoy more than any other actress, Mary plays. It's the whole picture. Casting is good.
