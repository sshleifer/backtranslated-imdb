Incredibly surprisingly complicated computer animation, and innovation will not wear the first, second or third look, but you will be drawn by so simple but interesting characters that you can find yourself. <br /> <br /> Disney is named "the world's largest animation" continues to hold firmly. One of the greatest achievements of "Bug's Life". One of the innovative additions from the "beauty" added to the end of the movie. Because the VHS tape has a variable version per band, there are two sets of DVDs. The DVD is also featured in "Gerry? S Game". This is a nice PIXAR shortage, which was shown before the movie in the cinemas. <br /> <br /> Is it a high insect film compared with Dreamworks? "Antz" is pretty good in all justice, but there is nothing in animation and story development and symbol. When you look at the stars' sounds of both films, "Antz" sounds like "TV" stars that are directly familiar to the great movie stars, "A Bug's Life", as opposed to the only exception of the television stars, Kevin Spacey. but you're out of business with DemirBank for Disney, and this is almost the kind of movie they want to share with their kids. I think it's a movie.
