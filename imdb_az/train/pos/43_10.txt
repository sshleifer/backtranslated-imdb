I liked this movie very much. Deanna and Alicia were really interested in how to deal with this tragedy. Alicia was just an uncomfortable spirit and Deanna was happy to see someone after she was pulled. My only complaint was initially slow and it was a little too late for everything. Other than that, it was great.
