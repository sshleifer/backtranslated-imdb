Spoilers! Classic 70's garbage! The Swedish gal (Helga) made this movie beautiful. She was beautiful, but I was so sexually. During the film, massive sex was leaked. His best scenes were, he was stimulating himself. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Also, Dr. Julia (the brother's dark men-oriented film) was very interesting visual. Although the 12-year-old girls had more heartbeat than Julia, she knew how little she was using and how she would use her scenes (especially silk blouses and black skirts), and I kept my focus unnoticed. You liked the great embarrassment scene where the bats captured his neck; At the same time I do not know when I see something more funny and sexy. Classic things!
