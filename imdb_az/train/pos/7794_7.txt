Victor Nunez connects this unusual tale of the sensual journey of young women with rare poetry in cinemas. With poetry I mean the meaning of literary and kinematic play. There is something very literary about the movie, almost a novel has adapted a page to the screen. In this sense, the film does not reach much depth; but it is also slow at other times, which sharpen the depths that it once gained in favor of ennui. The star of the film, Ashley Judd, made her debut on a debut film. She acts as a gloves for the smuggled Ruby, she almost did not move. The film has a real movie star, and although it is impressive in its normal way of life, it really does not convey the same charm in its subsequent films.
