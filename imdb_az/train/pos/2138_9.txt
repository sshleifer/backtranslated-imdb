This film is about the Japanese culture, as it has created a Japanese family life. Physical contact occurs in people over the age of 7 (especially in the community), and so do hugs even when you have close friends / brothers. Ballroom dances attract the attention of the public and the attention of the public! Ballroom dances are often very popular (very often). People who dance Ballroom in Japan are viewed as a little western Nudist ... I would like more, but it's blocking the culture. Any amateur dancer is a delightful family movie that will only enjoy for dance performers. I understand that Japan is more famous than the Titanic. In my opinion, the Japanese are like us - they also want to hug themselves.
