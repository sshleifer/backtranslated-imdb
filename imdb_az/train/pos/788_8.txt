OK - I admit. I think Kenny Doughty looks stunning in this movie, but because of his good looks, the film is sometimes predicted, but with a sophisticated sky. <br /> <br /> From the start, the film. One head - his image is very uncomfortable and will not marry. Police Officer - go with a child and go bad. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that the first one is the "first female club" and there are actually several rumors. Behavior from "credit card". <br /> <br /> McDowell's character, head, is late for the funeral - when a young body filled up for a regular player (Doughty). What then is his two friends talking about? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < All the great movie that comes from the choice of action, special effects and horror of schlock.
