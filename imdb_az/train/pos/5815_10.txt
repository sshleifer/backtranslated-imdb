I was a kid ... I'm crazy about Michael Jackson. His music, dances .. He was always the greatest. A few days ago a friend presented to me a gift .. "Moonwalker" DVD .. I could not believe it! I also took the time and saw the movie again ... After many years, I was back. I immediately cried. Not because of Michael Jackson, but since I enjoyed my concerts, music and dance. The film gave me another perspective when I was a child. Michael can actually see parody of his life. Thanks to Michael Jackson for returning me to your perfect music and dance. People have forgotten you that is a shame .. I did not sing because you had a great time with music ... Because you have the best of being there ...
