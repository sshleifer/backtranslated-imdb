This is a totally charming movie, one of my favorite romantic comedies. This is extremely joking and shooting is wonderful. Laurence Olivier, though largely related to Shakespeare's work, shows that this movie is not limited to playing classics in any way. He controls the easy passage of the helpless lover to X Lady X, played by Merle Oberon, from an idle divorce lawyer who wants to escape from women and their treacherous paths. The dialogue is very witty and refreshing, and the atmosphere is spectacular. Ralph Richardson was also happy to watch. I highly recommend this.
