In 1979, Vince Lombardi's Lisa's students filmed a new, dictatorial director named Miss Togar (McVuronov), a beautiful cult film. Togar respects music and accuses the students' musical tastes of guilt. <br /> <br /> Riff Randell (PJ Soles), # 1 is an admirer of Ramones, who wants to write more rock band songs. <br /> <br /> Now this film will resist. First of all, the soundtrack is incredible, with the songs of artists like Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground, in addition to the non-infectious Non-Stop variety of Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena Punk Rocker" and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are some of these. After that, the cast really provides you with an ideal choice of the Riff role with Soles; it is a real pleasure. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young, Tom and Kate, that Woronov was a good example of disrespectful and disrespectful tiger type and that Clint Howard was one of the best parts of the crocodile occupation entrepreneur Eaglebauer, and Dick Miller, Paul Bartel especially music teacher Mr. McGree) and Real Don Steele is always as entertaining. And, of course, Ramones have a cure to see themselves playing. <br /> <br /> The film has the spirit of truth. The energy level is high, with the author and director of the story, Allan Arkush, bringing great benefits to the court process. There is also a great sense of humor. Paper airplane gag is an outstanding example. It extends to the "delete" style of the scene transitions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Get <br /> Buy. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is just a beautiful movie movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
