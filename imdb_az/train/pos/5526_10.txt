I love movies, and what I confess is a great deal of embarrassment. Without giving the film, I gave the "Che, the 1st part" and the 2 thumb. I know terrible. But who am I in a trap that I committed? I do not really know, but I have a negative word spread like wildfire, and if I think I'm smart, I've fallen into it. But fortunately, Argeninean film director Martin Donovan, I loved a person I love and love. I said I would not say it because I knew that the movie was a failure because it was ready to hit me right and Donovan was a pacifist! She drew me aside and told me how much she liked the movie and why she liked it. I went to see both parts right away and "Che, Part 1 and 2" is the best movie I've ever seen in 2008. It is such a purity that some of the great artists have gone through. Spectator reserves are no longer usable. I do not know, we never did. Riding, walking and without the help of Benicio del Toro is just supernatural. We can see his spirit, and we can really accept it. Man's humanity is great. That is, I would like to thank Martin Donovan again to teach me honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this magnificent film. Do not make mistakes that I should make wrong. Now go on the big screen
