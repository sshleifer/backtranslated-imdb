Franco Zeffirelli, who played the role of Mel Gibson from 1990 to 1990, was the second of two films. Zeffirelli's version Since 1948, like Laurence Olivier, based on a short version of the game, most Shakespeare's original text is cut. (I have never seen Tony Richardson's version of 1969, but it fled for less than two hours, shorter than Zeffirelli, and I'm shortened). <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh was attempting something more ambitious - a film based on the full text of the game. <br /> <br /> <strong> Henry V, a rare example of a major film shot on the Shakespeare comedy, is one of the foremost Shakespeare's films confirming his brilliant "Nothing about Much Ado". As a Hamlet director, his third Shakespeare movie (Oliver Parker acted as Iago at Othello in 1995) and, as expected, is very different for Moc Ado. <br /> <br /> The previous film shot down in a villa of Tuscany hills and beautiful surrounding villages is a pleasing summer movie about everything that creates the value of life. <br /> <br /> "Hamlet" contrary, winter depth. (Ophelia's flower-shaped flowers show Shakespeare's idea of ​​what's going on in the spring). The appearance of the film is particularly striking, and it is outstanding and cold. It was shot at the Blenheim Palace, perhaps in the most spectacular home of England, and is also forbidden. Snowy looks are cold and shouting; Internal ones are formal and complicated. The campaign is up to the mid-19th century; female characters wear complex fashions of that era, and the main men are mainly wearing military uniforms. (There is a contrast with Zeffirelli's film, and the suits fall under the delusional sounds). The game is dominated by corruption and decadent images; The intent of the breed may have been to contradict a flat surface with something mainly "decayed in the Danish province." <br /> <br /> The film is a large number of great actors, small roles. (Blink and John Gieldgood or Judi Dench may be opposed). As it turned out, the four-hour film was demanded by all the star-makers of the hottest producer. Hollywood stars have not really come up with some of Robin Williams' ideas like Osric, but others like Charlton Heston's King of the Game or Billy Crystal's First Gravedigger have played very well. Normally, Yorick, just like a skull, is played by the British comedy, Ken Dodd, on the flashback. <br /> <br /> Brian Blessed, often playing jovial characters, opposes the type as Ghost and makes scenes that are pretty scary. <br /> <br /> Kate was the weakest of Winslet's Ophelia's main characters. She was the lead singer in the first two Shakespeare films, then her husband Emma Thompson, but her marriage was divorced in 1995. Winslet came to himself in the terrible scenes of Ophelia, but seemed poorer in places where his character was still smart. (I have chosen Helena Bonham Carter in Zelafirel's version). Richard Briers plays Polonius with a superior principle than he is often given, is not an intelligent and experienced consultant, pruning is not an old fool. Julie Christie also brings the merit of Gertrude's role; there is no attempt to offer a gentle connection between Hamlet and Gifson, as well as the Zeffirelli version with Glenn Close. (Commentary, which is more debt than Frey's Shakespeare). The age difference between Kristi and Branagh is great enough for the mother and son to be safe, which is closely related to Clap and Gibson. (Olivier's Gertrude, Eileen Herlie, weird, less than ten years old). <br /> <br /> The game is aimed at rebuilding frequently cut scenes in kinematic versions of the play "The game is linked to national and local tragedy." The war with Norway is very stressful and a subpot not entirely seen by the Norwegian prince Fortinbras - Zeffirelli. This attention to the national tragedy was perhaps best shown in the character of Claudius, and sometimes played as one dimensional villain. There is something about Derek Jacobi's performance that Claudius could have been a good person under different circumstances, but he allowed himself to be misled by envy and lust. He could have been a good and faithful servant of his brother, but he decided to act as a wicked king. <br /> <br /> Despite being guilty of sin, he does not see the way to make corrections according to his evil. <br /> <br /> Branak, a beautiful tongue of the Shakyir's leg, is dominated by a key role. Like Gibson, the Hamlet's old concept has little time, inadequate, passive, and melancholic. His active, physical, energetic Hamlet, Laertes, is the best shown in the deadly duel. His guiding principle is not the fatigue of the world, but an evil hatred and an active corruption. <br /> <br /> This was a gamble for the crew to create a four-hour epic, and the cash register of the film. In addition, many critics have been highly appreciated by James Berardinelli. In my opinion, regardless of financial care, Branag's gambling has been figuratively paid off. Fully compiled, he revealed the full meaning and full emotional power of Shakespeare's most intriguing game. When I viewed his "Spectacular" movie, I said it was the biggest film of Shakespeare's comedy. His "Hamlet" can only be the biggest film of Shakespeare's tragedy. 10/10
