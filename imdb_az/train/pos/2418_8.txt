Eugene Levy, who is also one of the funniest, is also great. I just want the studio to know that there should be DVDs, there's a video tape, but the movie's DVDs (and extra large) Kung Fu University (Kung Fu U) skit like the whole movie, The scene with the girlfriend and her family is great, this movie never looks like a TV, but most loses its dissatisfaction when it is edited for television broadcasting, if you offer it to buy it (it's a good place to find ebay copy) I will continue until we look at the DVD. DVDs have many great movies that have not been released yet, and this is one of them.
