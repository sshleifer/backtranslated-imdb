When I went to the United States, I was pretty young, but I wrote it on television, and after recollecting everything, we looked again. So far, I'm still referring to myself. The show was hilarious and had many famous characters from Frank Sinatra and Mr. T. from Sylvester Stallone. The sounds were great and sounded as symbols we describe. Despite being a bit creepy, the puppets also did a good job. I was just surprised to know that Rob Grant and Red Dwarf were writing by Doug Naylor, and that I was also a favorite show. As another man wrote a comment earlier, I was robbed by a "friend" borrowed from this great show and never returned. I'm sure that there was a lot of demand for a DVD for this show, but I do not think enough people have heard it. Well, maybe I'll try e-mail ...
