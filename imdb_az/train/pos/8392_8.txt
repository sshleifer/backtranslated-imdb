Instead of capturing the attention of the cinema, this film reflects some of the small details, the woman's cocktail hats and artistic kinematic techniques that can be wrapped in a layer. Her husband is wearing hats, socks, shoes and underwear and both can look comfortably and comfortably. It is a feature that shows how much diversion the woman has chosen to know that the director is a sexually explicit soul, and that he or she is directly or indirectly smiling to the desired taste for the person to feel. Relationships between a husband and a wife are unique. He does not feel sorry for nothing, no matter how he behaves, and want to share these truths with him because the main focus is always the reality of marriage. Nothing can happen between them. Only the fate of the foe can interfere - what happens after a long time after the war has been arrested. It's a very funny movie that's completely ugly.
