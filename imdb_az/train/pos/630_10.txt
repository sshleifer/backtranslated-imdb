I did not expect much from this movie. I was given a ticket for a great selection. I just got lost. It was hot and tired. I had to wait for a 40-minute movie line and seemed to have no cool air passing through the corridors of the theater complex. <br /> <br /> Tired and hopeless, after sitting in the theater, the movie began, I did not know any actor at the start, but the movie stream was perfect. From the very beginning I consumed the movie, and I was more excited every minute. In my opinion, this movie is a fantasy / fairytale classic. The actors were spectacular, the speed was perfect, and the end was magical.
