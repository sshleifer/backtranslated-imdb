This television series was one of my favorites when I was a kid. Now if you see through nostalgic pink shaded glasses, I can say that it is still a good show, it is very educated but still funny. I did not see the original French version only in Swedish. <br /> <br /> It was said that it was too long to remember how good the dubbing was. <br /> <br /> The premiere of the show was to show how the body works. I lie, the school still does not teach half of what I know from this show. Along with the fine examples in the body, it is also associated with other things, such as eating unhealthy eating and exercise. Who wants another chocolate bar when you know that miniature virus tanks can invade you? D Cartoon looked beautiful, of course many children were friends, but with care. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies, and all are animated with cartoon-smiling animated films. <br /> <br /> This and the series on history (especially the surrounding scandal) were the main parts of my childhood. I am very happy to find them here.
