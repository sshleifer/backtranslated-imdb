I've seen an episode or 2 when the show was first released, but I was also hooked when watching one episode. I watched all the series in 2 days. :) I like the character of Gary Cole. First of all, he started with joy in character ("They use a thousand")! His MP, Andy Griffith, met with Charles Manson. Attractive, charismatic, charming, uh type dangerous and "kind" I want to say "really". I want to be like HIM when I grow up. Lucas Black is very big. The accents are very large. Anyway, I thought it was one of the best television shows and you owe it to yourself to see it.
