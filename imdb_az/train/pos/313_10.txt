I am a black American and I like this soap opera. I looked at the Spanish dubbing at Telemundos about 5-7 years ago. The story is a truth about a black slave who deals with a white commander. <br /> <br /> Many of us could learn a lot from XICA. He did not take anything and saw his potential. <br /> <br /> Many claimed to have sold themselves, but she tried to secure the future and future children. <br /> <br /> It was such an excellent soap opera, but it would not be released. The soap opera EVER was the best soap opera. It needs to be broadcast or re-broadcasted on the DVD. It is currently playing in the Azteca America, available only through a paid cable in Mexico or the United States. We need to be re-telemunded.
