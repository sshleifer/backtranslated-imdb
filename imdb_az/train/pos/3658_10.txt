This movie is like the allegory of the Gospel. This can not be directly attributed to honesty and innocence, and therefore does not believe in the abolition and demolition of Italy after World War II, and is filled with a large homeless and poor population. It is a monument to the best qualities of the human soul and to the infinite creativity of these gods. <br /> <br /> Toto is a contemporary Christian in a great city like Doostoevisky's "Idiot." He is loving and well-arranged in kindness and purity, and changes his actions as a miraculous invader. The story is explained in a natural way and in a simple style, yet imbued with a magic of premonition of Fallini's sutrealist fantasies. It is one of the most inspiring and uplifting films ever to date.
