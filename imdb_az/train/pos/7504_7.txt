Hey guys, I'm actually in this movie! I did not know that this site was within a few years ago and I was very surprised! I played my son Pete with the main characters. It was a great experience and I liked every minute. When filming, I was forced to be in two places, and my second brother used my body twice! The pad, pushing the car's radio button, is not mine. I'm still moving and some of my TVs, but not many. <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p> My favorites. I thought the players were really good, but the story line was just so-so.
