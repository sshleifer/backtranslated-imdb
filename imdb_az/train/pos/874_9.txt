This movie draws you with just two main characters. I even popped into my laptop without laptop reading (re-review) and was interested in two solid watches. Two missing passengers were killed in two different ships. Sexual tension, combined between a secretary and a criminal, is almost palpable, with almost no physical contact. Until the end, I could not decide what I wanted more: our hero and hero to draw their caretaker or simply fulfill their desires. RML could not make an interesting subpotation and it would have traditionally been 100 minutes long. I also say nitpicking. After a series of Netflix, Blockbuster, and local public libraries, this movie has regained its credibility.
