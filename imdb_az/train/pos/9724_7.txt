Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. In my opinion, he is the kind of actress who does not behave better in front of the camera, but only by himself. He did it and looked at Elizabethown naturally. However, in this film, especially in the first half of the film, he tried to perform more artificially, so he looked at a sober editor. In the other half, he was returning himself daily, and I did not know him to be editor in any way. Therefore, his performance does not stop in this movie. <br /> <br /> Generally, the film attracts and inspires. The young man's character is full and intelligent. In any case, the film tells a great story. <br /> <br /> Only a major flaw is that the hero and hero's love does not show a turning point. When I'm kissing at the end of the story, I'm completely confused, because it's not clear to both parties.
