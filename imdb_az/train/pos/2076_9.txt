Good place is a great movie! Everyone should see ... Tear-throbbing and very heartwarming. It is built upon values, perseverance, modesty and love for the family. The story may be particularly relevant to our day-to-day life, especially in the face of poverty. It is very important to respond to this problem, and it can be vulnerable and useless if one is not strong enough to be encountered in such a way. I am very glad that the roles of the heroes are even justified by the young actors ... The parts attracted the audience. The film could be black-and-white, but the story is as sweet as you do not want to end. This is really great! This should be re-established for a very beautiful movie.
