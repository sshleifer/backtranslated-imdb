If the scientists behave in the same way HG Wellin believes in the future, then history would not have come about in the same way as it did in the future. Wells writes that almost 80 years have elapsed since the writing of the film and the form of things that do not come close to the world that it has previously explained. <br /> <br /> Even though this is good, well-known players like Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwicke are participating in the game and want more cartoons than real characters. The main weakness of the film is that it will solve all of Wells's philosophical problems and the rest are backwards. <br /> <br /> Massey's symbols, two generations of the same family, are extremely optimistic. Cedric Hardwicke is a suspect who feels very distant. And Ralph Richardson is a war lord born in the destruction of the Thirty Years' War, fighting modern weapons. Unless the atom bomb was invaded, poison gas was regarded as a weapon that almost destroyed humanity. According to Wells, science and conquest can never be confused. As a group, scientists are far from the world of politics to engage in such work. In Wells's life, scientists fled the right-wing Fascist governments of Hitler and Mussolini. Those nations have been subject to allies to defeat them, and have prepared atomic weapons that are beginning to modern times. If they acted like Wells, someone like Albert Einstein would manage the junta of the scientists who made a new decree after the Second World War. Wells has made a mistake in both time and development. Perhaps the computer did not mean atomic energy. Computer programmers are more likely to become kings in a new world than scientists at this time. The things that have been created, created and created by William Cameron Menzies, suggest that HG Wells, of course, does not completely correct the way in which he comes to a respected thinker of his time.
