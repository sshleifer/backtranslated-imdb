"Before You Know That Satan Is Dead" is one of the best films I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> The perfect performance of the ensemble is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman performs outstanding performances and always enjoys on-screen entertainment. Ethan Hawke scene for the scene and Albert Finney chews up just to the screen. Marisa Tomei <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The script is perfect, the story line is nonlinear, but watch out is easy enough for you to do. Although Sidney Lumet did not know about her blockbusters, a ship came out with it!
