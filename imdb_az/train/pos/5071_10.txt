I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and especially thought it was better than a real man. Pierce Brosnan was as good as the only Englishman who had the identity of half-breed Gray Owl. <br /> <br /> This film has made me more researcher Archie Belaney, known to me as Gray Owl. I want to read a lot about him. I did not know when Richard Attenburton headed. But I'm not surprised. I love or control all movies. I gave him the highest rating. If you're like me, if you make a mistake with this movie, and if you make a mistake, enjoy a beautiful story every few minutes without hearing and listening to special effects.
