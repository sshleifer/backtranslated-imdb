EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is the funniest stand-up concert I've ever seen. The most stagnant acts at one point seem to smoke, but this is not a nation. There is no side-splittingly funny moment for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Simply this was done in 1983, and Eddie had not done anything funny. Eddie made a striking deadly impression on Mr T. <br /> <br /> Eddie, if you're there, come back and give a concert. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" SUBJECT SITUATION movie, I believe fans will love you for that, you know, you know it.
