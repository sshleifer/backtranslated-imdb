An American woman, European husband and children, returned to her mother's home in 1943, filmed by Lillian Hellman and starring Paul Lucas (repeating her role as stage actor) Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald and Donald Woods. Many anti-fascists, workers in underground motion, often wounded and need a long strike on the property of any Wolf Mueller (Lukas), rich in resources, which the Nazis hired. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of great speeches in this movie, written in writing: It is very important to have Lillian Hellman's liberal view. The wars of war and the fact that people in other countries have reached safe homes in America, of course, were powerful propaganda when they were released. The big controversy of the film is that Paul Lukas won the Oscars on Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca today. Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful display presence and an incredible Rick, but it is obvious to Lukas Kurt. <br /> <br /> This is not something that Bette Davis is like, but here's a skillful performance. The wolf is loyal and loving wife Sara. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lillian Hellman is not everyone's tea tea, unlike the "The Little Foxes," wrote a series of really sympathetic, beautiful characters and a beautiful story by Warner Brothers. Be advised.
