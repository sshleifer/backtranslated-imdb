I bought the Dark Angel season 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after capturing the episode of several seasons on Channel 5. The show did not prepare anything about how brilliant it was. Since Firefly (and beautiful show), it has never been more than satisfying. I will admit that season 2 is pretty good, but there are still some nice episodes (see Handbag, Berrisford Agenda, Harbor Light, Freak Nation, etc.) and Alec is also great. I've heard of the plans for the season's 3rd season, and I say I do not believe it's been canceled - I'm going to spoil you - but it's as if it were! I think the film has a lot of potential, though it is very difficult at the moment. As my obsessive evidence, Max barcode number 332960073452, and two weeks I've done it, I'm doing 3 episodes looking at two seasons twice. This is very good.
