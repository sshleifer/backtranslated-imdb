At first, after watching the movie on the 14th, I recall that for the first time in Soviet television I was exposed to the word "govno" (sh * t) (I write that for the first time in history * Everyone wants to add it to the trivia section :)? What is courage and freedom? Over the years, I was more impressed by the movie and incredible moves, but my feelings turned into a blurred mix of the real cinematography and the painful realization of a conception that I was at the age of 14. impression: helplessness. Throughout the film, there is an inevitable calamity throughout the film, which proves the lives of the best minds that develop humanity, and the primitive degeneration (which is embodied by Sharikov) ... It is a great metaphor of the national Russian revolution, their superiority and the power of the middle classes to swallow and swallow hoping to 'raise' the lower classes ... A gentle satirist and a very subtle and talented piece with a really sad idea in a transparent way. The movie itself became symbolic as the end of the Soviet film tradition before the Hollywood tsunami drove them down. <br /> <br /> Indeed, most Russian films appear to be labeled 'blockbusters' (most of them prerelease! trailers and posters). <br /> <br /> Funnily, the 'govno' episode is no contradiction. Efenstor's comment on the current language is rough ... I said it could be a movie showing it, but it was not. A soft word for modern standards, it has often returned and was enough to show the true nature of all the Sharikovs ... BTW, again with Efenstor's slander, intellectual and rough lexicon, has adopted a single spoken translation sentence for those who speak Russian can have meanings! But with regret I can say that today's speech can be expressed by ALL cusswords in the speeches of young people. I think this is a bigger problem than choosing the most effective means for voters :) This is a great food for movies and books that can change them or make them luxurious for watching.
