Michael Stearns plays an indecent individual Mike, sexually abhorrent with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality. She paralyzes naked dancers, but women lose when they come in contact with men. She believes that women are sexually active when they are really "innocent" and / or "beauty." <br /> <br /> The main reason for the existence of this film is sexual intercourse. So she came close to each other in Hollywood Hills and died with a high-level rifle. It operates over and over again. The story begins to work more and more in the future. This is a very happy heterosexual man (where ladies look very well dressed) and a genus for serving as a great titration dose, for looking at scenes of nakedness for a long time. Of course, looking at a fair deal from a border, the dragging factor significantly increases and demonstrates violence against voyeurism. In a word, Mike waits for a couple of minutes just a few moments before taking off the trigger.) If there is so much atmospheric music playing in this noise, all this is emphasized in a terrible way. <br /> <br /> For the lurid garbage, the angel will enjoy some degree of it. He even uses a taste that defeats Mike and gives him an uncertain way to react. It opens at a very slow pace but ends with the most entertaining irony. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
