Currently, I'm doing film studies at the AS level, and this is a movie watching "it's not a song of love" and, in my opinion, this is a very simple storyline movie, but a complex back story. <br /> <br /> If you hit the surface, after committing a crime, you will find an exciting film of two men fleeing farmers. <br /> <br /> Along with this, we need to dig deeper. The true sense of the genre emerges. As suggested, this is a love story between two gay lovers full of trust, deception and betrayal. In this film, we do not talk about "love" directly, but what happens, for example, is that Heiklo's movement in the direction of Spike almost impresses this cautious love on our faces. <br /> <br /> Generally, <br /> <br /> It's a good example of the fact that British films are not just released as it is down in the budget. <br /> <br /> Although it's a good movie with a complicated story line, it's definitely a taste and unpleasant for Hollywood's blockbusters.
