I was reading all of Nancy Drew's books and gathered books as adults. In the film style, I liked the effect (and recently) used at the end of the film, where the line shooting was filmed. It was a neat way to point out the relationship between the situation in the film and the books. For example, scenes with Eastern antique vendors have reminded me of many scenarios that I remember from the books. I thought Nedine was pouring out perfectly, and Emma Roberts was a nice comment of Nancy Drew's 21st century. (As it happens in Betty Crocker's picture, that's the same time!)
