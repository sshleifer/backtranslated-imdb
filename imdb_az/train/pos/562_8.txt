It is a story about growing relationships between Jeff Webster (Jimmy Stewart) and Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman). He is rejoicing Jeff at a brief meeting at the door of his curtain for Skagway and gets a longer look when the authorities are hiding in his booth while looking for a murder charge. They find that there is something else common in involving an animal. Because they are married to deceitful friends, they rely on the opposite sex. They gradually learn to trust one another when they go from Skagway to Dawson. However, Ronda is in close contact with corrupt sheriff Gannon and deals with some shady practices in the Skullway Gala Hall. He must ultimately decide between Gannon and Jeff. At the same time, Rene, a young, loyal French woman, is immediately glad of Jeff, but takes only the insulting brush edges. However, he goes to Skagway's Dawson and his activities around Dawson. In addition to Ronan, Jeff returns her to a state of health after being assassinated by Gannon's armed forces in the gold case. Walter Brennan, like me, Jeff serves as a sidekick for a long time. It does not have a meaty role, but it serves to soften Jeff's hard edges. <br /> <br /> John McIntire (like Sheriff Gannon) is likely to arouse charm and humor to release the most charismatic bad city boss you can see in the movie. along with his fears. Undoubtedly, Jeff has repeatedly stated that he loves himself. <br /> <br /> He is a convincing incarnation of innocent Soapy Smith, who spent his past years in Skagway as one of the best men of his time. <br /> <br /> Jeff, a traditional antihero, a comrade (except his wife) Ben, while others know he does not want to hurt his neck, or even a worker. From this point of view, for example, Vera Cruz is similar to Burt Lancaster's character. Thus, Jeff not only fired Dawson's marshal, but also asserted that the Gannon gang would leave Dawson after he had been intent on delivering enough legitimate gold claims to everyone, leaving some miners to think that the rest of them were hurrying out of Dawson. Even Ronda, when he and Jeff are still alive, propose Dawson to hurry. Then Jeff suddenly changed his heart, as it seems, Ben and his desire for revenge. The Hero hero guides the removal of the Gannon gang from Dawson. In this respect, unlike Lancaster, he does not make any reform (But did Jeff really change or revenge for the crimes he committed against his own interests?) <br /> <br /> The main problem I face with the plot is the 2 main women. Obviously, Ronda is prepared as a right woman to raise up Jeff. Although he is described as a "bad" girl, Jeff has a gate near the past, at least five people in the United States or Yukon, and stole his animals from Gannon. After the Hero hero returned to the hero, Rhonda made a similar move to the street to warn Gannon's anticipated ambiguity. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, Corin Calvert has just done nothing for himself, like Renee. A safe replacement for dead Ronda in Jeff's mind. However, although the apparent aspect of the explosion scene is somewhere, Jeff never expects kissing or embracing. If his appearance is true, the young woman is somewhat disturbed by her work when pushing powdered dust on the floor in Rhonda's hall, heavy gold dust, and then restoring it. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < Br> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Rube Morris, a gun battle between Jeff and the Gannon gang. If Gannon had no pistols, he had killed Jeff or seriously injured Jeff before he did the same thing. Would it be better to shoot a shotgun after hitting Jeff's right hand suddenly? I'm also interested in what Jeff and his comrades have done to save the avalanche victims. They were too far away because they were in the snow. <br /> <br /> So, was Ronalden's horses and mules buried? <br /> <br /> You will probably see an unusual but familiar face between the miners and the Gannon gang. The sequences in Canadian Rockies provide a breathtaking background for action. All of a very entertaining western, generally the biggest drawbacks have come to an end. Undoubtedly, this film receives great freedoms, including the history and geography of Canada, especially in the Canadian Yukon, which is much more than the United States Skagway.
