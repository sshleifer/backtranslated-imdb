This is an animated film that must win the country's cousin. Visually impressive and more entertaining and memorable. Just need to watch just for the music! Certainly, there are elements that disturb the sensitivity of some days, but the cartoon should have some perspective. It is more than six years old and therefore only one cartoon. I'm disabled and if I were hyper-sensitive as a nation watching and looking at things like this cartoon, I'd been frowning and ghostly in a dream. Sometimes you need to lighten, pull your head back and swim! In the 1930s and 1940s, cartoons of cartoon characters were common and almost no blessing. Bing Crosby reportedly hated it when it was used several times. * SIGH *
