I only blasted when we watched 139,000 (wide screen) with just a few friends. I will not worry about repeating what others have said. What Kinematographers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. The great battle is very soulful. <br /> <br /> We were surprised to find that we were still about 30 minutes away, but could not protect us to bring us all in and out. <br /> <br /> There was something that destroyed her and it was terrible music / songs. Blues, Country / Folk, and Rock Ballads are not here, and every time we use, we go out laughing. It's scary. <br /> <br /> You've warned, but the story and story tells you. <br /> <br /> There are a few prominent moments that evaluate the talent behind the camera. There is a lot of use of silence and a nice slow-moving photography. I would like to delete my music, but I'm sorry. <br /> <br /> Look for it. It's fun, different, and takes you where you can not wait and it is very refreshing.
