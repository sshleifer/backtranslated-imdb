Mary Pickford ("The Fourth Day of July" by Angela Moore) "The Little American" (French heritage); she fell in love with Jack Holt (Carl Von Austreim), who moved to America with her father and her American mother. French-American Raymond Hatton (like Jules de Destin of "Combat Destinies") was in love with Mrs. Pickforda. <br /> <br /> The triangle of love is triangular, resulting in a great deal of hardship in France, the Great War (World War I). <br /> <br /> Cecil B. DeMille's movie is very entertaining, like a ship carrying Pickford torpedo and sinking, "Titanic". When the Germans occupy their ancestral home, when Warwick is gradually becoming a secret spy for France, war drama dramatizes. Of course, German Holt came from Holt. It was difficult to believe that they had taken too much time to get to know each other because of their aggression, but they were dark; the previous events believed that each other was dead. The film is set to coincide with its symbolism. <P> <p> <font color = red> </ font> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <em> Wallace Beery, Colleen Moore and Ramon Novarro - For a more memorable sequence of directors, see Novarroya's "star" quality: Pickford and the wounded soldier greet each other in righteousness. Novarro gets even to write a letter to her for Mary Pickford; No doubt, there are pictures in the future. Ben Alexander, who plays the guy Bobby in the future; he becomes a reliable child player and grows up to be a partner of Jack Webb on the "Dragnet". <br /> <br /> Small America (7/12/17) Cecil B.
