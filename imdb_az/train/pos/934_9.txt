In our house, we are a fan of A Christmas Carol and we follow every version of every Christmas, including the 1938 Reginald Owen and the modern 1999 Patrick Stewart. Alastair Sim IS is Ebeneezer Scrooge and his transformation is the most important rings because our common favorite is 1951 black and white classic. However, it has a distinctive essence in 1984 and is generally a favorite and entertaining story to Dickens novel. (See comments on other movie adaptations if relevant) <br /> <br /> First of all, C.C. Scott, of course, may seem pretty ugly and bad Scrooge will not. I love his neighbor, his long sleeves and hat. He cuts the best fashion figure and a pretty gentleman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In the film shot in the UK's Shrewsbury, it appears to be slightly more British. All the necessary parts of the story have a nice musical score with beautiful, flood music. Sometimes it is chestnut and I read it with pudding. <br /> <br /> Marley's furious dreams (with her beautiful jaw drops) and all three souls are completely convincing. Christmas Past, a beautiful lady, Christmas, Beautiful giant and joyful, not Christmas, but always shrouded and come to the front. However, Scrooge's nephew Fred found a bit silent and terrifying. I love my brother's wife, they named Janet, with her cute, strange, hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Instead of the blind man's bluff, we have prepared a game for Simile's nephew's Christmas party, this is a lovely touch, Scrooge's into the soul of something. <br /> <br /> Cratchits and their (although highly appreciated) Christmas dish is well illustrated, Bob (David Warner), patient and patiently in a fitting manner in his shawl shaft. Ms. Kratchit is attractively described by Susannah York, and also played with George C. Scott in the fine adaptation of Jan C. Eyrein in the 1970s. Above all, this version is undoubtedly the best Tiny Tim, not just an astonishing and loved little waif, but disease. <br /> <br /> This is a nice and hearty version of the holiday classics. With a holiday atmosphere, you will be convinced of the spirit of the season.
