A detailed study on the subject by Dr. Dwivedi returns us to the previous party Panjab. Dr Dwivedi chose a challenging theme for the film's beginning. He has worked in every detail to bring the story to life. Treatment of the subject is very sensitive. <br /> <br /> Even though we did not come to the area at that time, the sets and suits look real. Unlike the majority of the films in the section, it is aimed at attracting viewers, not to the horrific details of violence, but to its subsequent results. Heroes are in life. Priyanshu Chatterjee has shown an impressive performance. Manoj Bajpai made his heart move by pointing to the condition of an accused person. The rest of the rash also did a good job.
