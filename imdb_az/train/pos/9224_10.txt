This film is visually striking. Who cares if anyone can move. Each stage is a work of art created and captured by John Derek. Places, certain designs and dresses work perfectly to convey those who are in love story, which consists of beauty, youth and wealth. In some ways I would like to see this movie as a longing for John and Bo Derek's story. And ... When Anthony Quinn was a father, a mentor, a lover, and a man of men, that comment would not have been completed, as a man belonging to the era of men. There are some people who rely on our strength and direction and have the power to influence security, security, and security. Yes, they do not do the same! However, then how often do you find women like Bo Derek.
