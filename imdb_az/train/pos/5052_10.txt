This is a beautiful movie. As a Canadian growing up with a rural lifestyle, it is familiar with winter, canoe, trapping, hunting, and so on. <br /> <br /> The story of the Blue Owl is well-known with the Canadian director Attenburon's loan and screenwriter Nicholson. <br /> <br /> Brosnan perfectly describes a complex person, a very good performance. Anni Galipeau is the first great role. The rest of the pile is firm.
