First of all, do not call for an update of the '63 movie. This version is very long, even if the scene is more accurate. Casting was good with some exceptions. Chyna Phillips was a good cast. She was about 30 when she saw this movie and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after some time he gave me headache. Tyne Daly overcomes his part as Mae Peterson. George Wendt was funny as Harry McAffee and even showed a melody. Like '63, he was forced to play with Conrad Birdie. Marc Kudisch had fun and played it as a bird. There is even a soundtrack and I love listening to her singing. So did this make a TV ratings flop? Someone was long. They put new songs and scenes. While some of the new songs were good, was it really important (say "Come")? Now do not take me wrong, I like, but I'm watching '63 (see my review). It has played some roles, made some changes, and has played the role of LENGTH again. Vanessa Williams, another thing she does not want to mention. She does a good job with her role and music. Give him any promise, and he could read them. One of those who made Bye Bye Birdie's production came up to me: If you want to watch a fun game in the game, follow the '63 'movie. If you want to follow a version that is more accurate to the game, follow '95. At the same time, look at the reluctance. Do not be a hero and watch all of a seating.
