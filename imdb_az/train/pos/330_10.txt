I am an Italian and recently I was amazed at its beauty when I looked at this movie: for the first time I was 10 years old and likened it to it, but today I appreciate it with mature minds and feelings. Now we can understand that it was the masterpiece of the Italian season (Pasolini et al.). <br /> <br /> Hollywood epic movies are good for fun. Probably, this is not the English version of Odyssey, because it's not funny ... it's not pop-corn and cane audience. But it suits Homer's patches and existentialist thoughts. <br /> <br /> Italy recently came out with a very good DVD version: INTEGRAL, with excellent colors. You can find some file shares, but this is only with Italian and without subtitles. Very bad: the dialogues and sounds of this film are also striking.
