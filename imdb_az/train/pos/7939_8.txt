There is a movie that the whole family can watch together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple who want to marry in Las Vegas, and then just join their families (each with two boys and two daughters), not just to break the news. The four teenagers, two preteens and two smaller children are the first to be surprised if Carrie and Jim can be truly happy. The wars between children (and a small love relationship between them) make everyone wonder that he can always set out on a journey. More interesting than Brady Bunch, this is a totally pleasing way to spend a few hours. It is presented as a good movie for all ages.
