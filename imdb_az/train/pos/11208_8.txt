<br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> I remember these shows when I was first screened in Disneyland. Recalling that sitting there, electrified by Werner Van Braun's interpretations of rocket science. <br /> <br /> This was a science year ago. And the show is in the Disney Treasures series and what a treasure. Last night and evening, I saw them with their 8-year-old daughter, first of all, not coming to the room, and later partly saw the cartoon changes. Undoubtedly, some predictions about reaching the moon were wrong, but it is still unclear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < .. You wonder how much it has changed over the next 50 years.
