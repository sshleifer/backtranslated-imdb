I watched this beautiful movie last night and was looking forward to a wonderful addition to the question-and-answer session with the director. I think the first commentator did not lose any parent or someone who was close to his death. I have been so absorbed in this sort of way, and this movie has been talking to me. One of the most important issues is not too late - regardless of how we deal with questions / issues / stories with our loved ones - because they are flawless or dead before they happen. Talk to your loved ones, listen to and record their stories, tell them your favorite people, and solve differences. I liked the message that there was no mistake. I love the director's relationship with his two daughters - as one of my six brothers, I understood how complicated these relationships are. His film history as a cinematographer is well-received and clear - what a beautiful movie! Casting shooting - a movie that should not be missed!
