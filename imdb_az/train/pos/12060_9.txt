I really missed the production of good old fashioned Spooky films. When Ismail Merchant and James Ivorya were given the assignment to give such a film, it could have been, in addition to the internationally renowned, best shot. We want to hide it in one dark night with one pizza and some popcorn movies and even under cover, because you do not bother eating until morning. Bravo director Herbert Wise, Writers Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, Production Design by John Bunker, Art Department by John Ralph and one of the most populated cities in the world, at the beginning of the 21st century. I really gave a great show with television production and budget constraints, because I gave "9" to "10".
