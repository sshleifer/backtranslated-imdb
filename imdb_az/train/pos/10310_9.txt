Player: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was very skeptical about watching this movie for the first time. I want to say what a conceptual NIGHTMARE. Jim Carrey is playing God? Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is tough, but it's not a big one, it's not sacred. Yes, Jim Carrey has God's authority for some time, but he is not God. Is it mixed? <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a correspondent who loses his luck and feels very unsuccessful in his life. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, by just being kidnapped by Evan Baxter. Of course, Bruce shares his thoughts in a televised way that is funny and definitely fired. <br /> <br /> Then, Bruce, who is very upset about God, takes a page. After a while he was tired of the call, he responded and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There the Boss meets God, the Electrician and the Janitor of the Building (Freeman). I found it very entertaining. God is the boss, the Holy Spirit Electrician, and Jesus Christ Janitor. Think about it. The boss is open. The electrician holds the guy running everything. Janitor is the man who cleanses the world's evil. In any case, Bruce is a little skeptical of his acquaintance with God, but God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot of God playing, he begins to believe a little. Why I wondered. <br /> <br /> Because this is Hollywood, Bruce will definitely end, learn his lesson and begin to use his power for the power of the world. In the end, he screams to divert God and does not pray with Bruce, but to do his will. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey is very entertaining in this movie, and there are definitely some great laughs there. The film is not theoretically perfect, but for Hollywood this is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite thought-provoking and even challenging, and I welcome Tom Shadyachi for his efforts in this film. <br /> <br /> Thus, a perfect, definitely a fun popcorn movie <br /> <br /> Bottom line: 4 out of 3.5 (appearance or two values)
