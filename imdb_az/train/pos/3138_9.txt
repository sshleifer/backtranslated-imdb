Yes, when I sit here, I remember having a red face, because when my wife waited a few weeks, my wife chose to watch just like Mommie Dearest. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How does Batman and Robin explain the appeal - I really consider only Adam West and Burt Ward. It was a terrific show with terrible scenes and terrible moves, and oh yes, it was funny! And it is about the same "reunion" and "flashback". Adam and Burt are invited to an auction to be sold for the old Batmobile charity. But it is stolen and our pals (like themselves) jump to their old characters (without their costumes) and push their head to find out what's going on. On the way, they remember about the series, and we see how all these things come together. Jack Brewer and Jason Marsden, young Adams and Burt TV series. Indeed, looking at some old series behind the scenes was very interesting, and Adam and Burt just returned to the character perfectly (although they were not really characteristic) It was almost nice to see Julie Newmar and Frank Gorshin. <br /> <br /> If you are not an admirer of the old series, you will hate it. If you're banned from paradise - you really hate it if you think that Michael Keaton and George Clooney are taking "Batmans." But we grew up with Adam and Burt, and if you're ready to admit that you've never missed an episode, that's for you. <br /> Yes, that's right - 9/10
