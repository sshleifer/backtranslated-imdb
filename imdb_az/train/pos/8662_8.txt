I really liked it. In fact, if I look back (and plan), I can only love it. I reflect on other viewers that this movie really does not grow on your watch. It starts slowly, but the path to the enfolds is very natural and it has a soul. <br /> <br /> In spite of some of the movies, there was a part of this movie. The heroes have a strong sense of realism, and when the movie is being drawn very slowly and sincerely from each other, we want to read them and find out how they will eventually decide which characters they will choose. <br /> <br /> I am very sorry that there are few comments on that - there are more comments, then there are TV shows that are rich in love. <br /> <br /> I say that I missed the crazy driven end, and I had to watch it again to see it. This is a movie that can not be for everyone, but I felt that it was declining decently (even though I did not see almost any movie, some of my friends are not in the movie shooting), and most of the invisible message board really liked me and let's look at those who love the drama, the scenery, the atmosphere, and the family drama, which are hot at a pace that has not been delayed. This is a gem for those who love Southern South Carolina (such as myself) and the films that are there, especially because they deserve it. I will quietly add a few comments to my voice, and I recommend this little flick.
