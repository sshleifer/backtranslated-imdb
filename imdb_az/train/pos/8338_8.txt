This movie is too big. Perhaps in the 40's and Meg Ryan's character struggles to be recognized as "smart". Now Tim Robbins is very sweet in this movie. Everything about it has a magical feeling on it. I'm watching everything, I feel happy. This is definitely a girl movie and I'm a girl, so I love it. I also love music. The violin is awesome. but I think it's a cute story, and everyone should watch it.
