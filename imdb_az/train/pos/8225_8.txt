Strangely enough, all previous comments simply describe the start and leave the details. I feel that Marina Vilni is the wife of Robert Hossein and that this is a family affair, since this perfect jazz is written by Andr√©, the father of the director. In this situation, it was really a good tension, it was seen and immediately depicted with music. The tension was flawless and continued until the end. One of the best European players, Robert Hossein, has also succeeded in applying himself as a top screen and scene director. She is still preparing great scenic performances that favor religious issues. Harry Carasso, Paris, France
