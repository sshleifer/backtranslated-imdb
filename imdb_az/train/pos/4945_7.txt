"10 Product or Less" is a difficult movie classification. Generally, I do not think to define genres, but there is something about this film that just wants to put it in a certain category to convey your feelings about it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone and if you really enjoy movies and enjoy life, you would want to do the same thing as you watch it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and call it a wonderful and delicious, but it does not make a mistake. I do not want to sound like controversy, but writer / director Brad Silberling knew that he understood this inspirational writing. I am sure that he wanted to achieve a product that had nothing to do with perfection: his name would be a simple, attractive and impatient product. Yes, he did it. <br /> <br /> Longer, sophisticated, dramatic films such as "The City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile" cling to Silberling just 70 minutes, proving it with "10 Product or Az", His work and the belief in it. What Silberling offered here is to place a player (Morgan Freeman) in a grocery store (Paz Vega) in front of a woman and take them to the exact location. <br /> <br /> I can not give you more information, because there is an unprecedented argument in clear simplicity. Because everyone is exposed here: The camera stands on two main characters, and it is because of a spouse who stands with an endless chat car. And how good it was to say that Silberling had reached a smaller place than how good Silberling had reached (at the time of the film, but not during the film's time). <br /> <br /> The link between the two characters, Sofia Coppola, "Lost in the Translation". <br /> <br /> Founded in Tokyo, she also met an actor and a woman who talked about their moments. their life. It's like "10 Product or Less" and the quality of the "Coppola", the nature of each situation has never been lost, and all the music and, in any word, unprecedented images are "time consuming" without having to enter or not. <br /> <br /> From this point of view, Silberling and his photographer Phedon Papamillion are the co-operation. The person who attracted the "side-by-side" scenes and paying attention to every part of Patch Adams delights in the visual transitions of the true natural beauty. However, the final beauty of "10 Products or Less" can be found in her castle, by her two heroes (Avy Kaufman). These are the transmitters I first mentioned and I can not say; we feel their connection, and we can say that we are entertaining and can even decorate decorations. Oscar winner Morgan Freeman simply stands as the executive producer of the film and today confirms his status in the film industry and has a good position: a quiet man, able to laugh easily, laughably. And here is a real deal, and beautiful Hollywood is not small for him - and beautiful Paz Vega (well, I said it was good at Spanglish).
