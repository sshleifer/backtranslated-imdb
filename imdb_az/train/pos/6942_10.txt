The age limitations for movies in Brazil in the 50s are: No restrictions, 10 years, 14 years and 18 years. Usually westerners reached the age of 10, when they were exposed to more violence, they went to 14, but limited to a western under 18. Winchester 73 was one of those, and I think it's a good idea how much this movie is on the average. The hero, James Stewart, fought against his brother who killed his father. He was looking for revenge and more trauma than the average good guy. Anthony Mann tested this kind of variation in his subsequent films with Stewart. Shale Winters, a prominent militant, was far from the good guys behind the man with the rifle. Dan Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great villains who will always be remembered. The story of the movie is always followed by a rifle person, one of the best fit for the West. It was not Fritz Lang's film. When offered to Mann, he began to refrain from doing something zealously for Lang. Winchester and Mann have created a different western concept, but still protects all their traditions. Winchester is still a great movie to see again, but nothing can be compared to the impression made to the viewers when they are actually released.
