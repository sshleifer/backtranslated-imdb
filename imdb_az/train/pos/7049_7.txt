In this line of war commercialization and "heartfelt" warfare, John Cusack plays an assassin Brand Hauser, sent to Damascus to send an attacker to Omar Sheriff for some oil business that might be a problem for an ex-vice president. The US is its own company. In addition, Hauser should encourage a fake position such as a commercial show producer, a wedding for pop princess Yonica (Hillari Duff) and a refugee liberal journalist Natalie (Marisa Tomei). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - As expected, the functioning (at least of the main characters) was good. Some of John Cusack's dialogue was not clearly written for him because he was often anxious. . . Maybe it's more realistic. Joan showed great and often fun, performance. Marisa Tomei would never be a big fan of her, and she was more accessible and better suited for her role. Hillary Duff was terrifying. They needed a charming Middle East (or Russia, or any accent) pop-star. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, there has been some tough and discrepancies in the writings, especially in John Cusack's dialogue. Not too many, but one. The story was a little laugh at a point where it was nice at a point of satire, but raised it to a new level. Fortunately, Kusacks and Tomei have a relatively cool, calm behavior, and make a nice mix even of the beauty of the movie and the level of actors. <br /> <br /> - The real loans dwelling on behalf of Joshua Seftel, who lived before, made a wonderful job with a fairly wide spectrum movie. He worked very well on a small ($ 10 million) budget and encouraged him to be more visible. Seftel blended the humor of the story well. . . <br /> <br /> - If the general satire is an exaggeration of the war on commercialization, the painful and unexpected parts of the real war (including the killing of civilians and other US tanks, especially the 'Golden Palace Poker' ads, have done very well. but in the end it shows exactly what is happening in a young "Mel Brooks" style. <br /> <br /> Generally, the movie is well worth the budget and deserves a look. <br /> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;
