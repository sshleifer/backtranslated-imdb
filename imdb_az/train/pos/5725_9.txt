<br /> <br /> LEGAL CRAP, The Grudge, honestly, is one of the scary movies I have ever seen! If I'm too loose in my age or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures have done a KICK A ** job! (Wait for Boogey!) <br /> <br /> I was afraid of being in the dark theater and I was a man sitting next to me (with the exception of Hero in Grudge). myself.) I swear that there were many unexpected jumping scenes! I felt foolish, but my nerves were uneasy! I was on the edge of the entire film from opening credits and the music was fantastic scary. <br /> <br /> I really sounded a few times and cried on a "oh" scene! Oh, yes, I've covered half of my eyes several times! Despite the wise saying: I thought some scenes were a little psychotic. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> I was scared, but very good and scary. Who is the last scene too? I'm a 32-year-old mother, especially because of this voice, I think I can be afraid of this movie. <br /> <br /> When I grow up with betrayal (Jason, Freddy) is not an uprooted flicker. This is the most up-to-date film. <br /> <br /> Two great trailers for this movie were Boogeyman and The Ring 2!
