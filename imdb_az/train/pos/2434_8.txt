I often wondered how much CASPER was meant for children ... all the issues around her personality (we believe this is a dead child's soul because her home is a cemetery), as well as anxiety from this movie . Perhaps Casper was supposed to be an ethical game, or Famous Studios was thinking of breaking new places in "reality" cartoons. <br /> <br /> GOOD BOOS TONIGHT - a good animation project. <br /> <br /> Give credit to well-known studios - they are fighting with respect for death ... but they are similar. <br /> <span style = "color: red;" >>> Casper's law is pretty graphic and disturbing for kids (although denouement offers a happy end, but I will not end it) and even standards of 1940 violence is even stronger. <br /> <br /> This is a good cartoon for parents to use to help explain children to death - but I will not open the VCR for a dark caricature breakdown.
