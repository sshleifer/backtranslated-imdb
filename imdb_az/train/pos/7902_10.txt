Film is an exception to gay symbolism and puts it off to music and players. There is a childhood miracle, as seen from the main character throughout the film. He is sincere, funny, and beautiful in the world around him. In short, there is a fucking movie for girls. Look, this is an entertaining funny night movie. If you like, it unites you in a different media world and love (?).
