No non-targeted letters ended in another world in the back rooms of the post office. Here, Alice tries to get started with the hope of finding her missing father. The thing he discovered is the disastrous spirit of his boss, Frank. A quiet little Aussie naked going to the cinema. Now you can find it in the deep dark corner of the video shop shaded by the fifty-foot copy of this horrible GODZILLA movie. This, unfortunately, is a film that describes a daring story, showing powerful images and two effective outcomes. This movie, the other dead letters of Garry Marshall, DEAR GOD (1996 - US) failed and succeeded and Kevin Costner was not in Turkey but O Jianjun's POSTMAN (1995 - China) glimpse.
