The film begins very fast, with Wallace Napalm's lifestyle, a helper at the station for the photo service. As a sentence for his heart, his spouse returned home with ankle bracelet. Wallace is a volunteer fire brigade and seriously fires fire. <br /> <br /> When watching Wallace's pretty dull life, suddenly there comes a new, hard thing: a carnival to the city. One of the stars is Wallace's brother, Wilder Napalm. He is a clown, but he has a special ability. <br /> <br /> Wallace is so. They are both pyroxynethics and "pyrotechnics", people who start fires through mental energy. Wallace keeps its powers secret; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Spoyler: Some differences come back to a childhood phenomenon, causing them to die an accidentally dead person. Wallace withdraws its powers; Wilder wants to go public on national TV. <br /> <br /> Wilder wants Wallace's spouse to make matters worse. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun, but not funny-high-silent. It is enough to have one copy in my library. A good extraordinary movie.
