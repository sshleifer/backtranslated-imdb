Dana Andrews is one of the actors I've seen in many films, but it's not actually registered for me. Perhaps, such an actor who plays such a role and looks like underrated Glenn Ford, often stolid, taciturn, a little effort to truly appreciate; but once it has come to the right movie .... <br /> <br /> This is it. The premier's nervous appearance in New York is dirty and elegant as in any one of the 50s, and Andrews hates criminals who do not know how to play in a very difficult steel game like Mark Dixson, always playing with rules. At the beginning of the film, he accidentally murdered a murderous murderer, whose witness Dixon has created an illegal toy set up by a group that hates personal reasons, and the rest of the film to cover his participation and his "justice." He contacts a betrayer who is killed on the road (Gene Tierney) and should try to pull his father out of the hole to kill him. <br /> <br /> Posed for a surprising photo by Joseph Lauchel. I have a really strong ending with a tough and brilliant dialogue and tragedy elements by Ben Hecht, and have found a moment or two grace, which is another good thing for the ages and may be my favorite Preminger movie these days - it's as good as Laura preaches.
