Master Cinéaste wanted to work with actors who are part of Alain Resnais's family. In this film, we see family members such as Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, André Dussolier and Fanny Ardant, who are dealing with serious topics like Resnais's death, religion, suicide. love and overall effect on their daily lives. It's as clear as the nature of the shared relationships shared by these people, and they are formally addressed to each other. In 1984, when L'amour is considered a mortal, Resnais is the place to uncover the mysteries of time, memory, and the key question of human existence: Is love more powerful than death? 16 years ago, in 1968, Resnais had made a little bit of a movie about love and memories. The content of this film is high and clear: the true and deep love can put the love of science into action. Deadly lovers restore their lives by leaving their doctors to care for their losses. L'amour à mort, no didactic.It is a game. a movie that is perfect tandem with its images. This is one of the reasons why this film is easily captured.
