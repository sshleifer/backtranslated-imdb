Greetings from the darkness again. A party for the highly anticipated, twisted comedian actor Pierce Brosnan by writer / director Richard Shepard. Bond's son went. This new guy is a completely different thing! You read that Shepard's Brosnan is a very nice guy for this awesome role, but Brosnan's perfect Julian Noble, "Facilitator" ... and a pretty good thing! How bad is this humor twisted! Wait for punch lines and eyelids for anything you can think of sex, killing, religion, sports, business, and politically wrong. Brosnan receives a nice script to another level with spectacular facial conquests and physical exercises. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear is a straightforward comrade of Brosnan's comedy, and has a great deal of depth and comic time to make clicks. <br /> <br /> Hope Davis plays a small, exciting role, as Kinnear's wife (in her name, "Bean"). The visuals and settings are perfect - around a bull, racing and around Denver. How often do we get Killers and Xavier Cugat at the same Soundtrack? It is not necessarily for everyone, but feeling of humor is a bit of a focus, and if you enjoy the risky movie boots, it may be for you.
