"Plainsman" represents the censorship of Cecil B. DeMille in the most inaccurate and unrealistic way. Lincoln was actually less than perfect, though, with Lincoln, less than perfectly contested by Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln he has died right now. For a while, DeMille is approaching the truth in a realistic way, but easily flips away from the show and showcase. The film is just an attempt to support Custer's last stand with graphics, based on the lives of people who are the product of finished products and legends. <br /> <br /> Taking into account the grape of the film, it is an attractive transfer, because taking into consideration the grape of the film, this is world-wide, DeMille is a zeitgeist in a fun year. TRANSFER: frequently clean nets and extremely robust swallows. In some scenes, many films lack grain and other moments. All of this is generally a bit contradictory, but is not all bad or good? a bit better than the middle of the road. Age-related works are kept at a minimum and digital abnormalities are not remarkable. The sound is mono, but beautifully balanced. <br /> <br /> EXTRAS: Forget it. Universal is! BOTTOM LINE: As the celluloid is painted in a pseudo-history, it's western and solid. Just take the characters and story with a salt grains? in some cases ?? a box will fit more!
