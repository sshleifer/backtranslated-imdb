My daughter, my friends and I have been watching this movie for decades. I bought it twice and charged with several little girlfriends. Later, I rented it many times. Not just old! Blockbuster does not exist anymore and has leased, found, leased for more than 5 years. Surely this was my favorite daughter's favorite movie, and that's all! We laughed, weeped, discussed the real life, and came to some difficult situation in the world. There was nothing to talk about this movie. We contacted Bill every second and every line! Thanks to one million people to restore our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. CANADA, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> If a rich woman is in love with a poor man, who are we? or a person with love chooses to raise a child who is not himself. It can not be my life or my life. It's not just amazing, it's every day. Thank God! Believes in human nature! Celebrate!
