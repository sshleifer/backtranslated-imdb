<br /> <br /> Therefore, it is confusion, confusion, and darkness. This is a quality that really distinguishes good players. I think there's George Clooney and Jack Nicholson is. Clooney, in a word, happily resembles scenes when Andy Garcia and Elizabeth on the Ocean 11 betray each other's name. Terry. "Danny". You can choose from a few few men and Jack's performances, followed by five people from the audience at the courtroom. These guys are just there. You can add Denzel Washington to a small and exclusive actor list that leaks these awesome features in everything. If you look at some explosive frontier lines in Rice, you can see that Malcolm X is not a better actor today if you look at the same title in Spike Lee. I do not mention all this to prove that Fire Fire is perfect for Denzel's case, but he is definitely a product of the production. <br /> <br /> Washington is a former spy or CIA agent or Creasy, one of the secret government employees. He was hit hard by the disappointment of his life. He was killed and perhaps abandoned saying the best things, and made him a harsh and painful man. A very well-guarded friend and perhaps a teacher who lives by Christopher Walken enjoys a very comfortable life by providing body-protective services for the rich in Mexico. As you can see, the kidnapping business in Mexico is so alive that we can do a good job of paying the old SSE and providing the necessary service. Creasey needs a job and looks at some financially difficult family with a good job. Marc Anthony is as good as Samuel, Radha Mitchell is as tantalizingly sexy as incredible and precociously brilliant as Pantaya as his wife Lisa and Dakota Fanning. I do not know how a child in my age can play the characters, but Pita's description is not something Oscar deserves. All half of the film depends on the relationship between Pita and Creasi and, if it were a weak actress, the emotional synergy would not have been so short. However, Fan's role in this role is not remarkable. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Pita and Creasy directs this film to the movie apex. Together they are perfect, and there is a developed bond of truth between them. Tony Scott focuses on a frenetic emergency and is never better for his visual torch. His next movie, Domino, is interesting to see how. <br /> Citation: Quote: Quote. There is a certain link between them, and maybe, though Pita loves her father, she is not around too much. She has little time to spend with a charitable and obviously family. Coming soon, Creasi is in Pita for her swimming competition. She reads bedtime stories, and her toy bear is called "Creasy." This is not a friendship between them, but more brotherhood, and a deep parental love seems ready. <br /> <br /> When the pita was abducted and kept for ransom, the film was almost wounded, transforming the film and trying to protect Creasy. When the story is thickened with deception and matures with deception, the plot pieces become like an onion. Denzel is the place where he got the tour. As I said earlier, I've seen Denzel showing his outstanding performances in the films Crimson Tide and Education Day, but I have never seen it. He is a possessor, and Pita is likely to become a dead person, possibly dead. He produces and cooks his mark on hunting. Denzel's anger and acerbity are not to drown as easily as any low hunt that is responsible for Pita Violations. Just like the Mexican authorities, this justice is always one step away. <br /> <br /> The bold glimpse of this film is of great importance, in fact, there is little movie that criminals have conveyed to them. I'm often frustrated to watch movies wherever bad guys are eager to leave. They suffer all kinds of film, then they get a bullet and die. But not in this movie. Writer Brian Helgeland sees here that the sentence is unambiguous and painful. These criminals feel Creasy's anger and live in pain. There is nothing to do with his justice brand. Needs information and someone finger loses. Homemade bombs are put in place where they want to answer and where they are meant for other things. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < Get / STRONG> </ SE. It is loaded with bonus features that include approximately 6 hours of documentary and different interpretation paths. 10/10
