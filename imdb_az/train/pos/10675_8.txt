For a long time, I wanted to see this film, both of Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I acknowledge that the romance is a waste of time, but McCallum's talent shines in this juvie's role. Thank you to the Sky for the Turner Classic, which was released last week by the show. I think that after the war, especially in the 1950s, there were many problems between children. Some boys are a little scared. Of course, I would not want to meet somewhere in a dark, well-lit street. There was a good idea of ​​a firefighter, or a firefighter called it.
