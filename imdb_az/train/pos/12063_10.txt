Black Women (1989) is a modern classic fantasy story of Susan Hill, published only a few years before the film's release. Unfortunately, this movie has not been featured on the DVD and I have been deleted in the VHS as I know it. This presence differs directly from popularity among those who want to know about the fear movies. The story takes place around the events of a seaside public in the early 20th century. Here, a young airline sends off a dead widow's death to end her death in her isolated seaside territory. As he thinks, a routine, and perhaps a tiring task, becomes a nightmare when he sees the old woman's death coincident with her past-mindedness. The story is gentle, but briefly explained, it is never attractive, sensitive or extreme exposition. Obviously, the budgetary budget has led to an unsatisfactory approach, but why this story is needed and why it works well? You do not see this scary. After seeing, there is a particularly terrible scene that prefers visually and especially for excellence. I watched this movie in the afternoon and about a week later gave me nightmares. If you love to be terrified, do what you need to take and follow a copy of the Black Lady.
