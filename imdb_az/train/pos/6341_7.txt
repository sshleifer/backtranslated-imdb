Although I liked Jim Carrey's latest "serious" appearances (The Truman Show, "The Man of the Moon"), I always thought about his real lies in the physical comedy. It is not a fact that he is a fantastic and talented actor: the Bozos in the Academy Awards seem to have never been so dissatisfied with him, he has never been nominated for a title or awards. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that any "body" nominated for the 11 Oscars known as the "Titanic" should not be taken seriously. "The Grinch" is the sweetest, best-looking, best-moving, enjoyable season film since "The Nightmare of Christmas." Both films are quite similar to their highly stylized sets and the premiere of one who stole Christmas. <br /> <br /> Both accept their main actors as those with a higher level, both of which receive strong moral lessons and both are really pleasing. <br /> So Jack Skellington is a puppet and Grinch is a man. However, human actions are similar to animated films, because they are unrealistic, so that the film can never be in the way. He can be a cheerful, sad spirit, may be angry. Lives in a 3-dimensional world where 3-D people live. He is joking, laughing, crying, and eventually saving Christmas. I liked this movie for a bit and can not wait to get it on the DVD. This is really one of the favorite films after 10, 20 years. It's like when they came.
