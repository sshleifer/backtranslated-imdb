The story of Columbo's first television station is simple: half of a successful mysterious writing team merged with others, frames are invisible by the Mafia group, blackmailed by an admirer, and abolished the admirer. <br /> <br /> < <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Aside from being directed by the young Steven Spielberg, in the episode it has a macabre atmosphere due to the future of its stars: Cassidy and Barbara Colby. These two films are similar to each other and both of them die dramatically in the tenth in the film, Cassidy is in a fire room and is still in the hands of the assaultants in Colby, three decades later. <br /> <br /> Now both are real life styles!
