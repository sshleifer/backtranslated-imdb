I thought Rachel was fantastic as York "Lucy". I've seen him at Kiss Me, Kate and Victor / Victoria, and each of these performances has very different and very realistic features. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised at how negative the comments were on Rachelin's performance at Lucy. Even some bonafide TV and entertainment critics have escaped from his illustration. So, Rachel really focuses on many people that do not look like Lucy. In response, "What?" I was not looking for a personalization of Lucy's surface. I would like to know more about the real woman behind Palvan. And Rachel certainly gave us a great deal of depth. I also did not want to see one of the "executing" classic Lucy routines. That's why the producer and the director were very pleased with the decision to test Rachel Lucy - the most memorable of vitaminataveque and sweets. (As you can see, some reviewers are not meant to be a sequence of exercises, rather than actual sketches of these two scenarios). I thought this approach gave an innovative twist to sketches we all know from heart. And I thought Rachel was terrifying at this stage, fresh and funny. And he has achieved completely rebuilt routines - especially Professor and Grape Stomping. At one point in the vineyard, Rachel had a small upshot that I remembered as Lucy's corner. <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Most of the nation that criticizes changes Lucille Ball is the "Lucy Love" movie. After all, people who were only familiar with television would have no idea as Lucy had in the early film years. I think Rachel has made a natural breakthrough in a brilliant character. Given the right conditions, he planted all the right seeds to see the clowns waiting to wait. Lucy did not fit the mold of the old studio system. <br /> <br /> I believe Rachel will not miss comedy, drama, mind, sorrow, anger and anger. lust, love, enthusiasm, loyalty, sexism, self-consciousness, childhood, and stoism have become a whole complex American symbol. And he made it with an absolutely loved originality and freshness. "Lucy" was a turn for Rachel York. Hopefully he will play a major role in his future. And I hope he'll bring her Emmy.
