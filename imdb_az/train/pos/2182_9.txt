This perfect movie draws on talented actors and musicians on the pictures - Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone is a story entirely presented by Billy Wilder at home. She is a pretty clever change in the fairy tale of a sterile master / productive employee, and I would like to know more about what to do with it - about a dozen of entertainment industry managed by dry numskulls, but not by the world of live art and exploited homeless and WASPs. When looking at music, television, and movies in the United States over the past six decades, it's hard to see the baseless conceptions of this film as prophetic.
