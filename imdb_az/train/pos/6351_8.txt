When Grinch appeared, I thought it would be a happy happy movie and I was thrilled. There was a little nightmare before Christmas. You know a dark and dangerous species. I liked this movie because people were full of Christmas spirit. So basically Grinch rescued Christmas. And then what they say is good at Whoville, they say the Grinch little heart has grown three-dimensional that day. MERRY GRINCHMAS!
