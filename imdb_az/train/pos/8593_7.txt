Sentinel, mill and clutter cavity / mystery has some sort of running, but with some good motion and push pacing. These stories have gone through many sections, as we have passed most of the time, so how good a player, good organization and bad guys are, how well we are leaving, how well they are made, the main area and so on. ..... So, Sentinel does a good job with regard to its content. Michael Douglass and Kiefer Sutherland are both good screen protects their attitudes as well. Eva Longoria brings some satisfactory support (the first time I saw her on the screen). All the sides of the story beat him a bit, totally unbelievable, but worth the spot. If you want a genre, it's a valuable image.
