Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her spouse Michael (Sam Neill) welcomed only one girl, Azaria. Like the Seventh-Day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and soon Azaria dedicates them to God in their church, looking at their two great boys. Michael is on vacation and the family decides to lead Ayer Rock, one of Australia's most influential tourist boards. Camps located in the vicinity of the family that are not rich. After a wonderful first day, Lindy will sleep in a tent in Azarija baby. Suddenly, Azaria cries. When Lindy runs to the tent, a dingo dog breaks its head. The baby went on and soon, dingo. Although the whole camp is looking for a baby, it can not be found. When her death ends and the dingo is built with her beloved child, Chamberlains is struggling to accept God's decision and continue her life. But, unfortunately, the story takes a sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale comes into play when Lindy kills the baby. He was subsequently arrested and sent to court. How can it be? This is a great illustration of real events that show that the "mob ruler" is not a description of the imagination. The whole country is partly opposed to Chamberlains because they are seen as a single unit. Streep provides the best performance as complex Lindy, with her strong will to work against her every step. Neill also does a wonderful job like a hesitant and mixed Michael. Casting is the largest of all, with the nation's image around the country, earning its own excavations at Lindy's work. The suit is the whole of the decor, the script, the direction and the production line. If you have not seen this movie and heard it, you just got it right. To say that this "mind" should be seen from the film and the obsolete force of the media is far from the truth.
