When this first came out, my dad brought home - we were amazed - it was different from what we had seen before. Yesterday we were looking for a certain movie and found 'The Mind's Eye' again. I'm surprised that the box falls apart and the band is still working! Although Nemo's quality graphics are not found, it is still very good. Need to sell again - a place for computer animated images. Recommend!
