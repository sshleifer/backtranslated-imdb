A woman was a boy alone in this world. A boy had a gift and a curse in a package, and both were alone - able to pull a sword out of his arm. The wound of the most deadly weapon inside the body - there was always a scar on the back of the "gift". First of all, the persistent father who kills his mother every time kills her son. Then he grows up and decides to find his own father. For a superhero it is always as simple as it is - it is fair ... but the society decides that justice is not necessary and dangerous, as it is not the case with Hollywood movies, but to kill someone - Sasha (he is the key to acting by Artem Tkachenko hero) justifies the death of a person who has the right to kill, but runs away from power. In such a run from the authorities and mafia, he meets and loves a girl who is acting on Ã‡ulpan Hamatova. Everything else should be watched ... not. Remember that this movie is more about feelings and feelings, but not about movements. This film is filled with the fullness of her character and the vision of life.
