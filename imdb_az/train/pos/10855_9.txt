Over the last 28 years (since I was exposed to my first demonstration) I missed again: Once I bought it - it will stay with you forever. I remember my initial reaction: 1) Humble, 2) When produced 3) Different characters. Well, two years later, I watched several episodes and did not find it as nearly annoying. One year later, I was able to keep track of all the series, and quickly understood the prospects of human deficiency and happiness. Yes, the show has a style that does not belong to anyone, but I am sure that the price of a historical production would be difficult to deal with now. <br /> <br /> In some cases, at least once a month, I show a show for me. <br /> <br /> I look like a person like this ... a show for these women)
