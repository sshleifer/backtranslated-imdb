Poor cast, terrible scripts full of holes, hot blond eating habits, evil scientist has a serious beating, a man takes a guided armed driver and is winning, giving terrific special effects, and avoiding the cannabis ... Awesome. Something missing is an unnecessary graphical sex scene in one of the killings. Haha. Have fun having fun with a lot of fun and laughable liners. I'm very pleased with this movie, but make sure you smile good before watching. I recommend this movie to people who are watching a movie and who are not so serious. In my opinion, this film is intended for people to accept seriously. However, if you watch it and get back and enjoy it, I think you can really use this movie as you like. Very simple. So you get some popcorn and some beer and have some friends and a fun night with this movie. It brought joy to my life.
