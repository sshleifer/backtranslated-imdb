To begin with, I will say: ... Why, oh why, why did the WB do these movie directors? Sandy, of course, is an incredible Director and deserves some loans from WB and DC. However, a man with a budget of $ 12,000 thinks that he can build a super-hero's soul. <br /> <br /> In some of the movies, one of the best short films for me is either Trailer or not. <br /> <br /> I'm thinking of choosing Bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn) for a genius selection of Supermans. Meet people, Superman is not a super model. It might be nice, but not GQ Stud. And I did not know what this man had for a few comments, but I was really scared by Superman (did you really read a Superman comic book?). I can only guarantee that ... Some actual muscle masses do not seem to be a beautiful hero, so it seems like an open choice to play superheroes. Same Thing for Batman, Bartram's incredible shape and excellent Batman ... I do not know children ... If a bigger budget and a movie is given ... I think Bale and Bartram will be neck and neck. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's a bit strange. I do not know what everyone is saying, O'Hearn is not bad. There is a convincing thing like SÃ¼derman and Bartram ... That's Batman. I want to say to people that this movie has a budget of $ 12,000, what were you waiting for? Everyone Else is also very big, except for two faces, more horrible than ever ... But hey, we're just referring to Tommy-Lee Jones. Oh, Lois was also pretty hot. <br /> <br /> SFX is very sweet. I want to say that Superman was seen on the car ... MAN !, how cool! If it looks like the Tank scene in Grayson, maybe I have to put something above, because Mike looks like flying and easily. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch? Batmobile used! (It was a Probable Model, but looked damn sure)> Generally, the only collapse of this trailer was the absence of a serious budget. And WB Collora refuses to acknowledge the fact that Collora is a trusted Director and should be of some kind outside of a Project ... Yes, they will continue to get these hack directors (not just the majority of Marvel projects) but their fans they are careful and able to release these gambling films. Thank God, Superman Returns was a hit, or it would be a serious end. The world's best is perfect and in my book is considered a Superhero movie.
