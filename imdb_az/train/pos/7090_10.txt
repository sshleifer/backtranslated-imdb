Linear travel in nonlinear structure. This is a reality in 12 monkeys, of the time, the stream, the future, the future, and the past. But the linearity of the film can not be overlooked: it's a lot of projector's work, and it's a narrative. <br /> <br /> The essence of the temporal topic is that our actions are inevitable. This world of Terry Gilliam is a world with little space for free space. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cole's (Willis) mission is clear: to explore and return to anyone who is related to return. virus. There is no way to change the past: things that can be realized can gather information that can help scientists in the modern era (who, for us, will come), finds the cure. <br /> <br /> To change lives (past is inevitable), but make it better. <br /> <br /> Cole at the time of his "resources" is gradually approaching a terrible dilemma: his life is better in the past <br /> <br /> The latter is dark and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists who choose the "volunteers" (<br />) <br /> Scientists did not achieve the highest level of time travel and Cole ended up with incorrect dates - this is evidence of her health for psychiatrist Kathryn (Stowe) at the next stage. <br /> <br /> With the development of the story, we can see that linearity and non-linearity turn into circular temporality. <br /> <br /> From now on, there is already an event that is the first and finally the latter - and, of course, climactic - looks. <br /> <br /> At an airport a man is killed while he is armed, while he is armed. When talking about Cole's memories he changes himself. <br /> <br /> This is a scene that combines past (cole, where a child arrives at the airport with her parents), today (during the narrative) and the future (mature Cole) narrative, Cole has a sense of reality now experiencing the reality . His prophetic dreams prove that it is impossible to save or escape what has happened. <br /> <br /> Financial scientist, Dr. Peters (Morse), responsible for the spread of the disease, stopped killing him. <br /> <br /> What could not be changed. And in the case of Cole, what will happen. Eternally. <br /> <br /> A movie is not very well understood. <br /> <br /> For me, something that is not a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another good film on the subject is: The future trilogy (the "mindless scientist", especially in the second film, is more optimistic than Gilliam's work, namely Hollywood's single photo). <br /> <br /> "Wild strawberries", one of Bergman's masterpiece in another register <br /> <br /> I've never been to La Jet√©e, but because I can not find it.
