This is one of the best Talkies of Joan Crawford. This was the first Gable-Crawford pair and gave the MGM and viewers a clear look that was a charming team and took the studio together to capture more movies with them as a joint star. <br /> <br /> First of all, it convincingly shows the lower part of the brother and sister that after their father's stock market crash, they must earn money and work for life. Life is difficult in Depression and soon attempts to find a legitimate job wasted, and they resort to secular activities. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford turned into socialite-excellent as moll. Clever, complex, convincing. It even breaks the theatrical stiffness of other actors' "Talkie" style of action. Clark Gable is a diamond-in-the-box, man and blend, like no bullfight gangster associated with Crawford's character. That same year, he would play a more prominent and more successful role in Norma Shearer in "Azad Soul", which maintained his position as the best male symbol in the MGM. <br /> <br /> If you do not miss the "Paid" a year ago, this is also one of the best Talkie performances. <br /> <br />
