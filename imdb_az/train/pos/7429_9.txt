She is such an unusual singer who cares about something else! This is the final scene all the show is one of the best moments in the bar! I am glad that the camera kept it in ten minutes - it deserves a symbolic situation - it's the power of sound. <br /> <br /> When I was five, I saw this movie for the first time and had a great impact on me. <br /> <br /> Today I see, yes, I see some flaws (like the one who wants to leave the Grammy right as Esther's prize is announced). <br /> <br /> But some of the other user comments are just a bug - namely, where there is unequal nudity - maybe we've seen different films? <br /> <br /> The Streisand's ability to read is monumental, and if he has a great body, it is a penalty! <br /> <br /> He won.
