The excuse here is a nice movie. It was a guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan can shoot such films (another example, Joe to Volcano). That's why it makes some star stars. Walter Matthau, of course, has this ability and really makes himself a role-playing, entertaining, good-hearted Einstein. I think they are loved well, but when describing lovers they say good and good (curmudgeon loved by loving young women).
