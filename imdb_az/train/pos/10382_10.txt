Like all other reviewers, this film has been stable for 30 years. I remember going to the library exploring everything I knew about this story. Even for more information, I wrote to the PBS station. Despite all this, I realized that there was a story published in the newspaper in the early 1900's. <br /> <br /> By 2002, a fast weekend, based on the VHS copy of the movie. There was another contender, but I'm determined to win this movie. The lost bidder asked for a copy I gave him. Despite having a copy, I have still sought and searched for a DVD selling DVD copy.
