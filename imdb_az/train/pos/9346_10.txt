<br /> <br /> You do not hate this movie, either the dead, or Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> An excellent cast, all made good speeches. This film proved that Adam Sandler is a good actor despite criticisms. Adam Sandler becomes a very respected player. Everything began with the performance of Big Daddy, then drew a few bad movies, then 50 First History, The Longest Yard, Then Click and now broke with terrific performance in the Judgment. <br /> <br / Back to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who loses everything. She is the best family in the family and belongs to a mother-in-law and a mother-in-law. His old college-room (Cheadle) can turn his life away from him. I will not say it because I do not want to destroy the movie, but I am very happy about this movie. One of the best films of 2007.
