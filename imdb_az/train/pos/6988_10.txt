It is a movie that will give you time to go out after you see it. Dialogs are perfect, as expected from the game adaptation. The actors simply do their best, the story is simple and attractive. <br /> <br /> Yvon Attal is absolutely safe with his role, Sandrine Kiberlain is not a nice blonde (but not terrible), which is delightful to the eyes as it's ears, Jean's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul Rouve provides a perfect estimate of the overall trail (and proud of being) and Marina Fois is a dull friend who is always wrong when you least expect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If you like it, you can probably use "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances". Both were written and duplicated by Bacri / Jaoui.
