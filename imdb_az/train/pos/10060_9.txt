Wang Bianlian is an old street singer known for his skill as the "mask king" for Sichuan change art. Liang is a famous opera singer in Sichuan art, and respects Wang as an artist and a person. Liang is concerned that a valuable art should not die with Wang, and therefore sows the seed of a heifer to Vang's mind. Film prejudices, men's domination, art state, values ​​and, above all, heat. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. The whole movie is on the turns. Everything is important. The length of the film is only a mere 91 minutes long, a very good story. Overall satisfaction. It's a five-minute feature movie, the next five minutes is her sad movie, the next five-minute tension. Just changing the mood of the protagonist changes his face. The final scene on the rope is extraordinary. The story and script are flawless. Players are brilliant. Both heroes can explain both art and art. Very effective. Not a candidate for the Oscars. In that year, he won the 'Bestseller of the Year' film, Oscar, and 'Kolya' in the category of foreign films. The 'kolya' was just ok and was not much better about 'English sickness'. Follow 9/10.
