This is a perfect modern day cinema noir .... "excellent" that is interesting, ends with the start. There are some gaps here, and there are some doors that can be shaken by your head ..... But I did not find anyone who was not involved in this story. The film has the right amount of movement, decline, landing, and interesting characters. In addition, it features some beautiful colors and cinematography and a good guitar based soundtrack sport. <br /> <br /> I called this movie "movie noir" because it's strange and all the characters are not good. The only good person performed by Nicholas Cage is in such a tragic situation that he is in a difficult situation and he has a quick connection with them. It is not true, it does something at the end, but I'm going to fall down. <br /> <br /> Is there anything better than Dennis Hopper when talking about "bad guys"? Not much. At least in the category of "troublesome", it is difficult to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is entertaining to watch many reasons. J.T. <br /> <br /> Valls also gives you a great deal of support. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films that are not very popular. You will watch it. By the way, do not play this movie three times loudly.
