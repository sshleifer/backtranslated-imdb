A slow but beautiful story of the American Revolution. Griffith's storytelling appears less severe than his previous epics, and his desk work is fully integrated. Lionel Barrymore is a full pig, Neil Hamilton is poor, but lizard and Carol Dempster are good .... Carol Dempster is the one who is wrong with Griffith at this time, but often does not appear to slow down the drama and drama. <br /> <br /> Note that for the first time this trivia is released, it means that it's less than 2 hours, but it does not have more than 90 minutes. However, the dvd version was presented at a slower fps rate and increased tension and brought it back for less than two hours. <br /> <br /> Better news than good sound versions PATRIOT. Griffith's best way is to spend a few hours, though not in the league, like LAYLA DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS.
