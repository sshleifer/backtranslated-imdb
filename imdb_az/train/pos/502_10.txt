Okay, so it's been late for several weeks, but it's here. Basically, this is one of the expressions of various negative stratum. Starting with technology. Star Trek: While fleeing TOS, the special effect technology was at a very low level and, moreover, the crew had little money to fit every kind of wrestling. <br /> <strong> For the 35 years TOS has provided, Star Trek crew has been an expert in economics. <br /> <br /> Finally, in my opinion, they should leave the TOS appearance. That is, they decided not to pull the carrier out of golden glare or to see the pistols near Star Trek II closer. With regard to the first contact with the Klikon Empire, Kirk and Riker were thought to have been based on the commentary that Earth was only meeting the Clinton in 2200. Nothing was set up exactly. <br /> <br /> The most promising place we have been exploring for a while. Voyager was able to do it. No serial can develop without a few inconsistencies, but be thankful that Star Trek is too small. So leave the handle and enjoy it.
