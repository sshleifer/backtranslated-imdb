This cool Marvel super hero game, paying tribute to the comic fans. Spiderman improves both departments of all Marvel superhero games that are lame with weak graphics and gameplay. Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics, also has his voice. <br /> Spiderman as you would expect any spider can do. It does more than spin threads. In fact, they use them as weapons and shields. When you do not use the Internet in the fight, he also punches and strokes. Spidey Venom takes his hand fully when he fights to name a few, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Dr Octopus. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The only complaint about this game is that it's too short and may take up to three hours to complete. If you are a real Marvel superhero fan, this game is for you, but I do not expect long gameplay. Better luck at Spiderman 2. My rating: 10 to 9.
