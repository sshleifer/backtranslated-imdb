Why would I want to know why John Amos left the show and how he died of the show again? I could not belong to everything, but sometimes they came home with problems they were facing. By the way, did they get the ghetto? The episode with Black Jesus was my favorite. We will see them live a few good times. something they do not have. They will bring the show back. In the daytime, people can actually climb to watch. I do not think the movie or a new show will work. Especially without the original casting. They really did the Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank you very much!!
