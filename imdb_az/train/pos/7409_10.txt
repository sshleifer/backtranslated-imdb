I did not expect to see a "cute little movie" from China's mainland, and I was prepared poorly. The dynamics of the family, the community and the inevitability of changes are rarely studied in terms of kinematography. Each character is solid, and the whole story is drawn. The organization is more complicated to get to the American audience. However, while reading subtitles, there is no problem after development. Jiang Wu, a slender brother, is a constant shining light. Put cynicism into your locker room. Will be there when you go out.
