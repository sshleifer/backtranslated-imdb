I have not yet watched the movie, but I will not wait to see it! It looks very exciting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting trailers I saw: these questions really stopped me and I thought that a unique approach to the sport of boxing was a metaphor for "inside fight" ... another thanksgiving box to another god. This movie looks so fresh and smart. And the actor is really hot. In particular, I took a short clip from the Rocky movies with the actor, it was really clever. I thought that the chosen theme - the elimination of troubles and childhood traumas - is infinite, and God knows what many need. He brings it.
