A flying saucer, designed by a crew of up to 20 male space explorers, has flown hundreds of millions of light on earth to enter a colony of about 25 years ago on a "banal planet". The place they find is a robot that is imaginable on the face of a beautiful and completely sociable humble young woman and is the father of a hermit philologist who has been thrown far more than the devils of ancient civilization where they drown. <br /> This story on the surface pulpa scifi is the secret of crime. Some are comparing it to Shakespeare's strange, but this one stretches and somehow scary genre. What makes a scifi movie, how far is its The Tempest, but how many can you say about hundreds of movies? <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a clever tale about progress and technology and the social evolution needed for its proper and safe use. But the film still has hopelessness for the future, and we have come to expect from the show as Star Trek. <br /> <br /> Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described. Special effects, even aesthetics of backgrounds, are also strong enough to be inevitable directional and uneven. <br /> <br /> If you did not have retro-art deco-ness in the 1950s philosophical works, you watched a piece of 1960s. <br /> <br /> I do not want to call this a very special classic of the sub-genre of 1950s, and, in my opinion, this is certainly good for anyone interested in science fiction films and special effects. Now, the intelligent field with the height of the Star Trek, Space Lost and even the six or seven episodes of Farscape will retain the interests of the most respected and loved fans. Trekkers will be particularly interested in different aspects of the film, though they have been inspired by Star Trek's works published about 12 years later, but the genre (relatively soft) of the 1950s and all-inclusive race integration. I'm not saying nitpick, the lack of social progress in this film was a problem with it. <br /> <br /> Someone will likely see this movie just to catch one of the youngest, most beautiful Leslie Nielsen roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only average, sometimes low and right (especially in the film's galaxy). Walter Pigeon, though perfectly featured in other films, has a great influence on his role. Ms Francis, Earl Holliman, and the incredible Robby Robot are different actors in this band, and all character actors with the ensemble do a good job. Problems with digital output, I think, the director and editor are guilty. Even though the majority of the film is quite accurate.
