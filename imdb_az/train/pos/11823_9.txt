I love this truth to accept Dick Tracy's personality. It is a good product used by modern technology. If you've been an admirer of one of old Dick Tracy's b & w movies, or if you're closely watching, you'll be hit by one of those comments. Pastel colors and an exciting moment of life, with a larger epoch of life taken from the original way, it is fun as it should be. Personally, I find Madonna's music as part of this movie - I've been listening to CD from this movie for more than a year, it's just fine-tuned and played with music and adapted to that era. In my opinion, Madonna's screen is the best in terms of music. It is sure to bring "kids" for you.
