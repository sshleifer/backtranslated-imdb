Today's fantasy tricks, like the Rambo, are so funny in outer space (like the bursting sounds in the vacuum) with special effects. Despite the current standards, special effects of the "Forbidden Planet" were vivid in their time. Even today, they still have a purpose. The best part of the film, perhaps the radio heroes, still surprised. What you've been up to has been the view of the audience. (What made Krell creatures look like?) Most of the story's framework is never disclosed, or just the tension and endurance shot across the film when it's finally disclosed. Finally, he was very thoughtful and satisfied. In my opinion, this is still one of the best (at least the best) fantastic movies.
