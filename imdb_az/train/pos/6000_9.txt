Kristine Watts (Molie Week) breaks down, loses her boyfriend; can not overcome the love that is missing in the past. She takes on a strange job (Douglas Davis) and gives her a list of things that correct her mistakes. However, time is irreversible, and sometimes pain relief is a tragic outcome. <br /> <br /> The Cure is an elegant cinematography that combines the first point in black and white. The small and sharp scenario is capable of developing a tragic and horrible story of love for less than eight minutes with an unexpected plot point. The soundtrack is nice, but the volume is a bit higher, and English is not my mother tongue, but in a matter of minutes it was necessary to repeat some words that the narrator had whispered. What's happening is that the actress has a magnificent performance and is brilliant. There is a chance to see him again on the screen. Last, at least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri could not have been better. <br /> <br /> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;">
