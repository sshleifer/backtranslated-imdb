Mr Pinwar is a great movie by dwivedi. Its definitely the best and best in 2003. There are very good speeches in this area. Dwivedi knows what MAST can say from Urmila. he has never seen before. a real big performance. a wonderful player Manoj Bajpai showing Bollywood what is happening with him Bhiku Mhatre. The film is about a girl who lives in Pre-Partition Pakistani (Urmila). in a small town in a punjabi family. She is fighting for a while with her punjabi family, as she was kidnapped by a Muslim boy. after a few days, a series of twists and turns followed by a wedding organized by urmila. this movie is really a very good movie. The story is solid with a spectacular scenario. All the appearances like lillete dubey, koppikar koppikar (u can not believe, but can move next to jus dance about Khallas), laughs and more. pre-serving pacemaker, suits, cinematography, sound, sequences are added to the positive points. When you ask a question when you're up to the end of your head? This film deserves to be part of the film collection despite watchin value. the end of the final scene film. all this No-Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-gum-and-No-Language-To-Pagal-Hai crowd will offer you to watch this beautiful flick. my rating: 10/10.
