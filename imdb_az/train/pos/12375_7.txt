Based on the novel of the same name, this horror film, imperfect production and confusion draws amateur orientation, but still strange. Unlike shocking disasters such as The Exorcist, this film takes the viewer slowly to a grueling pool. Terrified, it only opens the audience with a sliding look like the same dream when looking at the poor girl who just was chosen to be the next screenwriter. His task is to sit at the gate of hell and not to be thrown into the world of evil. <strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ strong> <br /> <strong> There are flaws in the field that are not well-described and gratifying. This is regrettable. Sentinel, your seat is not a flick; it's worrying about a watch-and-squirm more. As a bad car accident, you have to look at it when it is unbearable. <br /> <br /> This movie is not all bad and still has the opportunity to shock. <br /> <br /> Christina Raines was seductive on a pedestrian in a clash between good and evil as the sensitive girl Alison who was under attack from both sides. Chris Sarandon looked at her, but eventually she was as good as her self-controlling lover. Eli Wallach and very young Christopher Walken are detectives who are fighting to uncover the strange puzzles they have given. Ava Gardner is as elegant as a realtor, who is unaware of the horrors hidden in the rental property. Older John Carradine is as good as deadly sentinel, which should be replaced by arthritis-twisted hands. The devil is played with the magnificent magnificent by Burgess Meredith; it's so sweet and still bad. There are future stars in this film: Beverly D'Angelo and Jeff Goldblum, like a poor girlfriend, Jerry Orbach plays as a crushing television director successfully against his type. Finally, the damned spirits are made up of real lanterns and strangers. <br /> <br /> When Alison opens a door and finds her father after finding her, the horror that accelerates the film is an unpredictable horror. with two slaves. He eliminates the first attempt of suicide, faces lesbians without a strange function, and sees a cats cut as a cake. With life and fantasy, dreams and waking sleep, there is no way to overcome, to overcome. In fact, the devil tries to get enough evidence to kill himself before becoming the next magician. Will it succeed? In summary, a very typical 70-horror film that is slowly yet imaginatively creepy, well-focused, but poorly directed and diminished before real shocks. (No pun intended) This movie may not work for those who have a short span, but still can still shake the waist back and still can provide some low key shock value. A striking and entertaining wave of Satan's righteousness.
