*** ALLEGATIONS *** Nakchivan and revenge half-aged Zach Provo, James Coburn, spent the last 11 years in a chain of traffic planning. <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br / Two prisons his Providence, who escaped after his murder, found out that he had gone to Yumaya, where his bachelor's daughter, Susan and Barbara Hershey, lived. Provo, who promised to give Brigade 30,000 dollars in gold coins, plans to clarify Bourdade's bloody revenge. <br /> <br /> In some cases, after witnessing her daughter being harassed by her relatives or witnessing that she has been in a state of frustration during a nagging season for a few years <br /> <br /> John Wayne In 1956, he resumed his search for a kid of the classic "The Searchers" in a dangerous India area for his kidnapped daughter. Charlton Heston is perfect in the role of aging and retired sheriff, so that Sam Bourgeydi, who is responsible for the killing of the Provo family, and then the same thing as Susan, daughter of the same thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Just as Susan and Provo give them a green light, they think they give a $ 30,000,000 worth of gold coins to break their paths and keep them. Susan's lover, Hal Brickman, Chris Mitchum, who accompanied Bourgade, proves that this is a unique thing, not only with her, but also watching fugitive criminals <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An incredibly pitiful and bloody horrible vote between Bourgoire and Provo, a lot. Provo who hated Bourgade suffered from a slow and heartbreaking death as he withdrew from insanity. It was hated by Bugrad and after taking half a bullet, it was terrible and blood thirsty, and away from the foolish, kindness!
