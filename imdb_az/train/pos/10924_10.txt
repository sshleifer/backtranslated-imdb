When I was a kid, I saw this kung fu movie and thought it was so cool! Now I'm 26 and my friend has a DVD! <br /> <br /> We did a brilliant event and watched this classic! He lost NONE from the original kung fu coolness! If you are an admirer of your kung fu / karate movies, you need to see ... DVD available. This movie is called "Choose Your Poison". <br /> <br /> See too much!
