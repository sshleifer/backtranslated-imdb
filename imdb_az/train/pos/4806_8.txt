A new approach to Victoria and Albert's story is brought by Jean-Marc Valle. Queen Victoria is thought of as a woman who has ruled for decades and mourns in her life. If Emily Blunt gives the audience a different perspective, she has more capabilities than her head. Victoria's youth, portrait of the rise of the throne and early years. Blunt's Victoria movie is fresh and limited. His most powerful scenes are Albert (Rupert Friendly) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). <br /> <br /> This is not a story of dramatic springs and histrionic "moving" moments, although the story is still interesting, but all actors are worth the look, including Miranda Richardson. There are several historic freedoms written on the screen, the film tries to keep in touch with the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and royal structure of the era. Open designs and costumes are superior. <br /> <br /> This movie will be most appreciated by date, drama drama and Blunt and other actors. <br /> <br /> Level: A
