Undoubtedly, the film had a great impact not only in the genre of friendship but also in the genre of action. George Lucas was forced to become an admirer of the Craze because the Star Wars series long ago respected the religion of Gun. The characters of Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks are Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca's precursors. Even Sam Jaffe's Gunga Din C-3PO and R2-D2 are either included or not: Jar Jar Binks. <br /> Today, this film is regarded as non-PC, but Eduardo Ciannelli's Guru, the leader of the opposition in India, will now be able to reflect the views of many people on the English race. <br /> <br /> This was a great movie for the young guy. Three strong men are just a romantic sign. There was a time when the young girls who kissed the girls in the movie did not have a mush. It's not like today when more skin is tastefully welcomed. I hope this movie will not be forgotten, and several channel surfing will stop at the TCM and will capture thousands of CGI instead of action, adventure and filmmaking. actors.
