Four years ago this film was dubbed by a French actress. <br /> <br /> In the first half an hour I was sitting in Hollywood's New Beverly Theater, who hated me, hated this movie, hated myself, and even hated a French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I do not know what's going on, but I have not been filmed for many years. And one of the projectors broke down and had to make every change. The theater was about four hours away, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I believe that big movies attract you to a world, it's part of it and then leaves you to chat with your friends in coffee or drink. This film did it. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
