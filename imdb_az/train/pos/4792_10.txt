Straight Story is a comprehensive study of America's goodness and beauty. A heartbreaking slow pedestrian march on one level, such as residents and amber grains, is another level (remembering and actively forgetting) of old-growing and important. David Lynch gives us time in this movie, and I can say with much calm that it helps to remember. A nice movie that will come in close contact with me for a while to come.
