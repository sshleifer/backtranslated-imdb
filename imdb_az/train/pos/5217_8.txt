I spent the night in the cables at night and I was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine the reason why this film is not well-known because the subject is very uncomfortable. But if you manage to deal with sexual abuse, it is a good, moving, suspenseful, and very exciting movie. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good. The subject is not for the weakness of the heart, though the film is not going to be cruel (eg 8 mm). <br /> <br /> Serial killer and shooting type films to those who love it.
