This is one of the most moral films I've ever seen. I headed the 150-person St George and this movie We found it at the headquarters of George's temple. A man had no eyes on the audience. In addition, there were some non-religious and anti-Mormon people who were attentive to the audience's experiences of re-experiencing the story of music and pioneers who had felt and listened to the film's spirit and their experiences. /> <br /> I'm here for the difficulties that the pioneers want and want to understand more about Joseph. This is different from American history.
