Like a wa petto one day is a cute story about a girl who finds a boy inside a box outside his apartment one day. He decides to bring him and make his cut. Then, after having to go to work, he eats some food to go home. When he comes home, he finds out that he is still there. She says she wants to live with her as her brother or brother. In desperation to abandon her, she says she would stay if she was at home. Like a pet, he says he will not have any rights and what he says. (this is not a devious way!) She agrees with her surprise, and then Momo is known as her pet.
