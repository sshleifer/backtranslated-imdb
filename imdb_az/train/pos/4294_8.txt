There was no dry eye between yesterday's afternoon after seeing a film in the house sold under the Hamburg film festival this year and leaving a movie. Tears are also a laugh. This movie was cheerful, there was no other way to say that. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat was very strange. <br /> <br /> <strong> Alain Chabat, if the event calls, a big clown is needed and serious. Performance was, of course, entirely above, but it did tell the story and how well it works. My favorite was Charlotte Gainsbourg, and her mother was also a very strong performance. Sisters could have been characteristic in nature, but there is nothing like that. When I dropped out of Hamburg under the rain, I spent a little afternoon seeing this movie and I wish the French films to be released on a regular basis in Germany. But distributors do not understand that French movies are the best in this country. At least I can not wait to find a DVD that has subtitles (Hello Australia! Please), because I need a home-made movie to watch it several times!
