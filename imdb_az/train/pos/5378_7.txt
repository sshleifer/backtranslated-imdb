It's a fascinating little flick with an area of ​​1967, a cool jazz twangy soundtrack that will make music and laugh ... OK, it's not really stupid, but it's fun with the cheese. I've seen a great deal between this and 'Blue Handshake' (AKA Bloody Dead) and has the same director! The Scottish Yard is the best in the college to investigate the killings of young women. It seems that criminals are leaving the local prison to return some of the bad guys and return after performing their job. There is a hidden device in the Holy Bible, and no other device that is concealed, it looks like a big pistol and should be where it was moistened before the end of the victim. Joachim Fuchsberger plays an Inspector and he stretches largely quietly and lasts a distance. There is a "monk" and everyone identifies me as a "monk", not in me, but in a red-capped red dress, a whip and dress carries a member of a different colored Clan member. There are all kinds of ugly installations like a fireplace quarry that turns upwards and downwards for adoption of the monk and burns from the plain and survives the firing of a rectangular trick. It is a heroic drama with a heroic drama, and sometimes it is very fun to watch. 10 out of 7 is not bad.
