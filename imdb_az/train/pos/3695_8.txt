I'm lucky enough to be in Stockholm for a show of this delicate, unpleasant and thought-provoking film. With romanticism as the heaviest arsenal in the arsenal, Paris je t'aime bravely embodies love in Paris, eighteen separate "quartiers", but Parisiennes and Sakarin formulas navigate different forms without pouting. Her gallbladder is undoubtedly caused by disappointment in the part of the directors. Frustration with only 5-10 minutes screen time? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> Instead, just about every filmmaker will be happy with his eccentric style and skills, and of course you'll find what you love. Although Gus van Sante wants to be introspective, LES MARAIS is one of the best contributors to a well-grounded Kurt Cobain. Coen brothers, one of the more accessible segments in Paris, silently but emotionally transparent Steve Buscemi, with deadly humor and intelligent camera angles, maybe have created the most laughter in my theater, and maybe it is. <br /> <br /> In this way, all the story lines are exquisite? From the minds of different directors? but Vincenzo Natali's cardiac DE LA MADELEINE, which is very different from the others, is a Gothic love that takes place as a tourist on a nightly night in Paris, a night-time voyeur-dominated role by Elijah Wood. In black-and-white format, but the red blood color, which is unusually broken through the screen, is roughly the same as Sin City? refreshing, heartfelt and visual shift in another reasonably-funded film. <br /> <br /> My only favorite segment was FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS, but by Tom Tykwer, I thought it was my love to my companion in the theater with him and I went to nudged with him, "Finally, here is my favorite filmmaker." Nevertheless, Tykwer's a blind guy is listening to a nice segment of the phone, and he does not hear from his girlfriend (Portman - not annoying), and does not hear his connection. Like the Tywker style, story, shouting and running (Lola Rennt) is the most powerful, frequent, kinetic and repetitive tool that organizes the most adrenaline pumps segment in Paris je T'aime and maybe Tywker is the most touching one after starting it? music. <br /> <br /> It is unclear to fill out a negative account, for all directors like Tywker, Van Sant, Cohens, Coixet and Dpardieu. Sylvain Chomet draws the bottom of the cliff with the trimming of the one-off segment that praises the story of a little boy's parents. They are two single mimes. This part of you is frankly French and it is a strange thing that it is an insult to international audiences. Suva also manages the poor and hairy segment with Juliette Binoche, the unusual brother-in-law of her son. There is nothing else. Finally, in the end, the closing of 18 stories and the mixing of each other fled somewhat, and they felt half-hearted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paris Paris This, of course, is one of the most important points of 2006 (probably not), and it is inevitable to choose a favorite and at least a favorite. <br /> <br /> I invite you to support up to 8 "ambitious" (hex) audiences
