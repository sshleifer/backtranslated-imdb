Do not be convinced that it is a tiny, charming little movie, but it's a very nice one. Gwyneth Paltrow, for this English accent, shines in this early showcase and is packed around the entire casting dialogue. It's around Sense and Sensibility when it's around and I'm sure she does not know why she collects all Oscar's attention. Emma Jane Austen's most accessible and the most magnificent story.
