I am very excited when Patrick Swayze finally returns to the actor's career with King SOLOMON'S MINES. I was looking forward to a great Indiana Jones action adventure. The thing I bought was 4 hours (with advertising) epic and it was very slow. The second and third hours could have fallen completely and the story would not be damaged. The last was good (there are no spoilers here), but I still wanted more. A good man is Swayze's "RoadHouse 2", so he can take it back to the genre of action that makes him famous. An admirer of King Solomon Mines is not too good to read a book or watch a 1985 version with Richard Camelin and Sharon Stone, but instead of just four hours of life, your life is only for hours and forty minutes.
