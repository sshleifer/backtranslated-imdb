I love this movie. Nairit images combining the spell of the spell, Mike Hammer works well to create excitement and rarely make rare feelings in early low-budget detective films. This can not be 'Malta Sahin', but this film will contribute to this genre. Spillane is often criticized for claiming misogyny and so on, but its way to their male colleagues in terms of 'dames' trickery and intelligence. Former Mike Hammer, as played by Biff Elliott, is corrupted by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist he met while examining his friend's death. Pennyi is finally a picture when he turns his face. It is good to see that censorship did not force the movie makers to throw the last line in the 50s. Loyal low budget classics.
