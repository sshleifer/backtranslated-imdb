Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very unique film run by animated pioneer Ralph Bakshi. It's a stranger to the cinema and worth seeing. As it turned out, the animated live action, as seen in response to this trail, was affected by Disney's legendary Song South. Philip Michael Thomas, the most famous of the Scythman Crothers, also known as The Shining in Kubrick, is a prisoner of war, including Miami Vice-President Don Johnson. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, Barry White) are friends of Thomas and plan to escape from prison. They are inside the lid in front of the police and Crothers tells Tom's story about a black hare, a bear and a fox that moves south to Harlem to find a more peaceful creature. The story is animated and offers many beautiful things to see. Like all the movies, most are uncomfortable and do not like animation. True animation lovers are proud of their magnificence and they love ingenuity. The film is very strange, very sexually and most of the battles are races. For a long time, I was thinking of watching something very important, but after a while, after looking at Superfly lines, an iron blacksploitation began to look more like a flick. It is very important and really does not say anything. Besides, Baku is not white? No matter what the answer, Coonskin / Streetfight is still worth the look of for animated aficionados and cult movie fans. 7/10.
