For the first time in the Subiaco cinemas I saw Ice Age, '02 after returning. I was only 13, but then I liked it. <br /> <br /> We've been filming for a couple of years and although you've looked at it many times, it will never be boring. It consists of an element different from all other 3D animations that have been made at the time - there is no special "home" left by characters. <br /> <br /> Each individual person on the surface resembles one another, but really good friends. Also, all the characters have their own attraction (even bad guys). Siddy, aggressive, over-compassionate and naive. <br /> <br /> <strong> Manny is a depraved, treacherous character, and something like that. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> Another beautiful thing about the movie is the animation beauty. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds to the feeling of the film is the fact that there is very little gender. There is no symbol of any woman, but you really do not understand until you've watched it a few times and even less likely to see the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite all this, Ice Age is a great movie and proves how much effort it has made. Shrek came out before 3d animations and The Incredibles.
