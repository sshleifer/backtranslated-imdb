No messages. No symbolism. There is no dark tension. Only a fine melange music, nostalgia and good entertainment are, of course, brought by people who have a great time. Some assertive garbage that is guaranteed by the studios is a refreshing antidote. Of course, everything is worth watching with unique Judi Dench. And Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz performance is a bonus. This woman is in the same league as the late Ella. When I needed this hot experience and needed a glamorous good-natured giggle, she filmed my film strip again. Just a nice movie!
