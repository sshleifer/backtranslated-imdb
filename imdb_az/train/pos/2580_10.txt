I say that the Domino principle is a very flawed film. We have taken the time to explore the history of compromises in our modern history; cfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and, in fact, many others actually knew that the dominoesman was actually talking about the principle. Tucker lee harvey oswald or james earl ray or sirhan sirhan or arthur bremer, even a couple of john hinkley or timothy mcveigh.to. The plot plot, which includes spyware, big business and political assassinations, is really a fiction, it is part of our rooted existence history. The sky helps us, but the domino principle is more than fantasy. This causes a little loss of sleep, maybe I have no say in it. , explore yourselves.
