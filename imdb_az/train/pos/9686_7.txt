A sentimental story with a sensitive voice stroke. About a little girl (with sound barrier), treasure her green parrot Paulie. The mud is like a human being and speaks and gives advice and advice to his constant companion. <br /> <br /> Paraghan is definitely the star of the movie. Depression and sometimes rarely, the bird takes the most comprehensive and expressive mood. A synchronous sound works very well and you believe this intelligent little bird is in a minute or two minutes. <br /> <br /> Early in the film, his father gives a pawnbroker a bird and tells the next scenes the story of Paulie's reunification with the meter of a long-standing struggle for many years. Many memorable scenes are encouraged to spy on those who fall into a bad company and use automatic wire-machines. <br /> <br /> Paulie has this phenomenal memory. <br /> <br /> The latter is predictable, but someone else wants. Kids will love this movie, and anyone who takes a bird like Paulie's antiques will be delighted.
