When I came out in 1995, when I saw this movie through a free choice of theater, I was totally ill and glad to see it. I was sorry to talk to many people I saw later and to be completely disappointed and how it ended up. On the other hand, I felt completely different. I am totally satisfied with everything. The people I talked said they were talking too much! They were no longer unhappy about the fate of the two characters in the last left. I have found painful evidence that these observations are absurd and that the majority of American filmmakers do not want to watch the movies easily. mixed. They also have spoon-feeding neat endings - happy or sad. It hurt me. No one wants to protest now? And when it comes to ending (and I do not want to be spoiler), I am fully satisfied because I know that these two characters will see each other again in my heart. About your personal belief in romance and destiny. This is a very personal movie, not talking to all people. But he talked to me. Give me a chance! Be patient! Richard Linklater has prepared a beautiful movie with a beautiful story against the beautiful background of the city of Vienna. Watching, you feel like you're watching the streets along with the symbols. You also spent yourself on the Eurail passage through Europe. Very intimate. Plus, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are doing a delicate job to bring a complex scenario. Some parts need to be improved and work well. They have a great chemistry in their roles. In the beginning, the outsiders who are involved in recognizing each other are very disturbed by their dissatisfaction and can feel romanticism and relationships as the film progresses. I feel that this is a very personal matter for Mr. Linklater and I am grateful to him for getting this movie. It definitely touched me and I hope this will touch others more. Bravo for romance!
