"Xizao" is a tale about conflict of contemporary life and ancient traditions and its impact on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu) is a returning businessman who believes that his father, Liu (Hu Zhu), died of a letter sent by his brother, Er Ming (Wu Jiang). <br /> <br /> How does the film learn about the centers around the Ming family and the importance of its law? his father's work always thought of an ancient tradition that had to die in a short time. Also, the film explores Er Ming's challenge, the problems of the small community, and the place where the bath is not only the body but the soul. <br /> <br /> The two main topics of film, family, and progress are incredibly well developed and can never lose the point that the movie itself is trying to do, both issues are well developed and we look at Chinese society and customs sources. /> <br /> The director, Yang Zhang, tells the story fairly simple, allowing symbolic characters to do the job. It's a very simple approach, but it's perfectly suited to the movie, and I doubt that another style will fit this good movie. <br /> <br /> According to the artist, the Age has a great potential that can explain a story without visual light or camera recommendations. <br /> <br /> The natural approach of the toy is outstanding, everyone behaves very naturally, and if they are real people, the film is shot. <br /> <br /> Even if the film is heroic, like the "old days are much better" message, it does something. <br /> <br /> <strong> As the change is good, the progress is good and we need to act, but we should not forget that we came here and have a balance between contemporary life and old traditions. <br /> <br /> And touching the movie. 8/10
