The cat and the mouse take part in ordinary chases when Jerry goes into a dive in an invisible ink bottle and detects it. Instead of spying on a single room or something that changes a girl's mouse, Tom uses the invisibility of the new agenda. And though it's a bit of a joke cartoon, it's pretty funny and very inventive. Movement never leaves the inside of the house, which is usually a feature of the medium T & J shorts. It is still worth 7/10. <br /> <br /> But I am not sure that an invisible mouse can shade over the wall, it opposes physics and an unprecedented nature.
