An interesting blend of comments on how difficult it would be to add something exciting. But, I will try. It was a very good action movie with some fabulous pieces. I will note that the genre is shown. I did not shout about the lack of character, but I did not respect the player. For people, why not enjoy the animation above the average movie? I can go, but I wrote my comment.
