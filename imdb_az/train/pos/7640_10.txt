Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 Stars <br /> <br /> Mr. Destiny's is the subject of many films covering many different years. His theme is the same, more serious and dramatic concept that works in his work "This is a beautiful life" (see "Scrooged") and "A Christmas Carol" as described by Charles Dickens in Scrooge's story a few centuries ago. <br /> <br /> It involves an ungrateful person who leads a life-guided tour and witnesses his first-hand life. <br /> <br /> In most of these films, an angel of guardianship can save a person from ungratefulness and show him how he or she may be. In this case, we are shown by a businessman named Larry (James Belushi). She lives with a very loving husband (Linda Hamilton) and rejoices in a bigger sense of humor, but she was convinced that her life would be better if she was in the state championship in the middle school year. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This little moment of his life remembers because his subconscious side is great , but I doubt if one of the elders would want an actor from the middle school. Anyway, when Larry went home from work overnight, when he was retired with John Lovitz, the hi car was broken. A pay phone enters a bar and asks for information on how the life of a bartender (Michael Caine) has come to an end. <br /> <br /> This bartender, in the first place, listens and bites, without worrying about any other customer. It is likely that the stick is old and curved, but it seems that no other person has been occupied by any other than the two. In fact, Larry even makes a comment about not seeing the bar at first. This is probably because of a certain reason the audience waits for Larry. <br /> <br /> Thus, Clarence's Larry's special drinks, like the bartender of God, can be seen as an angel's angel, revealing what his life is like, putting Larry's life on. he had fled home all year ago. Larry, however, had no idea of ​​any change at first, as Jimmy did not know that Stewart would not survive after Clarence had gone to death and lost his life, until Larry went home to make any changes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Linda did not get married to Hamilton, but instead married Rene Russo and settled in a great place with the children. He knows that John Lovitz is no longer a friend, but his worker. And the most striking fact is that with her new life, Larry has always wanted to do ... she loves her after her ex-wife, Linda Hamilton. Sometimes money and a great, yet still quiet, spouse does not constitute a clever spouse and everything in a person's life, such as his love and true happiness. "It's a wonderful life", "Mr. Destiny" shows us that the life of a person creates life and that everyone is influenced by people, shows us that there is nothing in the spiritual wealth of material wealth, "Mr. Destiny" Time is not a very unpleasant thing, but it is never too unpleasant, memorable, and really sweet. a sweet, kindling comedy that does not take him very seriously. Like "Family Life," the problem with this "beautiful life" is trying to be as effective and memorable as "It's a beautiful life". But only a few times we can overcome a magnificent movie, and Mr. Destiny knows it and plays the truth. It does not work because there is nothing; On the contrary, this is something that has not been tried and it is clear to the audience. <br /> <br />
