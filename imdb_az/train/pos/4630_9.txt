This is the second Eytan Fox movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> In this film, Lior Ashkenazi also plays a small role as a fantastic actor in the Water Walk. But real stars are young Israelis living together in a small apartment - Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinian left them - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). <br /> <br /> There are many Friends / Sex in the city (mostly gay) and they all want the war to end, so they can continue their lives peacefully. <br /> rub. No matter how many poster you are talking about or you are very satisfied with the peace, the war will not end. Many have tried to bring the two sides to the table for years, but they just want to continue for whatever reason. There are many in the Israeli side, both in there and in the United States, just wanting it and not thinking about peace. There are many Palestinian sides, as it seems, will come out of a job that needs peace. No one is interested in ending this war and children suffer. <br /> <br /> It is always in your mind when you watch this funny and attractive movie. It can not go. You know that something catastrophic will happen, and of course it does. The tragedy always happens when revenge on the strengths and motivations of both sides, and this is a great version of Friends / Sex in the city. No advantage. It was a real life and a wonderful thing to see.
