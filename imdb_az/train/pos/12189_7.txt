Despite having liked Rita Hayworthy, she had not done much for me in Shanghai, who was able to evaluate some of the symbolic "symbolic" aspects of cinematography, finding the last few series of the film. I had problems with the majority of speeches, scripts and general structure. And in most cases, this is a pretty big problem in a chatting movie. The Shanghai lady was very low for me, "C", or seven. <br /> <br /> Shanghai lady is really about Orson Welles's character, Michael O'Hara. O'Hara sees Elsa's "Rosalie" on a ride on the central park in Bannister (Rita Hayworth) and shoots it. Later he goes out of the theft and gives him a glimmer. O'Hara, a sailor from Ireland and Elsa, wife Arthur (Everett Sloane), gets a yacht with a very famous and powerful California lawyer. He said that, despite Oha's initial orders, they are talking about working for them, so Elza looks for the audience and does not want to join O'Hara. <br /> <br /> Shortly after working on the bed, a strange man, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), who says Arthur's partner, appears in a port of call and begins to trouble himself. Finally, Grisby asked O'Hara to have a very suspicious and dangerous scheme. Unwise, O'Hara agrees. Of course, it makes him a little worried and as a result some secrets are emerging. <br /> <br /> Maybe the problems with the movie are still in vain, so far I'm not exactly Orson Welles's great fan, and produces, writes, guides and consumes most of the time here. I did not see anywhere near most of Welles's work, but when there was a bit more campus and performance, I was inclined to improve her subsequent films. When I insist on giving fake F for F (Vérités et mensonges, 1974) and I was insisted that even a charming baccarat table be allowed to do magic tricks, Casino Royale (1967) was kind of like her performance, but Citizen Kane (1941) had never been to me , despite the fact that over the years I could not afford four (about a year ago, my rating was below 7 - the same as my current account for Shanghai Lady). <br /> <br /> Welles' performance and dialogue for her are found to be effective and ambitious for me. He has a motormaut, a little smoke and a little monotonous - he does not want to sound like he's singing. His performance was recorded by Moody in "IMDb in 1999," in 1971, "After The End", Orson Welles: The One-Man Band (in 1995), he just read the camera and sublimely it seems dramatic. <br /> <br /> In some cases, she does not clarify this issue either. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, Hayworth did a great job. Of course, it is not beautiful, it does not hurt. Here's a multi-eyed candy. Like Welles, Sloane was a little impressed and ambitious for me - I did not like his character, his handicap, and so on. I have not bought it and Anders is strangely unmanageable. Welles often shoots near his drawers and Anders almost always has some over-exaggerated, manic expression on his sweaty face. <br /> <br /> Structure, Shanghai lady is very inadequate. The first 50 minutes or so is extremely soft and soap operative, although the soap opera ministries tend to use a complicated obstruction. After Grisby presents his scheme, things will go up a bit and improve as they get closer to the end. However, when the Shanghai lady becomes a murder / mystery movie, it is too late and suddenly turns into a drama in the courtroom before the excitement, and is relatively soon too soon Exclamation. <br /> <br /> In the end, more action-oriented, less dialogue, more varied and exotic, and sometimes quite abstract. Welles, as the author, manages the material essence. If there were many mixed combinations of the murder / marijuana and the latter of the Shanghai lady, she could easily have at least one. 9. The final scenes can be easily 10s as Welles relocates on a Hitchcockian backdrop scene. San Francisco's Chinese opera house is on another excitement scene in the Chinese entertaining park. This yard area uses cinematography that is experienced in time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Blocks scenes with Welles skill. From Central Park to Acapulco, there are attractive film shoots from various San Francisco locations. Welles are effectively deployed from Acapulcon's high altitudes and sedimentary drops, like the maze-like Caribbean streets, the fine-framed and silhouettes of the San Francisco Aquarium, and so on. It creates symbolic backgrounds for some activities. The romantic material served by the aquarium as a background creates a sense of confusion throughout the film, and on the other hand romance will never work as romance. <br /> <br /> Of course, serious Welles fans will appreciate the Shanghai Grandmother than me and, of course, if you love Rita Hayworth, it'll take about an hour. In my opinion, the Prince of Prince is not exactly a terrifying movie, but the "passing" is in danger. Continue with care.
