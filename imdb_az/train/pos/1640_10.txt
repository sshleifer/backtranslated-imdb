"Heartland" is a beautiful illustration that I really would like to live on the border. Hard work and personal strength needed to get rid of climatic discomfort and lack of medical care are mixed with the interaction of peers and settlers. The drama was particularly meaningful because the storytellers are still based on the diaries of real people who live there. It was nice to see the real people living in the west. No one was glamorous or just had a meeting with a make-up or costume department. Conchatta Ferrell is just beautiful. An example of powerful, courageous people who came to Wyoming early in the 20th century and have no difficulty in a new land.
