Jane Porter has come to shrink from Tarzan's hidden remote jungle to Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) and his wife Martin (Paul Cavanagh) TARZAN, APE MAN, who was seen for the first time in the APE MAN "Elephant Cemetery" for elephant bone gold ... just as soon as we get both We discover that they hide the intentions of man ... ie Jane. Tarzan will stop for this? It is not possible (in fact, Tarzan will not be opposed to any Elephant cemetery), and Jane, who later came to believe that Tarzan and his party were in the worst world after knowing that Tarzan was trying to remove Tarzan from the picture, with the intention of the tribe ... Is Tarzan sufficient and able to reach them in due time? <br /> <br /> This film is full of scenic loads facing Tarzan and other wild animals, and is a rapidly spreading summit that keeps track of the audience. The cruelty shown to the animals and the description of the indigenous population today can be disturbed by some, but it must be reminded that these are mostly fantasy adventure entertainment and should not be taken seriously.
