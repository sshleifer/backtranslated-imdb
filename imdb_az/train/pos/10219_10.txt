When a wealthy tycoon was killed in a plane crash, Spinster did not believe his twin brother, Martha Craig (Madge Kennedy), was detained in a suicide diver (even though he himself was in the family), the girls could not care less. Valerie Craig (Kathleen Hughes), a pilot, Jim Norton (John Bromfield), an angry sister, Lorna (Sara Shane) and family lawyer (Jess Barker). Another sister of Valerie Norton wants to deceive Lorna when the advent of Nymphet Vicki (Marla English) does not prevent her, but when Norton gets rid of her plans, she is thrown into a trunk. All bets, like the world of fraternity, heroism, attraction, suicide, blackmail, murder, Mann's Law, double-cross, disorder and poetic justice - despite the appearance of the "Craig Manor" sea ... <br /> <br /> This defective bucket, Since 1956, WRITTEN WRITTEN has created a second feature perfect.

THREE BAD SISTERS recently appeared on the big screen as part of the Palm Springs Film Noir Festival, but the jury was still cleared of soap bubbles ... aw hell, this noir ( 5/10).
