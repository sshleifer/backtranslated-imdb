Indeed, there is understanding: If you are easily insulted, you may want to get away from it. There are some painful moments in the film, but I probably mixed it until I laughed. Actually, I've been thinking about laughing. And if I did not have a flair outside, then I was in the mood. In this movie you are embarrassed that there is absolutely nothing, there is simply no embarrassment. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;" > by topic. I said, "This movie is not fun, check it out!" <br /> <br /> Some cute, old-fashioned church leaders are heading to the theater, and graphics are exposed to heart attacks in one of their open sexual situations, and that's a good thing that's not in my conscience. <br /> <br /> How is it flawless? Hmm, try 100 times worse than Toy Crashers. Honestly. My mother would be on the first stage. <br /> <br /> There are some great comedies, but this is what I'm expecting from a person holding his hand (Judd Apatow). but also Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all enjoying Michael McDonald; a white-colored single man to give Kenny Rogers the money and his beard.

I find that the subtle, clever humor f-word or fratboy sex discussions are about 200 uses are very entertaining. But it is me. As I said, there are some strange hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself, that they are sitting in one of the most vulgar films you see in the theater.
