Brosnan's performance is far more realistic than the original James Bond novels. He is neurotic, paranoid, alcoholic, and hammer. This is a great defeat for you to have fun gardenlike. "I'm a mess, I'm a parody of myself," he says. There is nothing better than this. I just finished reading Dr.No and it was how much Ian Fleming described James Bond. Personally, I did not like Brosnan as Bond, because she is closely following the symbol. Compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery, there was nothing to personalize the character. Brosna's vision is, in fact, a luxurious way of looking at the wall. A simple character who wants to come up with an understanding of deep emotional and psychological issues, there is no background. This is an effective illustration and Greg is only poetic by Kinear's putting it down. This movie reminds me of a certain dynamism among the main characters in my "Blue Heaven", but it's more authentic in their leadership mechanisms.
