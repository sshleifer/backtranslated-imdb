Like the Pagan, it is necessary to say that this movie is of little importance to any Magickal. This is a "entertaining" wizard film and does not mean to teach us anything, but love is the most powerful Magick ever and should never use it under control or vengeance. <br /> <br /> This film was written in beautiful style and dubbed by Kim Novak and the mighty Jimmy Stewart. <br /> <br /> Hermione Gingold, Bianca, Elsa Lanchester offers the perfect performance (with many movie credits to celebrate except Marilyn Jane Marbles's "Death with Death"). Novak's was as beautiful as the ungrateful, invincible high-level neighbor Queenie. He also plays a leading role with Jack Lemmon (beautiful performance) and Jim Kovacs (brightly witty). <br /> <br /> "The witches can not cry, why do not they shed a tear filled with Magick's hearts?" Queenie does not have the foolish things like love. <br /> <br /> Gillian Holroyd (Novak) and his brother Nicky (Jack Lemmon) Manhattan witches. They were deeply hidden in Craft's secret underground, and they lived as one of the other New Yorkers. <br /> <br /> But then the Shepherd Chandler Henderson (Stewart) comes to a businessman who is engaged in marriage with an old college rival, Gillian, who is patient, sluggish. <br /> <br /> For a fortunate luck, he drives himself to Gillian's building and immediately "charms" with his charm and grace. Gillian Pewacket (by Gillian's introductory, Robert E. Blair's training) and Queenie, with some help, Gillian has come to this new dream to return to his old enemy. starts working on the person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But Magick should never control or hurt, and Gillian learns that the hardest way to go. He must not face what he has done, but only face the sin of the Shapha. <br /> <br /> From a critical perspective; However, the film takes a serious turn: The effects are written much on a clean camp. Some images were shot in the basement of some of their smaller houses, but at least the characters were quirky and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Pyewacket stole a show in a private note. Big cats! Great training by Robert E. Blair. <br /> <br /> Like a note on Trivia, it's roots for your favorite TV sitcom loved. It introduces the original Samantha and Darrin. All notes of the note are available and calculated. <br /> <br /> This is for me to see myself. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites and I often follow him. <br /> <br /> This movie is 9.1 / 10. .. <br /> <br /> Opinion:.
