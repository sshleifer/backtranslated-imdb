For the first time, the director (Bromell) gathered a small but powerful fortress to fight with an average, middle-aged, depressed man and his father. In less than 90 minutes, this film presents a very interesting contrast in human nature. David H. Macy's 6-year-old son, David Dorfman, is the most animated small player I've ever seen. Macy is brilliant in a part written by a person who is subjected to torture by his father and his work. Seeing Donald Sutherland is always beautiful and beautiful here as Macy's ugly father. An alternative audio piece of the film is worth it to explain how the director chose, filmed, and filmed. The main dolby 2 channel sound is enough for this movie and is well-marked. Cinematography creates a mood in a very subtle musical background. Any movie buff or human nature observer, especially if you have a fan of that controversy, you will enjoy it.
