I did not see the BSG, I tried to watch it in the middle of the show, but I could not get it. But when I saw Caprica Rebirth, yesterday I was a little lost, so I decided to watch the Pilot today and I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> Sometimes it's very important for me. <br /> <br /> But I love the hard BSG fan to figure out what's going on in Caprica. <br /> <br /> Since the BSG has reached more men, I have been working on the network and trying to reach the female population and at least worked in my situation. <br /> <br /> Along with this, start the show with the Pilot.
