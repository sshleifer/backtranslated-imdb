I do not know if Clive Barker's betrayal is the best horror game ever. I played the Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Evil Dead and Castlevania, but none of them have captured the pure glee that solves the terrifying elements of this game. Barker is good at what brings terrifying things to the world and shows it as open everywhere in his hands. Heck is in the game where he is one of the main characters of his voice. A good atmosphere for sincere images and enough atmosphere to shake up, Undying is the game to beat the name of the best horror in my books. I want it to be a console system, but very bad PC sales are bouncing off the budda.
