Disney (and, of course, nice people at PIXAR) offers a beautiful, stunning story combined with the best of computer animation. I know that the faces of the mistakes were less static than Antz, and there were only four legs ('Antz' in six ...). But the backgrounds were superior and the animation was breathtaking. But this is an example: there was no such a successful computer: the man behind the car that adds a nice twist that I missed at Antz. Some of the points were, of course, "bloopers" at the end, which was extremely entertaining and original (hence, look at the end, it's worth it!). The "completely grounded" line was designed for a more careful viewer.
