Probably the first time I saw this movie in 1995. I've been back many times since then. This is amazing! Especially the first and second clips, such as "Creation" and "Rising culture." Amazing! Wow! CG animation was so cool in the days of glory. CG is older than I am, and I know that "Tron" was made seven years before my time. But this movie was a place in the early 90's. It was probably the first collaboration of various CG experiments in music. I love it, but I will follow it right now. Bye
