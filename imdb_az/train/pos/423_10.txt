I just read a summary of the plot, and this is the worst thing I have not read. It does not justify the incredible movie. For a good summary, read the "Turner Classic Movies" list. Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies. My sister and I can not wait until April, when we see T.V. It is one of the best horse films of this time. One of the great classics that the whole family can follow. Romantic is pure and pleasing. The story line is interesting and the songs are great. They are not filming anymore. It does not move well. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are the best in combination with many other great actors.
