The old collection of stories creates a difficult challenge for the production team, this classic character can grow up to date and is quite exciting to catch up with its new audience. In my opinion, their mission is over. A must have for young children, adolescents, adolescents and their parents. Okay, there are a few moments of scary moments, but parents with young children should sit tight, the film is focused on better things. I will review this clever user who emphasizes that Emma Roberts presents or presents a positive role model for young women. Nancy balances her femininity with thoughtful discovery skills. Here's a lot of laugh to love, does not take it seriously, and the true mystery to solve (you can imagine yourself as an added bonus and see it as an unpleasant symbol) Nancy Drew even makes a good history movie in my opinion.
