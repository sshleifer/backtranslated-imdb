Gene Wilder's "Question Women (1999)" is a well-known mystery drama reminiscent of the old black and white Raymond Burr Perry Mason series. Both Perry and Cash Cash guessed me until the end. There were many suspects on the grounds of the crime, but I did not know what character would be. <br /> <br /> Gene Wilder is perfect for her in facial expressions and vocal sounds. Part of the movie that actors acted very well. I'm sure this is an additional problem to avoid shooting. I'm not surprised to see some of the movie's writings done. It was even a pleasure to read. I love him more than the old "sillier" role as "Young Frankenstein" and "Willy Wonka". I hope the A & E will continue this series. They can say something like "A & E Gen Wilder Mysteries". <br /> <br /> Music time is appropriate. I'm delighted with the cool live combo and swinging melodies. I first explained that we were seeing a flashback or that the action was at that time. And I do not accept the need for the script to flow into poverty. <br /> <br /> Generally, my husband and I have begun a second good preparation for this second, and we hope that others will be the same - as we all love the other: Raymond Burr's Perry Mason.
