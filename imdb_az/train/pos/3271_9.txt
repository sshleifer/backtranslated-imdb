I've always been a great admirer of this movie, first of all, you see the role of art, the player is very nice and this movie helps you to act very well. Sibyl Choban's role was greatly appreciated, and they were also honored. The beginning of this film begins when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill), when his wife Louie suddenly dies when a picture of a perfect marriage breaks down. Fortunately, Louse becomes a second shot in his life when he is received as "new" as the newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). When Corinne is trying to get her, Alex continues his new life by forgetting his past life. But the fate of Alexs, which met 23 years after Corinne's daughter Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and enriched with unwanted memories (this is fun and embarrassing). The music is great and the scenes felt heart and I was very sweet. If you give a chance, you will be disappointed, Chances are you like it. Very funny and sweet!
