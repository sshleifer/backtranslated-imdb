I must completely agree with other comments on this film. Visual effects complete the film's supernatural theme and are not limited to trickery. Moreover, because I love this action different from Crouching Tiger, this time it was the most time the sword was not added to any wire and the action was recently seen. <br /> <br /> I think the western audience will be very confused with two scenes. One of them concerns villagers who say that one of them is trying to burn himself, and the other is the end of the world. The scenes arise from some explanations of Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea, and Japan) and the other area deals with a quirk of Japanese calendar ... people then really think about the future of the world until the end ... Gojoe, to any audience it has action, story and visuality to admire. I firmly believe that some skillful editions can be sold in the United States. One complaint is in the last battlefield (no apologies - sorry).
