I loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone for a good time. Do not take the entire movie very seriously because it's fair enough to recall that it's Disney. Some parts can be admitted by adults, but the "triangle" Valet Alonso, who is faithful to children, especially Cruella, Le Pelt and Cruella. Glenn Close is fantastic and really Cruella himself and he is incredibly terrific, though he is "cured" of his hauser-loving ways, he can scare the audience with his shrills full of shaking the theater. (I even found myself when I sat in my surprise with "bipolarity" like a dog who loves Ella). Despite all this, I'll be back in theaters, and I am very glad.
