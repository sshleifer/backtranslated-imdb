Many run away from Hollywood's concept. If hero heroism stimulates a child's mind, within the boundaries of the law, let me confirm the lessons taught by Doc Savage. <br /> <br /> Every conflict or war will decorate the public and government heroes. The cinema industry brings the heroes to the screen for recognition as people's Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage is remembered by James Bond, Superman or more than any of the "Best of the Best" by many generations. Anyone who follows Doc Savage is just a part of the character, not the "Brain Man".
