This is a great movie for any fan of Hong Kong action movies. In addition to this small plot, weak drama and comedy antics, the film is an action packed with gun-fighting and martial arts action. It was fun to me from beginning to end. I thought Shannon Lee was awesome in the movie. <br /> <br /> Being an actor, like Corey Yuen, makes Hong Kong's movement stronger. This modern action movie is at a high level!
