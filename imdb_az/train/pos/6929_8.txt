The third or fourth time ENCW last nite saw this flick. I was very pleased to order DVD. This is, of course, the first of the Mann-Stewart associations. Although it's as powerful as the callers, it's more than ever before. Many men are characterized by symbolism, but mostly by Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters, and Waco Johnny Dean-Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (not Joker) may be a hero who is interested in Lola, but very yellow. Like Stewart, the man who killed the Valance Liberty practically reduced the aprons to give coffee to his enemies. Undoubtedly, Decaf. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > <BR> <BR> Rick American Cafe is a very low-grade Western version. No one wants to spend the night there. Jay C. Flippens performs on a kiss from Lola (Winters) and has beautiful scenes before Stewart gets in the River and Far Country Bend. Wyatt Earp and Indian Chief Walter Brenna's teeth are waiting for good intentions. It's Wayne and Scott, not just Stewart, but a kind of western. It's worth throwing, I repeat. :-)
