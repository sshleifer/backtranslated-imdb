Although I did not love Stanley & Iris as a movie, I was amazed at the player. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are great in this film. I have not always been an admirer of Fonda's work, but here at the same time is subtle and powerful. De Niro has the ability to make every role that describes the functioning gold. It is a great performance in this movie, and there is a great scene that has to take her father to her elderly home. Because he is going to break his heart. I will not really recommend this movie as a great kinematic entertainment, but I would like to say that you will not see a lot of bits on anywhere.
