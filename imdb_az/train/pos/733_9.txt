How nice can go wrong with Ramones? Two of them have already died. It reminds Dennis Leary's jokes about the great musicians who died in fires in the kitchen while living indefinitely. <br /> <br /> ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL describes the story of a group of disenfranchised children struggling against school management. There are many stupid things, but if it's refreshing (even if they apply for a breeze), there's optimism. Who knew that this would really create anxiety for students in different countries around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a capsule of a time when people are convinced that their music is important and that they can make a difference to a larger society. Children who know their purpose are full of responses. <br /> <br /> So, it's just a rock-roller and something that can be trusted. <br /> <br /> But the most important thing is that it is pure abuse. Just go and have a good time. If this is not the case in secondary school life of the 70s, it should be.
