This movie took me with a full surprise. I watched it 2 or 3 times. I liked this movie very much. There were many truths from this film. I also love all the characters in this movie. This film gives a lot of meaning because the society is "growing more". Lack of commitment. I really can talk to this movie from my child's head and will never come back or never become my life. This movie is my best 5 movie. Whenever I watch the movie and the truth that is needed to get it right I feel like I am. The creators of this film have done a great job and I liked this movie very much. This movie may not be for everyone, but I think you'll love it if you have an open mind.
