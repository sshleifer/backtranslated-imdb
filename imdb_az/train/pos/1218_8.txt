This animated movie was strange, but the story had more depth and feelings than other cartoons. We have a daughter in an incredible camp, and we're not a friend other than a few brothers and sisters. He reaches the end, and when the opportunity arises, he deals with Satan with the devil, in the true sense of the word. I found this movie to be very true to life, and when things just did not get worse, we saw that the girl saw what she was doing, and then it changed, and then it changed, and then this dark, mysterious creature helped her to learn the human quality. The twins also help the little bears to get better and then value themselves. A very positive message for children, although some of the film's features were strange, it was a pretty good movie and it is still. Stephen Bishop (Tootsie's songs) made the movie better
