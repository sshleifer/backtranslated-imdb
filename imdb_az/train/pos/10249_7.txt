<br /> <br /> Guinea is one of the premier outputs and one of the more sophisticated films released from the pig series. <br /> <br /> Finally, I took a lot of time to get my hand off and give my hand a copy. this is a malicious movie band. I bought a set of guinea pig set and decided to watch the collection based on the date of the release. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to seeing what I read on the internet and the contents of this movie, so that I could fully overcome my frustration. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of people who have been kidnapped by a woman who have been abducted in the hope of discovering a breaking point. <br /> <br /> Is a sick sounds like a flick? It's wrong. The film will not shock. <br /> <br /> It may have been a year that I started to hate sensitivity, but I think that any truth can easily sit. <br /> On the other hand, individuals who are well-versed in this kind of film are likely to be drowned and surprised by the images they see on the screen. Although the film does not shock me, there are some pretty dramatic and graphic scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> Generally, I think that in most of these squads you have to take your hands together. for the novelty of this movie, but for those who come to any new movie, I think you should work in such a way for such films.
