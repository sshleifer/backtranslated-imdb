I liked one of the best "Amitabh recycling" films. This stage was when it went strong with Govinda Dhawan. It was awesome when we called the "masti" type. Multiparty Anupam is a story writer similar to Kherin chips. The story is Davidei Dhawan's very entertaining twists and circles known for the potatoes. Mrs.Madhuri's "Nene" Dixit, with a timely appearance, ended in a total conflict. It was great to see Amit perform such a force and humor after a long exile. Some might think of a typical Bollywood Masala movie, though I would watch it every day. I'll only give 10 to 10 in Bollywood.
