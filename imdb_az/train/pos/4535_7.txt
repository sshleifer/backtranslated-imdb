The first 50 minutes of this film was quite boring. Doyle was personally involved in personal problems, including the feelings of guilt associated with his wife, his wife's death threat, the aggressive publisher and the mentally ill. Although these issues have a major impact on Doyle's life, I was more interested in the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes were perfect. Finally, there is a look at Doyle's head, how he created Holmes, and why he had to kill Holmes. Players are very good. Including Sophie Selden, who plays an attractive role as Tim Mackenny, Arthur Conan Doyle, Douglas Henshall, and Brian Cox's "Sherlock Holmes" role model for Bell. Places are good, especially with a TV movie and camera work. If the first 50 minutes were good, the last 40 minutes would be a small one.
