I do not believe people are looking for a plot in this movie. It's Laural and Hardy. Turn on now. These two were an insurrection. Their comic genius is laughable today as it was 70 years ago. There was no evil word in the mouth and could keep the audience in the stitches. Their comedy did not develop with any luggage. If a shy cushion can not put you in your heart, there is no reason to keep track of these children. It was a simpler time, and people laughed at things that were funny without a plot. I require a simple mind to enjoy these products. Comedy teams do not consider two people, We're not too complicated ... Are not we lucky?
