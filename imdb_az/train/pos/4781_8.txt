MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me a strong supporter of David Lynch. He is a modern genius because he is not just a filmmaker. His stories and styling are magical magic. So STRAIGHT STORY was very surprising for me, it was easy to easily follow the story and sun sets. There is still Lynch, and this is a movie that should be avoided even though it is far from the best. <br /> <br /> Former Richard Farnsworth's performance is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
