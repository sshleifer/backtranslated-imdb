I have never been complicated when watching the movie for the film's sparse box. I always thought that was a very successful film at the end of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> After watching the Internet, I was shocked when it was intended for television, for it was totally fantastic for a television movie! <br /> <br /> The thing that troubled me was the length. I felt that the man in a battlefield was removed because he was absolutely unnecessary. And, as it seems, the adventure will never end, he is drifting towards the end. <br /> <br /> Moreover, everyone has a powerful, very interesting and attractive structure with spectacular performances. I simply felt that Patrick Fraze looked a little dark. <br /> <br /> In some scenes, Gogool was a little foolish about looking at demographics. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Africa's beautiful landscapes. Also, the first half of the film would have given me this movie. Still a great movie for television. 10 to 8.
