I had much interest in watching Flock.Andrew Lau. The tragedy of the infernal works directed trilogy jointly, but he was fired by Flock and was replaced by an emergency manager named Niels Mueller. I had a good film but Lau did not work, so he was dismissed and hired another man. This usually does not work well (remember the Gospel) .But the Flock was better than expected. great movie, but interesting and entertaining story. Character development is very good and I know the characters very well. In addition, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and convincing.Richards Gere and Claire Danes bring competent speeches. , let's look at the negative points. The only thing that really bothered me was that most of the recommendations were published in the film for more attitudes and styles. their existence is not accidental. Plus, I think the film should be more ambitious. Nevertheless, I recommend the Flocoon as a good tension. It's not memorable, but fun.
