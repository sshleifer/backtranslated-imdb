I will begin with my first meeting with the Prince's music. At one bar, I was 39 years old, and a girl danced with a naked dance, playing in 1999 with the speakers. I asked people, who is this singer? I said it was a prince. I was applauded by a beautiful, top dancer. Later, I started listening to other prince songs, and I really "dig" them. When the Purple Rain came, I still knew little about Minnesotan. The film blew me up. I was the first admirer of Prince of War of "War Baby". Later, I learned that one of my brothers was his secretary and he and my nephew V.P. The prince concert we are sitting next to the mother ... how cool! Hand in hand, I agree with Siskel & Ebert, called the sudden classic called Purple Rain. I have seen it 17 times and I love it completely. I thought the prince was beautiful, Apollonia fought a bit, but all was good. John Gielgood did not play the role of "The Kid", so he became the Prince. The film is visually stunning, brightly paced (slowly moving) and horrifiedly directed. I am among the best movie tracks of all time. The last time I watched was after 7 years of empty space and still surrendered. I am proud of Rogers Nelson of Minnesotown, and I personally would like to say it. During the concert mentioned above, I walked in front of me and said, "Hello, not my nephew, it's not for me." She talked to her mother. I was a little crushed, but I still have 1 number.
