I do not think many people give this movie as much credit as it deserves. I love low budget horror movies, and this is especially cake for originality. Yes, the Cowardly Kung-fu fighters, but why? Nobody is ready to go so far. After the candy, I did not have that much fun watching the movie. Thus, the city chooses a child calling her to be scared, and even her mother is not interested in her. Then it is killed and the soul is filled with heroism, and then goes on with the killing grass. It's relatively easy to accept death after the film's departure. In the end, the blessings directly go directly to the horrific directors, but these people who made me a new genre film by giving Dario Argento the greatest sacrifice, struck very well. The film has a lot of Arnold rip off, with a liners you will definitely laugh around and steal the sheriff with a stick. I would say some friends get a pizza. Close A $$ with this movie. I love personality and fun.
