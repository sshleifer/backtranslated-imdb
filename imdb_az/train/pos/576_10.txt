this film is just brilliant, casting, decoration, story, direction, and really fit everybody's part, and you can only imagine it there, as an incredible actor in Robert Redford and now Norman's father, the same director of the Scottish Island, I liked to have a real relationship with this movie, it was vivid in the whole movie, it was just brilliant, so I bought the movie for retail sale and recommended it to everyone and the fishing fish was incredible and eventually cried that I was very upset and if you do not cry in a movie you do not know good words, and you know well, and it's definitely a congratulation. Two little boys playing the Norman and Paul's party were just brilliant, and I often think that children are out of the list, because all the stars because it is such a great profile, but these kids are incredible and praise what they have to do, do not you think? The whole story was so beautiful because it was true and it was one of life after sharing it with us.
