I saw the movie twice a couple times in Orpington, Kent, and in the UK cinema. The place was twice full, and the people turned away. From the start of the film 'wounded' on Henry Winkler, the whole audience was laughing and laughing until lending. <br /> <br /> For fans of American wrestling this movie should be one, but be ready to see Henry Winkler until you've seen it before. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to watch this movie and if it is the best family comedy entertainment!
