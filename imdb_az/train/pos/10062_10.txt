Amazing! Wow. A beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> The only movie Minglun Vey wrote, the violin is nearly perfect. I hope he has more stories. Zhou Renying as Doggie was amazing - very natural talent and Xu Zhu was a delight - as much as the old trader of strawberries. <br /> <br /> The sound mode was very effective, it did not look like it. <br /> <br /> If such a film is in Hollywood or Hong Kong, family-friendly, well-behaved, well-written, close to a perfect boat.
