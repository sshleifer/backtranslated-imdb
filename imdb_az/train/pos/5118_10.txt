******** Spoilers - Careful ********* What can I say? When I came to town cowboy I was biased. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ font> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify; in LA or New York <br /> <br /> Travolta Houston is a small Texas state that moves to Houston to work on the oil field, Travolta, playing stereotypic bad guys / good guys in big budget films, like Saturday Night Fever <br /> <br /> Bud meets Sissy (played with Debra Winger): It's really a good movie - bullfire and two-step dance floor can be expensive - slutty glow) - and soon, they are married and have a dream trailer, but their relationships become a real-life war, and Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be a real cowboy, but the role of men in modern times is unclear. He can do dangerous work at night, and during the night he will have a mechanical bull - he can be a "city cowboy". But Sissy wants to drive her own truck, and she wants to fly. Budu escapes from here? As Sissy puts forth his own independence, he is afraid to walk around with a conditional con and prison rodeo star of a bull and flirting - a real ox horse - Wes (starred by Scott Glenn). Bud is threatened and Bud and Sissy collapsed. <br /> <br /> There is something flawed with Wes who abuse her. Bud develops himself, Bam Pam is a boy's toy, a wealthy girl who is in her father's oil and all these things. Sissy comes by the trailer to clear it - Pam does not do such things. <br /> <br /> Buddha's uncle Bob was shining and dying in the workplace as he led to the explosion. Bud and Sissy have the chance to reconcile, but they are very stubborn. Then the mechanical wheat driving competition goes to Gilley, and Bud goes to win. Pam Budun understands that he does not love him, but Sissy did it for him. <br /> <br /> If you ask Budd and Sissy what time to go, Wes seeks to rob Gilleys, but she keeps the city cowboy, Buddhin Day, and her favorite woman earns back. Gilley every night and "live as a pig". Maybe it helped her marriage. Or why not with Bud Pam - it was not bad and money. Or why did Bob Uncle kill it? Why Bud and Sissy always had stupid friends like Marshall and Jessie? Marshall Buddha says: "He is better than a bull!" Part of Urban Cowboy's fun is a little fun and it's Bonnie Raitt on the stage!
