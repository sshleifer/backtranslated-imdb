This movie is very ancient. I have never understood that Ray Montand looks young in 1936, and I remember him in a big movie called Lost Weekend. Ray plays Michael Stuart, a very wealthy banker. In this way, three girls learn that they are not happy to divorce their father and mother, and that their fathers want to marry a young girl who digs a gold digger looking for only one rich sugar dad. They call a man to call it a very rich number, the name is always drunk, Misha Auer, and gives a lot of funny laughs throughout the picture. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) was surprised when she ordered a police station and told the chief of police that she was an opera star, and then Penny reads the most beautiful soprano sound, with all the police and convicts applauded, and this movie is very entertaining and enjoyable. It was a scene. It was the first debut of Deanna Durbin and during the night he had a great success, and after leaving MGM, he became a great movie star with Universal Studios.
