Joel Schumacher made a selection heck when deciding on this script and the script. The story was well-written and well-prepared, and this entirely new cast of 10 or 12 central characters was absolutely brilliant. As you can see, there were 6 "leading" and nearly half the support, and this is the best thing about the movie, the younger faces of the morning. It has been a long time since Hollywood's talk about controversial Vietnamese war films. This is the "story to be amazed" (as shown by Shumaxer) and transforms the Tigerland lands into the most important war period. However, it can not be labeled as a war movie because Bozz and other human beings are more based on the spirit. I think everyone who just wants to see a good movie with all the special FX, but only good, gritty drama should see in Tigerland, obviously Shumachers Best works for the last 8 years.
