In the late 80s and early 90's, a person who grew up in NYC could say that I was one of the most important documentary documents covering the area during that time. No Madonna came up with the idea of ​​Vogging, but it took it! Instead of avoiding touching one another (avoiding the possibility of automatic disqualification), "fighting" within the boundaries of all people, instead of resorting to violence or adjoining cat fights. There was not such a spectacular sight in such unusual talent / well-organized "shots" in the clubs, and all the great names coming back from the day are here ...

Words and deeds were as sharp as the movements of the earth. All the tension, excitement and magic of NYC energy in this city are filmed in this film. BRILLIANT !!! Tell the world to see the world! Thank you very much!
