I went to see Antone Fisher knowing what he was expecting and most enjoyable. Derek's task was outstanding and the story line was excellent. Certainly, Denzel Washington has managed to do a great job and lead. It is a perfect example of this movie that can help people with mental problems. Do not miss them.
