It's a killer film, with killer on-board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny), a complicated writer, wants to conduct field research on American serial killers. But neither she nor her girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), has money for a crossover tour of killing sites. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> A young couple they have ended, Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend Adele (Juliet Lewis) /> Indeed, Early and Adele are entertaining in the way I see since The Beverly Hillbillies revisits, such as embarrassment, frustration, trust, thought, prediction, drool and behavior. Early California's idea: "People are thinking faster than all the hot weather, cold weather is foolish for people." It's enough to convince Adele: "There's a lot of stupid people around here." Early replied proudly: "Be sure." Early in California, Adele continues to teach: "You should buy no fruit, because there are trees ... and they have no speed limit and the first month's rent is free, the state's law" <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> > <br /> <br /> "California" begins to appear more like The Hitcher (1986), and Early, it starts to move more, John Ryder, everyone's maniacal hiccup, could not even stop terror. <br /> <br /> "California", the player is uneven. Duchovny's performance is straightforward. Brad Pitt is surprising, though sometimes overwhelming. Michelle Forbes is great as an avant-garde photographer. But my choice for the best performance was directed to Juliette Lewis. Lastly, the film accepts the Twilight Zone feeling, so it is striking as Nelson's voice and heavy-weight South accent, like Adele, a naive, high-animated kid. our testers entered a Nevada nuclear test site with an old home full of test models. <br /> <br /> However, "California" is a fun movie, thanks to a smart concept, beautiful scenery, especially a very beautiful look. The second half, good cinematography, great dialogue and a wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis.
