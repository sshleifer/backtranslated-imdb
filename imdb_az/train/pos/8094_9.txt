First of all, no adaptation is as good as a book, especially when you are dealing with a master writer such as Tolkien. This adapter is a beautiful synthesis of the Tolkien universe with the psychedelia, aesthetic and liberal culture of the 70s. Yes - animation and background painting are sometimes a bit rude in technical performance, but it's so nice and not so wonderful to give a unique "sense of sense" for each scene. In addition to the absolute uniqueness of the images, the absolutely outstanding voice acting - the advantage of the FAR that operates in new live action films. Cellular animation may not be the most "technically adequate" animation, but it delivers an actress's expressive body and face gestures at an instant without forgetting the subtlety and nuance. Background images differ from the traditional "fantasy" motifs, but switching to abstract parameters is always motivated by the narrative and has a great impact on the theme of the movie. If you are a human being who needs to have a broad computer in a movie, you need to visualize everything, but you'll see how you can not enjoy this movie, but it's a great role-playing, transcendental footage and JRR Tolkien.
