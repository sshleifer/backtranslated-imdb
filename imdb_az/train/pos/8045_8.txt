Finally, I leased a DVD to DVD because I could find movies that were not sold at me at the store. <br /> <br /> Because I love Christopher Meloni, as well as small, often unprecedented films, I chose Souler. <br /> <br /> This is such a cure! Meloni has such a charm. You only see it as alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). <br /> <br /> In this film, Meloni is a realistic and timeless character, in many ways, to find the way to unexpected happiness by hitting the skid. I have not seen Busfield seen for 30 years. But it was all the Chris movie. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BRONG> I thought some "flashbacks" could be edited down. But in general, this movie will make you happy - male or female - today's relationships have an honest, refreshing look.
