This film on the paper would be incredibly boring. A 75-year-old man claims that the country is on a sidewalk, with no involvement, but the real power behind the film is its charm and intelligence. Writers will not be able to find a job better than Straight Story. <br /> <br /> The best example of this is a scene where Alvin is facing a fugitive young girl. She is pregnant and afraid of what her parents will learn. Alvin tells a story about her children long ago. Each of them took a stick and broke what he could easily do. Then he gathered the sticks and tried to break them. "This package," he said, "is a family." So many other films will have to continue, and we know that an individual can break, but it will make members stronger. <br /> <br /> Straight Story understands that we are clever enough to understand and simply puts our thoughts into thinking and drawing our own conclusions. <br /> <br /> Alvie's journey through Iowa, the mutual impacts. Each intercourse is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is driven into a desperate drive because we can not help, but smilingly drives to the Bostons to reconcile with his brother Lyle. And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the true story is not a destination, but a journey. Alvin is a trip to meet everyone - their benefits and ours. <br /> <br /> Straight Story is a rare giant live action called "G", which means reminding us everything we lost by urbanization, slow, simple, and really should not be missed.
