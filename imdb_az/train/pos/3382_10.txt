Often I would have to see a movie feeling. But it is clear that this film has a premonition seed. <br /> <br /> We should not be tempted to be excited and at one point we should not see armageddon, because it looks appropriate to our feelings. But did not we say "1984"? James Orwell knew that Internet became a reality after 1984; In fact it was in 1994; he might have reconsidered his story as he wrote it. <br /> <br /> Indeed, the issue is that we regard ourselves as superior to us, but when it is necessary to hit our door, it becomes really "feelings of love." <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> /> </ strong>
