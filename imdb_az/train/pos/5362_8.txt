RUNNING MAN, along with TOTAL RECALL, is my favorite Schwarzenegger movie. No, it's not 2001, but it's not for that. Here, the actor and writer are not at the same level as the other Arnie films, such as PREDATOR or TERMINATOR. But behind this movie, IDEA is one of the best quality screens to reach the big screen. The government-sponsored game, the criminals who are convicted of serious crimes, are fighting against heroic stalkers equipped with all kinds of weapons (athletes are not equipped in any way) to ensure the sport and the blood of the public. Final prize for a winning run: freedom. Otherwise, the rules are claimed. <br /> <br /> For a movie with such strange death scenes and a cheesy liner, there's really a lot to say. Nobody pointed to all the comments on the culture / government presented in this film, so I will not be here. It is enough to say that the movie can look more out of the imagination of the mind, you will love it (especially with your great SF fan with many imaginations). As I said, it does not try to be a serious art movie, but it's a striking level for shooting in the 1980s. The essay is taken from a short novel by Richard Bachman (aka Stephen King), but in the end it is quite different from the welding material. <br /> <br /> I love my line: I say steroids.
