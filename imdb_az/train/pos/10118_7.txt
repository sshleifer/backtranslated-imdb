I really love Miikes Yakuza's films, about 2 years ago, and actually works with me. I have never seen such a patient and wrapped anything. The story is good and the actors are doing their job very well. I have not seen the version of England or Japan, but I want to say that the German DVDs were a bit censored. If you have not already seen the movie and live in Germany, you may be interested in a DVD from Nederlands or Austria. The I-ON DVD has many very serious and bad scenes, but I've heard about one or two short scenes missing from the show. <br /> <br /> All this is crazy characters and a high level of violence, so what is Miike for!
