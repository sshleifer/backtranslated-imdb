A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of the darkness in the apartheid and has actually died a lot before his normal time. Even though it's already an old movie, Biko'nun does not show how important it really is. His life and teaching are somewhat diminished, and a few virtuous words are best. The film, from 1987, aims to push South Africa from its threshold, which will lead to its freedom. Thus, the film aims to show the irrationality of South African apartheid supporters in 1987. To show this film, Biko's death must be seen, so he is not a Biko, but a white-liberal journalist and a system that flies absurd. His run is considered to be necessary because he has suffered with the victim family, and after his death, Bikoda wants to publish his first book and can only happen in England. It shows a movie to escape from South Africa, the apartheid is still standing and killing. So, do not expect this to be true and correct. That could not have happened. But the film means forgiveness for those who want to forgive those who wish to forgive those who wish to be forgiven to those who want to be forgiven of any distance away from South Africa, far from Nelson Mandela's head, and those who want to be forgiven. The film is strong and emotional, but in the movie, the third race community, not the Indians, is a very historic line today. Panegirik books or movies all have these defects: they look at the person they look at from a portrait. The reason why the film is so old is long ago, as it has been. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques Coulardeau, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID
