Above all, I loved Bruce Broughton's music chart and was added to the charm of this movie. The best feature of the film was the three animals that were voiced by Michael J. Fox, Sally Field and late Don Ameche. Fox has funniest lines, ameche plays another attractive character (reason for the sound), and Field is always reasonable to include a character that said Chance is off. People did not draw, and sometimes the movie was drifted, but this is my only complaint. This is a nice-looking movie, with Canada close-ups, I believe. Although the film itself is quite long, there is never a dull moment, and it is dominated by a soundwork and a well-written script. Generally, with me, it's a 9/10 movie that's a charming and perhaps unfounded movie. Bethany Cox.
