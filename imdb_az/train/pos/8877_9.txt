This story was probably one of the strongest I ever got. John Singleton certainly went above and beyond, combining this educational masterpiece. <br /> <br /> However, as a college student, Singleton has touched on many issues. <br /> <br /> Epps and Rapaport have shown that the young star's career is the best and most convincing. excessive. In a sense, though many college campuses face problems, this movie is not openly or clearly presented in a faith. In some cases it would seem ridiculous to think that nature can actually happen. At the same time, though the film was dramatic, the film was brilliant and surprised me, she could not talk, think. Something I can remember from this picture is a word taken from Lawrence Fishburn's character: "Knowledge is power, without knowledge, you can not see the power." Bright, just brilliant.
