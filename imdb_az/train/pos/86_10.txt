When I was a young boy, I never remembered it, I saw here at Dayton, Ohio's Salem Cinema (Kiddie Matin√©e, almost every Saturday). It made me and my friends very surprised. I wish there was a way I could see it again! I do not want to get any shorts or something to try. I've just discovered that this is a Cousteau movie, and I've been thinking more about it recently. It is my understanding of how to do it. Fish is really CAT'S MOUTH at some point, if you really remember! I would be extremely grateful if anyone could help me find a way to see him again!
