<br /> <br /> Did you expect a comedy-based high-resolution movie Slam Dunk? Really? Actor Jay Chouun is not the most moving thing I've ever seen, but I liked the movie very much. Did it close to the awesome level where someone like Jet Li or Stephen Chow could produce? No, not really. If you just bought the price of the surface, was that fun? Completely. This is a movie about some Chinese-made candy idols and musicians who can play basketball at an inadequate level. Jay Chou is a badly-triad-friendly friend and an illogical planning guy who involves all of these. A love is interested. This shape is, but for a while it has been postponed. Come on.
