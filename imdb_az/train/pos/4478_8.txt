Generally, it is a pleasant, light, romantic, musical comedy. I think it might be a little trick to continue the film for a long time. But I'm not sure what to do. Kelly and Sinatra's song? No. What a wonderful dance that Kelly thinks? No. When was the film shot to develop the storyline and improve the relationship between characters? There is nothing (this is a lot of complaints that more and more new characters are not developed). <br /> <br /> It does not bring much to the Eurythmic film, but it gives us a chance. See and hear great talents from the 1040s. So if he was not an actor? Grayson was an important part of the film as a mainstay for meeting with her. <br /> <br /> In fact, Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer brought him to the MGM for a screen test that included an aria. During the selection of the film, MGM rattles rice and has a smiling shot. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of life, it's hard to beat all the moments. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;" The big use of the film is illuminated and you can see why Frank Sinatra is a star, and the point in the film is that when it's leaving Sinatra (a woman later) just played a role in finding a date, and you will feel good after seeing this movie
