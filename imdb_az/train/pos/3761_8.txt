Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey go on to Bill and Ted's perfect adventure. <br /> <br /> After some films, the first movie is followed by a direct mistake and a better job for entertaining audiences. <br /> <br /> The solution is a bad person from the future, using Bill and Ted, Bill, and Ted, the most exposed bad robots. After robots kill Bill and Ted, they must compete with ugly (death) and return their normal lives. <br /> <br /> The actress in the movie is top notch and even thinks it's a bit weird, especially when Bill and Ted's conversations are a great movie. Wannabe rockers made sure of a great movie. Next time you select it in the block!
