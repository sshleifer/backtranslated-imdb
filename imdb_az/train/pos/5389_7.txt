As one of the many primitive episodes of the "General Hospital" set up in the Natal Town, this rapidly moving programmer has an unpleasant emotional effect - mainly in Eric Linden, the main area, such a palpable accident and such a good reason. His expectant spouse, Loretta Young, was brought to the person at the start of a 20-year sentence to throw a lecher who came to him; Ms. Young, as always, does nothing to break the sympathy of the audience, and, of course, is sympathetic and beautiful to look at, but it's a little good to be true. His challenging pregnancy and relationships with other girls make up the heart of the film, and the result - not entirely happy - feels right. According to film historian David Thomson, Aline MacMahon, "one of the few great actresses in the film," leaks heat and power like a nursing nurse, and Glenda Farrell is regarded as a new mother without twins. Combined "Frankie and Johnny" as a drunken lullaby. Frank McHugh takes another subpotta figure and Warners usually to show him more range than allowed. It is scale-scale and easy, and Linden's awesome paranoia is with you for days - these feelings often sound for laughs, but she is a child in anxiety and very convincing.
