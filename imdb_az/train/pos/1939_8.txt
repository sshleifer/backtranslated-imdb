I do not know why I chose to watch this movie, it seemed like something strange and not a definite one. It is good to film a little differently from Hollywood's Hollywood hero / thriller at a time, and this film is of course different. I was interested in this movie from the very beginning, but when I realized how real the movie was, I did not understand how much the movie was up to its end. I imagined that the actor was perfect, and the development of the character really cares for them, and I hope that eventually a good thing has happened to them. In my opinion, anyone watching the movie may belong to one of the characters, and it is a beautiful look and good laugh with the actor's inattention. <br /> <br /> In the culmination of the movie, you are feeling absolutely good and leave the feeling that everything is going to be a good thing. I am convinced that this will be a great wish and a chance to be given.
