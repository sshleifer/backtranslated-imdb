This is really one of Hollywood's "Golden Age", they do not happen anymore. It's a rare, entertaining movie that you can guess about what will happen next. <br /> <br /> All actors are perfectly discarded and support all major actors. This is the first movie I've ever seen with Ronald Colman, and since then I've been an admirer of him. Reginald Gardiner has always been a favorite actress and he adds a certain quality to each movie. While playing a different character here, he added something else to the film that added another player to this character.
