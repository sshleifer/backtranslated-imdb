Jean-Jacques began his career with a career question: Culture makes us worse. This clever and exciting movie supports these arguments. In this sense, a common theme for French films repeats: society is real, personality building, freedom is a crime. Here, the idea is being treated in the fullest sense. Both main characters find themselves and each other only in violation of the rules. This discovery can be true in France; in any case, is very romantic.
