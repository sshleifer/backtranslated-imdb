Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is an important film in my life because I see the first movie I remembered as a 4-year-old place in my home theater's cinema. This story is based on Sheila Burnford's novel, and it's not possible to record it as a clumsy Lassie clone. <br /> <br /> The main story: Two dogs and a cat live in happiness. The Seaver family is forced to temporarily go to San Francisco, the city of San Francisco, when the new mother of three children is sent to an animal in the city and sent to an animal for a few months. Relationships between animals and their children are particularly strong and, like children, the shadow gold retriever and Sassy Himalaya cats have a heart failure, a young and happy companion American Bulldog, known as Chance, is a bit less anxious and slightly offensive (partly rarely, the animal was taken to the shelter and explained that it was purchased by the family). Do not tell the story. <br /> <br /> Three pets escape from rescue and include a broad and dangerous desert (along the way to fantastical desert on the road), driven by the skies direction. The family and the elderly are hoping to live at home as they are worried about the disappearance of animals. A great dialogue between the three animals and the sad lines (see the memorable quotes) and the immense companionship, the funny moments that grow among the main characters during the events that take place. <br /> <br /> The pride of Sassy trying to cross a desperate river causes it to fall in the river and is washed off under a waterfall, a moment when the viewers feel deeply. <br /> <br /> I have not seen what survived the deserted girl is in the desert and adds to the story. It even seems a bit unnecessary as part of the story. <br /> <br /> When the shadow falls into a pit and breaks its legs, the stakes are higher when it's over, it's hard to get out and it's helpless, and then climbing with it to encourage them to rise, he said that they had pushed them so as not to throw them off easily. <br /> <br /> The way that this scene is not betrayed is that Chance and Sassy return to the home after a return to the final scene, but there is no place for the lake to appear. Then, as it all seems, it looks slowly and joins with the family. As a result of his luck, he speaks about his friendship with his wife and his friends, and makes it a long way to go home, puts a good epilogue to show how far the character has grown, and how the other two are. Take a second, I think I'm going to cry ... <br /> Anyway, I did not read Sheila Burnford's book, so she lost the differences between books and movies. But this is a movie that the whole family can watch, and if the toasts love animals, the old audience will understand a better line (when I watched the movie a few years after seeing it). This movie is a work in cinema and if you see that you do not see it, you can take it out and get it! <br /> <br /> And do not hesitate later (see Revision for Homeward Bound II!)
