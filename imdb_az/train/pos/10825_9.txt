Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid shot despite their television work. <br /> <br /> However, their film work was heavily damaged (2008, the Bank Business was good, the previous year was pretty weak against the universe). <br /> <br /> Crazy, fortunately, is a solid success. <br /> <br /> I love "moments" and there is one of them in this movie - everything is above all, on top of everything, in real life, a great story, great speeches, very humor <br /> <br /> Dear volunteer.
