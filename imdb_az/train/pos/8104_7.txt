It's an incredible movie since 1936. Although the first hour is not very interesting (for the contemporary audience), the elegant vision of 2036 is then made up of words. <br /> <br /> The quality and accent of the sounds (American, but Americans of the 1930s) complicate. <br /> <br /> In fact, the story proves. Look at the so-called US city of Alltown for 100 years. <br /> <br /> Although the first hour is a bit slow - although the audience is difficult to explain, the war is in the horizon until 1936, starting in 1936. I would think back then. Events, regressions and visuals are at a very low level today. But when it comes to the future, it's just fun to watch. <br /> <br /> It's hard to beat the huge set of everything and the retro-rooted look. <br /> <br /> If you do not have great listening skills, it's hard to listen to this movie. I understand only about 80% of the dialogue. <br /> If you have a fantastic fan, this is one of the classics of the genre, and at least after the first hour. For a moderate audience, wait for a closed header and watch it if you're comfortable with movies of that time.
