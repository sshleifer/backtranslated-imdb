If I had not been for the Oscar nomination for the "Surprise" for the Best Animated Feature Film, I would not have been acquainted with this movie. Fortunately, I came to watch this little little treasure. <br /> <br /> The story is about Brendan, the nephew of the Kells town siege and Superior Abbot. Abbott's main occupation is to build a wall to protect the Kells against the Vikings. One day, a famous illustrator from Aida, Aian, took refuge in them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to art and foreign attraction. Brendan was a friend of Aisling's white forest sprit, trying to restore the old crystal, which was not paying attention to the illustration of the white library. <br /> <br /> "The Secret of Kells", unlike many of the released animations, these days. Drawings are a kind of shooting such as symbolism, without paying much attention to realism in simplified geometric lines and design. The movements of these lines remind you of a simple yet fluid animation style used at the beginning of Kung Fu Panda. But the spectacular use of the color, which is a surprising basis for the audience. <br /> <br /> The red colors used in the sequence of the Viking invasion are unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try to keep this quiet ship of a movie. It's called "Monsters vs Aliens" and so on. The current animation is a welcome reminder of all the unstable grenades of the mice. Cruising Celtic musician is impressive with a sense of fantasy that holds the film. Okay, the story can be a little quiet and wants a little bit of ending. I would like to know more about Brendan and Aidan's book. But the bright star of this film is indeed a beautifully stylized artworks, based on the works of the Kells Book.
