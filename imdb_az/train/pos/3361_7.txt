I am going to recall the 10th anniversary of Marcello Mastroianni's passage of numerous films with VHS; However, given my ongoing heartbreaking Christmas marathon, I just have to deal with it! Perhaps he has one of his best performances and he has named the Oscar (the film itself is also honored). It is also one of 14 collaborations with other well-known Italian celebrity Sophia Loren. Casually, play against the type here - it's an unglamorous housewife and she's homosexual! By the way, the title of the film has a double meaning: the leading characters are brought together on the date when Hitler came to Italy to get acquainted with Mussolini (the event itself is shown in long archive pictures) but more precisely, they briefly share their passionate moments with 'short encounters' of the stars - they know that it is inevitable that each one returns to normal life, so the film is about to end. This is simply a double-headed start and sequence sequence, which is strikingly played by John Vernon, with all the other symbols apart from the strange conjunction of the block of flats covering Loren's mistake and conscientious patriarchy); still a difficult setting is not limited to director Scola (for record, I watched his 7th film and 3 more in VHS), and Pasqualino De Santis, a cinematographer, as a result. <br /> <br /> The Prophet (saas) said: "Believers are absolutely dependent on the performances of the two stars, and both of them convey the message to them, and when Loren faces the rewards in his own home, , He loved the international audience with the appearance of Mastroianni's inactivity (the film is undoubtedly anti-fascist and anti-fascist!)
