I love this movie. The Bladerunner-esquire of Paris in 2054, the most respected classic movie noir script: trying to find the lady, the sister in danger, honest cop fight anyone. Fortunately, this stems from being stereotypic and combines exciting, innovative visuals with a pretty good story. The film can be reminiscent of seeing Sin City, but it has a more affordable, more graphic look that I really found. Each frame may appear to have been pulled out from the desk of a talented graphic designer in each row. In terms of story and art, corporations are governed by films like the nineteenth door (or Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer classic views) and Casablanca, as well as a strange future of our targets. Give us the pretext you need to see this movie.
