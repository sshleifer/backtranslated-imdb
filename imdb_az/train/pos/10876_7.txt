I was very excited to see this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> I apologize for Molly Ringwald, who went to Australia to make a great movie . <br /> <br /> Acting was awful (especially the Australian guy trying to speak American) <br /> <br /> When I heard about this movie for the first time, I thought my head was miserable (because "Stab" cheese movie on Scream 2 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Probably the worst thing about the movie has come to an end. I was expecting a great surprise on who this murderer was. But the murderer is not human. This turned the realist film into a terrible fear film. <br /> <br /> Do not see this movie. You will probably be disappointed!
