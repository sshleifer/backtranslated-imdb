This film is undoubtedly a perfect 10/10 .. for all those who have a rating of the lower classes because it is a complex of the jokes, because it is not a "good plot" or anything, The film is bad, because there is no plot! You watch Jackie Chan's protection from the action, so that his action is not a very good story or something to compare with, how he filmed it, and compared with other American films of that time, you will also perform Jackie Chan's films, scenes of top-level battles and really good While passing through the fields, American movies Jackie Chan had a lot of good things compared to that time, but there were indirect motion scenes. Watching porn on porn, Jackie Chan is watching for AKSIYA, I think your people are bad because there is no structure because I think a smart film critic will appreciate how good a movie is, but I see it as a good way. Surely the middle of the film is boring, VERY VERY, but in this way all the action scenes and stunts are paid too much of the rest. It changed how American movements were created, and even had scenes from this movie. If you're a true man, a true artist will watch this movie and more from Jackie Chan, Hesse from every point. He is watching American movies in the park and even resembling the TODAYS cinema. American films are based on special effects and safety wires and stunt pockets and more. The Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are the work of a talent that has made all the work and talent they can do. a king
