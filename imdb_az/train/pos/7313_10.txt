Some Spoilers If you are a fan of a great movie movie, then you will know that Halloween has made many films. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this film is one of the most classic and definitely not imitated movies of horror. <br /> <br /> I, in fact, do not ask why this movie is in the series). Before I saw the other seven films I saw honestly, how it worked. But I want to say once again that it is distancing others. It's really a scary thing, and Michael sends a bruise on your back for a walk or a walk in the dark. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael stabs a man and pulls his head one side. <br /> <br /> The movie is one of the most shady images in history. <br /> <br /> As the 13th movie on Friday, this movie was more entertaining and less. I feel the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie is better than just F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a terrible disgust as he is a realist, and you can imagine a horrible guy as he was going to kill people. <br /> <br /> What's good about this movie is that it does not rely on respect or humor to entertain the audience. Only pure terror. The subsequent films of the series are far from this movie because it is an example of a magnificent slasher movie when they arrive.
