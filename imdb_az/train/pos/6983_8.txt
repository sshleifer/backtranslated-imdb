I liked it, I was an admirer of the original series, I always wondered what the back story would be - I did not fail to please me. I also love Eric Stoltz, another person does not know - it is like a BSG. It has given me a new abundance - wait to start venting the series. Ronald D. Moore and I have done excellent for the team - a great job. There were special effects, dialogues and toy stories, and I felt emotionally part of the story. As far as I know, they will not agree with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica was superior to most Sci-Fis in the last decade.
