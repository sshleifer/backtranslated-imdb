I think most of the commentators in this movie do not understand how to watch a movie and / or feel less elegance. First, we need to understand that everything in the film works together to evaluate a film. Modern sensitivities require great drama. No, I do not mean to build great characters and columns, but they require emotional trajectories that are very useful or very comedy. This is a delicate film. His beauty is subtle (not to be confused with simplicity). In this film, neither the story nor the faces are simple. This is a movie that combines sensitivity, politics, human weakness, and mentality ... that's what you call it. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br / > <br /> This film does not understand that Victorian society is not truly Victorian because it understands the notion of today. <br />
