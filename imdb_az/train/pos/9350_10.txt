I would like to say that I love Adam Sandler and look at my power and closer to his player <br /> <br /> When I raise his voice, I can not help but shout at a happy golf ball, then <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <! br> <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle does not always do a great job, and here's really no big deal with big lines and deserves Oscar in any movie <br /> <br /> Adam Sandler is the best of his career movie But we can recall that he was laughing at many parts of this movie. <br /> <br /> The player who supported Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith was also great. Whether you have no doubt that great NYC's great comedy drama, and great reverence for Adam Sandler, are no bigger than Don Cheadle
