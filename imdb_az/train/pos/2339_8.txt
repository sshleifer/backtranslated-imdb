I love this show. Now, I'm not a great admirer of many science fiction shows, so if I have any similarities, I would not notice it. I love the storybook quality of cinematography. Even though I love the story I love, I am surprised to see how some part of the story really looks like Ned, and you can not touch Chuck or anything else. I even love Chuck, I do not feel tempted, and generally I hate pretty sweet, beautiful characters. I love the voice of narcissus, even if some of my family members are concerned and like some Walgreens ads. I can imagine all the other things about Ned's difficulties and how the writers will solve it in the future, but I'll wait for more and see how the writers are expecting fairy tales.
