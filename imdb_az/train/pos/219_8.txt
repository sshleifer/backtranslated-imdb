Simon's carefully written dialogues are powered by Matthau and Burns. You can fully exploit the scenario scenario. There are several films that can develop such a connection between actors and scripts. For example, the famous merging scene could have been very widowed with less quality actors. Matthau Willie Clark appears to have been born to play with the little idiosyncracies and mannerisms (of course, Oscar moreso in Odd Couple, of course), and he is living in the city while Lewis lives in the country (he argues that Lewisin is "without touching" the controversial line) , it's one of the best performances you've ever seen in any role, any comedy or drama, or something else. Period. Matthau and Burns work together well; contrary to what we describe, emphasizes Simon's superior skills in creating a funny defect. This movie just needs to "see" the latest and requires a fairly authoritative location on the pages of the film's history.
