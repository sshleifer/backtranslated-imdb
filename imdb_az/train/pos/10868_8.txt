I've always thought this long and boring Talking Heads flick, will be full of static interior, my friend, I was wrong. "Election" is a very interesting and thoroughly charming thriller drama, with a deep and realistic look behind the origins of Triads and Rituals. Characters are steady in motion, and you may feel the tension coming from certain decisions and ambitions of cartoons, even if you are always in the wrong place. Additionally, Johnnie can create some really rich images due to the sharp focus and shadow contrast of the atmospheric light. Although it is not a motion, it ends up being shocked to describe violence in a violent way. I came to look a little bit more about the coolest movie and minimalist acoustic guitar.
