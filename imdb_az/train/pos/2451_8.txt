George Lopez is a funny guy without a sitcom. The first episodes I have seen often make jokes at the expense of her mother. It was more and more diverse, as I watched more. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that George's family is more relaxed with the Sitcom Dad role this season. At first it was not, but it is becoming more and more grooves. It shows both, and shows that it is increasingly funnier. This year, George had also added several characters. <br /> <br /> His mother still exists but is not as central as the past season. I mean Corcus's comic timing feeling and ABC's lack of good sitcoms to say Corr. Lopez here means that George W. Bush has a good chance to be here after ABC.
