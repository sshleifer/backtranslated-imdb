This movie is incredible - it's like a nightmare. This strange story, dark d√©cor, creeping insects, sketches and srealist dreams ... It's really great! People who love religious movies or very thrilling thrills will find this fantastic. It's a bit like David Lynch's movies: strange story, strange dreams, red curtains. Nuit Noire has almost no space. This is a sequence of more irrealist events, nightmares and meetings. This is a disadvantage. If the movie has a really tense field with a tough penalty, then I'll give it from 10 to 10. But this is incomplete and I gave the movie 8. Nuit Noire - a movie watching. Search and reward DVDs!
