If you want to watch something for 'him' and 'his', then this is a movie to choose from. I am a sucker for rom coms but my husband is not always so sharp (what a boy !!!). <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is very funny and his lead man (sad, but possible). its name is remembered) is equally good. When I watched the film, it was called 'The Perfect Match', but it changed England's name because it was based on the Fever Pitch book and already had a movie about football (same movie, but World version - phew!) <br /> <br /> Anyway, all the reviews here will give you more information if you need to get girls, take them away, get the husband / owner in front of the TV. a Saturday night, and both of you will laugh and cry together. A real gem.
