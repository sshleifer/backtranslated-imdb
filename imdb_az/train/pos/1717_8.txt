The story is about the Ankush (Abhay Deol), a witness of professional marriage, briefly as a witness for couples in the marriage registration body and love Mega (Soha Ali Khan) Dhiraj (Shayan Munshi) who flees from her home to marry in Nainital. The story starts with Megha, waiting for Dhira's wedding registration office, but for some reason she does not appear. So here comes the picture, which approached Megha with the intention of earning Ankush Rs. He is helping the Witnesses 200 and giving him asylum. Anush works in a bank like an agent ... Anush is in love with Megha, and he is in love with her (or type of love), and he agrees with the marriage and returns to Dhiraj's picture. Unexpected situations occur, really unexpected conditions are unexpected and then you have to say ... <br /> In fact, the film's story is a bit different from what we see and I do not think it will not think about it. Masses, but if you're like a movie freak and like to watch something different, then you'll love the movie. The film is just an innocent love story prepared by the heroes of Abai Deol and Soha Ali Khan. The heroes are so natural that in the next section you feel like things happen to the person. The background music of the movie also plays a very good role, it is very good. <br /> <br /> He says Delhi's road is very good and gives a fresh feeling. <br /> <br /> So let's cut it off. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> Actor: Abhay Deol was the most impressive, very natural and innocent toy, but he should avoid singing songs from the songs. Soha Ali Han, a puppet, is a very cute doll that you have to say. Again, it is very innocent and natural, and these two players are perfectly suited to their characters. In addition, Shayan Munhi needs some actor classes and can be several layers of fat to cover the bones. The work of other players was also good. <br /> <br /> Stars: I would give 5 to 5 stars. If you watch the theater you will enjoy the movie, I recommend watching in the theater. The film adopts strange and unusual stories. Otherwise, wait for the DVD to come. The film will not necessarily be loved by the masses, and the work that can do it is the discovery of the mouth.
