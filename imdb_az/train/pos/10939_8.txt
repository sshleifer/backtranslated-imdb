Five Deadly Birds are wrapped in a whodunnite mystery of a great kung-fu flower film. A kung fu fever has all the usual explanations: great choreography, terrifying dubbing, different "styles of battle" and extensive exaggerated, often cheesey human emotions. But the plot is, of course, better than the average. It is interesting and striking in non-combat scenes. <br /> <br /> Let us recall that even when the character is in terrible injustice, we can fire the audience. <br /> <br /> What I love about five deadly poisonings is the beautiful simplicity of the film's morals and themes. Only everyone receives them. He was scared, greedy, and corrupt. The wicked men who are depraved by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their treachery and returning. Well, good guys use teamwork, planning and integrity to eliminate and overcome probabilities. <br /> <br /> Armor Clan rocks!
