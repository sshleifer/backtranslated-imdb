I really thought this movie was perfect. History is not only true, but styles are luxurious and still intimate. I became an admirer of Emili Blunt's Victoria picture and, while in her youth, she was forced to virtual exile, how she kept her soul. Blunt describes Vicotria as charismatic and sometimes religious in that it is famous (perhaps rude). The romantic elements of the film are so subtle and tender that you understand why at the end of the movie Vicotria chose Albert to stay away from the daytime. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film should also be noted. With the dramatic movement of the story, I appreciated the beautiful account that made a great move. <br /> <br /> As in this film, there were very few films this year, and there were few such films. As one of the best of 2009!
