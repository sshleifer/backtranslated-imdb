I've seen this movie several times in the Comedy Center. This movie was pretty good. An interesting adventure with Sunny Davis's life to marry the king of the ophthalm, because the US can take the military base to balance its power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including "Sunnygate". I also liked the last issue very much. He gave me a great political spirit. It was my rating for it.
