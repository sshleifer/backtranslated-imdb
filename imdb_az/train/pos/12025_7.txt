At the bottom of the movie studio you will find companies like UFO, Troma and companies. <br /> Seduction is a video production company specializing in lesbian-themed, non-weighted eroticism. movies. They have released a very special fan base that purchases each new title as they are free, but, unfortunately, the company has often been associated with star Misty Mundae. Unfortunately, the common interest shown recently and the horrors of Horrors have led to the fact that its zero budget, which compels its companies to find a new identity, has fallen short of its efforts. But in their glory days, they left this movie in a gladden world. <br /> <br /> Gorgeous Misty Mundae is forced to go to boarding school at the request of his father. At school, she has been singing by Ruby Larocca, designed instantly, but the president (Barbara Joyce) has other plans. In typical S.C style, the movie stands for every 10 minutes for a long sex scene, but unlike most of their efforts, this is a bit of an interesting story and some good performance. Ms. Larocca has begun to spend a great deal of time as Daryan Caine (like a devil) looks like a sexual predator who sees Misty as a delicious meal. This is Jess Franco's 70th birthday movie (though Franco does not always have a heavy duty to go for a foreigner), and fans of this madman would be wise to give this one thing. <br /> <br /> For me, long As a zero-budget movie fan (and Troma worshiper), I prefer their parody movies (players, monkeys, erotic billionaires), but in fact, I prefer their original works. You'll see either the low budget background and sometimes poor performance or dependency on these things and hate all these movies. For me, the most similar thing to combine these non-budget films is the real meaning of fun. <br /> <br /> These low-budget companies are able to create their own unique style that gives the audience something different, with the efforts of their studio, which loads the numbers and multiplexes. <br /> <br /> This is a great choice, starting with a movie movie or this Sin Sisters (which deals with both Mundae's sister). This is an entertaining, fast paced movie (although the appearance of the school is a bit old), and the DVD is completely erased scenes, including an alternative launch, which is loaded with extras, including scenes featurette and some behind, adding a ton of suggestions completely. I advise you to go to the movie's first movie because of the bonus feature of your disc, because it is incredibly weak and really worth it.
