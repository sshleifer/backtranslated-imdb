I came across Insomniac's Nightmare while looking for extraordinary independent films and I'm so glad I did not disappoint it. The crazy half an hour ride curious about me all the way and the end was excellent - one of the NOOOOO moments that really stays with you. I have shown it to a number of people, and everyone puts their hands down. The little ghostie girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. He is amazed at me, I can say a lot. Nanavati did a great job in this brief way. All the numbers have just fallen to the ground and you can say that he is a great writer than what he did with this article. Well written. The undoubtedly the most powerful part of the film. The director was great and the player was pleasant, but here is the power of the most important factor scenario. Good job for this girl, I will not wait to see more!
