Samuel Fuller is an intriguing filmmaker, mostly in his films, with many unstable policies. "Shock Corridor" and "Naked Kiss" represent America's hypocrisy and dignity and effectively portray the horrors of the "Great Red Bir" War of Merrill's Marauders in the hell and the "Pick in the South Siege" "The Threats of Communist Spies. Fuller was as good as any of the main studio contractors, although the piconholed, often as a b-film shooter, is no exception. "Pickup in the South Saki" is no exception, and despite the themes, the style of filmmaking is long ago. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Caucasus is a great anti-hero of Richard Widmark and Jean Peters is pretty sexy as a girl who works for his communist spy boyfriend Thouma Ritter , but with a totally pleasant performance like the police stool.Fuller employers are great, moving sequences more aggressive and cruel (which is very intense in his time), the camera moves continuously like Tarantino and makes school forty years later. "Pickup in the South Street" is a nervous excitement of a great action. The Shock Corridor remains my favorite Fuller movie, but this is a very close second. (8/10)
