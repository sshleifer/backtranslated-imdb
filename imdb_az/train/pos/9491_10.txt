Henri Verneuil's film is not famous for the 3 Days of the Parallax View, Condor or JFK, but it is worse and sometimes even better than this classic genre of the genre. The hero of the action was killed by the so-called president that happened in the western state. After a few years of investigation, the special state commission decides that the president was killed by only one gunman. However, a man playing by Yves Montand - prosecutor Volney - has something else to explore and he thinks the film is starting. This film does not deal with some accurate theories, but it covers all the relationships between the government and the society in today's world. This film can only be done in the 1970s, but it will never lose its true truth. In addition, it is a little scary that oracle is as accurate as it is. From 10 to 10.
