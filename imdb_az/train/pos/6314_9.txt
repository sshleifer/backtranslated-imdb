I went to the cinema with my two friends and chose this movie off the hat and did not know what to expect. And that's a very enjoyable, funny experience! This is a great movie with very unexpected story, very good dialogue and crazy humor. All the characters are clearly being made in the style of "Alan Ford" (Italian satirical comic), but it did not bother me for the second time. In fact, such a loser-bums line-up made a unique and exciting movie. Sam Rockwell gave a very good and convincing role, Willian Macy de Clooney was hardly recognized and brilliant. But the real star is really Guzman. She has played a role in this movie! When Cosimo died in the movie, the scene was so fun that it would strangle me and almost die with it! All Alan Ford fans are highly recommended!
