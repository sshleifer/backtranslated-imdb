Friends of the first episode, released on September 22, 1994 in "Where Monica Receives a Hospice," has a song that sits in the window toward the end of Rachel's show: "If you need to keep" .... the artist has read or the song's title who knows? It looks like a great song .... I would like to get her copy. Thanks for help. I'm looking for the album / cd I get it. <br /> <br /> There are some shows to be sold to me, and you can repeat this show again and again. It just seemed convincing for hours of fun you've been ...
