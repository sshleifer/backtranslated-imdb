Ronald Colman plays the famous Broadway actor who started losing sense of identity and identity. After many years after playing a large part, he can not remember exactly who he is - who is his role and who is. And, more importantly, the game begins to be heard and heard in normal daily life. So he plays at Othello because he begins to act as jealous and suspicious, as a hooded character. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie a few years ago and liked it. I just saw it again and loved it. Now, maybe some enthusiasm, because I always loved Ronald Colman, and this is a great triumph for him and he won the best actor Oscars. Looking at the competition that year (Grammar PECK for the GENTLEMAN AGREEMENT, John Garfield for BODY AND SOUL, WILSON POWELL AND MICHAEL REDGRAVE), I think Colman has a very good choice of its usual comfort zone and has played a more demanding role. <br /> <br /> Now, I did not see a reviewer hating this movie because they hated Shakespeare. However, this movie is not really about Shakespeare, and it does not matter if you do not like Shakespeare. I'm not a big fan of Shakespeare, but I was amazed at the small part of Colman's play again - though, as I said, it's not really a movie about Shakespeare. Instead, it is a beautiful portrait of an actor who has lost the actor and mixes the scene with reality. <br /> <br /> Although Othello was a perfect choice for the murder scene, it could have been any game. Your favorite movie - With some overtones in the movie Noir. Fortunately, the player was terrific, as Colman's Signe Hasso, Shelly Winters and Edmond O'Brien (especially good - played right in his part) were excellent support. And it's a great movie from the beginning to the end, given the great leadership of George Cukor.
