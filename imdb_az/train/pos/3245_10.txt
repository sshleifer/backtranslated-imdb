I love this movie for a few reasons. I have a soft spot for movies about complicated plot areas such as TOPKAPI. I also enjoy the genre (TOPKAPI and BIG DEAL ON MADONNA STREET). <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen has come together for four years over the course of four years and has decided that he can be useful for a bank robbery planned in a small Montana town. But they have not provided any details of the crime or really know each other. Shortly after they were sent to Bernsen, two refugees were arrested by New Jersey police (Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck) and fled earlier and gave him an order to bring him back. Those prisoners are composed of four parts (Fred Gwinen, Lou Diamond Philips, Ruben Blades and Will Russ). <br /> <br /> The first twenty minutes of the movie are slowly intermingling with each other four blends. Gwynne and Philips manage to overcome their doubts in order to rely on each other. At the same time, Bernstein patiently waits for the right moment to escape from O'Neill and Roebuck - not very difficult, because they are not the brightest bulbs available. As a result, there are two areas in the film that will meet each other: Bernstein's scheme and its four drawbacks on how to apply it, and Bernstein restores his freedoms to his followers and his cabinet (and hopefully find the team to command his team ). <br /> <br /> There are many unpleasant moments in the film that a local house in the city of Bernsen, like Axton, captured by the Oeyneil and Roebuck, a third of the local anxiety and anger of the local Sheriff Hoyt Axton against the bearded New Jersey state beard hiding and shouting around (through a megaphone, "Come Out, We Have Covered You!" This phenomenon is a transition to a great Montana jet that flies and fights from the place where Bernsen is thinking of the police. there are moments of misadventures by four cons of us <br /> <br /> In some cases, there is no need to drive somewhere by car and it is necessary to leave the truck Unfortunately, a fertilizer truck is successfully carried out with robbery, including removing all the police cars critical time (Philips special car husband), as well as timing, tension and funny results.The film is very entertaining and of course worth seeing.
