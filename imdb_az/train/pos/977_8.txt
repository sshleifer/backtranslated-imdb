Where was this movie when I was a kid? After divorcing her parents, Tadashi moves with her mother to live with her father. Tadashi's sister lives near her fathers and often speaks on the phone. Dad is only "here" every three days. Moms are really at home. Children always choose a poor child. In a village festival, Tadashi is selected as a "dirt rider" or a spiritual champion of peace and justice. <br /> <br /> The little one suspects she will have to become a hero as soon as the dark forces unite with the anger of things that are being planted to destroy mankind and the spiritual world. <br /> It's an easy part. <br /> <br /> This is a great baby movie. No, this is a big movie, defective, (very defective), but less than a big movie. It is like all of these great books loved as a child, and Tadashi is sometimes in a tight state trying to find the strength to become a hero. While waiting, I felt I was reading a great book, and I thought it would be great if it was not for a book. I liked that the movie did not go normal. Things happen through frequent occurrences or miscommunication; a character simply enters the event of falling asleep. Of course, his Takashi Miike movie (this typical Miike) is more attractive for him, there are twists and turns and moments visible as non-sequiters. The Japanese maker of the film performs a very often touching, funny, and funny movie at the same time. Except for Miike, no one realizes that you can have many emotions or you may suddenly become confused as a second for a second and for the next funny. I believe that Miike has made a heartwarming and hopeful film, making a film afraid of fear, especially for children is really intimidating. It's the same dark place as Harry Potter, but rarely happens. It's a dark Grimms tale with humor. My first reaction started at a glance, and I found out who was filming after everyone believed that they would shoot a baby movie in the end of the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mechanical monsters, made by bad guys, are rid of the burdens of humanity. His anger burned by monsters. Yokai (alcoholic drinks) speaks about angry shoes because someone feels dirty or too little. And you have one of the good guys who refuses to join the bad guys, because it's going to be something for a person. Its a wild concept, but like other things floating around something that raises this film to another level. (Many parents have very good riffs and references to other films, television shows and novels that surprise the kids because they can not understand it) And, of course, there are monsters. They carry the boat from the cheese to a great place where they stop. Undoubtedly, we must forgive the inequality of their creation because they should be hundreds if there are thousands of monsters on the screens. His way is cool and working. One of the main characters is that Yokai, who is described as a hamster in the best tunic, and often playing with an animal, may seem dumb, and still tricks the tiny coaches and loves every moment he feels at Tadasi. . (Even if you've seen old wooden trees in strange Japanese monsters, it's easier to admit) I remember the flaws and have a few. The effects are uneven, and some sudden turns are less than two hours after watching the film, and it's a bit strange (even if it's understandable) and a few other little things. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie. You see me as a child, it would be my favorite movie of all times. (Where's the English dub?) See this movie. Its a great picnic. (Though Miike films are well-acquainted with blood and graphic sex)
