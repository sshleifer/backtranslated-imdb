Robert Wuhl teaches classroom students at New York University in Manhattan, New York University. <br /> <br /> It reflects the unrecognizable truths of history and truths. I would like to see more of this show. Very entertaining. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "show and report" to get his points. Paul Revere's Midnight Ride was not actually Paul Revere, a brown person! <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus> HBO. He is a good actor and a good beating comedy, but he is a great teacher! It is recommended that you watch an episode of this show. It is worth your time.
