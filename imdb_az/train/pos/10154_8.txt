I did not see the first Michael Vartan movie I've seen - Alias, and you would be wondering if this person could move. Of course, this film may be, and he likes this movie. Natasha Henstridge is certainly magnificent, but she has found it to be very good and beloved in the role of a more "sweet" role than usually in the physical and acting roles. Some of the negative comments I read are true, the film is full of clich√©s and the story is not true. Also, every character in the movie looks like one another and there is a screen chemistry. However, I enjoyed this movie. Places are good, characters are unpleasant and tolerant, and supporting actors are pretty good. This is not the case if you are expecting a great romance. But it would be great if you want to see a pleasant movie with the unpleasant character.
