This was a double experience. For some reason, the greatest scientific thought of the 20th century did not play any key role in the film. * The closest I can imagine with movies with Einstein is the feeling that a great man (like a deus ex ma-china) clarified to a point in the Radio Quiz show that Ronald Colman gave the right answer after all, and in BULLSHOT, the great Albert, is one of the many leading physicists and scientists who have been secretly exploited by the villain in the area where they have stolen some individuals. Let's note that in both cases and IQ we play comedy. So far no one has tried to make a serious film about Einstein's life, John Huston's attempt at FREUD with Montgomery Cliff. I think it is difficult for the world to turn the secrets of the theory of mathematical equations or electromagnetic field into an interesting dialogue. But then, just three years ago Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer beat a nice one. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <br /> <br /> <br /> Another surprise was the actor playing the great Albert. Walter Matthau has gone away from his career with Jack Lemmon over the last decade of his career. Matthau was both a comedy and a high-class and talented actor in the theater, but his comic staff, usually Whiplash Willie, was different from Gingrich's FORTUNE COOKIE. They were respectful and goniferous. Later they pushed their criminal tendencies as they grew up, but they remained sad. But Albert Einstein is really sweet. <br /> <br /> Albert plays as his elder brother, Albert. Apparently, Matthau Einstein lives with Princeton's nephew Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan) and sees a professor of James Morland (Stephen Fry). But Fry needs a car repair, and they drive to the auto shop where they work, Ed Walters (Tim Robbins). Robbins falls to Ryan, who is involved with her - but she finds out that she is deprived of the surprising mental equipment. His elder brother Albert, supported by three friends (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher and Gene Saks), decided to help Robbins and turn him into an unfamiliar physicist. <br /> <br /> This will open romantic gates with Ryan and Fry will not break things if it is affected by Ryan (<br />). <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is sweet, a super physics quiz that Matthau and his gravel instal help Robbinsine (by changing the body's position). The field finally explicitly implies that Robbins set up a nuclear powered missile ship - the country's president Eisenhower (Keene Curtis) in the nation's interests. <br /> <br /> It was an interesting leak for the charming comedy and Matthau, which was not as normal as hyper, more unhappy.
