<br /> <br /> Whether or not Ghost Train likes this movie version is always something and only one: Reaction to Arthur Aske's performance. <br /> <br /> He steal almost everything and is not always in a good shape. Sometimes, you would want to return a little or go back to improve the features of several characters. But in any case Askey points to Tommy Gander's character. <br /> <br /> Personally, I love the movie, even as Askey. I will not always be able to come to my office early in the morning and really can not find the energy to watch another. There is something to watch in the quiet darkness of the pre-dawn I've been watching for ancient b / w movies ...
