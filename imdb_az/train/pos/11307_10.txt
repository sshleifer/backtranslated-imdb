To capture the beauty of this movie, do not just play music, but sounds of sound, but all sounds help to capture images. The opening scene, which led to the exit of Gino, is a beautiful way of organizing the theme of good morals! Be careful that we're presenting the characters of music because we are in Giovanna's wedding. You will not find much of Italy's political life in 1943. This is not about it. On the other hand, if you are sensitive to pictures of music and sounds, you will become a word on the edge of neo-realism. According to the end of the film, there are landscape moments like Antonioni, which has more to do with the interior of the characters. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
