In this film, I remember that in this film, Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) lies in his cigarette, and then Ramone begins to see that he is in the room where he reads the song. <br /> <br /> "I love you very much" ... <br /> <br /> It was entertaining, energetic, quirky and cool. Yes, I will admit that the end of the end is far from the top and far away ... but this is a very funny movie because it's not fun. <br /> <br /> I really have sex, pot and Rock n Rocll. <br /> <br /> I read that cheap trick was the first group in this star .. But I do not know if this is true
