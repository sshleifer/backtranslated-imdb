Maslin Beach is a real nudist / naturist beach in South Australia's Fleurieu Peninsula, south of Adelaide. <br /> <br /> Maslin Beach is labeled as a romantic comedy. It's not a "cheerful" movie, and in a traditional sense it's not really romantic, but there are moments of light, which can be a little wrong. Life itself has many moments of sadness. It is also abundant in the nudist beach mentioned above and nudity continues along the film length. <br /> <br /> Simon and Marcie (Michael Allen and Eliza Lovell) are coming to the car on the beach. park They carry their belongings to the beach and when they go, they tell Simon about the love of true love. The rest of the film is a full-length research on the beach. The main story is Simon's love life, but there are many other symbols highlighted in many separate vignettes. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the beach, both Simon and Marcie appear compressed with each other. Marcie sees them as romantic couples of Romeo and Juliet. Simon has just been revived. After that, we met Gail (Bonnie-Jaye Lawrence), Paula (Zara Collins) and Jenny (Jennifer Ross). Gail's grandmother goes down the beach, discussing the chance to find a "perfect" man with a "necklace" powered by his neck. But there are more interesting people at the beach, not all "attractive" and young (part of the film's reality). <br /> <br /> There is a van with a flat, short ice cream merchant for serving the beach. This is Simon's friend Ben (Gary Waddell) and his unofficial consultant. I think this character is the main comic element. Nevertheless, there is almost nothing about me, because you were laughing loudly when you were drunk, male and very young! Although the Maslin Beach is a great value, it does not live much longer on any subject. Since the quality of the game is variable, the script is undoubted and everything about Maslin Beach is cheaper, and the lack of sustainability is a positive endeavor. Actually, I have something to invite to this movie (not nudity). <br /> <br /> The camera at Maslin beach is worth mentioning. It may be something related to its flawlessness and the attitude of tolerant "Austria" to religious matters. Sometimes very good, stunning static shots and beaches, rocks and sunsets "in pans." Nudity is a key factor in this film, and framing is an important aspect of camera work. There is no concept of excellence within the frame, so the frame is built so that the camera does not rely on the 'special' body parts. This makes it easier for anyone to feel traumatic in the subject's "personal space," and makes the film more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Maslin Beach post-pubescent, testosterone is not romantic for men who are exaggerated nor 'Mills and Boon' for 'skin whistles' or worthless women. . Maslin Beach does not look anywhere in the genre. Players are not "attractive" in the Baywatch sense, and "normal" people you see everywhere on the beach. Perhaps, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, of course, natural. In addition to Australian accents, filmmaking could be in any sunny country. Australia, which defines this film, is a meaningless thing (film verite?), Only the Australian Cinema and other medium-sized National Cinemas can review such an argument. At the same time, medium-sized cinemas have a place to experiment with identity, and 'flop' will not hurt their reputation. <br /> <br /> During this criticism I sounded very negative, and sometimes I have a negative attitude. About Maslin Beach. This is not a true position because I find it easy to watch the movie. I like it as a reflection of real and real people (and problems). The problems they face in the film are brought up and down a bit. It does not hurt me in my opinion, and I want more movies to be made so far. Here are some of the European cinemas, especially the French movie. They are rarely engaged in major catastrophes or disasters, but every day. Hollywood is directly opposed to this, and it draws on the strengths of hyper-real action / drama / angst waves. Speed ​​is faster than Hollywood, but that's not true. Maslin Beach is not exactly 'Jacques Tati', but it's a lot of culture, equality, gender intolerance, and so on. Even though he does not see issues, he is on the right track, which is of such importance in the current cinema. <br /> <br /> I love or hate this movie, but I'm sure it's a medium-sized place. <br /> <br />
