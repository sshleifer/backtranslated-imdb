This film is very well-traveled through almost all railroads, with great music and great visuals, without hesitation, without significant special effects. Although, like science fiction, it will be as early as it is mentioned for the future. That is, we do not say we have left the forest yet, but soon we will be in this situation in the 2022s. "1984", "2001: Cosmic Odyssey" (comparing the space station with the International Space Station) and Isaac Asimov's "I Robot" (pacronic brain was invented in the 1990s).
