I watch this movie again and again. I have to watch at least once a week. I'm from Africa and when I watched this movie, I learned some things I did not know about Africa. Denzel's films are lessons for all lifestyles. I wish he was my brother. I also saw Masala Mississippi and love it. What an exciting situation. When Denzel is trying to get his brother to work, my brother always reminds me of my young age when I'm mad at all times about dealing with me. My brother always cared for my old father and wanted to see me the same way. Where did Denzel take Africa's emphasis on the Cry Freedom movie? At first I saw the film in Africa and did not know that Denzel was American when I moved here.
