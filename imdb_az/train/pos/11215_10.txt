I first watched the Walking Tall movies at the age of 8 and both thought Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson had done a great job, because they had to be there because after watching the films I tried to learn about the Sheriff Buford Pusser. All three parts of the film gave me a shake, and this was the true hero of Buford Pusser, I just wish he was living today and that he has more people like him. I thank him for getting rid of the whole crime and for being brave. I was very sorry for the family to suffer such a horror and pain. My heart is reaching them. 30-year-old Sheriff Pusser and three-part Walking Tall films and actors describing him were trying to justify what kind of person they were, unless they were afraid of negative thoughts about these movies and actors. was a real Buford Pusser and how large a family he was. And all the young people who have not heard much about Buford come to watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about it.
