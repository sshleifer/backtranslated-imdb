I took the Hugo Weaving movie and watched it until the end. <br /> <br /> I used to call a movie that reflects the story of a real life without any unusual events in my life, and this is one of the most dramatic "life drama" films. . The rest were very innocent, but without much merit. I wanted something like an interview, or at least one matrix for the element of here and there, but there is nothing normal. The story teaches a person to face his own fate and to get rid of the environment created by others, but this is about to close the peach plant, and there is a lot of effort to change things. <br /> <br /> In the background, the "smart" American soundtrack could have been a part of a larger noise, but after a 100-minute movie, it was something that was playing again and again. <br /> <br /> In the end, I have seen a part of the Australian life, but I did not look specifically in Australia (it could be placed somewhere) and it did not seem attractive like that. Story. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, we must be in a mood to love the film.
