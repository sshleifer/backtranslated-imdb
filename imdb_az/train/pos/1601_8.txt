It's not very active, it's a very attractive movie. There were moments when the poet won Oscara's Best Actress award, but there was another time I was wondering why Glenn Close did not get fatal attraction. Anyway, Oscar and Gold Qlobe win, and Cher, who is nominated for the BAFTA, plays a simple woman Loretta Castorini, who has a low salary job asked by Mr Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) to marry her. Since her mother is ill, she should marry most of her family to marry, just as she promises to return a month later. The only problem is, when Johnny's finds a handless brother Ronny (Golden Globe nominee Nicolas Cage), they begin to begin the relationship and love goes on for that month's scene (the title came). He also named Vincent Gardenia Vincent Gardenia, Oscar, BAFTA, and Golden Globe, as well as Rose Castorini and Olympia Dukakis, who won John Mahoney as Perry. It ends with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but he and Ronny were happy together. Oscars won the Oscars for the best essay and won the screen shot directly on the screen and became a nominee for Norman Jewison (Best Night) and Best Picture for Best Director, BAFTAs for Best Price for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay and Best Film - Golden Globes for Comedy / Music and Best Screenplay. It was 100 years 100 numbers, 100 Quotes (over 100), 100 numbers for 17 years, 100 Capacity and 100 years 100. Very Good!
