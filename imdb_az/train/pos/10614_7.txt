Three girls (including all women, including the media crew, cats-actor Barbara Bach) came to a small town to cover a holiday, and had to flee homes as a lash in a home. Some of the unnecessary dialogue scenes and a very elegant line (which is a good thing to hide their secrets) are a good shocking one. Particularly worrisome is one of the main topics (eg vintage shock material) and what is the film's development. Performance and cinematography are quite parallel (in the same film in the early 1970's and in the early 80's), but it really brings me a long, long climbing scene to the basement. From the moment Keller Junior was introduced, his performance opened my jaw and did not come close to the end of the movie. The actor is one of the leading roles to have a great surprise to see Sydney Lassikin (who is facing one of the "Smashing Birds over the Slot" and demented in The Unseen now).
