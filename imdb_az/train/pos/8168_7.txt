Dentist Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) and his wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) start their marriage. On the surface, Mr. and Mrs. Feinstone have a wonderful life in Los Angeles, and there is a successful career, but it's very wrong under the circumstances. Alan discovered Brooke's involvement with the pool purifier Matt St Michael (Stadvec) to add to the animosity. Alan is then owed to the IRS, the next neighbor of Mattin, Paula Roberts (Lise Simms), who breathes his neck and causes money to slip. The field begins to lose its sense, it keeps everything rotting and rotting, like the teeth of the patient, and corrects it. She began to go to the hospital since she started her job, first hit by a young man called Jody (Brian McLaughlin), who after delivering sexual assault to the ruler of April (Christa Sauls) deliberately performs an unnecessary and painful procedure in her husband and at another. <br /> <br /> With the guidance of Brian Yuzna, I thought that the dental story was a good movie and made a bit of a try. differently. The script, prepared by Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon and Charles Finch, is a psychological tension far more than a flat slasher as an extremely unpredictable sight for me, as it would have been easier to make a teenage slasher movie on Friday, in 1980) high body count and the wise cracking dentist is abominable, but it really turned out to be that the dentist really is different. The dentist is a characteristic study of a person's being deceived in his heart, and I am not convinced of his conviction that enough justification for his subsequent lethal acts. It moves at a good pace, it's an entertaining way to keep my constant relationship between 90 degrees minutes between the decay of herpes and what she's around her. Anyone with a phobia associated with a dentist probably supposed to give a miss or say that he can not go again! <br /> <br /> Yuzna does his ordinary job, but I do not think he's actually seen a Yuzna. a film that I do not enjoy much, is a dreadful dentist with a dentist who is open and predictable to play with a dentist with a sense of fear, to pull teeth, to sexually abuse, to deal with drugs, and to torture people. There are also other scenes, a dead dog, some with a knife and cutting the tongue. The Yuzna film has a certain style for a low budget, she does not want to bend the camera for some nice angles, and I liked the camera stabbed and liked the sprays that splashed blood on the floor <br /> <br /> Technically, the dentist , beautiful makeup, music and production values, although some special makeup effects are a little convincing. The player is pretty powerful from anyone involved with Corbin, puts a good crackpot performance. No cool and genre favorite Ken Foree Detective Gibbs turns into one of the best in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Welcome to me and I think it's an hour's worth.
