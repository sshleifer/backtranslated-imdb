This movie is described as a comedy, but it was not a comedy. Like any Panahi movie, this was a very realistic drama that reflected the common thread of social inequality and hypocrisy. But it was very funny; The director's dark and serious circle (my favorite Iranian movie) is lighter. <br /> <br /> The girls' skill and the soldiers and soldiers who were among them were completely incredible (as documented) and absolutely cheerful. <br /> <br /> We were shocked by the real game shooting and results. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> One of the performances by non-professional actors is the very realistic Australian Kennyi. soldiers and girls? very reliable. Seeing the passion, frustration and excitement of these girls made a lot of effort. Do you think this movie should be viewed by a different Muslim girl who believes that any Muslim girl is in this country? <br /> <br /> For me soldiers represent the existing paradigm. All girls' desires were answered with a standardized official policy. As the film progressed, it was even more difficult to maintain this position. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If it looks like all Tehran's single holidays, everyone will take it and the laughter of existing policies is one and everyone's. <br /> <br /> It was a very moving and unexpected end, the film gave a truly blend of beautiful emotions, darkness, drama and social commentaries. Despite the fact that the adult film is about seven years, adult children are evaluating this movie (reading the subtitles). <br /> <br /> Panahi and Kiarostami, a repressive country like Iran, produce these cool films. Perhaps restrictions force the directors to be extremely skilled. Australian (and other) filmmakers could do one of their books.
