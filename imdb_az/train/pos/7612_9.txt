OK I would be honest when I saw the trailer for the software, thinking it was an ad for some sun screen products. With all the people on the beach. Nevertheless, I decided to watch it, and I thought it would be a new show that could make me laugh. <br /> <br /> That's why I'm very glad. <br /> <br /> Starting from the first 10 seconds of the program, I got connected, why I was lying in trees, why a plane crash and so on. Not a single show that brings together intelligence, humor, action and inactivity. But "Lost" manages them all. <br /> <br /> Lost is like anyone who sings the song, and will look at everyone who is sick of the hilarious sitcom and the evil reality television. Lost 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O 10 Tuesdays on Channel O
