In 1927, Hollywood became the center of the world of cinema for more than a decade. After building a million dollar industry and a vertical integrated studio system, some of the quiet points of the filmmaking plant took time to reflect. The last commandment could be a classic story of a prestigious human being who once dropped in difficult times, and stories about how the film was unrealistically re-created and how it could be an aggressive personality in the production process. <br /> <br /> <em> Emil Jannings </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Emil Jannings. Before coming to states, Jannings was primarily a comedian, often a prominent, but hilarious, time-mastered, often influential authority figure or old doddering. He enters the Last Command as the last one, and first of all it looks like one of Janning's d√©cor-comic cartoons. However, as the story progresses, it demonstrates the sequence of actors, a sign of sensitive weakness, sincere dignity, and ultimately awesome power and participation in the finals. <br /> <br /> Even though he is another immigrant, he does not have a frustrating exaggeration of anything (a German-speaking tradition that does not know anything bad), extending somewhat around Hollywood and having no background in Europe's film industry man Nevertheless, Joseph von Sternberg raised the image of the artistic and imperious Teutonic Kino Meister (prepared in this way) and made a very different approach to art. The notes in this picture are the driving of his pace and tone. The best example of Russia's first entertaining scenes. As you can see on the screen as the screen shows, the audience opens with a chaos set in motion, moving in the direction of each other. Then, when Jannings arrives, everything is solved. <br /> <br /> Sternberg's work is incredibly sedate and measured, and when players around it start to reflect, it's simply his presence. <br /> <br /> Sternberg is afraid of violence, snapping moments and still telling that it's happening with almost poetic pictures. In fact, it seems to have no interest in numerous activities. The rebellion of prisoners on the scene of Sternberg takes a calm and objective position, and finally, the camera falls into a flying wall. <br /> <br /> Compare this with the scenes between Jannings and Evelyn Brent. The focus of the meeting is a complex combination of intensive relationships that let us make mutual interactions. Sternberg seemed to be a cool and elegant director on the screen by William Powell, and it was probably a deliberate parody of Powell's imagination that Sternberg would be himself. Unfortunately, this tough approach has not worked with human beings and has paid attention to its technical resources on human resources, and smaller demonstrations in their pictures should be desirable. Jannings demonstrates a classic stick in the Charles Laughton mode, although no comedy has been said that no one is in his comedy. Evelyn Brent is pretty good, giving us good emotions, but overplaying here and there. The only performance that is approaching Yanning is Powell's essence. It is a little surprising to see the ordinary and great Ziegfeld, the typical beloved star of the typical favorite nanotochs, playing a flawless and humorous game, but it does a good job and reveals a terrible feeling of terrible horror. <br /> <br /> The Last Command could easily create a few feathers in the studio offices, since the film is forced to make any biased interpretation of the drafting process, even with such a relatively firm pattern. At least, I think many studio leaders will be dissatisfied with the "back in" appearance. In this regard, it has threatened the film's mystery, which is still very vibrant in this film. As you can see, Jannings is the best writer for Lajos Biro and Jannings, who has won the best actor award and, according to some sources, the issue is somewhat unclear. The best picture nomination. It was important because the Academy was a small organization at this time, and the first awards were more than just a refund by the Hollywood elite. But when they saw him when he was an elite or not, they knew good material and wanted to reward him.
