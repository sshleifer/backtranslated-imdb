In addition to Rocket Men King, it has been repeated on BBC TV in the mid-eighties. <br /> <br /> During this period, while loading a capsule, this series would definitely be included. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I believe that someone watching him will think it's ridiculous, but it's "Serial". Don Del Oro would laugh at you (when Mr. Dustbin was heading for me when I was less than my nickname) and he was funny after shot when he said, "Your bullets can not hurt me," then he stumbles less than less happy. <br /> <br /> In the first part I also love the way to Sebastian. <br /> <br /> I was watching it again because I have had good memories for a few years, we've got some good stunts and good music, water, floods, fugitive cars ... Besides Ralph Faulkner, except for the first episode my sword was not as good as I recalled and yes, it reflects the inevitable "flashback" episode! It is still 10 to 8 because it is suffering from slow pace, padding and other tricks. If you are interested in these series, I come to the book by William Witney "From a door, a fight, a door, a follow-up", although there is a small introduction on this series.
