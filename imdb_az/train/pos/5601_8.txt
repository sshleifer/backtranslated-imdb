I'm convinced that anyone who sees this movie will be satisfied, it's very creepy. Other films in Polanski's unofficial trilogy are creepy, but their creepy situation is different, but all of them are dealing with the same thing, and they are all clever. Undoubtedly, the striking people are terribly scary, each sending a crushing crash on my back so I have not banned from sitting here yet. When you see the other two films we have mentioned above, you'll find it pretty creepy, but I'm sure you'll wait for Polanski typical characters to think that you're holding it, it is aware of it, and you are deceiving. I think that Trekkovsky will turn back slowly, If you twisted for jump, maybe it's just me, but it's pretty graceful, but she's going to do it, there's no structure in these music. <br /> <br /> Along with this, Polanski, of course, does not have much time to imagine all the other characters in the film. Polanski really shows himself as a great movie maker, but can not just shoot and record great movies, but he can really move. I do not think there is another good man who can come out of Trekkovski's character, Polanski sat down to the right. <br /> <br /> I look at the movie as the director emphasizes the fantastic multilevel and talent that respects me, apart from the main iron. <br /> <br /> How did I do something about this movie in English? For those who do not know, this is a French movie, sponsored by the US, and more in English for commercial success. There are duplicate duplicates that are quite open and I do not know why, but the dog has a 3/4 part of the band to get an adult's mistake. There is a woman in the film talking about it, but I got the worst person to vote, I had a serious heartache to listen to my ears, the sound was the highest sound I heard for a while, it seemed a fake, but I think , it was a very small character. The dubbing in this movie was a pain and was not near (two completely different films, I know), as the film shot, I just want to be part of French ingredients and part of English. Another high standard, similar to a good, bad and ugly thing. When I understand it, I realize it's not a big problem, but it's bothering you, but I'm sure if you know French here, you will not try to sit down for a long time to read what you mean. /> <br /> You know Polanski very well, you know as you know, maybe you know some of your styles, but you really do not know what to do with this corner. This film is open for more commentary than the other two films mentioned above, and I am especially strengthening this feature. Personally, I feel that this is the best thing to do, but after all I'm sure, all of these are relatively close to the level of maturity. The latter is fantastic, it will not be able to come out for a long time and make it easier for you to go anywhere. <br /> <br /> I do not think too much about it, it's just to have my personal opinion and let it go. <br /> <br /> I'm rambled and really do not think this movie is so big, so I'll do it soon enough. If you like Repulsion and / or Rosemary's Baby, you will enjoy this movie at least. For those who are too weak for what you see, I also think that if you are looking for something, it's pretty clever to check the movie, especially if it's a very elegant thing, even paranoid, even better under Repulsion.
