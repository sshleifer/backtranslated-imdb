I've been an admirer of both Gackt and actor / singers, but when I first discovered this movie and looked at the trailer, that's my idea. After a long wait time, I watched it and made a comment. <br /> <br /> I think everyone is familiar with the story line and we will not talk about it. Instead, my first applause, usually Japanese movies, is brilliant and does not work. just beautiful and especially Gackt reflects his emotions of emotions and makes very good changes, as I like his dramatic and humorous aspects as part of the HYDE, his play is good, but as an actor, deliberately behind him, as it is his character throughout the movie. A movie movie was not particularly fond of lighting and some colors, but there are still bright moments for small budgets, but it's a story of the movie's true story. It's good for me, and the movie's theme of friendship is really well-developed and sometimes touching, and on the other hand it points to a brutal world that reflects these issues with visuals with some of the memorable death scenes. In addition to an exciting article, the perfect vampire movie of this movie is Interwiew with Vampire, played by the most beautiful (beautiful, beautiful) actors of the American movie, in fact Moon Child can be brother with Interwiew, but it depends on himself. Only MoonChild is a problem. sometimes slow, I'm a Japanese movie fan and I use it, but it does not change some of the useless scenes or symbols of MoonChild. I hope this movie is really good and very sensitive, and sometimes I hope to see other films for both actors and singers in the future. I recommend this to anyone who loves vampire-action-film-fiction and romance 8/10
