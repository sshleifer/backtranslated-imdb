Elvira, The Dark Mistress, the fourth wall is a couple of times broken, and the fun camp comedy that jokes are often under the umbrella. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is the owner of the horror show she has inherited from Morgana's wife. Thus, he goes to a small town of Fallwell, ruled by the judgment of the most terrible monster, covering the earth: Morality. Elviras's pertussis view is, of course, not a lot of cravings, but to get a different approach to the life of the city's children. Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), after Elvira's mother's books, is, of course, even worse. Look, Elvira is actually a magician, but he does not know. However. <br /> <br /> What is this, Elvira is a very funny movie, although the script leaves many places to improve. The most laugh comes from the difference between Elvira and good moral people, but there are some good visual sticks. It is good in all directions, but it will not be anything more than anything. Everything is good, deliberate, comedy. If you want something like that, that is.
