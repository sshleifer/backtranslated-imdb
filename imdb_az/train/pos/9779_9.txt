Three terrible stories based on transgressive Hindu religious members returning home, but in some way changing. Our first old religious figure is now in a madman's shelter and is visited by a journalist who wants to learn what he has been doing for the first time. Sitting with two chairs slowly goes slowly when faced with each other. The reporter is particularly interested in what leads to the death of the participants. An extremely boring thing is very exciting with a stunning twist in the story. <br /> <br /> The second floor is a visit to a psychiatrist for violent young offenders. The patient seems to have some sort of agenda, but the psychiatrist is up to the job. Still things get a little slow and strange. Then there is a strange twist that is very well written and surprising in the story. <br /> <br /> The last story links with the spiritual healer, who is capable of overcoming the illness of the hands. One of the patients is a member of the past, so successful healing is becoming more complicated. Again, we are surprised by a twist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> > It should be noted that the review of the German DVDs found stories to be written very well and the director completed each story with its striking twist and protection.
