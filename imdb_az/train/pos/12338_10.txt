Joan Fontaine is victimized by stars during the Viktorian era. She also reassures married women with her favorite lover and looks at a wealthy man named Herbert Marshall, Miles Rushworth. Marshal Miles is very good. Miss Fontaine played the role of perfection - at the same time cunning, computing, innocent, fearful and attractive. She takes an actress with her unusual talent to make it. Joan Fontaine seemed quite beautiful in elegant suits by Travis Banton. Also in the film is Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine Lady Flora. I love this movie.
