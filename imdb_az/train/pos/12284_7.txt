Jeremy Irons did not understand why they were talking about stupid teeth and that they should show the most striking accent behind their throat. In fact, this film has offended me very badly, and it's probably a great performance by him (it's very breathtaking). No other actor or actress has had such a trait, and when I have always regarded Jeremy Irons as a great player, I did not regard it as a handy one. The film reinforced my appetite, as some of the other interpretations turned out to be a very interesting film and I am now eager to read a book.
