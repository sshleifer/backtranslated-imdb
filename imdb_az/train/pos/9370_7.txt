I've never heard before watching this movie, I wondered if it was an independent movie, and I was right, but I decided to come up with a good toy accidentally. Terribly Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage), a job seeker in Red Rock, Wyoming, and Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's JT Walsh), owner of the bar, gives him a large amount of money. his loyal wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). It does not work, it takes money, warns Suzan and needs to leave it after turning it upside down. When Wayne knows his true identity, he follows Michael's burning up a big gun until he drives out of Dallas (Dennis Hopper) with Lyle. However, Michael is in a difficult situation because he makes a mistake because of making mistakes, and he is quickly retreating. Suzanne returns and both of them plan to leave their cities where they know they are in danger and fall into one another and add another complication. Suzanne goes to safety before they leave, and stealing a lot of money. Of course, not everything will go easy, and Wayne and Lyle approach them, and Lyle strengthens them and now tied to Wayne and buy embossed money. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve, and Michael and Suzanne are on a moving train, but it is clear that he cares more about money and gets what he deserves. Craig Reay's like Jim, Vance Johnson, Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart's deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel played Howard. The performances, apart from a bare Boyle, are beautiful and dandyical and have a very good cinema for black comedy retreat. Very Good!
