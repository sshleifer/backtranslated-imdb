In this film Bette Davis's cockney accent is completely horrific. I fully understand that Americans and other nations do not understand this, and that's good; <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke is half as good as the cockney accent on Mary Poppins, and it was a burden for the old pony (many apologies for London's rich). <br /> <br /> One of the most remarkable things is that I'm stunned by strange habits and exaggerated actor styles. Human Care is part of an exciting movie, despite its surface deficiencies. This should also be looked at in the future. At that time, the technical and cultural limitations of the film should be appreciated and these restrictions should be taken into account. John Cromwell is a very good job of directing the camera, allowing cinematic development, not just through the movement and styling of the story. A good example of its perfect orientation is the scene at Victoria Station. Beautifully designed, stuck and edged. Pay attention to the controversy of Mildred, who fell prostrate to the end of the film; <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is universal and compulsory: sexual restraint, unselfish love, respectful passion, self-hatred, manipulative relationships, social divisions and young heartbreak. Although the dialogue often hackneyed, these issues and characters are well-solved despite the difficult task of describing the inner life of a challenging task. Some of the obsessions and scene feelings are disturbed to watch, but the story is not clich√©; We know that characters (even poisonous Mildred) are both victims and criminals, and their actions are motivated by the feelings of each other and the misguided selfishness. But the nausea in the style reaches the sophisticated state of a person, and the sensitive nature of the moving and sometimes alike exchanges does not reduce the accuracy of the work. <br /> <br /> Human Care is the one you are talking about when you talk about Bette Davis's films in Hollywood, and you are aware that you are witnessing a famous career. Her unbelievable beauty and screen karizma (no one even humiliated or denied like Mrs Davis) grabbed her first appearance. Although the film is definitely a memorable performance, Leslie Howard is as sensitive and fragile as Philip Carey. Why, oh why did he not help him with that terrible, terrible accent even though there were good combinations?
