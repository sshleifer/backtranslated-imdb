<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lost movie star after CLAIM ** Inspector Holloway, "who died in the House," one of the best anthology films. (John Bennett) finds that the last report is in a large palace in the village. While watching the house, four different stories about the former inhabitants of the house are explained. <br /> <br /> Best Story (s) of the criminal procedure - to get the peace move Charlz mysterious manoraya writer Charles Hillyer (Denholm Elliott) and his wife Alice (Joanna Dunham), Dominic with the name of the story centers around a serial Strangler they were excited. After a series of strange accidents and experiments in the house, Charles begins to believe that my life was created and deceived her and her husband. Perhaps one of the better entries in the movie is easily creepy. What's different about the atmosphere here. Fictional scenes are really creepy, the mystery surrounding it is really effective and always has a classic creepy moment. The killing of the classic psychiatrist's office is always high for heartache. <br /> <br /> The sounds to the students, the quick burning of a mysterious thing, and the lightning and the lightning at the rear work well for that. a new house, the widow of John Reid (Christopher Lee), she moved away from the business, the younger daughter, Jane (Chloe Franks), a former school teacher Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) recruited. Ann gradually begins to reveal a dark mystery from Jane's past. When he learns the true nature of what is happening, he is shocked by what he thinks is possible. This is a pretty welcome entry with the horizontal open space and the greatest twist of stories. The secret of the family is beautifully played, where little clues are gathered here and there, and the last one is clearly nervous. <br /> <br /> accident - who tortured by memories of lost love Phillip Grayson, Peter Cushing) and his wife, Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) by giving up their lives in the statue of a woman with a statue of a pissing Wax Museum, as well as both they find a shocking mystery about the opposing museum. Here's a smart foundation and always gives you an excuse to spend time in a scary wax museum. This is not an exception and looks hearty when it comes to fluorescent lighting in statues. A dream sequence ensures a great moment of fear, but ultimately it kills one slowly. Events are time consuming and most of the time is spent on exposition. It is also built up to a shock that is more than a mile. These are really a bit down. <br /> <br /> Cloak-veteran horror film actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee), I could not stand the lack of realism in a row. his new film comes out and gets a new vampire dress from a specialized store. Frequently, his dresses make him a vampire, co-star Carla (Ingrid Pitt) and other vampires in the house. The cause of the pandemic is unclear, but does everything possible to prove that it is only imaginary. It has a pretty decent place and there are many good opportunities for some good fears, but what a few factors are. First, it is very lawful for its goodness. Finally, a wrapped ornament is a perfect example, which is really no shock and merely foolish. There are very few scenes of fear or a fearful attempt, which is just a hole to sit. The film is weakest. <br /> <br /> Son hökm: Çox yaxşı bir filmdir, bu mükəmməl, lakin hələ də yüksək səviyyədə izlənilə bilən filmlərdən daha az olan hekayələrdən birinə çevrilən bir neçə kiçik problem var. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating-PG-13: Violence
