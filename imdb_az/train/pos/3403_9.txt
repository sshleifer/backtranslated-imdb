Gorgeous Techicolor explains an unusual tale of romance between a Trappist monk who abandoned her and her monastery with a strong religious belief. The film opens in a monastery in Europe where an old pupil prays - a beautiful beauty named Domini (Marlene Dietrich). She is recommended by the Parent Superior to go to the desert and "find her" in the desert and loses her face over her father who died recently. In the car on the way to the shore, he sits in front of a very difficult man, Charles Boyer, our old monk. Soon, in a hotel near a very treacherous oasis, he sees again the mysterious troubled man, as he thinks he will do what he can to a dancing girl. <br /> <br /> This film is sentimental, melodramatic and varied (somewhat surreal and even somewhere). found it to be quite entertaining and entertaining. This photography is really interesting - the caravans of the desert horses are full of extravagant facial trails and silhouettes of beautiful sunshine. Marlene Dietrich gives a beautiful look despite the amazing performance here. Charles Boyer is usually not one of my favorites - it's really good, and I think it's a part of him and looks very young and beautiful. Buril Rathbone is very good here, except it is very small. Another great orchestra composer, Max Steiner, helps to spread the drama - a very enjoyable movie.
