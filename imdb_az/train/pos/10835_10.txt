I love this movie. It is still one of the movies that can and will still be able to track time and time. Congratulations! I believe everyone involved in preparing the film and script should be proud of themselves. You feel like you're watching a real life band. I would like to see such films. I'm very happy that they did not choose Hollywood stars to be in this movie because it would not work. Even though Billy Connolly was quite familiar, he really played a role and could not imagine anyone playing it. Again, congratulations, this film is really worth the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy. And when you go to the final scene ..... what can I say good?
