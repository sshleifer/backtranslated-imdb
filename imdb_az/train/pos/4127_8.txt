I know that poo poo, which does not resemble the original, is anything, but sometimes spin-offs can stand on its essence. I love the new iron chef because it resembles a Japanese version, but at the same time looks like the American spirit. I love Alton Brown as a commentator, because he explains a lot of things. Iron chefs themselves are very interesting. I knew that the originals were probably the best chefs in the world, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chief to beat them. Mario Batali expects to be sensitive when cooking, commenting and creating. I watched the series and found a good job with all the players. Judges are not always the best choice. There are a few exceptions, that is, the lawyer turned into foodie, but most of the judges can be questioned for service. I see that the cooks are watching and the opponents are surprised. Finally, eating always looks nice and sometimes inspires me in the kitchen. Probably the food that everyone can ask is actually served. The only thing that really changes the array is to ask for a little light on the show. Sometimes the mood is a bit tense and it is not always fun when waiting for more fun. I liked the version of William Shatner (Iron Chef USA), because it was as superior as the original, but we can say that it is a very expensive offer. Please wish this version is up and I wish you were home - Bill Shatner and Alton Brown would be amazed at me for one hour. I will not wait for the original Japanese version, and you can have a good time as long as you can accept this series for its essence.
