What a great surprise a man I was on the moon. First, I was expecting a cheese and a predicted movie, but I decided to put aside when watching. The most loved men of the month (in tears) are in confusion. This movie is very entertaining and knows its tone and it's just a fantastic movie. Acting, especially Reece Witherspoon was so sweet and gratifying) and everyone. There was nothing that really bothered me, and I felt that I was somewhat unpredictable, but I did very well. I also felt something straight or as if it were just a movie, but still a big movie. Generally, I do not want to talk much about this movie, it's not bad, if you only love or do not love a movie. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that this movie is a favorite. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
