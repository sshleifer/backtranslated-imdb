<br /> <br /> Joshua Seefley's first film - a satir of memorable proportions - as headline says: Corporations affect war. <br /> <br /> The movie is intended to help the American government send its messages to the leaders of the capital, Turagistana (a non-real) John Cusack country, fyi). He meets with Rapporteur (Marisa Tomei), and we know exactly how all of us will be with a single human + hot correspondent. In a mixed place, a pop star called Yonica Babyyeah is discarded. Because Yonica is married to one of the most important people in Turagyistan (president's son), the place where a soldier should watch well. The movie starts with a single Cusack in the bar; no more than fifteen seconds, the film will close you. With an entertaining and sophisticated idea of ​​terrorism and politics, the film shot you in. The film has more activity than it is expected, sometimes a war scene, good choreographic battles and simply delusional scenes. Although the story is not very deep, simplicity makes the movie perfect for both human and movie critics. <br /> <br /> Simplicity in the last actor of the film is very enemy and pushed all the way. I thought it was very well executed, but others can be happy and I understand why. Twist is all about the end of the twist, and like most movies, this is a true hit / miss situation. Three filmmakers (Mark Leyner, Jeremy Picker and John Cusack) made a fantastic job creating a real and fun satire abroad for today's situation. <br /> <br /> Joshua Seftel's film's integrity; the film is the most unwelcome movie (I'm scared that will happen). Seftel has created a perfect film: a lively atmosphere, both of which explore harsh reality and cartoonist frauds; - a perfect contrast to them - you feel like watching the entire movie. Seftel is really involved in all actions and is fully paid. There are no errors here. I hope she is doing more directing.
