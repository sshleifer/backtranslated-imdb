Two days after I saw 'American Teen' I saw this little Belgian ship. Do not make any mistakes on this subject, adolescence is a roller coaster trip, whether American or European. The girl, who wants to be in the swimming team at the school, is a young 15-year-old girl called Naissance des Pieuvres (or "Water Lillies" in the United States), who wants to become a swimming team at school, with Adele Haenel ). It is more than open to involve Marie Floriane. All of these are united Marie's pretty full, ugly friend Anne. On the way, some of the young people are shown in a usual range of broken hearts (such as broken hearts, alcohol and / or drug use, casual sex, etc.). This is a quiet movie that takes the time to enter your system (Michael Bay's fan, here is pacing s-l-o-w, so calm), but if you have no problem about it, Water Lillies is a charm. There is no rating here, but because of language, nudity, adolescence, I'm going to hit hard "R".
