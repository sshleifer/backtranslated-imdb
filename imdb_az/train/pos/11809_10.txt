Dick Tracy was not good for a very funny book fan, because he wanted something like Batman. Dick Tracy is guilty of having a funny book with cunning only those who have serious visual impairment and entertainment. Warren Beatty is guided and as the main character who fights the stars without using super powers. My daughter liked Dick Tracy because I was a kid for a red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black funny atmosphere. A perfect movie to watch with everyone's kids. Al Pacino resembles Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays great boy Caprice tastefully. Madonna does not play the same toy toy she represents as the second victim of a babe in this movie. I said that there is no blood, no injustice, sexual desires or anything that will not offend anyone.
