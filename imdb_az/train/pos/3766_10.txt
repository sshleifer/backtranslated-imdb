<br /> <br /> What this movie can do is not the most dramatic drama or the most artistic activity. But who dares to say that this film is not art? I am not a supporter of thought, a serious movie should be serious, non-commercial or questions worrying me. <br /> <br /> "Bogus Journey is not one of these films". What you get is pure, extravagant creativity with very positive, childish energy. This movie does not reflect the truth. His friend is naive and utopian. Imagine the future world described by Rufus - it will be a great time for a living combination for me! Except for this music; -) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney has been very well prepared. I've always liked cinematography and scenes of this movie. Bogus Journey, especially at this point, has a very high priority. And the effects are good and I think most of them are made without much cgi. In general, I prefer good old effects on big budget movies. Make sure that some peoples have 'another Hollywood movie'. <br /> <br /> A short word to the conversation: all band and orchestral music are very well suited to the film. And there is no shortage of sound design. I am not a big fan of rock music, but I have to take this station to the station by Winger. <br /> <br /> I say these words: <br /> <br /> This movie is very naive and very creative! Panzerkreuzer is a better way than Potemkin, The Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - God's anger. Citizen Kane, apocalypse now or Chris markers are absolutely superior to the horror ... ... better than Total Recall ... In no way! Yes way! Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey are just the best movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Whoever does not have the courage to plead guilty of guilty behavior or loves Terminator's Salvation. <br /> <br /> PS: Part 1 is not a better movie. That's why Bogus Jorney is a great result. Even Terminator 2 is a great result! This is not it!
