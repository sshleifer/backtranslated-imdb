Peter Bogdonavich has made a few really great movies and all of them are one of the best barren. The player could not be better equipped to play this light, but somewhat bittersweet screwball comedy. Interestingly, the witty, light touch Bogdonavich is working so hard, giving the film a more emotional emotional nucleus. Fresh and instantly, the movie starts with no explanation. There is no music to entertain us. We welcome symbols on the move and Bogdonavic moves to the streets of New York, and the film opens easily. Robby Muller's camera is accidentally seen by a simple symptom, but not necessarily. Casting is terrible. In every way, classic.
