I love this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra does not have enough chances to read this movie, but it's not just a Frank Sinatra movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vivian Blaine is only good in this section and "Adelaide's Lament" favorite songs. <br /> <br /> I thought Jan Simmons was perfect for this part. Perhaps I did not see it at first, but after seeing it, I was meaningful. <br /> <br /> Michael Kiddin's choreography is endless. <br /> <br /> If it had been staged again in 2008, I would not change anything. <br /> <br /> I understand that something has disappeared from the stage version to the version of the movie many times, but it keeps the scene. <br /> <br /> I thought the film was well shot. I have spoken in regional versions and this is one of my favorites.
