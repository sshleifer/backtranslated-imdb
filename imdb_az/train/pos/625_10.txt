In the afternoon we filmed our children and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and almost Wow. <br /> <br /> I am a rare thing, but it's probably the biggest fantasy movie <br /> <br /> Of course, I have a good friendship, flowing, flowing, flowing, I could be sucked with a nice dialect. <br /> <br /> I can go on for a couple of days for the famous actor, perfect as Charlie Cox Tristan, Claire Daines Yvaine as Diamond and Robert Di Nero Deeper <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Caucasus pirate Captian Shakespeare <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> > One of the few films would make this movie a great movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects were perfect, t <br /> This was LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but it's a great deal to distract yourself from the film and mix it in a good way is not. is the story? What can I say? How often do you come across a story from the classic fairytale formula components that do not come as a cheap Princess Bride knockoff. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that this was a good movie, all of them merged and filmed a great movie, but these elements that are pale compared with the rich magic world are united to bring good life. Once again, Neil Gaiman did it, and she brought another lady to her, creating a beautiful and spectacular fantasy world. I did not want to finish it, I wanted to enter the Stormhold land and get to know Tristan and Yvaine, travel through its fields and valleys, travel through the markets, and meet with its inhabitants in a dangerous and dangerous way. friend and stay there forever. I realized that I understood that when I read everything from Gaiman, The Sandman, American Gods, and Coraline, I was left with a deep sadness, and I did not see anything anymore. I am convinced that Neil's writing and that's why the film will not have the same effect on anyone, but I trust it when I say that you will not regret the time or money you watched, this is one of the best five films I've ever seen, and I'm all in one spirit with at least looks like.
