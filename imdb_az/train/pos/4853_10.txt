There is something for this type of old black and white films, especially for films by Will Hay and Abbot & Costello. I chose this movie on DVD because it used the same idea as "Oh Mr Porter", one of the best comedy prepared by Will Hay. I just finished watching this movie just 10 minutes ago (the movie ended at 12:45). Such films include Ghost Trains and others. People who are in contact with the lights are watching the best at night. More and more night-time movies with this movie work well with this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the liners in the film may seem to be a little bit imagine, so it depends on the audience. Although they do not belong to me. I'm 28 years old and I'm not old enough to be around when this movie is released for the first time (though my dad is). I still appreciate many of these old films. Sitting in the room with some snacks and drinks on the TV and watching these films while sitting in a room for a night's relaxation and relaxation, we can not defeat the feeling we get when doing so. <br /> <br /> For a while, it's a reality run. <br /> <br /> I saw that in the movie, one of the men (who had a black mustache) after the car crash saw three-fourths of the movie, and she was looking for a woman who was followed by the station. This guy was in the Will Hay classic "St Michaels Ghost". <br /> <br /> The film is very atmospheric. It looks good on the edge of the abandoned station and there is no mood for the shaft in any direction and it is comfortable to stay away from the rainstorm outside the station. I felt like I was in the movie. The atmosphere of this film is something that is missing from many films now. <br /> <br /> We need more movies in today's market. But, unfortunately, he looked in favor of films with nudity and blasphemy and rough humor. Making the film in this era (The Ghost Train, Oh Mr Porter, etc.) The movie is golden age !.
