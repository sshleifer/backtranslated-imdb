A single depressed French boy Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) who is on vacation in the summer gets acquainted and falls into Cedric (fabulous Stephane Rideau). Silent and slow is a very frustrating film. On the one hand, I swallowed it and really felt for the two boys. On the other hand, I felt uncomfortable - the movie burns from the past to now, without any heart or no cause. Very mixed and meaningless. <br /> <br /> AIDES AID! <br /> <br /> Also, there are a few tones of empty space - Mathieu, at one point, is doing something in the hospital. What we did not say! Then she broke down with Cedric and talked to everyone who lived with her. Why? It was not told to us. Then, in the end, he connects with another guy indefinitely. Why? There is no explanation. Obviously, Cedric loves Mathieu and Mathieu lives in the same city ... But there is a character that is very important to the film. <br /> <br /> <p> I was not as good as my friend Mathieu. He has a tall, beautiful and beautiful body - but he can not move. Her idea of ​​her activity is slipping into her face with an empty view - all the time. Rideau, on the other hand, is great. There is a very beautiful, very beautiful body, and one player is hell. And there's an amazing sexy angel about it. The film is full of frontal men's nudity, very kissing and a fairly open sex scene - most movies are afraid to show love for men and women. <br /> <br /> So, it helps to see how the characters care for each other and how they feel. <br /> <br /> So if you are a frustrating film, but a little worth seeing - especially for Rideau Nud scenes - if you love beautiful-looking naked youth! <br /> <br />
