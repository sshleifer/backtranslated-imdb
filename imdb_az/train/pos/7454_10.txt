** Warning - this post can be spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I bought only one Gamecube in September 2005 and got the first two games James Bond matches, a decent Agent Under Fire and the boring Goldeneye Rogue Agent. The next game was everything, or nothing, because my friend said that I was better than two games. I want to say that he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought one for ten men at HMV and when I came home I hit him on the cube and played it at the end of the hour. It was better than the other two games and had a much better and more interesting story. Graphics was the best I've seen (but now with XBOX 360, there are some of the best graphics available for Farcry Instincts Predator). This story was clever; (Called Madame Dafoe, Nicolai Diavolo) and a wonderful refugee (Heidi Klum, known as Katya Nadanova) to the world at the start of the game, James Bond tries to destroy the small nanobots that are forced to destroy. a train. The bad thing is that Katya has hidden in one of the fungus. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing about this game is that there are 27 levels of Q., some of which are short, and some are pretty long and difficult, for actors that sound the actors. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Vote - 9/10 The repeat value of the game - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> This game is a total of 90%
