Incredibly interesting and charming, I noticed that after starting watching it was not possible to turn away. I am the most harsh critique at all, but this movie was just brilliant because it can almost smell the air and feel the tissues of the places. <br /> <br /> From a filmmaker I thought there was a great deal of light and weaving. From the orange light of the summer light to the plastic sofa, there was a separate air of realism for me. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of one character, Victor Vargas's idea is almost inspired by this story, and each of the other members of the family has more intrigue in the main character, after having a more complete background. <br /> Besides, recognizing someone like a grandmother When I come up with such a situation, I feel that the situation is particularly real. <br /> <br /> I thought that this movie was working for me, because I waited without waiting and saw that it was completely immersed. and brought back the memories of the young emotions that were in the heart of the excitement.
