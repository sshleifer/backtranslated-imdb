Almost all movies take place in the Chinese public bath. <br /> <br /> When a son comes to his home when he believes his father dies, there is no fancy kit, explosion, and no attractive people - just beautiful writing, action and direction (Hollywood, watch out!). He is surprised to find that the Father looks beautiful and continues to manage family business in a typical way. In fact, she sees that her father and brother are really close and caring, and soon she sees that she is out of the loop! The father is very conscientious and this visitor is from the big city and does not actually see the value of the old bath. <br /> <br /> Every Chinese movie is not in the form of a motion (like the actors Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, the Hidden Dragon), and I'm not particularly concerned about these cartoon films. Shower in a small town, as well as good examples of good Chinese movies about Spring Village!
