This movie is a half documentary ... and it is quite interesting ... <br /> <br /> This is a good movie ... Based on the true story of many Norwegian saboturs, heavy water production and heavy water in Rukjan, Norway, release <br /> <br /> This film was not perfect and could have been a bit better ... Some of the movie saboturs are being played by themselves <br /> <br /> If you are interested in the history and film of the Second World War, this is a worthy movie !!
