Bourne Ultimatum is the third and final destination for super-spy Jason Bourne, who was killed to kill those who murdered him. The Bourne series is one of the critically acclaimed trilogames by critics (Ultimatum has 85/100 on metacritic.com, that is, its status is "universal acclaim") and a good cause is a good choreographer and a deep story. <br /> <br /> First of all, I advise Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy to follow the Ultimatum two treacherous precautions. There may be three different films, but in fact they are the endurance of a person who has lost one another, as if it were my curl and mixed. If you miss the first two, you will still enjoy the Ultimatum's action and battle scenes, but then the story will definitely cause some confusion. /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to see the prequels of this movie, Bourne is likely to take his enemies and follow him from Supremacy. Jason Bourne plays very well by Matt? Damon Dayman does nothing worthy of Oscar's motto His job is enough to catch himself here. Adventures of Bourne occur in many cities; cities are fairly varied enough to ensure that the film is sometimes moderate. <br /> <br /> Bourne, the trainee Bourne, takes advantage of every technological instrument he has known to people to follow. <br /> <br /> I will not give detailed information about the cartoon because they are the continuation of the first two films. However, it does not hurt the film to write a few things for the audience - not every spectator is a horrible movie watcher who can get every little clue about story development. Ultimatum generally admits that a movie is successful: the film has been $ 69 million - and the total cost of the box office is $ 216 million. It is now very strong for a movie in theaters since August 3. This is the best action movie I've ever seen since Live Freed or Die Hard. <br /> Well) Damon is solid, but not spectacular, very clever movie Bad) The story looks like each other
