Do not read anything about this movie (especially with nothing spoiler). Only watch this beautiful movie without knowing it - and it will be a really great experience. You want to see a clever, twisted story: Go, buy a DVD, and you will not really be disappointed. "Cypher" is not really a fantastic movie, but rather a psychological tension placed on a globalized business environment. It's about corporate secrets, how big companies are spying on each other's research departments and their methods. Players perform a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides the perfect cold regimen. Cinc is much deeper, more complicated, and relates to the story and the end - Vincenzo is much more satisfying than Natali's other films, Cube and Nothing. In fact, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen (and it's really something that I do not mean about every fifth well-designed flick). Unfortunately you will not be able to provide more information about this movie. Simply give it a chance. ;-)
