Sergio Martino was surprised by the Giallo classics and "Mary Wardh's strange assistant" in a memorable way: "Your deputy is a locked room and only me" - but if that were not the case. The Scorpio Queue is not mentioned as the above-mentioned names when it comes to the classic Giallo debate - but why I did not know it because at least these two are good! Dario Argento could be Giallo's "king", but he's not really behind the five films he has prepared - Sergio Martino. In some ways, even superior to the master. All the Martino films were on the Argento crown, in the spectacular Profondo Rosso, in the early 70's - the king of Martino. The territory is watching the killing for profit and watching a rich man's insurance payment. His wife inherits $ 1 million and his life does not start long! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two employees of the Martino company were on the boat. The most famous Corell Hilton has worked with Marino and Mary Wardh's Strange Assistant and All Together Colors, along with a number of other Giallos. The Hilton has a great screen presence and every time you see it in an Italian thriller; why it was beaten repeatedly. The beautiful Anita Strindberg, which will be remembered by your staff, is a closed room, along with Hilton, and provides a classic Giallo female appliance. Sergio Martino does a good job at the director's chair with some nice scenes - the best ones are in a room full of green light! Bruno Nicolai (Wardh) is a perfect mood of the score, but it is again a force behind Martinon's success. Martne's other four Giallo's writer, Ernesto Gastaldi, wrote an exciting scripts when he left the common sense of Giallo pitfall; releases this movie from the illogical genre. The Scorpio Queue is a quality Giallo movie and is a great success for the great Sergio Martino. If Giallo wishes, you will love it!
