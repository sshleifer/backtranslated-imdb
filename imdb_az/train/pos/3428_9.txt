I saw this movie at NYC on Landmark Sunshine today. I did not know what to expect, I did not read it much, but nevertheless I will see it. All of them are very good. It was aimed at summarizing "war on war" and left politics for me. Soldiers spoke mainly about the toxicity of the training at the start camp and said how difficult it is after returning to the lives of the citizens. Paul Rieckhoff and Camilo Mejia were not just a war, but it was really good to see that they had difficulty refusing to return when they turned against individual morality. Do not make any mistakes - this is not a war movie. Everyone who says this has not seen him or lived with traces of war against himself.
