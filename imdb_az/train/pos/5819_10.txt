I loved this movie since it first came out. I was nine years old, and now I'm 27 years old. I play video games in Sega Genisis. I really enjoyed my son to show this movie. He also loves Michael Jackson and I know he will love this movie when I'm a kid. Even though it's smaller than I've been seeing for the first time. It is impossible to wait for the DVD to come out! I hope it goes on the DVD! Please go to DVD! I die to see it again! Well, my comment is hopeful that one day soon I will re-run this movie. I like all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video Badder!
