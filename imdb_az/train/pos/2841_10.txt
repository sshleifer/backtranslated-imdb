As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, and I'm very glad. Fortunately, I met all my expectations. It was funny, sweet, fast paced and entertaining. The film begins with two cab hop hopers (Bradley Cooper and Justin Bartha) who want to go to the same area, but disputes with the ongoing way. It was funny, and then the movie turned into one of the best sketches I've ever seen. Four good things were all good. I'll talk about four people. Alee LaBeouf uses an old lady as a bellhop in a hotel that is in love. In another, Orlando Bloom uses Christina Ricci as a musical instrument that deals with a woman playing. On the other hand, while Antony Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly are on the way to two men, Thirbly's character is a disability. Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman are one of the best duplicates of the old couple. Nataile Portman is an influential directing director and writing a sketch on a guard, Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are as good as a flirting man and a prostitute. New York, I love it, it's good, though not better than Paris Paris 2006. Sketches show good paced and movie indie movies really should. The film, however, does not have many famous directors like Paris Je'Time, so it's fantastic to live in a perfect fit. If you want to laugh, if you see some great dramatic effects, play an incredible spectacular performance and just have fun, then go to New York and I love you.
