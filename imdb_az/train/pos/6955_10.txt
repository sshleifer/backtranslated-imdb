My Super X-Girlfriend is a hell of a roller coaster ride. The special effects were perfect, and the suits were wrapped in a hubba bubble worn by Uma Thurman. Uma Thurman, an unreasonable comedian, has proven to be wrong and has turned her into a clever girlfriend. She was just FABULOUS! Luke Wilson was also good at moderate Joe, but was a brave man to work with one of the greatest actresses of all time. <br /> <br /> Ivan Rietman did a great job in managing this movie because it was very good, if not for her (better than a horrible film franchise). and Uma Thurman would not have done this movie very well. This film is obviously 10/10, its layout (Uma Thurman), director, scenario and its original plot line. This movie is recommended at a very high level.
