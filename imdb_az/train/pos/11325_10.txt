When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I have to say that the first thing I've seen is understanding it. I have to see this show and I did it really. It was best when I took the first volume of the show. I really liked the animation and all the fighting scenes were awesome. My favorite characters in the show were Saber and Archer, and of course, I love Illyan. And, of course, all episodes of volumes were interesting and very cool. Another thing about the series is Michael McConnohie (known for Transformers and others) who plays Berserker's voice. It is a cool character. And even watched the entire series before watching the final volume. If you see a good thing, you see this show, this is the best.
