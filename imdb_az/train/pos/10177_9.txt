"De Grot" is a controversial Dutch tension, which is the basis of a book written by Tim Krabbé. In 1988, part of the book "Het Gouden Ei" became a great Dutch trophy called Spoorloos ("The Vanishing"). This is not as good as the tension ('The Vanishing', though better than American remake), but there are times when they are approaching. <br /> <br /> Particularly, opening moments are intimidating. We saw a man, and then we learn his name from Egon Wagter (Fedja van Huêt), coming from an airplane in Thailand. It is obvious that they missed something along the border when they took their bags. These scenes are perfectly directed, shot and moved. Normally, some kind of suspense is created that you do not like on an opening scene. <br /> <br /> And Egon sees how a woman deals with a woman in Thailand, and says that she does not do anything like that. <br /> <br /> From this point on, the film has been going on for a while and is progressing. How Egon began to play friendship with a boy named Axel (like a kid playing by Benja Brujin), as a child playing by Eric van der Horst. We learned that Axsel's (Marcel Henseman's adults) played a part in sex relations. Meanwhile, Egon goes to the college and is busy with a woman. <br /> <br /> Sometimes he faces Axel for a while, but he has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> The film is a timeline. Egon and Aksel are more like children, students, adolescents and mid-30s. But from time to time, as I said, when the movie is again children and it is moving again. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Although the film has come to a happy end, in fact it is not happy. As initially, the end is endless. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and as a rule attracts the attention of the first scenes, only to come to this end. The film ends with a happy ending, though we can say that the dramatic end is somehow happy.
