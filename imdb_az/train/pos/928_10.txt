I watched most of the series that I could handle to watch television, but unfortunately, I started working on a business evening. Of course, I was able to capture some of the articles and, of course, bought the recently released DVD. While watching the DVD, we can see that the animation is somewhat smaller, but after the pilot has been executed, we've dropped a fair number of shortcomings. Sounds match characters and writing is very good. It is very refreshing to see the remature of the subject matter of adolescence getting rooted in animation. When it comes to the past century, society needs to be understood by today's standards to be recognized as an adult-oriented show. Heroes have very real personalities and are placed in parallel with what we often encounter in real life. In this regard, a typical sitcom, but humor is like a talk show on television night or day, as you would expect on a Saturday night or Saturday night ... when the SNL is actually laughable. Good job, Dreamworks. Perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to pursue this series ... and also increase the marketing of goods for the series to help pay for these high costs. Nevertheless, it is difficult to do this for an adult cartoon. Hmm ...
