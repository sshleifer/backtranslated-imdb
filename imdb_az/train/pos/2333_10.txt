Recently, I started watching this show and I want to say that it really made me laugh. In addition to everything else, you should also evaluate its non-realistic aspects. Some people, this show, said the dead are more responsive to other things. If you agree that Ned can take the dead back to life, you must accept the other crazy bits of the show. After each episode I watched, he could not help smiling. I have a really good show to really show you a really strange topic and really watch. I absolutely love this story, adding extra miracles for the whole show. You can not always compare older shows by a writer, and take everything as your own. Of course, give it a chance and enjoy the funny parts like them.
