I love this TV series. interesting and beautiful animation. I do not believe they cut off the television, and cybersix and probably never knew whether the data will die, they probably survive, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was the best BEST TV show ever. I know it's time to delay, so they will start again and I'm glad to watch it. </ Span> </ span> </ span> </ span> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A woman named Cybercrime, not human. A high school adrian sieldman is a teacher. Now cybersix is ​​really a woman, she is hiding as a man during the day. <br /> <br /> A guy named Von reichter has created a cybersix, and once he finds it, he uses everything he can to save his life. <Br / <br /> If he had not watched it before it was completely loaded. It was the best TV show in the world. Why did they cut? some people have issues. but I'm glad to watch 13 episodes.
