True, the book does not follow very closely, but it's still fun on the story. Swayze was better than I expected. <br /> <br /> Doody saved a terrible woman from the depths of the wilderness with the expectation of the majority (Kate Capshaw in the Indiana Jones & Doom temple). <br /> <br /> In any case, <br /> <br /> Richard Clerley is more stylish than Quatermain couples. <br /> <br /> It reminds many westerners in many respects. The only thing that interests me is about mysticism, but this is part of the genre. "How can the African adventure story without cadet doctrine and preternaturally wise browsing tribes?" Heh.
