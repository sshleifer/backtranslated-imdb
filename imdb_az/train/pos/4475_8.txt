The United States is still fighting the Second World War (film was given between days and days and VJ days). Every studio falling into salt was either a battlefield of warlike American soldiers, or American Americans were dancing and dancing. Technicolor Musicals were the things that America developed in the days when everything was in trouble. Most of the day's music was just a few musical pieces and fun with the best tracks to fill the next musical number! <br /> <br /> This film was called "search for Jose Iturbi", but why is everyone wondering now? . Let me explain. Coming to America in 1929 - was one of the best pianists on the Iturbi concert scene before his death in 1980. In 1942, he agreed to shoot several films, but Hollywood was about ten years later. Not a successful pianist, but a successful conductor, Iturbi had been a home for more than 40 years. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Another 17 pianist Liszt's Rhapsody planned scene early - and the other pianist have never seen all the kids? Making this movie and many other MGM music, Joe Pasternak celebrated Iturbi with an interesting American youth in classical music. When Grayson wanted to sing in the film with Iturbi, he was no different from the real life at that time. Everyone wanted it back. The joke that took place among the soldiers means "GI", "Get Iturbi" (he gave many concerts in military bases). Gene Kelly was a great dancer and Frank Sinatra was a perfect singer. This movie was Sinatra 30 and only four years was under contract with the Columbia Records. <br /> <br /> Kelly was already known as a dancer, but Iturbi was a world-class sensation for 20+ years. <br /> <br /> Americans did not need a plot to make a plot. They were tired of the war, frightened because of their loved ones, and became disturbed by the future. They were convinced that happiness and hope and things would work well at the end. They needed music and smile, they needed joy and romance. <br /> <br /> This movie and those like it just delivered what they needed. <br /> <br /> Sufficient teaching. Mouse dances aside, the best scene in the film is between Sinatra and Iturbi, each of whom teaches the "ignorant" music. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in Jose Iturbi, leave more than the Spanish De Soto, Cortez and De Leon, who have conquered more, from the United States, www.joseiturbi.com, here's a summary of the day, day "and this and other MGM <br /> <br /> Trout.
