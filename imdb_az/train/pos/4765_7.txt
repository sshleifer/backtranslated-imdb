<br /> <br /> This film is linked to the brutal dilemma between the life of a life dedicated to God and faith and the life of more secular pleasures. <br /> <br /> France during the war in the Caucasus is also linked to the fatal dimension of faith. <br /> <br /> This can not be a lifetime movie, but it's a sin to avoid forgetting. Moreover, Pierre Fresnay is magnificent.
