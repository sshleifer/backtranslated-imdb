Just a few minutes before I finish the Cronols of the Hero of Disciples I'm extremely sorry, but the questions are still up to me. Despite the fact that the first seven episodes or indeed the first War of the Lodos War, the truth is not true. The creator of COTHK had a different vision of how the original ends (the first 7 episodes may have happened), but I do not see it. CotHK says it's part of Parn, which began five years after the Parn War. In my opinion, the first 5 episodes of the director appear to be a small reminder to the audience and to be a copy of the original to enter the characters and give them the deeds, but it seems very little to start with the series Spark story. Now, when we sail into the Spark part of the series, we threw ourselves in 10 years (15 years since the Heroic War). Spark and his crew, in some cases, go for a walk to Parn and his crew, especially like the story of a love story between Spark and Neese. I also thought about CotHK several times that I threw it into the original series and knew that if the spark had not been long blue hair, I would have stopped several times to make sure it was in the right disc. At the same time, this is the backdrop of great support, and the writers have done a good job in the making of convincing characters and a remarkable story. The only thing that damages me is the return of Ashram and Wagnard. Ummmm ... how? Although Ashram's only foreign character supports Marm, I am not mistaken, and he is a big looter. Perhaps I left something in front of the series that describes this section. Although there are examples, I love CotHK. I have both the CotHK and the more I am the original record of the Lodos War, which is the Lord of the triad of rings. It's more epic than anything I've seen or read. I highly recommend this.
