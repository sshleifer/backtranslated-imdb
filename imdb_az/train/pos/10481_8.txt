A sweet little movie that will not offend our grandmother, "Grace Saving" seems to be cut with the same piece as half a dozen other English comedies over the past two years ... underdog faces a shortage <br /> <br /> Widow and therefore broken, Grace is a master garden and his friend / employee is sent to help Matthew grow the pot. He does everything wrong, so Grace helps him. They realize that they are a perfect person to win their pot, so they can also benefit. She smokes, she needs to raise funds to pay her mortgage. <br /> Some of Grace's London trips look like a white gown, sometimes as a painful thumb, as in White Night's New Year's Eve suit. <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always beautiful, and I can not say it about many people. Anyway, I can not. Ferguson is very good and Tcheky Kary, my favorite at La Femme Nikita, is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> It feels like a picnic with friends who do not think, but are not very entertaining and at 90 minutes speedy. 8/10.
