When it comes to good communication as a sudden actor, Eastwood's attempts to act as artistic failures at some point in his career. The reason for this is not the film itself, but rather its attitude towards inconvenience. In some places, it really owes Death to the original Dirty Harry movie. At the end of sin may be claimed that there is a film of sin, justice, and revenge. At the end of the day, sympathy for me is much more empathy. However, given all these arguments, suddenly the sudden effect is a very good movie, so it's easily ignored. Forget the peak of "Go out of my day", it's unique, but not genuine. However, look at San Francisco's views of the city and its approach to the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are very spectacular. Or look at a bright area where Sondra Locke's character visits his mentally ill brother in the hospital. Eastwood uses a great deal of facial tissue. Thus, the entire Sudden Impact movie is really a very clear film that shows how Eastwood's director will be. Actually, for the first time, Eastwood puts it on the screen even though it's in the action movie of controversial ideology. Additionally, I think this is a well-paced film focused on Eastwood. Despite his great talent as director of Eastwood, dramatics has always been his weak spot (see Misty Play for Me, Breezy, etc.). The goal of the novel is well-integrated into the film and leads to the story. Indeed, something that is nervous is a farting dog.
