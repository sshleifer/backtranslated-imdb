Irving Thalberg would never try to repeat this movie today. Maybe, this story was written by a westernist, because it was from Pune Bucking, Pulitzer Prize in 1932, even though it was diagnosed with Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin, and Walter Connolly, Her daughter, Ms. Buck, apparently brought China closer to America's consciousness than anything else. China's political struggles, not everyday life and desires of good people. Unfortunately, after Pearl Buck, with all its advantages and excessiveness, Kuomintang has been apologized for the Chinese Chiang Kai-Shek. <br /> <br /> Sundowners has a great deal to compare with China and Australia by Peter Ustinov. After all, Ustinov said China was very large and very full and that Australia was too big and too empty. <br /> <br /> Good earth is what you see in the Good Place, which is very good and full of people. <br /> Good Land, Wang Lung (Paul Muni) He is a young man who is buying a wife from a large house where he is a slave. <br /> <br /> Luis RÃ¼ner carries two sons and sees all his good times and salvation, drought, hunger, revolution, and climactic disease. <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer is the second of two consecutive Oscars to describe O-Lan. He may have shown some record for the Oscar's performance as the leading player with the least number of dialogues. He practically performs everything with facial expressions, which may have been in a silent film with very little subtitles. <br /> <br /> Ryan's daughter, John Mills, had only a few words, and she was a mentally handicapped person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rainer helps the field, takes the bear and raises children, doing the homework. When Muni becomes a person of property, he gets a second cup wife from China, which causes him many sadness. Still, Rainer carries all this. Still, Muni is not a bad person, and you do not hate this movie and its player and buck articles, and respect the cultural space being bridged. <br /> <br /> There are some oriental players who do more than Kung Fu films. I was shocked that the best places for all films were not repeated at this point. <br /> <br /> According to the government, the Chinese government will not allow some American companies to go to an actual location. <br /> <br /> That's why we have to appreciate and love this classic.
