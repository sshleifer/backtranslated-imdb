This movie is one of the centuries. First, once you have seen this, it has become one of my favorite films of all time. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director) brought together the true art work. Since 99.9% of the movies are just fun, director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us the truth, and is a training tool to know why it happened. The main media spins and spin, but Ben Coccio is taking the shooting from the school to the right, with no other press going to go to the minds and hearts of two young men who plan to kill their classmates. How could it have been, though graphically and horribly, undoubtedly? The gloves come out, the frauds of our press masters and the sugar coatings somewhere, and take them to a true place. Sometimes, like everyone who does not want to think, sometimes hate and insulate deeper, more like a screwdriver, we show these guys as we and we are. The society was behind them and the results were terrible and real. <br /> <br /> Respect your friend and be happy. We all want to learn a lesson, thank you very much for this film, Mr. Coccio, and hope you will continue with filmmaking with great expectation.
