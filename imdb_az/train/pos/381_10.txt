I did not give this movie because it was a perfect series of 10 films, but it's the audience to make up for their feelings. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman's fight to fight is still an old clich√©, but very few films have taken her with Color and Purple as warm and sincere. <br /> <br /> The African-American experience has shown a different side-after the slaves were freed, many fell into the hateful 'white man' and showed that their own people had been abused. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the acting speeches are superior - especially now that I am now in the Oprah <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <strong>
