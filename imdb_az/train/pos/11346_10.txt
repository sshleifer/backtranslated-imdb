I'm H.R. I grew up with Pufnstuff and the growing talented Jack Wild, and now my daughters love Jack Wild's fans. This movie should exactly be a movie: entertaining and entertaining. This movie is not limited to children. Many dialogues are directed to adults and you do not want to miss Witchiepoo's performance. Jack Wild and Mama Cass are beautiful in this movie. And like a Jack Wild fan, I'll never lose the chance to hear her dance or hear her sing. When Jack played the song "If I Could", Jack knew that this movie was even more beautiful. It loves my love because of the wonderful childhood memories I have had on my children. Let's go to Living Island, where everyone is friendly and entertaining! And keep Pufnstuff alive and keep Jack Wild's memory alive.
