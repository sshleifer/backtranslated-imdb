It's a strange movie for me because after watching a new movie made by a good film maker (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci), another writer / director, Ryan Cafri, contacted me and wanted to watch and watch the movie, The CURE. I usually do not look at movies in this way, but what is this? - I love shorts and do not expect to see anything else. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, when I left, I was like CURE, and she was not impressed with Jafari. <br /> <br /> This movie has a great style and, in the direction of Jafri's leadership, this is exceptional - especially for such a novice movie. (his first film). Combining a combination of color, pacing and musical talent has created a great atmosphere for the movie. You are really filmed, and this is a credit for making a movie. But what I do not like is a piece of writing. Although the main idea was large, it was very easy to prevent the last commitment. I really liked the latter when it came to a surprise or more for an unexpected twist. However, this is a good thing for the future, because it is someone who needs to be able to shoot such a professional film considering the film's experience. Good job.
