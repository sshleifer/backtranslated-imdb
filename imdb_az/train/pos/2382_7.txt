For a long time, "The Menagerie" was my favorite "Star Trek" episode, though it has been captured in recent years on the edge of Forever. What I prefer about "Menagerie" is that it is even more difficult with Star Trek. I still think it is a masterpiece that Gene Roddenberry's original pilot enters in a two-part episode. Although the "new" part of the story is basically an excuse for watching Kirk and a few (and we) pilots, the idea that Spock is in court is clever. You can hole the pitch if you like. For example, in view of the Talos's intelligence capabilities and Captain Peak's condition, why should you physically return Pike to the planet? And there are other surprising questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... The best of the most comprehensive information is not to think too hard and enjoy only the two STs of ST.
