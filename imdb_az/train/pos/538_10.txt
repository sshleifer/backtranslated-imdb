The return of the lake to the Lake is probably one of the few sequences that can possibly survive. Black was looking strangely, good-looking, beautiful girls and, of course, a psychological killer. What are we lost? I do not think so. Because we were prepared for television, we had a small amount of complexity. Being one of the best Sequels, it's one of the best movies to watch as Family. Recommended for everyone.
