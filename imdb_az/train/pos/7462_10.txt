Note: This comment is for people who are watching the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vanilla Sky is a bright, complex and exciting movie that describes exactly what tag-line is: LoveHateDreamsLifeWorkPlayFriends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I also have to explore my thoughts (and welcome your thoughts), but this is a try and I see if the film is not falling into place: the conflicting 'splice' <br /> <br /> Now that I have been explained by LI , I do not speak words <br /> <br /> In my opinion this truth is true, because this sequence can actually be regarded as a rationalization within David Aames's mental / sleep / coma state, a car crash Any specific sequence of existential / sleep / coma / non-reality is a likely "splice" point of the way (for example, no explosion) and it feels like it's on the screen before and after the accident - on Aames's personal journey to realize himself within his own mind h issue. <br /> From this point of view, we have two questions. <br /> <br /> If they were repeatedly known on the one hand, then they would contact me. or if he has been scattered throughout his dreams at some point, this film becomes an interesting exploration of a person on the path to find himself and himself. in today's pop culture. <br /> <br />
