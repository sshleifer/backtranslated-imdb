When Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) and the audience try to empathize, the filmmakers slander North and Jayhawkers. The mission has never been withdrawn from the Alliance, and the Union Army is not an invader force. The Southeastern states fought for state law: the right to slavery, the choice of crooked legislation and judges, and the application of a political prosecution system. There is nothing noble in it. <br /> <br /> Muslims can easily go to the East and join the Confederacy Army. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the story has nothing to do with uncertainty. When Jake leaves Bushwhackers, he does not give up on the reason for his abandonment, not because he sees the wrong way.
