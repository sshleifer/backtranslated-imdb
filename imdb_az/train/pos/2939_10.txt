Eddie Murphy is one of the most funny comedies - probably the funniest. Delirious should be the best stand-up comedy I've ever seen and a good laugh for everyone! I've been watching this movie for hundreds of times and every time I see it - I have some fun. This is definitely one for your video library. Because you are so laughing, I have to watch it several times to listen to all the jokes - I'll miss half of them! It's boring fun! <br /> <br /> There are many comic comedies - after watching this stand comedy, most of them appear to be second-class citizens. If you have not seen it - get it, watch it - and you will love it! It will make you holes! :-)
