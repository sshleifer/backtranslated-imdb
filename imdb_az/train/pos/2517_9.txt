After a long wait, I took this movie from Netflix, so I did not expect it too much. My worst fears were that it would be nudity ... Well, do you know all the screaming girls should bend over? GACKTnHYDE = hawt yaoi love? Is there anything like this? Do not worry. I'm very, very pleasantly surprised. The film could be surprisingly watched, although the filmmaking and music scene seemed to be like a pair of bags on both scenes and that Gackt would be acting in the part. Hyde, Hope, Hyde, acted as a romantic friend / clerk who would not be surprised by anyone on the stage. The film itself is one of my two big meats. But the remaining shooting (including the kids on the opening scene) was very good when it was done - mostly fire and shouting. But my second problem was very small. As with any scenario, I was really sincerely dead or buried for a very long time. But only Sho ... draws, multiplies, multiplies, while talking, while many are shouting, and Hyde pleads. However, if you are fond of any actor or just a j-fan, it's definitely worth an hour.
