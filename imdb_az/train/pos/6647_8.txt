Gandhi knows more about Harith Gandhi and about Kasturba Gandhi as you read my book, as you read a book. There is little information about both of them, and this film describes them in a unique way. Title Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son are wrong about Harilal and his mother about many films. And Akshaya Hannah and Shephali Chayya are fully justified in their role. <br /> <br /> Such films are leap years. <br /> <br /> My father, Gandhi, is an internal struggle that is always more difficult than the struggle for freedom. <br /> <br /> Watch this, you like the coolest cinema.
