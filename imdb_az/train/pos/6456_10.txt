My expectations were pretty high for this movie. Everyone who knows that this movie is in the cinema has stayed in touch with everyone because of their credit, because of their tremendous impact. <br /> <br /> My expectations could not have been higher, and something wonderful would have been faultless. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < In this film, the characters who worked for decades with their problems, used to work without prejudice, learned to open. But it did not come easily, not just a song or two songs. It was painful, he received arguments, made conflicts. <br /> <br /> <strong> People in the Caucasus are forgiving each other. Helen Sj√∂holm is one of my favorite singers, her voice is beautiful, and she has not just heard the lips in the previous recordings (often found in other films), she really is called with all her body and soul. Gabriella can feel the feelings in this area. When this film was made in Hollywood, his song was probably read to the end, and he would have opened his eyes and saw the mistakes of his way, as well as other people in the village to do something. Instead, it turned out to be half and did not bring any solution. Her husband did not feel drowsy and did not understand what she had put in her, and did not seem to give in to the others in the village. It was beautiful, clean and touched, but did not solve all the problems magic. It really felt to me, it would really happen in real life. The whole movie was felt like a real life for me, nothing was wrapped in a neat way, but everything with joy and happiness. <br /> <br /> There were a few things that disturbed me, but hey, no movie is perfect. If you have not already been there, you will find that you are "in Paradise" and that you are full of joy, a sense of hope, and a touch of level movies. <br /> <br /> At one point someone says that if everyone in the world calls on the chorus, there will be no war anymore. After seeing this movie, I have to agree.
