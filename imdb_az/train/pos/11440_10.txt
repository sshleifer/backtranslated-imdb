I went and saw Rivers and Tides again today. For the second time in two days, I like it, I like films many times. Yesterday I was amazed at the pictures and the glow of Goldsworthy works. When I throw coins this morning, they took # 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has a close relationship with water, so the title. Line 5 to # 7 has changed. Blake's art was a war. Anyway, I had to see the movie again. <br /> <br /> I've read a few reviews from the SF examiner online. Criticism liked the movie very much, but Goldsworthy's comments made the film enjoyable. She just had pictures and a beautiful soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I was aware of watching for the second time yesterday. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought I would vote for Andy Goldsworthy as the World King. Well today I can go beyond the pictures and listen to what I say. Do I love the movie without commenting on it? What goes out is what goes on in "art". Water, Time, Stone, Change and Tenth, and then his understanding of me was considered to be the human renaissance of Lao Tsu or some of the Avatar. Some of his work is like Zen. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> In any case, the film is only shown on the Bay Area (visible). Compile Trend. Go to the local cinema and tell them, they do not insist on ordering a movie from the hinter lands. <br /> <br /> Rivers and Tides are called. <br /> <br />
