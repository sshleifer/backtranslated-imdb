How can anyone say that this is bad? I liked this show before I saw it. For 3 reasons, I was interested in the Story, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please note bad comments, please follow all the first season before you decide that it's bad. Because I know that if you watch the season first, you'll love it and get it and Buy Season 2 on the Season 1 and DVD. <br /> <br /> I hate Fox and I'm sure many of you also hate the Dark Angel fans. They have something to show you well! Do not you all agree?
