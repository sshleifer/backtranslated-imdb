Josef Von Sternberg directs this magnificent silent film about the Troubles of the Russian Tsar, who found himself in silent Hollywood and the former Imperial General. Emil Jannings won an Oscar, which was generally voted as a General Secretary of the General, generally silent for the Russian general. The film leads to the country's revolutionaries, until the time of Russia. William Powell starring Jannings as Hollywood director, is a big screen debut. The film serves as an interesting image with the fall of Russia and an imitation of the scene behind Tinseltown in the early days. Von Sternberg is still a classic and one full of romantic, intriguing and tragic big elements.
