this movie is awesome. species. docent really says a lot or does, but it's a great movie to watch as it's stupid. the high school is taken by the evil ms.Togar who loves all the students, hates rock and something. Buy riff randle ramones show tickets for everyone and this movie brought my riff randle and ramones to the tops of the school pinnacle. this movie is a thing of all, a bad script, suspicious leadership, bad actors (ie clint howard & pj soles), awesome soundtrack, extreme camping, these elements and much more. > <br /> Note that during the live rumors, we see that the germ attacks are in front of the mass. neat-o
