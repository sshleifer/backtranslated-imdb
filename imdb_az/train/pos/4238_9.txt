On the surface, this postwar war is a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> One of the characteristic features of the MGM's characteristic rabbit. <br /> <br /> Leaders are simple, but all the latter are often drawn against the type. Margaret Hamilton (West of Wicked Witch), Edward Everett Husson (professional obsessive-compulsive fussbudget) and Sig Ruman (Marx Brothers' nemesis, _Night and Casablanca's _Night and Opera are always nice _Night) <br /> <br /> is very funny in romantic and comedy conventions, which is another indication of it. That's why it's not just a romantic comedy, because many post-romantic comedies and their 2-dimensional, once, interrupted, do not want to be positive, but this movie can be one of the best in the context of its creation, but now it is less successful that the audience is "a completely different lens." When I gave it 9 stars I thought it was hysterical.
