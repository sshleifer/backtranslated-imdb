A new look at this crucial meeting gave me the desire to see many of the classic MGM music from the forty and forefathers. ANCHORS AWEIGH is, of course, a smaller film than TOWN. Songs are not good, there is no chemistry among the characters. But the film is faced with classic lovers like beautiful Tchaikovsky. And the scene in the Hollywood Bowl where Sinatra and Kelly are coming from the forests above, and then dashing dozens of pianists in the piano, is the scene where Kelly is dancing with Jerry Mouse, even though she is the best scene in the film. Classical music enthusiasts will surely find the music played by the pianists. Then Sinatra, with whom she loved, writes, "I love it very easily." Color is beautiful, Hollywood looks pretty beautiful with its own mountains and polluted air (Can you imagine Hollywood in the mid-1940s?) And piano music is absolutely glorious. MGM was, of course, able to create such lyrical moments.
