Taking into account the low budget and production constraints, this movie is very good. The Chikos (a hustle of plains living in the plains) shows how they endanger their lives to save an American pilot, who is dishonest and gigantic of the Nazis. We are admiring the young, impressive, but very brave boy - an American pilot. If you are looking for special effects, heroes and magical endings - this movie is not for you: sad, stupid Nazi, and you will be surprised by this movie, and I love it and am happy for those who love humble and helpful people who value horses, dogs and freedom. .
