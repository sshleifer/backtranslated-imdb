This is my favorite Sammo Hung movies, "Prodigal Son" and "Eastern Condors". Fat Dragon is better than what's found in "Condors", but he is less confident as a director and actor. He is in fact above his jacket, providing a destructive, pessimistic motion of half-perfecting sequences that tries to explain the story of compassionate, sweet love. Love and romance are not the directors' priorities, but they serve as an exciting name for the activity, and ensure that viewers do not hit the rapidly moving button between physical conflicts. <br /> <br /> The opening scene gives a solid but cheating tone with a funny light-haired duel. A series of Sammo pedestrians followed by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, funny tone. The fast and angry stick fight between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a bright choreography and a sharp, superior direction and easily one of its best types. As the film's sluggishness grows slowly, and finally, when it comes to climatic images, we are exposed to the most terrifying tools we see in Sammo's production. Billy Cowa is a bone-cracking, physical punishment pleasure, with a director / actor's attack and an angry, dangerous opponent. <br /> <br /> At every level, it has become one of the best films during the terrible and fighting era. <br /> <br /> There is also a big score.
