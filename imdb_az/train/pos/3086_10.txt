Here is Italy (I write in Venice). Why canceled? ABC must have given the chance to build an audience. Casting (Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've ever seen. We need more shows like this, that the audience feels like smart ones. Hopefully, ABC will review its decision or another station will receive it.
