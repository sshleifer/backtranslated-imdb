This movie was one of the most funny films I have ever seen and the laughter from the audience supported me. Since the Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002), rarity has been arbitrary and intense. Parody's use last year is just as intolerable as Mr and Mrs. Smith (2005) (Mr and Mrs. Smith's spying and sex at Super Ex-Girlfriend). Director Ivan Reitman is in great balance between the balance of comedy and drama, a bare and terrible laugh. Shocking and dramatic serious crackdown is never the comedy power. At the same time, this predictable romantic comedy never loses any touching emotional elements despite the pre-release of the end. In some cases, it's great to see how it is played. In the real world, sometimes the truth is also true, and I really do not see it. The nineteenth place was easily sorted by Tootsie (1982). It is possible that one nine (depends on how it looks at the second look).
