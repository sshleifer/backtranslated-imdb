The word "classic" is thrown in the very empty place today, but this film is also good. Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (probably the world's best living comic actors), and George Burns, a comic masterpiece. As planned, Jack Bennyi is interested in seeing how the movie will be played when he plays George Burns and does not prevent death. Here, the merging scene in Matthau's apartment is not one-sided. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Sign in !!!!!!!!!"
