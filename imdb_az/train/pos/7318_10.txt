John Carpenter's Halloween <br /> <br /> Is the biggest fright movie of all time? no .. maybe it will always be for me, not everyone. The film is genius in my heart and always takes a special place. <br /> <br /> Twenty years after this movie was released, I did not see this movie, but even after twenty years after the cats had come out, the film still had the same effect. My father suggested that before Halloween H20, I was holding Halloween 1 and 2 for the whole story, and after watching Halloween, he identified and identified this Slasher genre. In 1963, Michael Audrey Myers killed Judithi, a great butcher knife, in cold blood. For over fifteen years, he has been cured by Dr. Sam Loomis, and he returns to Haydonfield where he has begun attacking three young girls: Laurie Strode is an innocent book worm, Annie Brackett, a tough talking sarcastic and Lynda Van Der Klok are beautiful and sexually strong A young girl. Dr. Loomis follows Michael's conservation of the help of Sheriff Leigh Brackett, who does not doubt his story about a psychotic assassin. <br /> <br /> This film was brilliant and unmatched by all actors and gamers, actresses presented top notch performances, and Jamie Lee gained a thrilling performance with a small role like Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br created one of the most recognizable horror issues known today. Blue Lighting was creepy and effective, and one of the biggest moments in the film was to materialize before the young Laurie put on a mountain after seeing dead comrades and hitting the shade on Michael's face. <br /> <br /> How nice this movie is, it's not a charming movie, unlike this unpleasant charm. 13 films, in fact, have a lot of blood in this film, and instead stops and tensions. <br /> <br /> On Friday, the Halloween movie has featured as the Friday 13th movie and Jason Voorhees. It's just the demolition of Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, I suggest that at least once in a movie to see this movie because it is the most important place in filming and not one of the biggest fears of all time.
