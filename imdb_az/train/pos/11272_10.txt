<br /> <br /> John Dillinger escaped from prison and slammed into a bank in Iowa, Tarzan and his wife (1934) - released in 4/20/1934. Bonnie & Clyde killed two motorway patrollers in Texas. COUNTRIES: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. DOUG: After disappointing us with the original "Tarzan Ape Man", the second film that we found among other users and historians was the best in the series 'Tarzan and his wife'. That is right. It's a big blow to this movie. Johnny Weismuller is returning as titular vine-growing, animal dueling as a wild super hero, and Maureen O'Sullivan represses his role as his absolutely fantastic lady Jane (who first and last time sports a two-piece outfit). In my eyes for "Ape Man," Jane was pretty good for his dress and his constant screams, but here he saved himself for me. No mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie and Jane is the most talented in all shooting. He acts as an ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, can work perfectly in the woods and keep in touch with animals and knows how proud the pride of the lions is when leaving the bullets. He now has his knight. There is no chemistry between Johnny and Maureen. She was completely taught to her. Cheeta is also very attractive by dragging Marty's cigarettes. The area is basically a pretext to fight Tarzan with the most brutal hosts of the army, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinos. Impressions, although always visible, are more dynamic and cool and perfectly complement their movements. Oh, and you can not talk about this movie about the nude bathing scene. I can all say yes, it's naked. Very exciting things. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Woe only. As for low and dirty pre-coding action / adventure, nothing keeps a candle for 'Tarzan and his wife'. The inevitable continuation of the Tarzan Ape Man is an epic, creating a boom, violence and risk. I hope there will be another Tarzan film in the future, so none of the prisoners will do it. It would be challenging to find a full scene in the movie that will be approved by the Code or approved by Animal Rights. Terrible violence, today's adventure movies do not even wait to show a happy jungle pair before you push the limits. And when you get into the picture after T & J, there's plenty of swims early in the morning and swims in the ass-naked afternoon. Look for yourself if you do not believe me. Most of all, I love Maureen O'Sullivan. In the first film, Jane seemed like a writer, like a writer, a seeming contradiction, and did not know how to describe a similar character. But here he is a great warning for the movie kick-butt woman later. Even though Tarzan helps save her from the most stressful, she does much more than she does not expect to be saved. For a woman who is relatively comfortable in the woods for a year, she is perfect for her personality. I watched this with my mom, and I like to show her that Janein Tarzan has "taught" it as she puts Jeffrey Foxworthy. He has a beacon and a monkey in every beck. Although there are many historic optical effects throughout the film, there are still many real-life (mostly) realized Tarzan and predatory battles. These and men's dressed apes are more convincing around this time. ** SPOILER ** Jungle Scales and Jane climaxes the film, erupts with a shock orgy in the severity of an animal prince who just left two people still breathing. I do not imagine that this pair will look like a next trip to find Tarzan and Jane, and will not hear about a few previous non-recurring groups, even though the couple's couples get together and win. . ** END SPOILER ** One of the things that disturbs me is that Johnny Weissmuller is a smooth, hairless bodice and a very neat coiff. <br /> <br /> Last movie: One night (1934). Next movie: XIX century (1934).
