Any screen adaptation of a John Grisham story deserves a major Hollywood approach and Robert Altman is about my latest filmmaker who was going to do something in my core. But this southern-fried boiler is good. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Although Altman is not the best , of course, not between his films, but in the 1973 film "Long Goodbye". "The Gingerbread Man" is not nearly as close as it is, but it is also good enough. Kenneth Branagh is a brutal lawyer who has been killed for dealing with himself after dealing with a customer (Embeth Davidtz) who has been assisted by his cookie (Robert Duvall). The film gives a tremendous atmosphere of animosity to me when the tropical storm approaches, in the city of Savannah, Georgia. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, twists turn into clunches and cliques, and Altman is not a master of laughter, but the film is not a bad addition to Altman's law. <br /> <br /> Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> Level: B
