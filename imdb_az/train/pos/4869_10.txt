People who do not think fast or have a drop of Balkan blood are not in their veins. If you do not have one, you will not understand. You understand, you can not do that. If you think that Picasso is a car produced by Citroen, you probably will see Picasso's painting, and you decide that only one street artist is a debris. :) So do not judge before you try to figure it out :) In the end I think I need it for everyone who is open minded. Still, my N1 remains Shawshank Redemption! Remember, frames are not put on everything. Because there is something in this world, no framework will fit.
