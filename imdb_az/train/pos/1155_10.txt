Very funny. There is a huge cast that gives you great speeches. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. A well-written script by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon in Vegas). I do not like soap operas, though I have never been to them. But I love this movie because it is very stylish and throws it out of the wall and throws hell from any stupid soap on the television during the daytime. In my opinion, this is the best film of 1991.
