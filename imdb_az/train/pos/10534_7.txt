Whether it is a good movie or not, I think such films should be made. Isabelle Huppert remembers the film "I Love Huckabees", which began to be tempered by a young American in a mud lake, in a picturesque sadistic-masochistic way (?? !!!!). Hopefully, director Vincenzo Natali was not always boundless, as I felt the choice (some scenes like a childhood clash, "tarte-a-la-kremen"), when talking about comedy and cinematography? The colors of the "Cube" were dark, something more white, more fun, and surprising than Natalie's old films.
