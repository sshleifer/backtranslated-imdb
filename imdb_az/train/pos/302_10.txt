This movie is perfect for all romantic people in the world. John Ritter has never been better and has the best line in the film! "Sam" is approaching the house, he likes to see it and is very entertaining to play together. Ben Gazzara was a very good cast and easy to fall in love. I'm sure I've introduced Arthur in some places to my friends. Great choice for any evening around! :-)
