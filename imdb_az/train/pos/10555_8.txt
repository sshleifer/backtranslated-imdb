The premiere of this movie has long been a part of my imagination. We've heard everything or read some kind of statement. What would you do if you were alone in the world? What would you do if the whole world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes? In fact, the last part is actually like Dave and Andrew, two rooms living in a fugitive home in the middle of a motorway system. Andrew is a nervous breakdown to say the least, and Dave is considered one of the greatest casualties of society. This is the main reason why only two of your comrades are so good, because they just have to resort to each other when they need to relax. Simply ... <br /> <br /> Since the beginning of the film there are many problems and many problems with them. Both are dealing with murder, Andrey suffers from paranoid and simply does not dare to leave home. Dave is unsuccessful in his work, and his colleagues treat her very well and respect her deserved respect. The number of problems they face is unstoppable and unable to deal with it. <br /> <br /> Dave and Andrey say nothing in this world. . First of all, this confusing environment has problems with understanding and employment, but they know that they can do everything they want later, because they still seem to be leftovers. Nothing is a tiny shot - in fact, except for the first few shootings in the film, we see only in the film, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew Miller. Obviously, this punishment needs to be more important for the task of the task, because there is nothing in the world that does not exist in anything that does not distract the audience. Vincenzo decided to take a closer look to make it even more interesting and really works very well. Photography director Derek Rogers has a great way to offend viewers, especially when a character sees something and reacts to it, while keeping track of information, but we do not see it immediately. <br /> Of course, this is not a movie based on this event, and that's not it. Most of the action is outside of their home when they move in space. <br /> <br /> Now, when Andrew finds a candy bar, it's where the worst scenes are. <br /> <br /> Now you can think: "What does not it look like?" Indeed, it does not resemble anything. The whole world is nothing white ... even though you look at the white. The weakness of this film ... It is extremely boring to look after an hour or less, and there must be events to make sure it is more interesting to look at. Thank goodness, there are some. For example, two grandchildren can skip high levels, just as nothing is wrong with what's happening, as Andrew claims. <br /> <br /> One of the best parts of the film - the designer Jasna Stefanovic has done a job. It's a nice job to look at the house where these two boys live, and it's fun to see that these two guys live together. Generally, production design is becoming one of the most powerful aspects of the film, though the film should be really watched ... <br /> But the best part of the movie is functioning. Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are similar to those of professional actors. For each second part of the movie, and as in the past, there is no coin in the movie, they are really bare. With a lot of character development and a number of decent bands, intelligent dialogue (sometimes with cunning foolishness), they all deal with this, and this really leads the movie to a well-prepared handicraft, out of the low budget. Let's talk about visual effects, because they are definitely worth a visit. There are no digital visual effects and prosthesis that are compatible with any modern-day fear film. The film has a terrifying dream sequence, and although Drews is totally neat, it's still fun to watch. One of the best visual effects in the film, Andrew and Dave, have suddenly come to an end when they discover their powers in this environment - are they capable of removing everything, so they can do it in another way and reveal things? <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a bright and well-lit movie that really thinks they are dead (really one of their theories), but the "Nothing" comedy slowly destroys its theory. We do not know where they are or what is happening. We do not know if they leave, or the film ends before you see something like this. In the end, this is not as good as possible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are "Hollow Man", "Kill Bill", "Cube", "Epoch" and many other films and "Nothing." It's really a combination of different styles, yet another one There is no movie at all (at least I know) Nothing really looks like Vincenzo Natali remembers how he talked with Cubé's story, and he was talking about André Bijelic talking to each other and hoping to get into this very boring room "Nothing" could be a shaded version of the story of the Cube story <br /> <br /> What can I say? I did not have "nothing", this was a beautiful movie, and the different parts of the film were well prepared with very clever ideas, I feel that the movie is missing something and find out exactly what that is ... Maybe if I have 2 words, I can answer that question. ir şey "is not a great movie, but it is not as good as expected. <br /> <br /> Last price: 7.5 / 10
