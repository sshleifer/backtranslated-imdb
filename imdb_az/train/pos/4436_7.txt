Tattooed Stranger was one of the rare B-films on BBC2's Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. <br /> <br /> This is a man walking in the Central Park with a dog, an abandoned car, and finds a dead woman inside. She was shot, and the police tried to portray her with only one tattoo. <br /> <br /> The majority of this film is shot around and around New York, as we will see some of the city's territory. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Perfect, but very dark. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 to 3 stars.
