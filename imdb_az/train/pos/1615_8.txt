A wonderful romantic comedy drama about an Italian widow (Cher), who plans to marry a comfortable man (Danny Aiello) until she falls for her horrible, angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The scenario is sharp with many large lines, the action is beautiful, the accents are excellent (they say it) and cinematography is wonderful. New York did not look good on the screen. The first one is for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - they deserve both fantastic and rich Oscars. A beautiful, funny movie. A must!
