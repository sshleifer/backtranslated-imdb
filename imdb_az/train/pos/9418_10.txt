I've been filming this movie for many years and still started watching it this morning (how excited I was waiting for my laundry!) ​​I did not want to hear Benjamin Frankel's forgotten music music. Sitting in the first half hour, I sat down when I was convinced of the direction, writing, and demonstrations. The film is made up of the British character Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont and Ernest Thesiger, a former dictator of textile factories, in the 50s. Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood are not characteristic, but charming, charismatic. This is science fiction, in pure form and in droll comedy. All the time is classic, and nobody ever hopes to rebuild it!
