Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a child. I paid all the chances I got from the library. One of my favorites was the Red Sea Shark - a lot of action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a brilliant exposition on the background of Herge and his Tint's development. <br /> <br /> The story of the film's narrator's conversation with Herge and his relationship with the artist who inspired the character of Chan was very moving. <br /> <br /> A great documentary about a very talented and beloved artist. A wonderful example of an internationally renowned person and millions of children around the world (and heart of young people) brought joy.
