It's a small movie, a few characters, theaters. And yet says something you can not find in Ireland. This movie is IRELI. All this is strange, it is grief, do not deceive yourself. Kids, Master Doyle, SP O'Donell, The Cannon, Daughter of Senator Doogan, Black and all Madge. I know them. kneeling down to pray with them. They are our sad history and they are in our day.
