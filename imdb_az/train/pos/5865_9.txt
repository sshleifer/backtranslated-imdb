I saw it in cables in the early 90's and liked it. I have never seen him until I see it until a cable is short. Find a Vietnamese movie yet. I do not know why he is not much appreciated. I found everything that forced this movie. As a veterinarian (not from Vietnam), we can relate to the situation brought about by Harris and De Niro. I can only make this movie more difficult with our situation in Iraq. I want to see this more frequently in the cables for the person to see. The soldiers of our soldiers are not in the battlefield. He brought the rest to his house. And this movie is one of the many who bring home in a very difficult way. Excellent movie.
