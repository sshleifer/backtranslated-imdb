As I watched in the movie watching how the two brothers responded to each other and watching how to feed through the whole movie, I was very happy. I watched a lot of this movie and made it from my Bible. After watching the movie, I acknowledge that this book is one of the few films that make justice. I'm strongly coming to Montana for fish or anyone who has the chance to be outdoors. That's amazing. I can not believe anyone who can play a better role than Brad Pitt. Justify yourself and watch one of the better movies during the modern movie. Recommend strongly, and as a guide for fishing trips to both Montana and Wyoming, do not try to learn how to fly from the scenes of the movie because it looks great in the movie, but does not know how much experience and skill fishing really does. Thank you for listening If you like a long, sad movie, watch this movie.
