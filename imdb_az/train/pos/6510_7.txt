Actually, I really love the things I see in this animated film. Of course, the animation is not the best, but frankly, often and inexpensively (a style that looks more and more frequently, and when it is time and effort). There's nothing wrong with curly lines and small black dot eyes - in fact, I really think this is cute. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> In any case, Shaggy is my favorite character and I believe it or I think it has the potential for some depths. No doubt the show was not around the original "mysterious solution" theme, but in any case it was just a tired old formula. Do not get me wrong - I'm convinced that there are writers who can bring more curiosity to Mystery's traditional follow-ups (not so late), but the show is a standard, entertaining deviation. Shaggy and Scooby are still funny but no longer just funny relief. They are still cowardly, but finally have the opportunity to use it as it seems (shock!) Intelligence. <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; clean cheese and the best way to be joyful, but the show actually has the power to make a real humor, and I have not liked Casey Kasem as Shaggy, so the new actor did not compare me with other people (though Billy West is still the best) <br /> <br /> Generally, , although not a great cartoon in the whole cartoon history, is still a success among other Scooby incarnations.
