It was most pleasantly surprising that I watched this movie according to the ratings of those who strongly appreciated it. Even though it's clear, it's a low budget, smart inventive. For example, when Julia woke up in a strange house and looked up at the window, I felt that my isolation would move with an external stroke that drew attention to her face and then moved into the house and her isolated place. And look! the next scene was the final stroke of the house, completely based on the abyss of the water. There are other examples that an intelligent filmmaker will bring the movie to a very unpleasant thriller. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that George McDean has no doubt. <br /> <br /> As for the competition, George Macready is an immoral creepy person. Nina Foch was a strange thing to do, without a battle, an unreasonable worker girl. <br /> <br /> But Dame May Witty, oh boy, she also suspected me of my own eyes and believed that she could go away with her bad ways. <br /> <br /> This is a rough real diamond and should not be missed.
