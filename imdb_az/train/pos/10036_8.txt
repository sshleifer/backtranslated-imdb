"Titanic" has long been a story of a figured adventure love story. Writer / Director James Cameron has made this movie a fictional storytelling between two different people and, by doing a great job, has killed thousands of people in the waters of the North Atlantic Sea with the tide of the Titanic, the sinking after a spinning on April 15, 1912 . Two films, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, have a great role to play. They tend to make good screen pairs. DiCpario and Winslet also met with original chemistry, resulting in more romanticism among them. Both of them have revealed their true talent, and these two continued to show in recent films. The rest of the game, including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton, have a small role, as well as the characters that make them a reality in this movie. The story of love, action, inaction, and special effects is particularly spectacular for that time. The horror of the situation is the fact that the heroes really feel, because it really wants most of them to survive from this life and death. Pacing was sometimes a bit slow and a bit longer, but the rest of the film was a few flaws. Titanic is a great historic movie that some girls are sure to be able to cry every time they watch. This really is a movie that really happened, adding to your sadness for all of your life that Titanic lost when he hit the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. In general, the Titanic is talking about a tragic heart of two people who lost their lives on an innocent ship, which made the film a must-see, especially for DiCaprio and Winslet.
