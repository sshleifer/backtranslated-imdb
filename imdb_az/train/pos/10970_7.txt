Edith Bouvier looks at Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) Aunt and his first brother Jacqueline Kennedy Onasse in a surprising way. They live in a predator, a hurricane palace, which is considered a danger to health by the city. It is quite clear that both of these are excentric. Little Edie, although actually 53 years old, is most visible because he's been in the ten-year mentality. The content consists of quite a few things. First, Little Edie was Big Edie lambastes to retract all his potential resources and break his decisive career as writer, actress and dancer. These discussions are usually very rhetorical, unusual, and often fun. Secondly, attempts by both sides to sing songs for a long time. Of course, every one of them is perfect and only bad sounds. In a spectacular scene Big Edie is actually attacking only with a cane to stop the Little Edie with a stick. It is very attractive yet they feel that they have a serious exploitation here and that they know the subject far too far. The filmmakers behave like a strange show in this circus, and every day they come up with a strange act (and giggle). Finally, this is a sad picture of how the world passed through these two past. Their hopes and dreams were rotten like the place where they lived. Despite these two encounters, they need each other more than ever. Because there would be no shelter alone without loneliness. The most beautiful line comes from Big Edie, which catches along with many cats throughout their bedroom. The answer to a complaint about odor is simply amazing.
