I was amazed at this small, independent image. Even children, as well as sometimes sad, but always provocative, are also talking about a few public travels, which are stories, meeting friends, and providing each other with a support system. Music venues, mainly underground bands, have been tested with camera switches, filters and slow or fast moving methods. The performances (played by filmmakers and filmmakers) are the best I've seen in the last few years. If you feel like you're pushing a square stamp round the slot, I believe you'll really appreciate "Hook or Crook."
