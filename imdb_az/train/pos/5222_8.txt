After Chicago, I began to lose all respect for Richard Gere, and then the Flock came. So far, a beautiful smile and a few scene facial gestures can take you, but she has finally proven that she is crafty and can act with the best. Clare Danes was also as superficial as "trainee / replacement". Some people thought it was very unusual, but I do not see it in this way. I did not see anything in the power of this film. I was really shocked that I did not hear the release of the theaters and did not find it in the Blockbuster. An exceptional movie, really, with the right mix of right action, excitement, excitement and public consciousness. 7 days as good? Yes, maybe. And you'll see better than anybody who works better than the Pitt.
