Moon Child, a Japanese woman rocker starring Hyde and Gackt, was a better movie I've ever had. In fact, I was very impressed and immediately became one of my favorite films. <br /> <br /> This story, set up in Mallepa, is followed by a group of street orphans, Sho, Shin, his brother, Shinji, and Toshi, who killed the robber. In one of the robbers, Sho Hyde's Kei vampire burns in the sunlight. <br /> <br /> The nature of the BSEC is not limited to the occurrence of the events, but no one will abandon it. <br /> <br /> Time passes and declares that the immortal, never-changing Kei Shofty raised a close bond. Sho and Kei then meet his son in an ugly gunfire and they become friends quickly. Both Kei and Hyde's sister, Yi-Chey, are in love. <br /> <br /> Time is moving forward and growing, Sho shows this time Kei's gap. He also explains that Sho and the Son are enemies. <br /> <br /> After the tragedy, this film becomes the reality of life, and it is a challenge that draws attention to friendship and love. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I think Gackt is doing a great job. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I would recommend.
