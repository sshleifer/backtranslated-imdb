Distortion is a movie showing me captivating in a surprising way. A multi-story drama about a person's experiences in life. In order to be shorter, his wife feels deceived, so he does something special to conceal himself. The husband does not know that this is happening. Meanwhile, those who are involved in this game are wandering around each other and hitting each other by extending their hands to one another, and calling them unfit to say in the Israeli world. <br /> <br /> The director of this movie really works with the ensemble of the characters and corrects the correction. in a way that is causing your attention, this is really a fun movie, although I did not explain it and I recommend people.
