At this point, I have to say that # 1 is one of the best elements of Christine McIntire. Shemp's scene is poisoned and the reaction is really spectacular. I think that as Christine offered in a poster, he would laugh at this scene, but in fact, made him even worse to be laughing more than Shemp. <br /> <br /> Unlike this, it helps Goon. His appearance was a huge cross between the terrible and comic walk-ups. I would definitely choose to meet in the dark alley or in any issue with one character. I would choose a little bit of truth about it, but in a short time this is good, who will complain. It is not me.
