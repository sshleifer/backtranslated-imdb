I found this movie wrong many years ago and wondered if it was not like it (yet). There is a good written, well-functioning, one-to-one forward-looking and unhappy character. I do not recommend this movie for people who are in the short term; In this story, enough intelligence is needed to realize that truth has a nuclear probability.
