When I went around Christmas in 1976 my mother took me to see this movie. I loved it and now I love it. Everyone knows Barbra's hair in a fun way, but it looks and sounds like it! ... And I remember some women copying this crowd at that time! Also, the windshower scene between Streisand and Christoferson is very sexy! Music is very good. This is the best 70's Babs!
