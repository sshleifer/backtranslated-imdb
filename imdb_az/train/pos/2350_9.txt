For each of the episodes of Pushing Daisies this season, we hope to enjoy the shameless ending of a very good show start with the pleasure and writers' attack. Ned is a cake maker who has a restaurant in the middle of the city and has a secret capability. Emmerson is a special investigator with his own unique quirk, like the weaving love. Charlotte (Chuck), Ned's once-in-a-lifetime, but no longer childhood-friendly and sunny point. Olive is jealous, but a good-willed waitress. Oh, and add the dog. Jim Dale brings together all the symbols along with the beautiful story of the show. Chuck, along with Ned and Emmerson Olive, sometimes solves many criminal secrets with the help of Ned's special gift to bring people to death. Show is funny, clean and romantic in a very cute and kind way, and I advise everyone.
