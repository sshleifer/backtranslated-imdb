I've seen it in Detroit, it should be an original run. I rolled into the hallway of the full theater. It was funny. I did not see it since, but I loved it. Where do you get a copy? Someone poseurs a bunch of money for my money, if someone falls into history, or overdone, saying something about it. Every sketch is either bad, erotic or distorted hilarious. Each! Not a weak one. For example, in 2001, the parody of the opening sequence, with the gorilla goats-dancers as if they were breasts. Felin would have filmed if she had a bad taste ... If you come up with an open mind and a heartbreaking heart to this movie, you'll find it in your best list.
