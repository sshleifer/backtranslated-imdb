It was difficult for me to watch it as it seems like a dip in the middle while trying to hit the head or tail who it is fighting against. One of the problems is cultural / linguistic. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem we just do not know, and we're just reading English subtitles because some of the frustrations are inevitable. Another problem is just a few, with only half the obvious bursts and coincidences. Nevertheless, there is a completely evil Miiki movie, and this, of course, is not possible. Very stylish and slimy slashing intensity, a window for a family-friendly, less than orthodox sexual desire. All in all a good trip, but possibly checking your storyline can actually be useful before watching it.
