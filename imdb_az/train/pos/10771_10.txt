This movie has a whole star cast, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi to name a few heroes like Monte Carlo, as well as some other beautiful European places and are very funny. When you lie to protect yourself, everyone's difficulty is great, and it's good to see this movie, it's worth it! John Candy is once at once on the Criminal Tribunal as it is! If you and your family are looking for a great family movie, this is your ticket. Everyone delivers great speeches, great acting, great comedy and great times, which are rare in films these days. Great heaven, great mystery (I love it anyway) and generally worth the money you spend. So get kids, catch some popcorn, fruit juice, tea or sodas and enjoy the show!
