Harem Suare is the best film I've ever seen in 2000. Bravo Ferzan Ã–zpetek. Harem Suare is a brave film that solves folk romance in Hollywood, with a striking and striking description. All pictures, sizes and colorful women cover the film. Women from the outside world are entertaining each other by telling stories about intrigue, competition and jealousy.
