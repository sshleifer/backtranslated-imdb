Future Persons is an early Sci-Fi movie showing a world of imagination for 100 years, or "Everytown". It can be divided into 4 different scenes or sections. This film extends from 1940 to 2036 and basically, this ruler or "Boss" is about the bombing of each city and the desire to fly back to planes after the war began. <br /> <br /> Only this film has about 3 deficiencies: this audio is naked and there are some strange things in the videos, the heroes are not deep, and the overall structure is not firm. There is nothing I can not put in my finger ... a little "hairy". But if you love scientific intelligence, H. G. If Wells could take place in the next hundred years, that should be absolute. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Everyone is afraid to learn what they are afraid of: a long, wounded war, because they would go to war in Germany and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What she is doing is a very good film,
