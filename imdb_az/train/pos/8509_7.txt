I hate reading, "Do not waste your time, this movie is wrong on ice." Whatever happens to this reviewer for me, he can be a sort of na√Øve attraction. If you liked other 'Whistler' series films, this would be a wait. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good as any of the previous series entries that Richard Dix has played as a protagonist. It is very slow and unobtrusive. <br /> <br /> You've seen this story device, which is used in many other films and at the same time better. <br /> <br /> But toy is good and clear, and so is the dialogue. <br /> <br /> The US Whistler series comes out of the US Whistler series. semi-noir and character, mood, lighting, camera movements and angles are more important than the story itself. But this is not a movie. It's too light for Hollywood and innocent. Neither Richard Dix's character, nor any of the women in previous films had come to a good conclusion. <br /> <br /> But still, I'll recommend it for at least once. I have watched myself at least twice and enjoyed it twice.
