Why is not this movie in 250 films good? This film appears strangely 56 years after production, but can only be done in a manner similar to the W. W.II because of the proximity of death. People knew better that life would be stopped at an unexpected moment. And what happens after life? I ended the scene with all the nations gathered with the court. The flegmatic referee (typical British judge - Ibrahim Sofaer), Doctor Reeves (Roger Livesey), who defends Peter Ecker (David Niven) and June (Kim Hunter) against American prosecutor Ibrahim Farlana (Raymond Massey) is an American. All this is very creative! Michael Powell wrote, managed and produced this amazing movie, which is a real "tour-de-force". The film's message is clear: the law in the universe is most important, but there is nothing beyond the love of people on earth. This beautiful story is more interesting than any Hollywood movie.
