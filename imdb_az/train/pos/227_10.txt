Robert Duvall is a direct link to the IMDb.com movie base, the Confederation President Robert E. Lee. After seeing this movie, you think Duvall's appearance is the best way to reincarnation. One of my favorite movies. Composer Peter Rodgers Melnick had a CD or a soundtrack available. Beautiful scenery and music for those who live or immigrated in Paradise, and "all very real life." This is "a real moment of time." Life is moving slowly, but "we are not foreigners".
