This movie could have been a silent movie; of course there is a part. I am very lucky to see a very rare version of this movie. The extension extends the "symphony of love" and all language versions. French, the most romantic language, appears to be quite suitable for this very sensual and lyric version. Young Hedy Lamarr gives a light on the screen, which is a kind of sex fantasy; but it is definitely far from being pornographic. Only qualities could have been a bit crude; but it will not affect the leaked magic magic of this movie. Those who love early cinema would have completely respected this movie.
