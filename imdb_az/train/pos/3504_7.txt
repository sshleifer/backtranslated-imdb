This movie feels like a movie project. Cinematographers have chosen and worked part of a society that has no experience. Characters, though, are inadequate and naive. Despite this amateur part, the film is effective. It resembles an intersection of life with the children of neighborhood who are trying to understand or cultivate genuine sexual feelings. Of course, this is a shame for having sexual intercourse by a great parent. It provides some predictable, but good conflict. In his romantic relationships, the main character grew a little bit, giving greater depth to sexual feelings. It's a good hour, but nothing mixes.
