Hope Safar (1990), many immigrants and poor Turks have opened a way to a good life in Switzerland. These people are very desperate to live as Westerners who will abandon their lives and lives in an attempt to reach the promised land. Many of them avoid paying huge expenses for hopeless people who are not in a position to win. One family braves to find that a cold, traitorous mountain range and predatory criminals just have a bright white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem is not only in America, but also on the world level. Some people tend to forget it. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended.
