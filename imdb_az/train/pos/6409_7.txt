I did not hear about Brashear without following it. This is the story of a man who helped him and her first African American to become a US Diver. A story of power. The field is well written and beautifully developed. As you can see, this is a typical thing and does not expect much surprises. This is pretty Hollywood, but hey, I do not know the actual person, maybe it really happened. Nevertheless, this is dramatic for dramatic scenes and difficulty along the way, and it is inspirational for everyone who has heard the words "you can not talk about sleep all the time". Fine performances are very good. DeNiro and Gooding Jr both shine when it's on the screen. Rapaport is also beautiful. The characters are well-written, reliable, and consistent. These are good adjustments and good kinematography features. The production values ​​are high and this is a fairly convincing job to bring us to 50. This is the only film I have ever seen by the director and writer, although I am already responsible. There is a moderate level of language, on the contrary, there is no offensive material. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in the topic and / or those who love it. 7/10
