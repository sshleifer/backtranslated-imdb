Cats Soup first appears to be a very casual animated film. The best method I can explain is that it is quite acidic. Not exactly casual. The story is about Nyatta, a young cats and sister Nyaako. Nyaako is very ill and dying, but Nyatta sees that his soul is seen by his death, and he can take half of it. The story is about his research to bring Niyako back to life. <br /> <br /> Although many of the content in this movie seems totally random, this is not it. Most of them are symbolism for life, death and revival. You can also see references to other tales like Hansel and Gretal. This strange favorite short movie has an interesting story that is deeper than what you see on the screen.
