Reiser (film maker) thought it necessary to use profanity for no reason. Maybe "adult" movies, bad humor in the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Falk's performance, some great moments and some important issues give me so high ratings. <BR> This is a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh about their nationalities and horizons. But focusing attention on audiences can be a family movie, but it may fail. Of course, it is not worth spending money, though it should be watched on television.
