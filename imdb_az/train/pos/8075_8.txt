I do not believe what famous critics say. Although this movie did not get the best comments, this movie caused my day. He thinks of me. <br /> <br /> The most loved are deceived by you. No matter how often the milk is fed, the yeast will never be loyal and will be bitten whenever a chance is given. Some people are not so grateful. This film is about how selfish people can be and how everyone works finally and thinks about themselves. <br /> <br /> A brother dies in the hands of a gangster in the darkness. The living brother is determined to take revenge. Through this process, we learn the gaps in this world. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has performed his own life. New player Aryan showed a good performance. The actress who played Amitabh's wife stole a show. His role was small, but his role was very effortlessly described by one's actions. <br /> <br /> Chawla, a great film by Rawq Kumar Santoshi, had really great facial expressions, but his role was very limited and he was given the chance to express himself completely. The film always sends a message to the audience. They have a true message to the audience, because their films are like novels by Nanak Singh (the novels are always a target and a Punjabi novel that targeted a social shame). They are entertaining and teaching.
