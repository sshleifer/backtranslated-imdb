Military education films are becoming so popular that they become a genre for themselves. More prominent are 'Officer and Gentleman', 'Top Gun', 'GI Jane' and now 'Honor of Men'. This is a fact that does not change the fact that the formula is the same. <br /> <br /> This film is likely to focus on desigregation, most like 'GI Jane'. <br /> <br /> The story is really inspirational and is probably the story of the best human interests among the above. Carl Brashear (Cuban Gooding, Jr.) is undoubtedly a man with great courage and power, and his strength shines brightly in this film. Unfortunately, the director, George Tillman, supported the development of the tunnel vision of the characters and the development of different characters from Brashear in a steady state of Brashear. Billy Bazar (Robert De Niro) is a central person and, with the exception of the starting scene, we do not know much about him with his wife, except for a few scenes and several scenes. For example, Brashear sees wounds in the palm of the market on Sunday, and we think we have a broom, but there is no persecution at this point. Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) just goes to a short scene so we can judge him. The rest of his screen time is pacing and ranting around it. <br /> <br /> If a director will prepare a story of human interests, he needs to be humanized. <br /> <br /> Cuba Gooding delivers superior performance like Jr Brashear. Probably the best I've ever seen. This is more complete role and character in any part of the game it has played before and it rises on the occasion. In the Jerry Maguire, Rod Tidwell was an interesting but dimensioned character in the depths of rainwater. Brashear is more complex and substantiated and challenges facing life crises make it even more difficult. <br /> <br /> This is a very good revival of Gooding's "Chill Factor", a film that was so intimidated that it meant a professional suicide to drive that part. <br /> <br /> After trying his hand as a comedian, Robert DeNiro returns to dramatic roots with outstanding performance ('Analyze This', 'Rocky & Bullwinkle's Adventures', 'The Parents Meet'). DeNiro is not a bad comedian, he is a dramatic actor who appears to be a comedy and does not waste his time. DeNiro, Billy Bazaar, is giving a tortured soul to a lying rock. It is a pleasure to look at it. <br /> <br /> I have Charlize Theron in every movie I've been watching lately. I saw the boundaries of "Legend of Bagger Vance", "Honorary Men" and "Yardlar", and I was surprised to find that in 2000 there were only five (in fact, only five) films. It was a small role for Theron, but he did well, and was able to stick to DeNiro step by step. There are some interesting features that reflect the real Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes on the DVD, with David Keith, co-starring Richard Gere and Officer and Gentleman. <br /> <br /> Despite the Hackneyed area and its one-dimensional presentation, I enjoyed this movie. I sounded it 7/10. I'm an absorbent story for a story like this and I'm glad that stories are the main theme of the character. This film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable activities that compensate for a number of deficiencies in the director.
