Victor McLaglen's performance is the best in film history. <br /> <br /> I think we can feel "Gypo" for everyone. Because we all struggled with good and wrong and wrong ones. <br /> <br /> Joseph H. August's cinema is in the best position here. <br /> <br /> The biggest film studio in the United States, however, was abducted in August; <br /> <br /> He did not accept the Oscar nomination rightfully. <br /> <br /> This psychological drama, thought, philosophy, imagination, as little as possible in small words.
