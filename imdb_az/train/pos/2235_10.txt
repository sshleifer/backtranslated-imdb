I liked this movie because Amazon is always a real story that is part of the world that interests me. <br /> <br /> I really think that after the event, the condensed form of the book was published in "Reader's Digest." <br /> <br /> Because I'm a baby boomer, character and actress are my contemporaries. For this reason I'm related to the movie. I believe the film is valuable to teach the survival skills if the observer observes that the observer follows the flows that can lead to rivers and the coastal settlements that can help, and other survival techniques. The most important thing was to stay alive and to maintain a positive attitude. As a result, I hope the audience will teach something while looking at entertainment. <br /> <br /> I hope to be released on VHS and DVD soon, so I want to add it to the video collection. . It should also be shown more often in satellite TV channels.
