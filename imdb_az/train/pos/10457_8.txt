Do not forget about "religious" movies monopolizing the television / movie market ... this movie has real feelings. Although it may be regarded as a movie with cheap emotional shooting, it has a message of forgiveness and generally good morals. But it did not like the lighting in this movie ... it was very bright for a movie that was dealing with this topic. <br /> <br /> I felt that the movie was far away from the general attraction that it is almost an innocent crime, but the castle and their performances are opposed to this control. <br />
