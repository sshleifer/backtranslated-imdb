This movie is good. These great CG kung fu flicks are not the best, but pretty good. First of all, the story is really good. The whole idea of ​​the type of contract of the gods with the strong powers is that it is quite cool. My problem is that there are so many characters! There is a lot of confusion when changing scenes! The special effects were unusual! The battle scenes were very fast paced and complicated. This movie was created almost all computers. The player is always superior to the high-level players as expected. Ekin Cheng is a great hero, a single character. Zhang Ziyi has done nothing for me in this movie. I thought it would be a bigger part, but it was a scene of struggle and a lot of artificial work. The bad man, the whole skull army, and the whole blood cloud are very scared. Music is very good. The story tells me at least one mini series and only one movie. There are so many stories to capture cram within 2 hours. Maybe if I had a book or something, I could continue with all the characters and details. This film sacrifices the story integrity for action. Every day, I propose this to Storm Riders.
