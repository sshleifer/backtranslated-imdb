When looking at some negative messages, you really should be interested in what some people do for fun ... <br /> <br /> I am lucky to see the movie during a very short theatrical show. The audience laughed at their heads. I'm watching a tape as I wrote and still fun fun! <br /> <br /> Also, there is a sweet side, an unexpected turn of the original patosh. The late, the great Royal Dano is particularly effective, just like the low-on-her successful farmer Wrenchmuller. Ariana Richards and J.J. Anderson is as big as the lead guys. Despite being limited to Mary, the actors of the Martian suits have a great deal of work. Another thing is the background details. The film is full of respect, makeup and references to other SF and fantasy films. Next time look at Martian suits. One of them is Marty McFly's costume, two are a Ghostbuster, three are an Atreides shirt and a fourth Starterfighter.
