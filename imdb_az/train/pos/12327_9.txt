Until 1987, Hong Kong released John Woo's "A Better Tomorrow" as "Zu Warriors" and classic "Mr Vampire" films by Sammo Hung's "Spooky Kind" Chow Yun Oil Meetings. Jackie Chan has made an international success in the video, but HK movie has been with the Chinese Ghost Story, which has long been the first real crossover of the West in the West. <br /> <br /> Western films did not see anything like this. It was a film that HK used for years (sword, heroism, heroism, and supernatural), and used them to create a unique film in its appearance, sensation and performance. <br /> <br /> The director, Siu-Tung Ching (still known as the Action Choreographer in Movies as "A Better Tomorrow 2"), The Killer '), under the sensitive eye of the legendary Producer Tsui Hark, Created a masterpiece of Fantasy / Horror. <br /> <br /> "In some cases," Come With White Hair 2 "director and" A Better Tomorrow 1/2/3 "," Hardboiled "and religious hit 'The Club' ') is a pretty genius piece of work.Features of flying, flying, flying, flying, perfectly choreographed, created some of the best HK movies. <br /> <br /> The crew of the movie artists also created miracles, This is a film that is made up of a beautiful blue color painting nightclub, always covered with a steamy mist, a breath-taking platform to unlock our story.There is a film used for a dream beauty tone.Helsia Tsing's silk dresses and dresses it becomes a living part of the film, either in romantic pursuits or in battle scenes A simple scene that changes Hsiao Tsing's clothes is transforming into a whirling beauty as every skill on the set to create the most memorable scene from such a simple action. The sets are also beautiful, giving the forests a different sense of meaning, miraculousness and hardness, exquisite, full of hell for the amazing finale of the flag. <br /> <br /> One of the other key factors in the film's success is made by Romeo Diaz and James Wong. The Hong Kong films gave us some fantastic music and songs that add us to the success of a sequence, but music from a Chinese Ghost Story is just a matter of vital importance. Starting from the opening song, music is emphasized as a symbol. <br /> <br /> The score is a perfect blend of contemporary and traditional tools. Drums, cords and guitars are greatly influenced by motion signals, but in slow, depraved romantic tracks that come to him. Here; flutes, strings, and female chorus creations create the best tracks they hear in the HK movie. Add a surprisingly beautiful song to the female vocals playing Tsau-shen and Hsiao Tsing's love (nothing looks good, but the effect is beautiful, this is a romantic film of innocent love) and may be the music of a movie that has a brilliant example of power. <br /> <br /> Of course, he has the ability to act. Leslie Cheung ("A Better Tomorrow 1 & 2" and a very famous singer) is as superior as the innocent tax collector. Joey Wang (who is then the most likely to be crushed) does not overlap with comic series Joey Wang (gentle soft), and scenes are never played in the right amount of love and innocence. <br /> <br /> How Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau was supporting the role of the classic film "God of Gamblers" did not seem so bright here. He is the song of unpleasant beauty. It is striking that the tragic Hsiao Tsing is described. He is saddened by what has happened and for what he has done, and also moves away from the delicate erotism in the scenes of men's horrible deaths. Veteran actor Wu Ma ("Mr. Vampire", "The Sword-Free") is brave, brave, but so embarrassing, like the Yen very entertaining. It draws a beautiful line between eccentric and ease-of-use teaser. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it may be a character that can cause a film being shot. <br /> <br /> But what about monsters and monsters? Well they are pretty charming, but surprisingly effective for Lord Black, ranging from zombies to a very rude but fun stop motion / animatronik zombies (resulting in persistent gloves attempts to munch about extensively unsuspecting Tsau-shen) living in the temple. Complete the flawlessly flying hats and the perfect wire work. <br /> <br /> But the most prominent influence and creation is the murder of the tree spirit. In the first place, we are experiencing the camera effect that accelerates the Evil Dead style to deliver a deadly French kiss that transforms its victims into zombiehead crusts. But then all the terrible glory was shown. It passes through the forest after the tornado, burns trees, bends itself around the building, looks like the hardness around people before taking the mud and throwing them into the wooden containers! It can even split open to detect a mouth full of mouth! This is a dirty idea because it is important that the deep romantic base is not to work. <br /> <br /> So, all of them are a classic example of Hong Kong. A real group effort, really broke a place to us. Fantasy, the invention, action, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, spectacular visions, fine music and one of the most romantic cinemas, is a full-fledged film.
