When I see Keifer Sutherland playing my favorite character on TV, I will go to the movie and spend $ 15 on it. I also think that this is about Eva Longoria fans. <br /> <br /> The film is about a leak that the secret service agent plans to kill. It appears that only the potential candidate was decorated by Pete (Michael Douglas) when he opened an investigation. <br /> <br /> The evil, the pursuit of truth continues in a fun, illegitimate style. <br /> <br /> It is not firm, of course, not spectacular. A good toy, a decent story, but I felt a little loose, but of course you can get even worse.
