The Cinderella story is my favorite of Charles Perrault with Sleeping Beauty, included in the Disney movie in 1959; this film is a sweet, magical work from Disney. <br /> <br /> The film has a great soundtrack; A very good soundtrack as well as a movie I love too; The most favorite song is romantic "So That's Love". I love the mice movie, they are cute. My favorite scene is the scene after anxiety, and little birds have tried to awaken Cinderella until the morning; Cinderella's animal friends (mice and birds) I love when Cinderella's dresses make up her clothes, so Drizzella and Anastasia could go to the ball!
