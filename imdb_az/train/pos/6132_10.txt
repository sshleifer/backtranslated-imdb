The users who love this movie (from that date) are glad to be moving now. I do not understand people who do not like this movie - they are serious (?!?!) Awaiting treatment. C'mon, how can a hell of a hell take the snowman seriously before? The filmmakers considered it a foolish thing and did not try to deny it. The straight-faced delivery of the scenes is actually FUNNY! Yes, there are times when the low budget shows (like the explosion scene), but I think it's an expensive look from the fun of the movie! So, if you do not want to apply for B-films and others, of course, you'll be like Jack Frost.
