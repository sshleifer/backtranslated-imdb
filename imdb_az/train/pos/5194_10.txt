This is one of my favorite martial arts films from Hong Kong. This is one of John Woo's early films and only a few traditional martial arts films. You can see it in this movie by pulling it under Chang Cheh. The action is good, fighting choreography is done by Fong Hak On, who is seen as one of the worst in the film. They are known for their "Five Venom" fame as Wei Pei and Gold Harvest and Shaw Brothers. The story line is interesting, there are few pieces worthy of twisting, and it is wise to build symbols and relationships with each other. This film had only VHS freedom in the UK. Media Asia has released 3 DVDs to a region and DVDs from the United States have a DVD. The film is great to watch in its original language or in English dubbing. I love this movie.
