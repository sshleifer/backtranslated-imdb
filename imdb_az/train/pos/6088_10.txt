Is the scenario fit for a 30-minute sitcom? Yes, but they are still working! Contrary to actors, I thought it was a fantastic job, especially with Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most of the board members really hate this movie. I can not see how it can be, but Envy is one of those movies you love or hate. Napoleon Dynamite and every Leslie Neilsen movie. You think you are either one of the worst movies or funniest. Do not shoot this movie due to views. Watch it and see you're really one of those who love it! If you do, I'm sure you're worth your money. If you do not like it ... well know.
