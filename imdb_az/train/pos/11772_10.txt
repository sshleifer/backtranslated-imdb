In another Bugs Bunny's bird-upisingly complicated shorts, a famous sculptor * works on a store store that Gildersleeve decided to decide on her. Of course, bugs prove to be almost impossible because bugs know the store better than Gildersleeve (and can spend time). As always, they continue to be at the highest speed, and when it comes out for the first time, it's supposed to be cheerful! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a beautiful example of how Louis Tunes appeared in the 40s. <br /> <br /> Please note that this is very good. <br /> <br /> Leporides are rabbits and birds. .
