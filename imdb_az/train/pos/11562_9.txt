I just do not understand how brilliant pair of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. Lemmon has been featured on a number of well-known films, such as Mr Roberts and The Apartment, and this was fresh from the Oscars victory for Matthau The Fortune Cookie (with Billy Wilder in Lemmon). This movie was not that big, because the story was long (about 2 hours). However, even though events that went up to Lemmon had ended in Matthau's flats, it was a very long (as such sentence), but it went half an hour. <br /> <br /> I wrote a comment on how this film was followed and that I would not go deep. that's it. The reason for such a joy is that the film is prepared as if American films were innocent, and they quickly began to forget. There are some sexual references, but this is treated innocently so that I can not say the most honest people there, "Well, I never ..." It's fun to watch a movie from a long time, and that's why it's incomplete, because Matthau and Lemmon say a few f-words and do not fit them. Of course, now they are both on the go, and you can be happy that you can only love them in such a beautiful movie. In this film I still live, I think only male actor John Fiedler. Edelman has recently died. That's why. It's just one of the best comedies and movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I did not mean any disrespect, and I'm going to try to be more careful about the things that are blah.
