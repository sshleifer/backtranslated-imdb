I am delighted to see those who regard me as Great Art as an actor of a society that works hard but does not act very seriously. <br /> <br /> A significant player in a movie is similar to a dictator. When the dictator is killed and killed by a large amount of drinking and eating, the actor is forced to play "a lifetime" by the neo-Nazi leader. <br /> <br /> Dictator's girlfriend turns out to love her and vice versa, and she's fine with the sheets he seizes. <br /> <br /> A great deal of work, a very good job, is widening by some of the unrecognized actors, particularly the two homeowners and palace guardians and most of the entertaining community. Sammy Davis Jr. illuminates himself, plays a semi-retired American businessman with something else, and is not the exception of Richard Dreyfuss, Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, and all of whom are outstanding. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The mute movie, but in the very beautiful places (Brazil), makes a humorous script and good actors look like they are really fun,
