This film was watching in one of my usual time, that night is real. Generally, if a movie does not interest me, I'm starting to fall asleep, and I should not be in a position to keep the refrigerator awake. <br /> <br /> First, I thought that the speed of this film began to slow, its shooting was long-lasting. But a little later, I began to get more into the movie, because more information about the main character, explaining her story, was given. Until the end, you feel like you are familiar with all his life. <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ strong>
