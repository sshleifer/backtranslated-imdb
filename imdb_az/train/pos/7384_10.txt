Ogtay Oscar was the only reason he followed. He is joyful. Of course, there was a serious approach to the show. It's not just funny, it's just a public forum that's great for telling you some things. The white nation, the Hollywood prizes, should be reminded that 'ceremonies, employment, and representation are the only exit from racism'. There is no need for "Black" awards. White-bread, milquetoast nominators and judges need to see the sun go up and not be limited to large material "white" directors, producers, actors, etc. The poor taste of Woody Allen in the air was deep. He has nothing to do with it. In fact, this is the first Oscar presentation I'm looking for because of the "The Color Purple" awards. The low cost of voting made me watch the show until 2002. Not to insult other promoters. Billy Crystal is a rebel.
