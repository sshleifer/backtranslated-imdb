This movie is incredible, it is a movie watching, and more than watching other movies by the actor you are watching by other filmmakers / writers. Sandler did a good job of working out a character outside the comfort zone and always made a very good job at the good Cheadle. This movie is great for a mature intelligent audience. The actor was fantastic and just overwhelmed by the film's director and director. This film focuses not on true Americans, past generations, no stereotypes or racism, but on people who come together and realize the true meaning of life. This film is sadly fighting. Instead of choosing a psychiatrist, instead of judging him properly, he should not judge you with an impartial person, but rather guide you to your thoughts. This movie is absolutely wonderful!
