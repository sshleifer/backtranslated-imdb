Wrong in military school? Hmmmm, it sounds funny, maybe he's attacking one another. There are characters, the Arab thief, sexually mad teenager, clever mouth, pot smoker, forget about, the man who burns things. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie and it's funny, because it's no nonsense, because comedy has turned around the truth, direct homosexual Sergent and a sexy ammunition teacher Sergent. <br /> <br /> If you try to work together, work will be done. <br /> <br /> The Weinberg Military School has set up this group of students for it, because Sgt Liceman says: "You were abandoned, embarrassed to your families, and societies, disgrace." <br /> <br /> Ralph Macchio's Karate One of his previous appearances before Kid and Cousin Vinny is Barbara Bach's speech, which addresses young people and young adults. <br /> <br /> The great movie continues the film's movement.
