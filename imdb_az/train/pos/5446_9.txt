National Lampoon's Class Reunion is a classic comedy movie, starting with the 1980s, combining unique characters, many laughs and some great music from Chuck Berry. When Walter Bailor was totally humiliated by his classmates at high school, he had the opportunity to revenge in his classroom interview. He keeps his classmates covering the innocent blind girl, the horny fat boy, the beauty of the secondary school, the king of all preps, and even the ugly luncheon lady serving in the high school all the kids. There is some kind of scary element in this movie, and there are some short sexual scenes, so I will not recommend for small children, but it's a great movie for teens. If you are looking for a movie with a beautiful score, you do not like classic or symbolic special effects Class Reunion. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and have some great laughs and lots of fun (and who does not), you should be in your movies to see this movie list. ++
