Secret Sunshine notes that Lee Changdong is returning to the world of filmmaking after a year's decade. The three critically acclaimed filmmakers are now inviting veteran teens Jeon Doyone and her very important (Cannes winning) talents for Lee Shinae's main task. <br /> <br /> While watching the secret sunlight, it is clear that if it does not pay attention to the pursuit of any genre, it is the investigation of a woman's tragedy and its fighting mechanisms. but in the event of necessity to choose the genre features to convey what they are trying to convey. The story follows Lee Shinae because he moves with his son to Miliang (turns into Sino-Korea's Hidden Sun). Like his hometown, his spouse moves to Milleanga after his death, so the film is born of tragedy. And I think that things just might be better as it opens a piano shop and faces a bit like a beautifully-similar mechanical Jongchan (played by Song Kangho). But this is not a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> As we (and Jongchan, doggedly) faced Milyang and fought for Shinae as his destiny, his armor cracks appear fast. She is a troubled woman trying to understand her power to tackle the tragedy, and she is not enough to look like she finds. The Hidden Sunshine still continues to follow Aristotle's dramatic publication, but some viewers, especially the romantic symbolism that ends, but under the name of Milyang, catharsis, reflecting the sun, and the drawings used. <br /> <br /> Very pleased with the film shooting. Once again I started thinking about the movie. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Jeon would have been a painful melodrama, especially when she played a better role, but given that Shinae took the nuances of her attempts to fight her finesse security. Mr. Song plays a smaller role than other films in this film, but she is still satisfied with Mrs. Jeona's appearance. Technically, the movie is well-known in classical sense. No aesthetic aesthetic here works - the director tries to make the story clearer. I think only one real complaint and it can not be fixed, although there is always a distance between Shinae and the audience (or at least me), though we always spend with Shinae. I think that some of them come from the nature of the work, because when the general empathy is exposed, we will not see the problems that Shinan is objective. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, despite the tire's condition, I never felt tired, despite her tears. Along with this, the film has still encouraged me to think about other things that existed and rallies, struggles, self-deception, insulation and loans related to the tragedy were compressed with me after the loans. I acted with the performance of a powerful lead, honestly did not notice the duration of 2.25 hours. And he says something. Yes. 8/10.
