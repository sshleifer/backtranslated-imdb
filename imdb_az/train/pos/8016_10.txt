Do not think of these movies as another baby movie - the whole family can do it. The film is a strange blend, with a film inside it, but at least it is at least meaningful (unlike contemporary movies). All the elements of a movie (a decent plot, good characters). - well, Muppets star, small celebs list *) is not surprising, these emotions are roller coaster, some sad, some heartwarming, some are funny and some may be seriously <br /> <br /> The film shoots are actually the best of the day stars, but there is only one true star in the film and no one is charming Miss Piggy Interview
