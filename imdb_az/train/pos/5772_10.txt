I watched this show as a kid and loved it! I was watching when Toonami came YEARS years ago .... Sheesh, I'm a very old voice! I should be 13 or 14 years old ... But this was a great line of mischief, and I'm one of the virgin girls watching Sailormoon (and ADORED) and I really liked it. The animation was not good ... In fact, in some places it was very entertaining, and in fact, the sound was very moving, but it was all a good hour, and I felt myself in the day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Samurai soldiers / Ronin Warriors are classic and always my faves. Go Ryo !!!!
