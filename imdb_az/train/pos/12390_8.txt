Filled with celebrities, but stolen by Cristina Raines (later on by the TV's Flamingo Road), she was stolen as a beautiful, but unstable model with a quiet smile designed to cover her own suicide! The scenes with Raines modeling are very well kept, the mood music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is attractive as Cristina's sister, but when the Raines enters the creepy Brooklyn Heights brown stone (a cave monster set up on the upper floor), it actually begins to dine. A fabulous bad Burgess Meredith and a kinky couple are neighbors, including Sylvia Miles & Beverly D'Angelo, a lot of diabolical and Eli Wallach is great fun as a clever police detective. The film is about a mix of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" - but not what the merger! According to Jeffrey Konvitz's best seller, The Sentinel was thoroughly enjoyed by entertaining, shocking, film director Michael Winner. *** From *****
