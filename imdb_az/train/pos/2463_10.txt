William Shakespeare would be very proud of this particular version of his game. This is not the best movie version, but the only full version of the Hamlet. Kenneth Branak's Hamlet is simply genius. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Generally, not because she wrote Shakespeare, but at least four hours, even though she is brave enough to do everything too. <br /> <br /> We are all members of the Danish Presidium and his father to escape the death of his father, so I will not go into the details of the story. However, the best part of this Hamlet version is not breathtaking sets or stunning photography, but the interpretation of actors of each character. You can find Polonius better than Richard Briers' delicious image. Plus, you can not go wrong with Julie Christie and Jack Lemmon. Also, Derek Jacobi is magnificent as an antagonist against Hamlet, regularly between Shakespeare adaptations. <br /> Certainly, we should talk about Kenneth Branag. He told the audience when Shakespeare came on stage with her first visit to Henry V. With Hamlet he dismissed himself. Certainly, Olivier's presence was attractive, but I think Branak's performance is amazing. While watching her on the screen, she knew exactly Shakespeare could play a role. It's a secret that Oscar is not a candidate for. At least the film is the only choice for several nominations and scenarios. Maybe they know a good post when they look at it. <br /> <br /> All this, Bard's best game will never find a richer and more luxurious product. The technical aspects can be said to be a great thing, a little understood. If you love this game and are an admirer of Shakespeare, you should definitely watch this movie. If you do not really care about Sugar, the images will be occupied by the film. You will not think that you can all sit down as soon as possible, but sooner or later you want to stop this movie.
