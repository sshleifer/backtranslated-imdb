In the early part of the century, those who were film-makers had already understood a portion of their potential very early. It's a good playboy-type story that sells to Satan, who needs money and blesses for so much. Unfortunately, the soul is double, and he often has to deal with it and separate his life. There are some beautiful scenes in which people are waving and, of course, the scenes are on the stage at the same time. The middle part is a bit short, but the story of Faustian is in the minds of the audience. One thing I can say is that people in the movie are generally ugly. In addition, they are far away from many activities that want to give something to at least one thing. I was aware of this movie 25 years ago and finally saw it. I'm not disappointed.
