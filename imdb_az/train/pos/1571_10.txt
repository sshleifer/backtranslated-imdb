We've seen more cartoon on the TV since Spongebob Squarepants. The colors are great, the sounds can not be better, the characters are so original, great cartoon. Hope Nickolodean continues to develop this animated film. Season DVD coming soon! I love these types of cartoons, and more and more people are forced to look at this great cartoon. It's hard to find a season DVD, so if someone finds a store that sells, let me know. Only Catscratch products available at Nick Shop are a great look, but are too expensive! If you love Spongebob; and who does not? you love Catscratch!
