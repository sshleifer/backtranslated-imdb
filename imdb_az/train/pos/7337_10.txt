Good story and excellent animation. The influence of Frazetta and Baker is clear, and that's a good thing. Anyone who enjoys the Conan Barbarian or the game Dungeons and Dragons should love it. The battle between good and bad is sometimes clear, even when our hero is neutral. In most fantasy movies Elves are usually described as white skin and yellow hair and goblins and orcs are dark skin and hair. Anyone who is familiar with the case of Frazetan, Baker and even Tolkien knows that they are not racist. Anyone using Fantasy movies should love this movie. Due to violence and sexual relations, it is not for small children. Casting was fine and the first stage of the scenes and music. Hopefully someone puts this ship on DVD. I'm lucky I have a VHS copy in good condition.
