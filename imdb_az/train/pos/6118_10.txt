Jack Frost is a really cool movie. I mean .... Its funny. Violence. and very pleasant. People are making many statements, but this can not be avoided by the truth. Have Great Special Effects and Good Operations. The only thing strange is, of course, Killer Snowman. I think this film is actually one of the best films of the last 90s. Most movies do not have A Clive Barker Master Piece Criterion these days. That is, Be original and give the viewer what they did not expect. Jack Frost is very cool. From 10 to 10. Degree: A +. Also, Sam Frost's fans recommend film uncle.
