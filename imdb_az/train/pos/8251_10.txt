And this one is mine. Here you can see only when you leave the IMDb or the theater. Why did people like it? However, it is clear that at least the zombies (at least "Dawn of the Dead" or "Resident Evil" movies) are at least astonished fans and others. <br /> Or at least they knew about everything about the Zombi ... this movie came together. And the zombies will be able to see a new light (perhaps). This is not a scary movie, though there are some violent scenes, but not a comedy. A line should be accurate. And never goes out of the steam! That is why I appreciated it. Pacing wise is incredible, acting is great, and there is no obvious error in the script ... on the contrary, this is a bit of a stone and a zombie interested in seeing it! Even though you look at them! Because this is a big (comedy) movie!
