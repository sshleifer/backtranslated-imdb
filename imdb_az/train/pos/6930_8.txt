This is a fairly unusual and unique little Western that is unique because of the unique and superior Winchester 1873 rifle and the stories around everyone who managed to shoot at a single point or somewhere in the movie. <BR> <br /> <br /> It is a very entertaining movie that is most watched but still not true western. <br /> <br /> The film is made in a typical '40' / 50 's western genre, so the lover's genre should not be extinguished with a slightly unusual moment. <br /> <br /> Because the rifle is actually the main film of the film, the story allows you to watch multiple characters throughout the movie, all of which are definitely connected and create a full circle at the end of the story. This movie would be quite soggy to watch, so the story often split from one dangerous situation to another, and it was always engaged in different symbols. Maybe they've all done this Wyatt Earp. But it is not really criticism. I like how the film and its story are original and that the film has gone from one incident to another. <br /> <br /> It gave the movie a bit of adventure and entertaining feeling. <br /> <br /> This is really a very nice movie. I really liked the parameters you used and I really believe that director Anthony Mann is the first western. <br /> <br /> The choice of James Stewart as a key cause was a very daring choice. He is one of the most gentle and most polite acting and acting actors, so it seems as though he is a tough weapon. But Stewart is surprisingly convincing as a tough guy, and shows that he is actually versatile and really capable of actors. <br /> <br /> There are some striking actresses in the film, which is not related to this genre. <br /> <br /> <strong> <p> <p> <p> <div> <p> <p style = "text-align : justify; /> 8/10
