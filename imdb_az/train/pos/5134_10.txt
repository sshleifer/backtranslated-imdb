It's a short Academy Award nomination and I wish you had earned it! Basically, a jam session, amongst many talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, is incredible! Hollywood has been quite often involved in jazz (especially animation, believe or not), but it's a rare appearance in an improvisational assembly. This film has been added to the Protection List and is worth it. TCM manages it and runs for the "31 Days Oscar" ceremony once every week. In the center of the city there was nothing but shingle, wavy, white, and the shooting was very soft, the net was weak. The most solid and highly recommended !!!
