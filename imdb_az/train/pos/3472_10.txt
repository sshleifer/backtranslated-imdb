Many Spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie (though only on TV) is absolutely excellent. I really did not pay attention to the differences in appearance or habits, so I really can not comment on it. In this case, I pinch myself and say, "Remember, that's just a movie, it's NOT". When I talked and listened to Harris and Quinn, I knew that this meeting was really a good idea if John and Paul talked. John's burnt interpretations and burns were in line with the character of Paul (especially in the restaurant!), As Paul, as in his depression, withdrew while walking in a very easy way. Both actors did a great job, and I was thrilled to see this movie. It's a bad experience for any Beatles fan. Prepare a few surprises!
