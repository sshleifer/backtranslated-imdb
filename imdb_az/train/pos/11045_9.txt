The French horror film has gained momentum with major movies such as Inside and Switchblade Romance for the past two years. Maléfique is just ahead of the resurrection, but the most up-to-date horrors are head and shoulders, and, of course, one of the best French frighten movies ever made! Maléfique has been explicitly thrown into a low budget, but this is done more than once with the originality of the film, which is accompanied by a perfect article and a movie that lets the movie win. The field focuses on two main ideas; prison and black magic. The central character is Carrère, sent to prison for fraud. He is put into a three-cell cell; quietly delusional Lassalle, body structure transvestite Marcus and his late boyfriend Daisy. After a period in the cell, they escape to an old magazine hiding in the wall. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Black Magic is a very interesting subject, it was surprising that there were not many more films in it, because there was a multidimensional framework for things to do with it. Maléfique is fair to say that, despite his wealth, he has shown the best of his assets, the film is in fact never restricted and the best flow. Director Eric Valette provides a nice atmosphere for the movie; The film, most of which appears inside a central prison cell, feels that the film is very claustrophobic and provides a great benefit to the centerpiece of prisoners who want to use magic to get out of the cell - it's easy to keep them behind! It is often said that an unidentified person is really a scary person, and this film proves that director, as a director, can not really be sure what is on the corner, and that helps Maléfiiq really manage. terribly terrible! The movie has been remembered for many reasons beyond the central part; all the heroes are very interested in themselves and the truth in which the book is characterized is very good. Everyone is worried that the film will not end, or when it's over, both are meaningful and terrifying! In general, Maléfique is really a great fear movie and one of them is the best - FIX CALENDAR!
