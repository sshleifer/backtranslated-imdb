This is a brave look at the mindset of men in a wheelchair. This film has never tried these flowers, cotton candies or soft soap to reduce the confusion, confusion, and pain experienced by these people. I think it is his strength. <br /> <br /> But more than that, the performances are fantastic, well-thought-out and conveyed to you, attracts you and feels a part of the experience. <br /> <br /> Heroes are trying to prevent the audience from knowing what's in their hearts. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> Please be reminded:.
