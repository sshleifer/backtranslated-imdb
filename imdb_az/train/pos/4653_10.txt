Here's an unhappy British comedy movie and I can watch it again and again without tiredness. Peter Ustinov has never played a bad role, and this is not an exception, not a very clever master plan, especially with a dry mind. Karl Malden has always been an admirer for me as he plays "streets of San Francisco." I believe that Maggie Smith believes that this is a true star of the film, though he tries to do everything, but in reality it opens, especially when he has put so much money on everyone and discovered that he was washing his clothes. Something does not care about me, though I can say what someone can say to me, why can not I buy DVD or VHS format in the UK, can anyone help?
