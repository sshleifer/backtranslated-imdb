OK, you first set up the tag placed on the main page of this movie. Abe Lincoln did not go with his sister in the film, nor stood in his brother's grave. The subject is Ann Rutlede, a close friend of Lincoln in the days of New Salem. Some say that Ann is actually a girlfriend of Lincol, but there's no evidence to support that. <br /> <br /> Now this movie has fiction and so-called consolation. Hollywood has always taken a dramatic license with something under the sun and is not an exception to "Young Lincoln Lincoln". The film is a real event in the courtroom: William has still watched the audience, despite the fact that Duff has been accused of committing a crime against Armstrong and that he has been re-constructed with many renowned titles. This is Hollywood's Golden Age, Henry Fonda, the best drama, that gives the best Lincolne played by everyone.
