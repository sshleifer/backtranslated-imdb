A great documentary about the life of NY firefighters during the worst terror attacks of all time .. One reason for this is why I need to see collective items .. Not only shocked me but also the "High Fat Diet" and some of these firefighters' physical appearance . I think many doctors will agree with me that some of these firefighters would not go to the 79th floor with more than 60 lb gears because they were in the physical form. Now it is a life that changes the job of saying that it is more respectful to the rescuers and being a rescuer. There is a history in France preparing great documentaries, and this is a great documentary .....
