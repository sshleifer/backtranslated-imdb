If you are moving fast with horrible reading, you will find below a classic fairy tale. Christopher Walken plays a very humorous and surprising role. It works well for Puede Punch, in the trademark style. Other actors are good for their parts. I have never done a very terrible fake or unusual job. Especially when the king seems to be an argument, I think he will be. I can not remember the real tale. Special effects are typical of the 80's, but at least what we see today is not as fraudulent as some of the payments from the computer. In general, I recommend this movie for children and adults who are children of a heart.
