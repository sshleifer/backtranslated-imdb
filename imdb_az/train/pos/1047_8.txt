This is probably the most exciting reason why I actually checked this movie because it wanted to see the performance of a man who beat Humphrey Bogart in CASABLANCA (10/10). The best actor Oscar. (I would give Oscars Bogie, but Paul Lucas did a great job and was able to be a candidate at least). Well, I'm glad to check out this movie because I'm very glad <br /> <br /> I think the movie is a bit prettier, but I did not even consider it, I'm really glad to talk and never did it <br /> <br / > It was a great game in this movie, especially for Paul Lukas, Lucile Watson (a fair Oscars), Bette Davis (not named), George Coulouris and Eric Roberts, who strangely played middle child: /> <strong> <br /> <br /> The character of Lukas forced him to do something that he thought I was wrong, despite all that he did. I gave her the reason why she felt what she was doing, and I realized why she could not explain it clearly. The story of this movie is good and noble, the decor (the meaning of the house) is beautiful and the actor is perfect. <br /> <br /> 9/10
