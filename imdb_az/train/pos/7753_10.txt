This Belgian movie, run by the well-known dEUS singer Tom Barman, will not be supported by anyone. For a simple reason, there is no clear story or trick. This movie shows only 24 hours a day in "a city" (here in Antwerp) and is a truly tragic, directive, humorous (Dario !, Osteopath Bruno !, ...) and tragic (Windman, Paul Garcin, ...) symbols. <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: Windmand on the beach, at the end of the dance party, KISS-fan, and Windman osteopathy ... <br /> <br /> It's clear that some of the other viewers in this movie they did not realize that it was beautiful and interesting. <br /> <br /> This film has no stories and is therefore complaining about it. But this is the atmosphere that keeps you watching. <br /> <br /> If you have not looked at it yet, listen carefully. Music. Just like Tom Barman and his band dEUS, it's amazing. <br /> <br /> "Ssst, mondje dicht h√©". (do not tell anyone)
