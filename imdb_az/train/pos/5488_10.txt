Cases of being at the right time in the right place. Great movie. It's easy to see how popular the people are with Chavez. It will be done. It is accessible. And so he hates him very much. He manages his country's resources and regained the people. Mostly poor. And it's easy to see how television stations can put wrong images. Like the Iraq War and the War on Terror. Or those with WMD missing. Or is it a bad stream? People need to wake up. From a different point of view. Stop the neo-cons of the world. Go, watch this movie with an open mind. Raise your mind. Then I suggest to see Aaron Russo: America: Freedom to Fascism. This is not the American people, it's a problem. Government.
