Magicians make a beautiful ride from start to finish, thanks to a large portion of the magic created by the stars. Alan Arkin is one of the best roles in the decades to come. Like any really nice movie, it's a journey back from the subject and the result of desires. I can not believe it's too hard to find this movie - I'll buy a DVD in a heartbeat, but I still can not find a single shot.
