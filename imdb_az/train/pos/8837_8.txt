My personal feeling is that you can not waste your political / historical work as many American commentators. It's not on Main Street Street in the United States. About the growth in Yugoslavia at a time of decline between East and West. Ester and Ester, as well as tearing apart from everyone else, have been split between children with "Brand Joe". There is embarrassment in certain situations that are missing on a spectator who has not lived under Tito's. I believe the film is small and the director is so bad we've lost. Freedom of films like this is more important. It's not just a film of East Europe's age-alteration ... it's a sensitive image of teenagers looking at a good line that can bring extremely real freedom.
