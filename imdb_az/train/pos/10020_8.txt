The legendary Boris Carloff has made his famous career, making horns in Mexico, causing four cheap fears. This band is a gothic horror group that has entered into a tough time. Carloff delivers a usual embarrassment and respectful performance as an old eccentric patriarch, Matthias Morteval, who invites a creepy rush castle to read a will of a few small, willow, strange and unwelcome few relatives. The deadly lifetime of entertaining guests who have recently hated them is thrown by people. Mexican Sex Symbol Anders Garcia, "Tintorera," describes the hero of the police officer, and is so excited as Julissa's only lover of character. Very ugly, washable cinema, ridiculous killing pieces (a lightweight blush, a miniature blasted with a ball!), Excessive stringed honey, a terrible terrible atmosphere, very bad mood (especially Karloff), cheesy soft eyes, poor With a dazzling and dazzling result, a gruesome and unusual fun splash of glowing ghosts is added to this gruesome lemon. A real campy hoot.
