If you want something like a scream or a big studio horror product, it's not an issue that we are forced to do today. This well-written movie was about everything I needed to give. In our lives, the importance of the myth, the miracle, the interpretation of children in the world (and violence in it), the spread of the environment and the history and legends of ignorance .. all this, but not on the surface. Although Wendigo does not get a physical form until the end, you can technically say "monster movie" and then you and your legendary spirit are up to what you are up to. Some standard tension elements are just looking for the basics and the film, but in fact, it's better to see just how little creature is actually. Fessenden continues the tradition of using the genre of George Romero as a discussion forum, and still drags us off.
