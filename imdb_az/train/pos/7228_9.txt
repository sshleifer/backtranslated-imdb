Undoubtedly emphasizing this film is Peter O'Toole's performance. In its turn, it is a wildly funny and very scary tragic situation. Is someone better than O'Toole? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> The story is strange and disturbingly emotionally strong in parts (especially to the end), but it is also striking and achieving many levels. However, I felt that the film was mostly around Peter O'Toole's speeches, and it was even more than half a day if that did not happen.
