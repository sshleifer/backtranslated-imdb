A young cats try to get their brother's soul out of it, but only half, and then have to go through the adventure to get the other half ... or maybe not. <br /> <br /> Of course, I am not convinced that some of the events in this film are filled with many strange, surprising pictures that can cause anxiety (ie cats that partially cut cats) <br /> Someone, Hello Kitty is a very strange movie like acid, and I think more like Hello Kitty, as done by Dali. . (Of course, this is more livelier than Destinos based on his work). <br /> <br /> If you are confronted with many movies that are prone to your ideas, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Just be ready for some strange images that will burn into your memory. <br /> <br />
