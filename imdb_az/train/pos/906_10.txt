VIVAH is the best film of 2006 in my book! PERIOD !!. My book is one of the 100 best films in Bollywood. It's a pity that this sad movie does not have so much appreciation and does not have much popularity. <br /> <br /> VIVAH is again a true success of a director. HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya Sooraj once removed from a vivid VIVAH. <br /> <br /> This is the simplest and favorite movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <! - away from the beautiful culture we have in the form of Hollywood style as Dhoom 2 and don. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and the Indian system is part of what I want to be part of. The system that teaches us to obey the elders, follow them, and of course, obeying their thoughts is so dramatic in this film! Of course, there is no power to choose a partner of life and, as illustrated in this film, it should have a brief view of the couple and her. <br /> <br /> When returning to the movie ..... VIVAH is a story of a journey between the engagement and the beautiful period of marriage. The stage where the man met the girl! .. Both do not understand each other .. They try to estimate each other as Valentine's (according to our system) and the variety of marriages that they love each other <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao is brilliant in the movie ...... The witness OK ..... and Alok Nath and Anupam Kher are awesome! Songs BRILLIANT. !! I especially like HAMARI SHAADI MAIN HAFTE REH GYE CHAAR and Do Anjaane Ajnabi ...... I generally should look for anyone who believes in Indian culture and tradition. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie ...... In a word ....... <br /> <br /> BLISS!
