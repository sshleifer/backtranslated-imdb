It is impossible to have a tornado in Bulgaria, but my imagination says "I'm scared!" This guy (Devon Sawa) has done a great job with this movie! I know how old your assignment is, but she did not act as a child (you can be added!) Now about the tornado - it was not very realistic, but you were scared! If you want to spend a good time in front of the TV, this is a movie!
