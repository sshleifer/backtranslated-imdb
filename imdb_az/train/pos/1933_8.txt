This indie film reviews the lives of a group of people who are taking the lead swimming sketch in Connecticut. The area is quite polite. Filmmakers are well-behaved characters by most unknown actors. Standouts in casting, Brewster, Weixler as a casino vendor with moonlights as a middle school teacher with a marriage problem and a stripper. These two actors give their natural speeches and work together well. This is an effective feature film debut for writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter moves the lever with a fast clip. The film's name and poster offer something, but it's a wonderful comedy drama.
