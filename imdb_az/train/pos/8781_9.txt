I think myself a part of the boxing expert and there is something that prevents Gentleman Jim from calling the best boxing film. It's Robert Wise / Paul Newman's flick "Someone likes sleep there." This movie can be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is No. 2. <br /> <br /> The film shows not only James J. Corbett's rise but also the sport of boxing. important transition period. At the end of the 1800s, boxing drove away from the brutal days of the bare knife rules, the "gentleman" days of the Marquis of Queensbury rules. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman Jim" is not a real look at those days. Romantic and yes, sometimes a little hockey. But always in a delectable way. Errol Flynn is truly a "gentleman", not just a "Gentleman" Jim who speaks fast from a working class family. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Alexis Smith has a love / hate relationship with a high-level female woman John L Sullivan, the end of Gentleman Jim (the famous line, of course, it is impossible to lick anybody "... romance) led her to Corbet. This is really one of the best scenes in any sports action. Realist? No. But nice. Hey, you want to watch the Raging Bull instead of the truth. This is more realistic boxing film. But "Gentleman Jim" is much more entertaining.
