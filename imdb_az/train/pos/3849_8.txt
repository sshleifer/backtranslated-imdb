Verhooven's recent Dutch talk made me laugh. All movies and cross-references in any movie, etc. As a film buff looking, I can provide everyone interested in the film art that will entertain all the senses in this part. I have not read the book Gerard Reves, but I still believe that a poet / writer who has deceived himself will have a sincere shape (in some way - not here). A hero hero, as well as his character, is surrounded by symbols that have unequivocal intentions. All of this is perfectly packed in a cinematography Paul Verhopven is trying to turn the suspenseful film-noir setting, the impressive work of the Dutch towns pretty sweet "gesellich (?)"!
