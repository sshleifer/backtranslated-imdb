I saw this movie. This movie is best for today's needs. Marriage is the biggest problem these days. This film is the best when expressing this problem. In this film, India's values ​​are expressed very well. Today's young people should understand this problem. The number of girls is small. Due to these problems, girls committed suicide. If this problem persists, then the day when a girl does not have a baby is not too far away. So, in view of this statement, today's young people do not take the lead in getting married, so they have to understand. We need to learn from this movie that Bread should not be avoided. If we understand this problem, it is possible to see a new tendency in society. This is a major change in society.
