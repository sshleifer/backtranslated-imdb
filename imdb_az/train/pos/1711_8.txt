Abhay Deol's second film, written by Imtiaz Ali, daughter of Shivam Nair, is directed. The Soha is likely to run away from home and meet her for the first (?) Meat as Rolee waiting for her lover Deyeray (Shayan Munsi) in the Delhi marriage secretary's office. She is waiting and waiting and finally marked as a girl who was angry by Ankush (Abhay Deol). After a few days, they spend a lot of days trying to escape from a trick and end up loving them to the end. Then your boyfriend turns! Aage pardey, parme! I know? Le Notti Bianchi, a friend of Dostoevsky's White Nights, is alike (albeit small, like Anush who tells the boy who killed his beloved). But it's more landmark and realistic (duh) adaptation compared to the very sensitive and excessive Saawaria. <br /> <br /> No one had brought this small ship a few months ago while talking with Saawaria as crazy. <br /> <br /> Delhi's settings are beautiful - the old Delhi, Jama Masjid, a roof top, Connaught Circus, the streets with rickshaw (How?). The hotel's colorful lighting units are enough to tell you that this is a merger with rooms for rent at this hour! <br /> <br /> I love this young man more than Abha. In this second film she is very good at work by a beautiful woman, who is given a goal in life. The field looks fine and she smiles when she is in the role, but in more serious moments I find her convincing. I'm sure she'll be a great actress, or maybe a breeze like a brother. Himesh Reshammiya's music is not so great and in reality it conquers songs in the film, breaks their definition, and does not sit well with the characters trying to read them. The castle is very good and I give it a thumb to adapt to the White Nights. Btw - Abhay Deol's has nothing to do with my favorite ratings.
