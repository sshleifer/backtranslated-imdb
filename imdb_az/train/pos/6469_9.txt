Hal Roach really a great short. <br /> <br /> For these two main reasons: at least some of the kids are the sweetest in the shortest possible time, and the body has so many comic and written elements. <br /> <br /> Little Rascals, I do not think of more than a child at about four years old than Spanky. In the years that followed, she was just a precious child, even though she was a fuller and ugly boy. <br /> <br /> Older children Spanky is involved in this terrible infant work, even placing a small child responsible for caring for small children is not only funny, but every kind of funny mayhem is empty. Gags is a very effective and good process - with a casual crank challenge involving a murder and a final scene, Spanky FINALLY captures the smallest ones in the most memorable way. I have not seen these shorts for many decades and have given it a chance.
