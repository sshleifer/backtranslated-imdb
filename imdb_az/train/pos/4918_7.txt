As the film opens, two thieves kill another thief. Despite the fact that the body was detected and immediately killed by the physician for autopsy, despite the death of the physician, he suffered from Pnumonic Disease - the worst and more virulant version of the Bubonic Plague! <br /> <br /> A race against time to find those who are in contact with the killer and find those who are immediately cured. Otherwise, a disaster may occur. <br /> <br /> At the same time, I know a little about the Pneumonic Plague, I have given some lessons on this subject for History lessons. The film really did not do a good job to get facts about the illness that seemed so little to the film. The biggest problem is that the disease is incredibly strange, in 1950 it would not be allowed to show it. Of course, there is high fever and cough (they have taken this right), as well as very bleeding and blown blood with explosive vomiting - with Bubonic tuberculosis you will get along with many swollen lymph nodes - all purposeful and common! Certainly, I do not understand why you did not go so far. Also, I am convinced that the federal government is more involved in the management and management of the disease - everyone at the very local level has looked badly and was a little dumb. Nobody was ready to believe in the doctor! As for the actor film, there were a few great actors here. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas, respectively, are public health physicians and police chiefs. There are good players, however, in the 1950s, also known actors. But in the first film, Jack Palance (still the original moniker, 'Walter Jack Palance') and also relatively unknown (zero) Zero Mostel. Palance was very nice - very stunts and very stunts physically. <br /> <br /> According to Mammad, there are many doubts. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it's great action and worth seeing.
