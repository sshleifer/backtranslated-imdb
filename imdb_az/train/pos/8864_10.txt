What an extraordinary crime training! My husband and I saw the Toronto International Film Festival last week and was the very best film in a very powerful festival far away. My second favorite movie after DR after all. <br /> <br /> I went home and discussed the film with my spouse, and I was in a definite way at a high level. <br /> <br /> I do not want to disrupt the fate of my spouse because the excitement of this caliber is unthinkable. Two brothers, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke, are planning to rob a jewelry store in Westchester, New York. The film spins over a two-week period (in advance, during and after robbery) and a main scene is repeated at least three times. Usually it can break the momentum of a movie, but it will never happen during the work. The excitement, tension, and even the quality of the film seemed only better. Until the end, I was on the edge of the chair I had hoped for a long time to see how to understand. I know that I used some cliches in this post, but it was as if I were sitting down. It should be noted that the non-linear story is very easy to follow. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> < textual align: justify; The only impression for the film if it were not perfect for casting A small complaint was that Hoffman and Hawken did not look like a brother, but a small word that I can easily ignore - Hoffman was the best and many scenes were positive with Hawke. Marisa Tomei (also known as Hofman's wife) and Albert Finney (like Hoffman and Hawke's ancestors) are also good at supporting some of the performances that were so impressive that every single note by Brian O'Byrne and Michael Shannon and the expression of facial expression - absolute excellence - the scene of robbery felt more convincing than the scenes of other cinematographic genocides, and I was particularly convinced that Hoffman had the same sense of reality in most scenes. helped to create tension, often played the same notes very effectively, as I sat in other films, playing music on the next day. At the beginning of this paragraph was a bit twist, along with my little complaint, a bit incredible (the main spoiler, I can not describe the scene). Otherwise, this film is perfectly close. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of great movies I enjoyed watching for the second time in the festival, but it's ONLY in a league that's dead before you die. On the one hand, director Sidney Lumet spoke before the movie and took Marisa Tomei and Ethan Hawkeni on the stage. Tomei did not speak and made a little embarrassment, so Lumet asked, "Can anyone embarrass this beautiful camera?" This comment is quite ironic considering the graphics boot scenario!
