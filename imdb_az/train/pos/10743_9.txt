I read most of the comments here. I came to nearly everybody to admit that 9/11 was a shocking date. <br /> <br /> There are a few people who think that the narration is weak. <br /> <br /> I accept that the Prophet is weak and unnecessary. About two brothers on Tony after the disaster. But I do not think the narration is unnecessary. As a very theoretician, I think my own life is legends. We live and live our own biography. This is the story when we talk about our lives. <br /> <br /> We are native, childhood, high school, and so on. We do not summarize some facts. <br /> <br /> Because we are familiar with stories we want to put a historical story. . Because we can identify ourselves in the form of a story. When we say stories in the past, we can understand well. Thus, it is intended to add a documentary story. The story is weak, so we understand what will happen. <br /> <strong> </ strong> </ strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify; True, it's great about the last 11/11 but there are a few ideas on the subject, but nobody is like this documentary, but if it's about a 5-year movie, I agree that I'm trying to make money from 9/11, but the movie I think the films are one of the best ways in history.Well, how many films did you have on World War II? "If I had never seen these films, I would have been different from WW, I remembered to see the Schindler List and cried for about an hour in movies, giving a good look at events in history. and it helps to remember the disaster and the wounded. <br /> <br /> So my idea is not always bad to tell stories, but to tell us stories, allow us to.
