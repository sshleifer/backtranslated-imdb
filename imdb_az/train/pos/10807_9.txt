I just watched this movie and fell in love with it. When it comes to romanticism between Lachland and Lil, there is only one thing for everyone, and there is something special for everyone. When it comes to the beach, I'm crying ... There's a clear fact that time is the most valuable commodity, and when it's all together, it's clear. This idea has been taken from a number of points, from marriage to love at least in traditional places. When you know that the movie may be the last one tomorrow, it causes such despair. It was particularly beautiful in the role of Crowe Lachlan. I've always had a mild place for emphasis, but I'm about to melt about describing her character. The filming of this film is also beautiful, music, backgrounds, and a great move. Together, this is a beautiful film that captures all human emotions.
