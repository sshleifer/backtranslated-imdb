Honorary Names Stars Cuba Gooding Jr. was able to become the first African American Divers to navigate a man like his first husband, Sea Diver Carl Brashear. Sometimes there was a man on the side and sometimes his admirer Carl Brashear really admired. His name was General Master Billy Bazar (Robert DeNiro). The market was pushed through many ways, became heavier and became the man he wanted to become. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this movie. His description is as free and powerful as in the hurricane of Washington, DC. At every stage, we can see his passion, motivation and stubbornness to achieve his desire. We can see the struggle he started to make his father proud. I liked that the director created and brought some tension in some of the main diving scenes. Brashear's encounter with submarine during his rescue mission is heartbreaker and brilliant. <br /> <br /> I would have to lie in a toy that supports the only crime I saw. Cuban and DeNiro characters are very complicated and interesting to watch. It is a bit sad to drive with these two-dimensional supporting characters. Bad Lt. Cmdr. Hankes, Market Spouse (Charlize Theron), eccentric diving school colonel (Hal Holbrook) and Cuban love illustrate that I do not have much depth. It was a little more time to make these characters more meaningful and more effective, and to develop them. Why was Colonel always in his tower? <br /> <br /> How miserable and always drunk on Sunday? <br /> <br /> This is another interesting question. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I would like to say if this movie celebrates this person's life, can not it be a significant event? Maybe just for me. Honorary men are a perfect example of victory and faith that covers the soul of man. This movie will inspire and feel for the man's struggle. I believe that this powerful story is the reason for being explained. Your hat is going to Carl Brashear. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
