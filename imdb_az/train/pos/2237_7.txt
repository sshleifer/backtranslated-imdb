It was considered a "Swiss Answer to the Lord of the Rings", but more than that. <br /> <br /> This is not something, something new is funny, and sometimes it is obviously stupid and unreasonable - but Monty Python is different from the foolishness. <br /> <br /> The start does not mean that the movie is not being taken seriously at all. Cardboard clouds on the strings are shot on the plane where the main character is sitting. However, to compensate for the missing specific effects, the landscape is a trick. Definitely beautiful and surprising - there's a whole lot of Switzerland, who needs New Zealand. <br /> <br /> What I like about the movie was a simple approach and an open passion and energy that included it. It's not brilliant; there are still some good humorous tracks. As Edward Piccine Friedo did, it's quite convincing, so it's enough to go to the movie and see it! There are some good jokes, some are too naked, and some will not be understood by people outside of Switzerland. Instead of Uruk Hai I thought to own "Uruguay"; I liked the scene with Frido's wife, Pupsi, who decided to take a telehobbie. Rackaroll is a very entertaining event when a knight wields a sword against the sword, and then it slams into a wall and breaks it. And there is a scene in which a "comet-ish" symbol is on a beautiful comedy scene with a toilet brush ... I do not approve of the Ring's idea used by Schleimin's "Gollum" character. the command of "seduce" women. A little far away. The idea of ​​Lord Sauraus, who wanted to cover the land with the foundation, was also bright. The original is, of course, but not brilliant. But most of all, I did not like the idea of ​​a gay dragon that really is not necessary. In general, I would like to see that the movie is just too crazy and totally naked. Do not expect LotR parodies like "Spaceballs" for Star Wars. But it will be an entertaining evening, but you will enjoy it, without any passion, despite your thinking. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ font> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> did it!
