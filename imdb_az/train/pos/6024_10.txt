I saw ZP when it was first released and found a great disappointment. The scenario was compulsory and back in the 1960's and seemed very poor. This policy is very important and funny. Let's face it, I'm still under a love story known as BLOWUP and I have not yet shuddered. Now "my darling" is bent and nicer than the whole house. . . Good luck to me! <br /> <br /> But time travels and time ZP has been auspicious and time is a teacher for me. I am reviewing this movie every 10 years and it is better and better with age. And the ZP is linked to BLOWUP through its "experience" and just really its creator, the late, the great Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, I was predictably correct (large), when I saw a purely pristine piece of art and restored an Italian government culture that knew the importance of keeping it in a good way. From the moment the first gravity of the Valley of Death came to an end, I remember the humor of the audience. Antonio was like a thousand-tonne entertaining shock because he intentionally delivered us to a new level of consciousness. <br /> <br /> How surprising to me is how this movie came to him. <br /> <br /> I remember that the second time I saw it --- at the beginning of the 80s --- I started to love Daria and Mark especially against a film. However, these two were before Zepherelli's Olivia and Leonard (read: Romeo and Juliet), before the smart-alecky shadow version, especially in his persistent verbal consciousness. He took his time. . . To live. Everything, EVERYTHING dies around it. <br /> <br /> The excitement of the theater, Reality, began to erase my "delight" recently. <br /> <br /> The power of Antonio's vision, I realized that he had worked for me the first time. First of all, I responded with 'Uh-Huh' in the 80's and kept secret, pleasant, and jealous of 'my love'. <br /> <br /> But what is the good art in you? , if he wants, he has his way and "loves you": secret, jealousy and wealth. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled to see Turner Classic Films decide to show ZP in March. Undoubtedly, ZP should appear on the giant screen, so you really will take it to the environment. <br /> <br /> Today's coup, the ZP mysteriously withdrawn and replaced by ALICE'S RESTAURANT'S GIFT. <br /> <br /> So, it's still "difficult", "uncomfortable" or "what"? <br /> <br /> Perhaps, as with all the good arts, everything dies around it. <br /> <br /> Peace.
