I watched this movie 100-200 times, and I always love watching it. Yes, it can be very dark, but it is very funny and pleasant. The film, which was shown in the film, is actually a real place for 7 years and is truly a camp, which is a great place to spend the summer. Everyone who went to the camp wanted to enter the camp or sent a child to the camp because we would bring this movie back to you and your children.
