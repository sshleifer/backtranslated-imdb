Man oh man ... I was dumbfounded to watch this movie (not long, there is a long list!) And finally had the chance to do so. And "news" is: For any Von Trier's "follower": Rigets, Crime Element, Dogville, Dark Dancer, The Five Obstructions, etc. Europa is probably for the magnitude of view difference. Everything is beautiful and complicated! In fact, you get the feeling of being in the "dreamy" dark timepiece. From the 40s to the vanguard Von Trier drops of noir films, he leads the film industry as a "good-natured totalitarian" filmmaker. <br /> <br /> As it appears to be utopian, it does not rhetoric with very complicated issues, but it is an authoritarian trait. <br /> <br /> I believe that as a Utopian, people like Von Trier can help the community in a wider range. Daily movies and cinematographers have such powers, but on the contrary, as a tool, maybe the beginning of a new era: "The emotional control of our fears." <br /> <br /> Bravo!
