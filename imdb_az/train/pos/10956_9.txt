Indeed, it is foolish for those who think that it is a complex humor and immaturity. Although the show includes a potty joke, it consists of many satirical material, and in public issues, race barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, and so on. Fun has fun. To do this, you need to read some more material. <br /> <br /> I also love everything that is not a punchline. For friends who like a formula joke, I can not find here (my friends fyi LOVE). Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve the more realistic humor. We are not traveling around the world and have smart punchlines for everything in the comedy. Instead, the Sarah Silverman Program is more realistic in this respect. <br /> <br /> Therefore, do not look like this as a unique humor, because it's more than that.
