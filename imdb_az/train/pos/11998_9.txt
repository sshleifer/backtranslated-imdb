This movie was beautiful. These memorable footage were full of good moving and touching topics. It would be very easy to write it as syndicated, but this film works to achieve such results. I was totally involved in the opening and presentation of the story. There were some strange shots, but you have to wait for such a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I could give was one ton of detail. But this film is about Joseph Smith's life, service, victories, contradictions, failure, and so on. Not created to explain each element; designed to draw attention to some of the most spectacular American and historical religious figures of all time.
