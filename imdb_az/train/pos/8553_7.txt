I was just watching the movie, afraid to disappoint me. I was very surprised, though. American cake franchise is still my favorite franchise all the time. Well, I'm not saying that I use the original as a mush as I love the original. The Beta House lost something that had hadit with the first two pies along with the two previous cats. The first two have become classic as it has already been. What is hell - it's still funny with very good moments, and if you want to have fun and relax after a hard day at work or school, you have to choose the first movie to choose from. The Beta House is worth $ 6/10, but I'm only a PIE slice of 7/10.
