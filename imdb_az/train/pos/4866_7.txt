First of all, in order to defend JOAN FONTAINE, it is necessary to say that Alyce, who is Ginger Rogers's lead role, will be quite smashed as a young British lady. Fontaine is here as a hero, but his experience shows him inexperienced and is better than his dance. Fortunately, he continued to do better. <br /> <br /> But here Fred ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN get the highest billing - they are good. The admirer of Burns & Allen was surprised at how easy it is to fit Astaire's dance routines. Particularly interesting is that the choreographer Hermes Pans is a great entertaining routine with an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The film enters the Astraire to have the most ingenuity. Unfortunately, we can not say much about the story's slow pacing - it's a long way from patience. It should be said that some humor is corrected and that ordinary romantic misconceptions that occur in any of the Fred Astaire films have been conditionally treated. <br /> <br /> Some pleasant Gershwin melodies are opened once, but not all of them can afford their worthy treatment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> If Burns & Allen are around to remind you how funny they are on their radio and television days. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens, with Fred, is convinced that Joan Fontaine's falling dance number will be drawn at a reasonable distance, but appears to be painful beyond Astraire's dance partner as his dance partner does not hide his intelligence.
