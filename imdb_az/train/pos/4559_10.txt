My older brother was born in March 1985 and has a cerebral palsy. At the age of 22, he saw the wall of our house and the school working with other disabled children. I'm the door to everyone's joke because of my sister's disability, and I still think that no one is in it or that it and its condition will not be curse. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew what Christine's family was. but they were happy. Christy talked, communicated, and had artistic skills. my sister can walk, but she can not speak a word and can not use her hands to do anything, but to catch things. but this movie, like my brother, had other people around the world and cried for me (to speak the truth). And I saw SHAWSHANK! This movie is seriously reduced and should not be done. This movie tells people something. people need to be proud of their lives. Do you think you can not write well? this guy wrote on his feet. Are not you tempting? this man was turned down by many girls according to the situation. is not the fastest runner? <br /> <br /> My idea is that parents of little children would like to have your children watch this movie with you, so next time they are a wheelchair, they do not look like they are aliens. My sister has taken millions of people, and this still breaks my heart to think that many people have been killed. People who are "normal" for this film are people. 10/10
