In the northeast of Brazil, twelve-year-old illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sells her daughter Tadeu (Chico Dias), a middleman for her father's prostitution organization, to work as a housekeeper and to live a better life. However, she sells her daughter to a farmer named Lourenço (Otávio Augusto) and she gives the aggressive daughter to her teenage son to have her first sexual experience. Then he was sent to a whore in a golden field in Amazonas, and his owner examined the esteemed Saraiva (Antonio Calloni). <br /> <br /> Maria is being investigated by Vera (Darlene Glória) while fleeing to Rio de Janeiro while waiting for a better life. <br /> <br /> "Anjos do Sol" reveals the sad and fictitious reality of child prostitution in Brazil. The fate of Maria Maria. Last year, I saw the story "Lilja 4-story" which described the same story in the former Soviet Union; therefore this problem exists in Third World countries. The director and writer Rudi Lagemann presents a great film that exposed the reality but does not show nudity or open sex scenes. Fernanda Carvalho's debut, which promises a perfect performance with the role that this terrible child struggles to survive. Most prostitutes are amateurs and it is not possible to differentiate famous plastic Darlene Gloria after many plastic surgery. The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. Name (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Sun Angels")
