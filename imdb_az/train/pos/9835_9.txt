I can only say that I'm a big fan of zombies, so I do not make statements like this. Secondly, I say this is an Italian zombie movie and Fulci Bruno (Rats, Terror Of Night) has just ruled for 15 minutes instead of Mattei. <br /> <br /> There is no compassion among the murderers. <br /> <br /> This is one of the funny zombie films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The scenario is a great horror. Look at two scientists who try to find an antidote ("try to put these two molecules together"). <br /> <br /> Zombies come in all sorts of ways. From gentlemen to buffers, moachete wiling maniacs, birds! <br /> <br /> Gore is more. His feet are burned, weapons are amputated, and the stomachs explode. <br /> <br /> Driving speed is faster than a zombie attack. <br /> <br /> Then there is a fridge in the head. Oh, in the refrigerator! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> You get some drinks and a beer and you will have a party. <br /> <br /> I'm talking about it in the fridge?!?!?
