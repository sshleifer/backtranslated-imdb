A good picture is worth every word. This movie has the most poetic scene dreamed of people with Down syndrome. I do not want to spoil you by telling you. <br /> <br /> Pasqual Duquenne is an incredible actor. <br /> <br /> The film itself has a magical presence. After watching, I realized that we were very successful and we did not have enough people we love. Stamina and simplicity are all we need.
