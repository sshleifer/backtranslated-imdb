This is a great movie and is a treasure trove of video and DVDs that can only be used to capture movies. Starting with the two lovers of the movie and ending them (though they are between many and not staying together), it gives you a sense of attachment and feeling with the whole world. If you have a chance to see this movie, do so. I do not expect to see it again and I wish to be released in general.
