For a long time as a Red Sox fan, I just had to see the movie. That was excellent! While there were not enough live footage on the miracle of Red Sox, some of my favorite Red Sox players had great shots. Although the film has a chicken flick, it has enough baseball pictures to return from the incredible 2004 Red Sox to make one of the top 10 movies of 2004. I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans, who are part of Ben's baseball family. The event I meet with my friends on the agenda to identify who is sitting in some games is fun! If you are looking for a movie that is useful for watching your spouse, date, or other matter ... maybe you're a baseball fan ... and more especially when you're a fan of Red Sox!
