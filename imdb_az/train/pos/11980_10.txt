It was a Full House and is still a great show. A good show and a good family show for people of all ages. No more shows. While the kids are very sweet and a bit stunning, it is still good, especially for those who follow them when they are children. Now I would like to see controversial dumps. Everyone who wants to see the interviews of the period should now have something to do with the special features of the DVD and go to the website of the requested place and sign a Full House Reunion application on DVD. If it wants to submit an application for it, the cast can do it. Summer for the Full House!
