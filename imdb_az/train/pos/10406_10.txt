<br /> <br /> Afghanistan, the legend of Baghdad, helps restore the righteousness of King Ahmed from a wicked magician. <br /> <br /> This is a delightful fugitive from the legends of London's Films Arabian Nights, Sir Alexander Korda's stating that Europe is going to war and that the major segments of the world remain in the flames. It was filled with swords and magic, in 1940 gave audience a short respite from the headlines. <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt has the best billing and deserves to be playing decent magician Jaffar. With his saturated eyes, Saturn's face repeats the glamorous role he has played in silent days. There is a villain worth watching. As a kid kidnapper, Sabu is the perfect third movie. Despite being a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is, of course, heroic and practicing. <br /> <br /> The remainder of the rest is a wonderful thing. John Justin is an unmistakable king capable of learning both the living and the excitement, the realities of life; Soap takes an important part of the action (when it is not turned into a dog), but Justin needs athletic when it is needed. Lovely June Duprez threatens the king of Basra, drowned by two different men. The film, which is delayed in the film, shakes things like a genie with massive behavior. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes uses the beautiful sound of a good preference like Storyteller. Miles Malleson takes on another eccentric role in toy toys (Malleson is responsible for the screen player and dialogue of the movie) forever, the Sultan of Basra. The old Morton Celten describes the good king of the legend. Mary Morris, later as an exceptional actress, plays Jaffar's partner and the dual role of six armed Silver Dancers. <br /> <br /> The film began in England, but difficulties during the war, when Korda moved to Southern California, is likely to reveal the presence of American Ingram player. In the well-known Technicolor, the artistic aspect is the most attractive, especially the tale architecture in blues, nets and pink. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sabe Dastagir was born in 1924, Sabu, by Korda's company was put in front of the camera and used in the Maharaj of Mysore's stables. His first four films (ELEPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) were the best of them and when they were finished, he pulled himself out of Hollywood. After a reputed military service in the Second World War, he regained his movie career, but with a great exception, Black NARCISSUS (1947) was boundlessly restricted to years of ethnic roles in unusual films. His latest film was Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS (1964) development, but it was too late. In 1963, Sabu spent only 39 years in a heart attack.
