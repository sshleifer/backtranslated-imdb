Reed Hadley is a better foppish Don Diego, he is a dashing and daring Zorro, but this is probably the best point in any series of this series, because it's near the point - and the most popular stagecoach in Yakima Canutt good version stunt. There are other good stunts, and there's a lot of action and hair extending cliff-hanger chapter break, but without another reason, you'll see this movie to watch the stagecoach stunt, then look again slow movement. This is incredible and, despite the lower budget of this chapter, Paz goes a far better place than in Stagecoach, where it is more popular. Indiana Jones, eat your heart: this is a true deal!
