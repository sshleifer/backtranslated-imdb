This story is beautifully used. It is a sad and heartfelt way to learn where the young girl went and where she went. Stephanie was adopted by his mother's best friend from his mother and father when he was killed in a car crash and was called the "wonderful baby", he dyslexic and finds life a little difficult. Findings along the way affect those around you. His guardian and guardian's relationship with the old lover is very delicate and sensitive, and all the casting support is true, 3 dimensional and convincing. Set around a peach canning plant in the small Australian city, it's a warm, soft, erotic movie, and it lends you a pleasant feeling when it's close. After reading many other sincere comments about Hugo Weaving, I'd like to add that she was very bright and very sexy. No, not Brad Pitt, but it's not attractive.
