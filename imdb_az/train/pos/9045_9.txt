Homer's on December 6, 1957 (at least the video used on television), has a number of trivia that should be mentioned about an early event <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Von Braun is a Marshall space flight center. <br /> <br /> He is in the next reading or Dr. Won Braun wrote a letter of condolences on failure. <br /> <br /> Von Braun for the Army. The Vanguard project was originally the first Nasa team to turn into Goddard Space flight center. <br /> <br /> The army fled to the US V2 Jupiter-C, but the satellite responded with Russia's response to Sputnik's success. <br /> <br /> This mistake could actually be made by Homer for Von Braun's communication, but his team was not successful. In fact, Redstone flies from 52 and was a booster used for the first US drone, Shepard's sub-orbital flight. <br /> <br /> So this kind of movie is very good, hopefully people will be inspired to read the tricks and spot the trivia and inspire to see what's going on in the process and more.
