Someone watching movies and complaining about their lives forgets something: a DVD menu system. I tell you people, I repeat the main screen 35 times. It was spectacular. The very beginning was where I came from, a glamorous cinematic tapestry. Many times the amount and Bam! I was hooked. Repeat and more. And more. <br /> <br /> Doot de doot, de doo de dodedo. And this is just a soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I was put aside in my bed, enjoying Vaio. The rain is flat on the roof and soft soft today. The cats are comfortable, and my legs are already resting. I drove to the DVD. I've been up front. Throughout the night. <br /> <br /> The Blob: "Dodo doot, de doo de dodedo". Look. Steve's Queen, two policemen and a girl in a dress. Two heads to finger!
