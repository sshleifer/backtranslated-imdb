I do not want my comment, or I do not have the idea, but I think you wrote that the movie was not good. Since you're obsessed with Hollywood movies, you can not see how good this movie is, I'm not an admirer of Jay Chou, but I love his game and you just think that ... and you do not think it's a big deal, and maybe not that interesting, Look deeper than love and passion rather than moving in film and tears, much more than the US, and that's good :) is good. It's a great deal to do, so do not criticize actors because thank you very much because the directors do not know how much they're working to make you happy at this hour :)
