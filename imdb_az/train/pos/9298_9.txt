It's just one of the most spectacular films I've ever seen. This is the parody of everything that Chicago represents in the 1930s. - You do not need to rate this movie because rating is less than 5. It is a massive idea and mass hypnotized. Who decides to watch it - regrets, who does not decide to watch - it's a pity.
