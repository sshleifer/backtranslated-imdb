I know it's raw and I know it's not a PC, but it's funny. It is likely that it began in the early 80's and carries all the stereotypes of the time, and the film is still laughing - it's farther away from being a good comedy. If you go to the tradition of comedies for thousands of years, the theme of this movie ends. <br /> <br /> P.S. If you put it on a DVD, it's hard to find the VHS now.
