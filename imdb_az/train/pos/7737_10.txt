If you think that you are an admirer of an author as long as I'm Jim Thompson, his works can be quite dangerous. Scott Foley's DARK MY SWEET AFTER is not the case. A suspenseful, sexually explicit noir classic, who is attentive to the original text and is dealing with fair justice. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward are likely to give their best performances. And always the phenomenon Bruce Dern even united himself with it. As in Thompson's book, this film creates a dark and surreal world that eliminates the logic of passion and never doubles the cross. We need to see something for all fans of the great nuclear film. **** !!!
