"Invisible Mouse" is an unpleasant and distinctive Tom and Jerry cartoon. These are ordinary cat / mouse jokes and fights, but this time in a different way. <br /> <br /> Jerry accidentally found a bottle of invisible ink and, therefore, very good because he understood that Tom could make many "surprises", scared, suffered, and confused. <br /> <br /> As weird, it's so cool and funny to see the invisible ones: Jerry is invisible. There is something to see who can see it in the air without seeing it (who do we know?) - these things were like their lives, and even a matter of ghost. While Jerry is invisible, it is equally fun to see some candy and fruit eat. <br /> <br /> As soon as some of the best jokes saw Tom Jerri's shadow and push him out, and Tom tried to break it into a frying pan, Jerry wrote, "She missed me." <br /> <br /> Jerry, I love Tom when he is drinking chocolate milk, appearing again and enjoying the face. In general, it has the essential ingredients needed for a short classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, entertainment and some beautiful artworks.
