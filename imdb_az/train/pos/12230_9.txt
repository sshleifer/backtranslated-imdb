<br /> <br /> A man (Burr DeBenning) burned his hand! <br /> <br /> A man (Burr DeBenning) burns his hand in the kitchen stove. But it is not something that a normal person screams, "AAAAATCH-KAH!" It sounds like something sounds like. This film you are filming is not a normal movie. Only the first step you took was the name of THE INGRADIBLE MELTING MAN, the 70th year of the movie, which is well-known for Rick Baker's beautiful makeup effects. Baker was on the edge of being a superstar, and it was the same as the famous "canteen aliens" at STAR WARS. For some strange reasons, STAR WARS has been renamed as HOME and WOULD NOT DEFINITELY. <br /> <br /> This film can only be fraudulent. From the loans (such as "Alex Rebar's Dangerous Danger Promotion" ... it really is!), A boiling nurse passing through a glass door, a waterfall, and rocks percussive to a fishing ropes, this film is very unexplained provides moments. "Why did they ... but how did it come ... why ...?" <br /> <br /> An astronaut returns to the Earth early, melting, radioactive; he begins to strike a terrible mysterious murder, which runs and breaks his mind as his body. The government wants the melt-off man to stop but can keep it as quiet as possible (who does not want to "create panic"). So, a boy then sends a geiger counter. Wow. <br /> <br /> The story is marvelous at the time of the movie. The moth goes to kill people. A doctor looks at him with a geiger counter. There are various symbols, questions, and queries. Finally, the doctor holds the melted man, but after being told that he is Dr. Ted Nelson, he is shot by a security guard for no reason. The mysterious man runs away and eventually throws a huge bird into the water. Last. <br /> <br /> This is a very flawless situation, although it's a little fun, despite a pretty low discount. Probably a large-screen DVD broadcast is planned. A very special movie.
