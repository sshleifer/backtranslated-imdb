It's one of the best films I have ever seen. Anyone who accepts this film as a tumor is not smart enough to understand all the subtle humor presented by this movie. It shows us that real life and the "treacherous" action can show a winning combination. Like a romantic comedy, it has one of the most intelligent ways to find two people. And besides all this, give me another movie that you have read as Donald Sutherland, "You Will Find My Mountain".
