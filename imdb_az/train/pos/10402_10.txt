I first saw the thief as old as the predestined jinn. If there were any children, I enjoyed the film's dreams, inventiveness and energy. A few years later, I realized how much the satire and the intelligence of the scripts I missed at first glance. I have not had the opportunity to follow him over the years. In addition to the script, the production exceeds the fantasy genre. This is the best story of Korda. You know that a good time has passed when a thief looks like a child. When you see it as a boy, you know that you see a masterpiece. This is not like lifelong treatment. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
