I am happy to be in this movie when I spotted all the movies I wanted to make for my sister during my vacation. <br /> <br /> Most dealing with the director's apology, I have a problem with this TV, so I could not get a copy for my friend! <br /> <br /> People with eating disorders do not go away from friends who are really diet and how much they really are. I draw my attention that bulimics can maintain a fairly constant weight, although there are more serious consequences for their health, so many people are ignorant.
