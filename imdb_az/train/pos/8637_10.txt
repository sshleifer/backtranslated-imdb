"California" is a great movie we look at. There is a huge cast in the film, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, A Dere Getting and Fall Legends), Early Gray, David Duchovny (The X Files) Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: The Next Generation, Homicide: Street on Life Brian's girlfriend Carrie Loughlin and Juliette Lewis (naturally born cats, what to eat from Cape Fear and Gilbert grape) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler is a liberal is a writer and is preparing to write a book about serial killers. Brian and her girlfriend, Carrie California <br /> <br /> Early Grace is a past and sociopatically conventional condition that has recently lost her job because Brian places an ad on college for those who want to go to California. <br /> <br /> The mirror factory in the city owes its debt to the landlord. Early oral officer ceases to visit him and gives information about a job. She is advertising and advertising, and then she talks to Adele about her daughter, who goes to California. Early and Adele get acquainted with Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and leave the city. Brian and Carrie do not know that she is a murderer killed Carrie and Adele are good friends because Brian and Carrie think differently about Early and Aden, but spend little time in recognizing them and being friends they become. <br /> <br /> Their journey is a lot of learning. Brian and Carrie were later murdered in the movie as soon as they did not know, Brian was asking about murderers in this film differently than us. Ere Grayce is a sociologist who does not see the mistake. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great movie, I give it 10/10 stars and 2 fingers. The end of the film, "The Sky To Look Up" by The Indians.
