Like romance comedies, it was lovely and winning. I thought that writing could be a bit more powerful for a little better connection, but that's not a big opening point. However, Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give wonderful speeches and are as attractive as usual. These are my two favorite actors, and I am glad that I just throw them as a romantic potential. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie does not change your life, but it is sweet, warm and victorious. It's not a bad thing.
