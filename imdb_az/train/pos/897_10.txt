What can I say, Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kia. Soragery has always been different. Films are part of our lives during the era of evolution. Finding sorrows is a difficult thing to do. Love and great love and partner family. Viva is a journey for a couple who are married to marry and to love marriage. The witness did a great job. Anupamji is always as bright. Although Amrita Rao was different, I felt that nothing else was appropriate for that role. We have seen him with Ishk Vişk and Ab ke baras and Na. So, he should not separate from a different role. She was excellent at Na and Ishik in Main ho, but she could have put her role a bit. In any case Barjatyan's work is great. This film brings about the values ​​we forgot. Illin's sweet movie. Great music and lyrics. Despite the fact that I rebuilt it, but in fact it is the original bright story. Sorority films were bright in all ways, and we always look forward to something different. All crew and everyone's big job. You will enjoy the family's favorite family movie, your parents, your brothers, your friends and your beloved. I'll give him 10 to 10.
