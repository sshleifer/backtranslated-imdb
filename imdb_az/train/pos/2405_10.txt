<br /> <br /> In some movies, I'm the first and only one to write a comment in this movie. <br /> <br /> Even though the film itself is interesting, the real thing that attracts me is that Mattdryll Lilyd, perhaps thinking that many people are happy or just plain sucks, but I think we are from the same age and same generation, now he is one of my favorites. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Matt wants to get his prizes, but they have no share, and Matt has a time bomb waiting for each other, Matt shows the true awareness of the planner, JAck, who started the whole scheme at the start. and a few art thieves who need money due to a lack of women's business, are a part of the film and only affect the intensity of the film. <br /> <br /> Left and right surprises are well received, and the last few non-clicks and happy you Perhaps this is the type of end you want but this is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Critics do not like this movie, but they like movies anyway.
