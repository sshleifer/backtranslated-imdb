This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie, and in one interview, Jackie said it was the most beloved. It contains some fabulous stunts and jaw dropping sequences as well as some very funny scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie was a favorite of Brandon Lee, using parts of Rapid Fire, and has been removed from Tango and Cash, which uses some of the opening scenes. <br /> <br /> Jackie plays police in Hong Kong. This story takes you to a fantastic chase instantly through an old town and Jackie continues to slide down a hill and jumps onto a busy bus to catch the bad Ku (one of the biggest villains in any Jackie Chan movie). Jackie is trying to balance her role as a cop with his girlfriend, played by Maggie Chung. His job is to defend the Cush's secretary who has enough information to protect him, but it even creates a lot of trouble. Jackie is definitely good here. The last battle scene in the shopping center is my favorite battle scene by everyone - the period. It was the strongest battle Jackie had ever seen in the slippers on a polar explosion. She was never one of her greatest stunts, and she grabbed hold of her. In general, another Chan is classic and has definitely become one of his greatest films. At the end of this film, you can say that he did not take anything back and did not give his stunt. In this film, many people were wounded on several occasions where they could no longer afford them. Jackie was to take responsibility. There are no gimmicks, wires or stand-ins - all of which is a real-life activity, which is a cure to watch. This is the action that creates the phenomenon for her, and it's a film that will admire people 100 years later. If you have not seen this movie and you are a fan of Jackie Chan or a fan, you can treat yourself and watch this movie. This is really a scenario.
