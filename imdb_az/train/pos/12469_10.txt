This is a great movie. I think some people will not rely on this true story. No matter what, the film is great, and all this flies in a balloon mermaid with a mermaid, and so is the thought of "a little girl's dream come true, and why can she think?" It means that all peace-loving desires will be realized and if we trust in it, they will do all that is in the world. The little girl (Desi - in the film) and her mother were the best actors I've ever seen. For them, for all actors, all are good for the director. If someone can say, tell them: "A 25 year-old man from Romania is thanking you for doing this."
