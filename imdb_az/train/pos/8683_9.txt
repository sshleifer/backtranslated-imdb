"Death gives a hand" is one of the early episodes of "Columbo", which helps illustrate the show for the next thirty years. <br /> <br /> In this case, Culp, the head of a great personal detective company, Brimmer, investigates whether Robert Culp's four appearances (as three killers) is a spouse of a wealthy newspaper magistrate, Mr. Kennick, asked. Brimmer hopes to blackmail his wife, even though she does not share her husband's information with Kennitz. He reacted badly to this proposal, and Brimmer's impetus was a fierce argument. <br /> <br /> In this episode there are some really priceless moments. One of my favorite scenes is the place where Columbo looks like a palm reading, though in fact it is a tool to discover Brimmer's face and size. If Columbo was Columbo, then he would really reveal what he really was when he was right to turn the screws a bit. So, first of all, he plays the role of a very simple mind-budding man who is excited by the "moths on the moon's mound" or the mummies jumping on a ridiculous palm. <br /> <br /> Brimmer is a great scene when Columbo should offer a job for the firm. <br /> <br /> Of course, Columbo does not disclose what he knows, and he commands to respect and respect this job offer. <br /> <br /> Columbo, there is something else in front of Brimmer that tells Kennitch, I wish you heard the killer conversations. Brimmer wanted to point out Brimmer directly without accusing him, because he was very brutal (in a situation where he understood), decided to play with his mindgames to make confusion about Brimmer and do something foolish. Of course it does! All this, sad Kennicut, is unaware of the subtext of this conversation. Columbo is near the end that everyone will tell Kennitz (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I'm not going to disclose Columbo how he finally kills the killer, but let's just say he has a potato. <br /> <br /> A really good episode is probably the best in the first row. If you like it, you will be in "Double Exposure" with Robert Culp.
