I recently saw this movie because of Jake's recent adventures on the Brokeback Mountain. I thought I'd see the movies I missed. I did not give any expectations to the film, so I was surprised to miss this movie. This passage is a story of a father and a boy, and this is a missing story. He even wept at the finale of this beautiful story. This movie applies to all ages. The only reason I have given 10 to 9 is a little slower in the middle, but it's strong in the end. The player was great, the story was magnificent, and the cinematography was tempting, given the film's description. FOR THIS MOVIE! Rent, Buy, Watch, LOVE IT! I knew it!
