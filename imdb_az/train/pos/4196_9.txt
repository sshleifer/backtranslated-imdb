This crime alarm is similar to the film's cinema, though it is a cold war-time since the post-war era, and there is something relatively worthy to say about humanity. The police in the "South Beach Placem" are good guys, criminals are really children, and the only enemies are "Commissions" that differ from good results that are emotionally unpleasant, and this movie turns around the characters. The personalities in this movie are quite unique and detailed: take a look at the attractive pockets, which can reduce any danger and sometimes with personal property; Moe, who only wants to get rid of for a magnificent funeral, but which gives the hearts and esteem of almost all other characters (and viewers); Candy is an innocent girl who does not fully grasp the conspiracy that he thinks is and is dealing with the government; and Joey, the worst Commie baddie, who is trying to hide everything from her, and the old lover, is the worst thing to do this ironically. Throwing a bunch of colorful characters (for example, a man with a pebbly dress and a cop) and a "Pick Up in the South Slide" will lead you to the beauty of personality because you hunt the mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames.
