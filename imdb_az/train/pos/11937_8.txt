It was an absolute situation with the Angels in Outfield. Last night was on television and I believe that I did not see a movie since the second grade at the high school and I was in college in the 4th year. The film has many flaws, though it is not so helpful, sitting, looking and enjoying it. And also funny. Danny Glover's color often does not coincide, but it can not help, but it often laughs to her. It adds to this movie and I'm sure the director wants it. Despite the fact that the development is not good, you actually feel the characters in the movie. A must see. <br /> <br /> 8/10
