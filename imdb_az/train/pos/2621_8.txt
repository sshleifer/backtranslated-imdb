Disney did it again. Timone and Pumbaa's glittering way are re-realized to let us know that Simba needs to come again to meet when needed. I love this movie and watch it over and over again. This shows how Timone lived with his family and other cemeteries before he set out to find Timon's dream and adventure. Then he gets to know Pumba and everything changes. Together, Timon, who is wanted and temporarily temporarily abused, becomes more and more crazy. Simba then goes out and we see more childhood than we did in the previous two films. The rest, you already know.
