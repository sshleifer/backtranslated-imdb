In Mexico this movie was only broadcasted on PayTV. Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life is a real example of a good German and especially a good man. The conversations between Tukur and Nazi prosecutor are particularly interesting. True Idea 'War: Two different German believes in it as well. Bonhoeffer was a very complicated person: male, freedom fighter, lover, church and a great intellectual; Ulrich Tukur is outstanding as Bonhoeffer. I have recommended this movie to the planet in these difficult days, especially long ago. We do not know much about Pastor Bonhoeffer's life and heritage in Mexico, it's a great job to rescue a forgotten hero.
