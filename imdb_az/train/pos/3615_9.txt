I did not expect a strong movie experience for Girlfight. This is an Indie; less budget, no big actor, first class manager. <br /> <br /> According to the US embassy in New York, Latinos. Diana struggles with heroes, school, and friends, looking at her peers with anger and shivering. She is raised by her only father who loves her and her brother, but implements a serious, sex-based double standard on her children. The dual standard of the father, Tiny, takes boxing lessons in a local gym, but Diana rejects similarities. While going to the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is surprised by boxing. Tiny does not like boxing, she is also Diana and she's trading places; <br /> <br /> According to some reports, Diana has so far touched on many serious issues. There is no giggly, "go right to everything go right" solution la "like a Beckham". Reality and personal issues are great for pathetic decisions, but in my opinion, "Girlfight" is a better and more enjoyable movie for that.
