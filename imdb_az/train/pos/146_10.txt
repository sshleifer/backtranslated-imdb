I came to the end and almost shouted, "No, no, no, it can not end here! There are many unanswered questions! Signs of dishes? Mona's disappearance? Helmer's income? Zombi "The little brother survived his father and what is his head ???????" ARGH !! Then I read that at least two players have passed and I want to say that Lars von Trier's vision will not be true, but it's planned to look past former players only to see his end! Naturally, it would be difficult for someone to play Helmer for someone's character. Helmer, hate your favorite doctor! I do not yet have to look at a person who feels better, forgetful, self-confident on the screen! But I can see a change in the actors .... I have to know how it ended!
