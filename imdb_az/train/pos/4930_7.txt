"Panic in the streets" was a decent tension, but it was a bit disappointing. In the modern era, the subject of a city that is attacked by a pest is interesting, but the film does not actually research and develop anything. Its a good and entertaining, but not as interesting as it should be. For this reason, the scenario is really weak and the whole movie is down. <br /> <strong> <strong> Elia Kozan's direction indicates that the movie is stopped and is moving fast. Especially memorable chase, especially mentioned. <br /> <br /> A few years later, when his leadership was combined with better scenarios, the man did not make a mistake. <br /> <br /> Acting is also very good. Richard Widmark was always a traceable person and could do with a character kept under him. Paul Douglas shouts a little bit of time, but he does a good job. The legs in the rubble are two cunning. Originally known for its comic roles, Zero Mostel is thoroughly thinner as one of the hero's last characters in the movie theater. Jack Palance is not a surprising, frustrating villain. The "panic in the streets" creates disappointment, but it's still worth it. (7/10)
