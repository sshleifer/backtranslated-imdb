<br /> <br /> <strong> Dentist is a really good movie. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify" Acting is not always the top notch, but the excitement is good and the story is good, you see Linda Hofman's Boobies, I'm not an expert in this field, but the direction looks good and the scheme is logical. a creepy dentist ... What Jaws is doing for doctors to do is to doctors ... Of course, there was a fairly limited budget, but they did their best and improved their characters.
