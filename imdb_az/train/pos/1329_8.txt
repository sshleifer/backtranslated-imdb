I grew up in Brazil, and I was surprised and surprised by beautiful beaches where the film was shot. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the Green Coast of Rio de Janeiro. About 150 miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This film brings back the lives of 16th century Brazilians. The Europeans are still exploring the coastline, which is already in the ready state. has been inhabited by a number of local tribes. The French and Portugal fought one another over the territory and in the Brazilian wooden trading, but for some reason, they were negotiating with the local population fighting each other. <br /> <br /> He belongs to his own dwellings) is killed by his own countrymen, but he is trying to escape and is a prisoner of a whole bare native tribe. Although they are "slaves" of another, they are permitted to live comfortably for months, according to the custom of the graves, for the purpose of killing and eating the ritual. <br /> <br /> What I like about this film is lovingly renewing the local population and their lifestyle (bare and cannibals) and asking us to recognize and accept their lives at that time. it's a perfect garden garden, full of life-threatening, fierce, persistent superstitions and strange customs. Europeans deliver their own problems, with more weapons and greed, including more violence. <br /> <br /> This film is not romanticized "noble battles" or "heroic scouts", but only people trying to live in a difficult world. <br /> <br /> The film is not as sincere as it is, and it rejects the local population. The idea of ​​adding a unique air to the project that I know about the subject is very clear: how many films have you seen for the Brazilian native life and the early relationships with Europeans?
