This should be one of the most sincere and touching guy-guest films ever made. While delivering beautiful drawings "Rebel Without One Reason" and "You Say Something", these films undesirable subplots and Hollywood divergences down the bands. This movie is just about watching a good romance. You do not doubt that the film will direct romantic pairings of these two people for a second. You are immediately aware of synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it is simply a pure joy to find them. This film is mostly based on the whole dialogue. But each conversation between them is very interesting. How realizes this kind of romantic relationship. In all of these conversations, we can understand nuances until they have no influence on something critical at all, and these two are more blessed and trusting each other. These are exactly the same as you imagined. And I believe that it is true that it is not incredible to believe. This can happen if you are confident enough to chat with someone you see in a random place. And the ice-cream of this film is a spectacular backdrop of the Vienna where this film is. It enhances the sense of romantic nirvana offered by the movie. No matter how many times I watch this movie, I will never think about it.
