In my opinion, this film will only work on people who are connected with the genius of the Lord of the Rings. Yes, I'm also. I also love this movie. In particular, I love the superb heroes of LotR, who have a perfect and dignified way of life. The most stylish Gandalf (brave and wise and totally humorous - all wizard) is Almghandi, coward and brain dead transvestite. Sauron's colleague (of course, from Sauraus, of East Germany) looks like a helmet with a straight sleeve. The Aragorns alter ego is another crash-shaped idiot trying to fix the broken sword (the legend of Ulrike) with a strip of stripes. And "Strunzdumm" (Wormtong's colleague) is really similar to Brad Dourif! And do not forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
