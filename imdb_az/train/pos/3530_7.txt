I can confidently admit that I will not have anything in my movie "Phantom Lady" (like IMDb geek). Moreover, it can not be included. It is worth noting that the Phantom Lady has strong and long-lasting images to make the film a better-looking look because it's not as good as the many other classics of the movie's Noir genre. Everything required from the viewer is the ability to go beyond terrible slow start. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film 'Kansas' murder of Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), who was convicted of murder. "Kansas" is Anderson's secretary and night amateur detective. The new night is like an inexperienced poet who works very well for himself while working on the streets of New York. The little one will definitely break the mystery puzzle. To be honest, the movie is owned by Raines and is best used by the film in his presence. In any case, he can give life to a film about a prisoner who is not interested in a small man. <br /> <br /> I am not convinced that this divisive dynamite of a dream guy is the fault of the actor or director, but it is clear that something is wrong in a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Something that is interesting, like Raines, is "Kenzo", when looking for some information to help the killer boss, "Cancer" is a nightclub, when you visit a trolley drummer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) accelerate things into. He painted the city a new red while visiting drum "all night" jazz clubs. While trying to portray this scene, it will prove to the scene unfair or worsen and shut the scene together. You will know the scene after the last collapse is over. If you are lucky enough to own this DVD, you will probably have more chance to repeat this scene again. Like Raines, this scene is remarkable. Basically, I'm going to give Phantom Lady 6 votes instead of 6. <br /> <br /> For most of the film, this movie is gentle and quiet with a few beautiful scenes and a magnificent scene. <br /> <br /> The film says: "You never go wrong with Vanilla," and I'm also a "drum / sex scene" separating the film first of all. <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <strong> Clark Richards
