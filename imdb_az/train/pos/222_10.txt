A neil Simon comedy that laughs from beginning to end. The late Walter Matthau is a strange old comedian who agrees to meet with a former partner (with the latest Oscar winner, George Burns) to feature in the latest record on the stage. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin Matthau's agent and nephew, both are very chemo like Matthau and Burns. I love Matthau's delicate character - it's the same as it always is, and it's also very different. <br /> <br /> It is not funny as Matthau, like the old man who is missing, fires. <Br /> Matthau: Want some crackers? <br /> <br /> I remember: <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> MATTAN: They were in the kitchen cabinet. Burnt: Maybe even coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Generally, a comedic, joyful, sweet, heartwarming, warm, acting comedy with hearty and all-time's most memorable quotes. <br /> <br /> They just do not make it like this! <br /> <br /> When all new comedies are young, younger and more foolish, it's really a really exciting backdrop to the comedy - funny characters, smart and funny dialogue and great fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
