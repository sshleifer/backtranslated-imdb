<br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie and you plan it, stop reading and take my word for it. You need to see this movie. I have seen four times so far and I do not think exactly what happens in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this movie, I will talk about stopping the axis. <br /> <br /> If you're still reading, I'll ask you some questions, <br /> <br /> I remember very well the English teacher of my 11th grade. His name was Mr. Krisak. For me, he was wise after years, and he had a comprehensive way to teach you what you did not always want. We did not like Shakespeare, then we turned the story into romanticism in a modern day, we can understand. Our classroom was never a room, it was a cottage and we read a book in the lake's own free time. It was an unforgettable way of branding itself into our minds as sponge. <br /> <br /> I start with Vanilla Sky's description of this brilliant man, because once I had a long-term friend's phone number, he gave me a concentrated assignment, and after watching Matrix finally, they gave me a meaning. If I did not get to know better now, the Wachowski brothers were really another name for my teacher, Mr. Krisak. But when we give them the benefit of doubt, we think that's not the case. However, this task was more than the first impallable. <br /> <br /> He wanted to prove to us that we were real. Show me how you can show me. There is a class that extinguishes all of the common thoughts you are convinced of. Everything was given to our teacher in order to prove to him that we were the truth, the sense of touch, part of the feeling of hunger. <br /> <br /> Because we will not respond to every scenario we give her. <br /> <br /> "You're nothing but someone else's dream?" <br /> <br /> What would happen if you were someone else's dream? There is a question. This is a question / script for us about 15 years ago, from the astronomical use of the Internet and the rapid development of computers. How could that be? <br /> <br /> If you are looking at this year's technology, ask yourself, now that you're part of someone else's dream. <br /> <br /> This year another bright, but realistic film, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, explored similar areas. But Vanilla Sky is deeper than any other film can hope for. <br /> <br /> In short, this is a movie that you really do not have to think about in the real sense of the word (if you allow it). <br /> <br /> Open your eyes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise plays David Aames, a young, He inherited from his father and, despite his ability and ability to work, his kings, the seven dwarfs, thought he was rich enough to be born of a silver spoon in his mouth. Each of them believes that he has done nothing to succeed. <br /> <br /> Early in the film, we have one of the amazing toys by Julie Gianni, David's Cameron Diaz, poisonous, but with a unique excellence. David and Julie are playing good games, and they claim to be using one another. This is the kind of relationship that David associates with other fangs that are at the root of his life. Though they both talk well, we can say that only one truth tells the truth. <br /> <br /> Then we meet with Brian Shelby and we played with a great shot by Kevin Smith's best friend Jason Lee. Brian writes a book that Davidin will publish, but they are also a very good friend. There is very little in David's life, and you can take care of each other early in the movie. Brian Davie has a famous line that keeps repeating it. And this is "sweet, without sweet sorrow". <br /> <br /> One day she says she can find true love, not just this part-time lover's status that seems to commit with all the floosies living in bed one night or two. At David's big birthday, Steven Spielberg's love wishes him a happy birthday), Brian entered the history of Sofia Sorrano, played by Penelope Cruz, who needs the best performance this year by a single player. This is just a bash of invitation, and first see that David and Sofia are interested in each other. And although typical David fashion is his best friend, he begins to flirt with Sofia. To complicate the Devil, Julie shows a job that is not called, and David begins to spy. David spent the night with Sofia, but only talked about each other's cartoons. Hanky ​​does not have panky. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The first day, as David left the Sofia apartment, Julie, This really tells the truth about the plot , because the film fills us with true truth and fuzzy perception. Getting acquainted with a character characterized by Kurt Russell and a few other cold characters, all of which play a strange role in the maze. There is a subtle evidence of death and a treatment such as possible or inaccessible, which can create the possibility of eternal life. It's one of the coolest things the film has to offer, but it does not end there. <br /> <br /> Like many films, this film is developing, and this is a mystery. Sixth Attention may have begun this fashion, but still look back, and maybe thanking Angel Heart for the craze. Vanilla has one of its own intestinal bands, regardless of how the sky is. And it's so fun that the movie gives you a lot of clear tips on the way, but it's not enough to justify the truth to yourself and your lies alone. I've seen this movie four times, and every time I want to see what I can do, something else I understand. There is something rare in a movie to put your ideas into the theater, and to open new opportunities. The best pictures of the year are good, but there is nothing spectacular. Lack of matter. A Beautiful Mind was interesting but flat, Royal Tenenbaums was interesting but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a rarity because it is a film that shoots more and more, because the film and those interested will delight you. I know that this movie has taken mixed reviews, but I do not think that those who do not like it do not understand it. <br /> <br /> The film shoots like this. What is a movie for you? Something to feel. Most of the other films have been vacant this year. <br /> <br /> The 10 of the 10 best films of the year. I would like to see a candidate for the best picture and I want to see the best actress Cruz, the best supporter Diaz, the best actor Kruiz and Jason Mewes should be the shoes for the best supporting player. Cameron Crowe should be there too. None of this will happen and it is shameful. This is a film that should not be released. <br /> <br /> And in a recent note, I'm absolutely convinced that Mr Krisak will want this movie, and maybe it's a movie that can answer her question. Can you prove that you are real? Or is it just a description of someone's imagination? Are we as artificially transmitted to someone else's embarrassment? This is a movie that questions more than answering. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>
