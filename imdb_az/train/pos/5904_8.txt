For a long time, I'm waiting to see this movie. The presentation gave a fair idea about the content and when I finally saw it, I saw that it was really well prepared. Most of the traditional romantic movies end with the lovers who eventually become married or have a happy life after marriage, but there is a great deal of change from the old life to a new relationship and transition to a life transition. This film is related to the period when a new wife, Fardeen and Esha, marry after their marriage and their lives start with honey. Esha was a little calm and could use some lines for himself, but acting really attractive. The story was well covered and dialogue was less appropriate. Editing and direction was also good, Meghna Gulzar really did a good job here. To sum it up, it would be a good drama romance, a true combination of Bollywood's pure entertainment that can offer.
