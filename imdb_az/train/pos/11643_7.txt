I enjoy this show, but the format needs some work. First, good features. I like how this show will go through a lifetime of a addict because our producers are capable of being dependent on how they can afford their lives. It follows an intervention followed by a result. Interference is not a matter of sweets, but sometimes the result (often due to the boundaries between short-term shooting and shooting) is a negative result. <br /> <br /> What I love about the show is the quality of the camera work. Photographing is strikingly good and stable, given the fact that the cameraman's compression and retreat scenes are not useful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An episode . After capturing the story of a addict, we suddenly went to someone else's story. Then that story will rise and then suddenly turn to the first addicted ... or are you? You may be in a situation where you have forgotten the situation on the screen. This constant shift between drug addicts is really bad when it comes to scenes of interference, because the demonstration will bring together even two absolutely uninterrupted interventions! Once I was marketing BS. The reason for this poor design is: "The show can be intensified that switching to another dependent allows watching the audience's time." Please. Obviously, this is two cases that are not big enough for one hour show, so they mix together. <br /> <br /> Instead of giving them a half-hour block, they are forced to watch all things (and ads) if they are interested in something other than interest. I was very worried about these "blend" episodes that I realized that TiVo wanted to point out only one episode of addiction, but it was easy to note all that.
