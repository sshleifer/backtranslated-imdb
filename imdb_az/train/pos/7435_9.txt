I saw this video 15 years ago. I thought it was excellent and I'm still going. I was a teacher of English (high school and college) and I was a lover of English romantic poetry, so Coleridge won me with high grades. Something that could protect the beauty of the poem or the power of the story could not have produced the perfect sound. In this case, everything works well to attract viewers, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated for a growing generation of television. In addition, Michael Redgrave's voice adds to his originality and power. Okay, so there was not a big budget for the project. So it's not Star Wars and there's no CGI. Who can release Gustave Dor√© illustration as part of the presentation? The above explanation, which dismisses only four lines of video as a trash, is fairly unfair and unfounded. I'm the producer's friend, but that's not the reason for that comment. On the contrary, I defend a piece of art worthy of every level. Coleridge's poems are useful for evaluating students and bringing them a blessing in the lessons of the ancient marina.
