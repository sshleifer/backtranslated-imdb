Most of the people who followed after the movie with Audrey Tautou did not realize that Amelie was a character - indeed, it was not Audrey Tautou's real life personality, so every movie he attended was Amelie Part 2, Part 3 . <br /> <br /> That's why I'm just taking this movie as Audrey is here. Yes, it is true, there is a big gap that maybe 45 minutes before the first scene, but I did not miss it because I was entertaining with other characters. The man who lies about everything is very funny, the guy who flies off the cafe, and finds the coupons and balances the losses, can actually enter the whole of the characters here <br /> <br /> The character of Audrey Tautou's Irene Amelie's succulent sugar girl is not. In fact, like Irene, I was at the forefront of the bulge of a fool who wanted to change. In this film, Irene is a good-looking girl, but in a very (very scary) day her wisdom becomes more noble and rare. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so beautiful? all these really interesting stories and building ... very entertaining, beautiful scenery and shooting to watch, very colorful and never too slow and all the characters can actually move. The best part of the film is about 20 minutes .... This is really the case when all the fields are merged and everything is closed and unreasonable, and all the butterflies are blossoms. I'm sure it was the best 20 minutes I've ever seen, and it's over. I thought, 'I'm indifferent to finding this movie.' The end of this movie is top notch. Anyone writing a script for this is brilliant, because there are only those other subplots, but in a way to lock them together (and here in a sensitive way), and to experience each character. <br /> <br /> I'm offering a very high level because it's a great movie to watch. any soul, any company or alone.
