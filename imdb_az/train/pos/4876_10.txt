Some children from the United States, Georgia, and even Bulgaria do not know if they are brave enough to express their thoughts on something that is unseen. For those who do not watch this movie - see. Do not expect too much or do not put a few frames, because it is Kosturica. Watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand all the humor - when the people of the country Bill Clinton bomb their villages, they try to conquer all the Gypsies of the Balkans at any time, LOVE is always unexpected, pure and colorful, and the Balkans are extremely creative. For those who claim to be a dirty film, you can see that America looks like Sh * t (Meet Dave, Smart, etc.), which is worse than a pure, sincere Balkan humorous love movie. The comment should be useful and should represent the author's personal opinion in the second place. I think the film is great and the audience should respect the director and explain it in the story. Simple but accurate. This is cruel, but laughs gentle and dead.
