This film is not just one of John Ford's favorite favorites, but also a number of top-class directors, Sergey M. Eisenstein and Bertrand Tavernier. In the future, I've had several original TV shows on Italian TV a few years ago and several times on Hollywood, several times on TV, and I've held it with my last 2-disc set of Criterion! <br /> <br /> The film, along with Ford's Henry Fonda, highlighted the first of 9 co-operation and is an example of Ford's folks American artery. A well-functioning and pictures-of-poetic piece of work, the sequence of the courtroom in the second half (and subsequent edition) is still inside a wall-roller except for a feature-rich actor, Donald Meek, as a prosecuting attorney. <br /> The fund is, of course, a perfect, someone who is novice, but a serious and humanist lawyer; The role of Lincol in the Fund's other rogue politicians, especially Franklin J. Schaffner, would continue to describe the films BEST MAN (1964) and Sidney Lumet's FAIL-SAFE (1964) "It's like God!" <br /> <br /> It is interesting to note here that Ford had previously captured Ibrahim Lincoln (tangentional) in the Shahin Prison (1936), fortunately, the exclusive Eureka's Masters of Cinema label, the UK's famous Criteria stand as a version of DVD. Besides, there are two more Abraham Lincoln movies that I have yet to watch in my DVD collection, and by accident, DW Griffith - A NATION (1915) and ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1930) Not only have I ever watched a lot of movies, With MR, I would give you a spin based on my high level viewing experience. LINCOLN.
