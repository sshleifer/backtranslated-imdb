Anime resembles anime ... <br /> <br /> In 2010 (hey, it's not too far!). Earth is no longer poisonous poisoning and pollution. When the perpetrators are seen as 30 seconds before the Third World Terrorists are attacked by the thieves, the so-called New Port city government organizes the Tank Police to tackle the problem - tanks with cops! This madness! <br /> <br /> This series includes heroes, new employer Leona Ozaki, Japanese women with red hair (yes, they know that no Japanese has heard of Japanese names) a beautiful blue-eyed boy. Leona tanks are new to use and, unfortunately, Tank Police Commander Charles almost destroyed Britain (known as "Brenten"), appearing on steroids as Tom Selleck, and a few sunglasses, a great revolver and a bad temper. Britain's first attempt to join the Toxunc Police and its lack of Tiger Special (a giant green monster tank), dislike it, and disassociate the giant tank, uses Britain to create a mini-tank called Bonaparte and soon " "encourages the transfer of child welfare. Perhaps the Mayor of the Tank Police, who also screamed about the antiques, is the biblical Genius, the Bible, Chapel, the Miraculous MO-hawked Mohican, and the Fierce Head of the Pot. <br /> <br /> When pursuing bad guys, tank police often use extreme violence to see how they destroy half of the city. <br /> <br /> The "villains" called Buaku, a cyborg "Green Peace," a gang and a mysterious past related to a project known as cyborg sidekicks Anna & Uni Puma. In the first installment, these children are paid to steal urine specimens from a hospital that treats patients who are not infected with toxic gas clouds and are hired to steal a painting of naked Buaku. But the story did not end with anime and ended in a very difficult religious comic book, Manga. <br /> <br /> In this black comic enterprise all kinds of chaos and mayhem occur. People explore how much the police want to get rid of criminals, and what happens when a beautiful line between good guys and bad guys begins to fall. If you make a movie of this movie, it would be better to get Quentin Tarantino. <br /> <br /> Followed by the "New Dominion: Tank Police".
