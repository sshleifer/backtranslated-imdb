This film is a very entertaining horror anthology film written by Robert Bloch (Psycho author) (along with Crypt's Tales lines). There is a good entertaining and perfect lever for horror fans. The film should be watched by fans for Dr. Kim, who has a fun role as a rude and humble horror star by John Pertwee (Third Doctor)!
