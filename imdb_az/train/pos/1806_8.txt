I wish that children's films are still being done in this way; dark and deep. The development of this character (and Charlie dynamic character epitome), area development, superior animation, emotional participation and rational, relative and consistent subject matter. If it were not for a few volumes of song and dance routines, you did not think it was a kid's movie, and that's why I'm giving you such a high rating. This movie is a perfect movie for a single child film. That brings me to a second point: This is the darkest "child" film I've ever seen, coming from a 22-year-old. I was shocked to see that she was not completely afraid of the second half of any of the 8's and the first half of the movie, and it ended with one of the happiest moments you can ever face ("Jurassic Bark" for Futurama fans) and this doing well. The film does not like to feel normal and not acceptable because it makes universal feelings; the film does not hurt itself; In fact, this is a success. Good comic films made us laugh; Good fear films have to scare us; good sad movies should upset us. In my opinion, good movies are not just fun, but it is necessary to act; this movie has passed me. <br /> Also, this film is extremely violent in line with today's standards for a child's movie and contains topics that may not be suitable for today's standards. Parents, I'll follow it first. I can not say anything about this kind of thing, but I saw it yesterday and it was a surprise to me.
