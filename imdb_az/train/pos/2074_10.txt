Another Canal 4 has been preserved long ago. Affected by Phil Devis and others. Hot, smart and funny. I remember those who had been watching since then, and even those around me that no one really had heard of it. But it's even harder to find someone who can now remember. Probably, Channel 4 does not do a good job to excite enough. Or the general public is very interested in TV vomiting from Big Brother. Secondly, I doubt. Downloading Garth Merengie's Dark Place caused Channel 4 to release DVDs of that series. Let's hope that it will be the same as the North Square.
