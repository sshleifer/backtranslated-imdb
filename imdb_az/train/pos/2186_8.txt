and what a combo. Two of the greatest singers of the century are stars together with this unreasonable music. He writes music, writes his words, and both work for Basil Ratbone, who is unable to write because his wife is dead (in fact, he only bought the oil!). The best scene is the number of pawn shops written by Bing as he composed the composition of Bing's carving tools. Just fine. And this legend of Broadway, plays a rare role for Mary Martin and she is very good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (once again a manic pianist), Charles Lane and Helen Bertram. And who can know Rathbone can be funny?
