Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers to his brother's death. Mr. Sen, Mr Margolin and Mr Morrow each have their first performance in their role; Ms. Phillips sought to spice up a television film (twenty-five years ago), delivering a "sexual intercourse" to another sexually explicit film. However, the real star is "California Kid"; <br /> <br /> Jake put a 1934 Ford coupe borrowed from Jacobs in front of the camera and was given a training session, holding the edge of the armchair without waiting for it to breathe. <br /> <br /> The scenes are spectacular (although some dialogues are a little bare) for a beautiful evening devastation. <br /> <br /> Some movies, movies, movies, videos are worth a dream.
