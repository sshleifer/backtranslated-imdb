The planning episodes were somewhat entertaining, but watching after the desert was quite fun. That's why I call this the most realistic reality show, because I'm astonishing, Charley has fallen from relatively early race. When my hands were wounded I was expecting ordinary stress and then a miracle, but instead came out of the race. The most disturbing moment of the show was almost in the wilderness with almost no water or food. The latter was great and I was very happy to see at least one of the teams. In general, the long road is not as big as a round, but an interesting watch puts an eye on the world's most difficult race.
