It's been a few years since I've seen it, but I remember it and would like to see it again. <br /> <br /> A thirty-five-year-old boy resembles a high school basketball game called "I miss the ball." his team lost. He would have been "hit this ball" after 20 years and thought he would be better than his life. <br /> <br /> This is a very reminiscent of me when I'm in high school for me. drill / dance group and did not do it. This team was the best in my school. If you were there, it was "all these". I did not work for the second time in my life the last two years, and I was in a really difficult situation. When I fought, I hit my legs badly before I tried, and it did not cause it. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> and I think that I have created something better or even different in my life, but I did not see this movie that we realized that we never knew how different things could be by changing the way things were done in the past. If anyone knows, it would change the point that I would not go with my son's father <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone who has a moment in the past that they could change. Be careful about what you want!
