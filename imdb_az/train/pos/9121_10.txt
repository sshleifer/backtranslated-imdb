<br /> <br /> Twenty years after 1984, this film talks about the future of the Prince in the music industry. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that the Prince's music performance in the past 10 years is perfect - that is, if you have the best two songs in the last 10 albums, you'll be a fantastic album! <br /> <br /> The scene plays in such a way. The princess escapes to the dressing room after playing a song and the owner of the club, the Prince of Grace in the 90s, and only the most hardcore admirers of the club The owner of the club - "You do not pack as you use them. yourself! " <br /> <br /> Spooky huh! Prince on the musical underline, which is even worse, when he puts Apollonia in two separate stages! <br /> <br /> This is not the only scene in which women are mistreated. <br /> <br /> Because I'm all the comedy sparring between Morris Day and Jerome Benton, both of them stole each stage. But how funny is you throwing a woman in a trash can? It was a simple mistake! The other bad bits put the prince's line into a place where the Minnieapolis police thoroughly provided, and that led the Prince to become more obedient! FANTASTIC! <br /> <br /> Blue Rain is a fun movie, because it prints Prince's songs, which boosts the value by 110%. But the film still gives us a theory about the prince and his music, because one of the greatest songs of the movie, Wendy, Lisa and Prince, says that he wrote music with his wife. <br /> <br /> Are the filmmakers trying to say that the songs of the prince and the prince write their father's music albums and steal their best songs from the prince's father? Perhaps the prince escaped the idea of ​​his ancestors, the steam was exhausted in the 90s ..... Hmmmm .....
