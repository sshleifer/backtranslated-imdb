I watched this movie and thought it was very interesting. Then I would like to know what happened. I was astonished to be able to fit in for a short time of 8 minutes. We start at the school yard. . Two friends discuss class jump. Kid B tells Kid: "Do not go to class today." And Kid claims that he can really miss something important. Thus, the child jumps to B and goes to class A class. After that the teacher tells him that he is planning to study the only and most important lesson he learned today. They went to learn the meaning of life. If you give a brochure to everyone and go to A, she is in a state of exhaustion and speaks with her boyfriend. Yes, the child will not share, because Kid is looking for a teacher. When he finally finds it, it is a revelation that shocks the true meaning of life. I suggest everyone to watch this briefly. You will only get 8 minutes of your life, but the message is very important, it can help with a lifetime.
