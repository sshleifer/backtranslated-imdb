I have just been looking at the 1st disc in the 4 discs (26 Episodes) collection created exclusively with the UCLA Film and Television Archives (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (beyond the 1st episode), the picture quality is very good. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> love this role. If you're in a mood for a quiet comedy instead of hitting you, you'll be able to survive to enjoy all the beautiful characters that you can remember from childhood. Although some of the ages are a bit confusing, they are most skillful and well-executed ... even the dark ones have fun. This is a television series that suits my childhood memories at an early age.
