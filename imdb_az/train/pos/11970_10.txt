I came home exactly when I was 9 years old. I recall the funniest home videos of America with Bobni Saget and one day my mother told me that she was in a show called the Full House. One day I am lucky to have an episode while visiting my family. <br /> <br /> From today, as I watched at 9:00 am at night, I will be the same. <br /> <br /> This show really lets you stay there. <br /> <br /> What I like about the full house is that it's a great show for her. children and adults of all ages. The larger parts for adults will then be parts intended for children, so the whole family can do it. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;">
