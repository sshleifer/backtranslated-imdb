This Anime Anime movie was not a disaster that was actually popular here in America and it was an adult swimming cartoon network, but it was a good movie I once held on the science fiction channel. I clearly think that they are less popular and more people now buy the DVD, watching the episodes from the internet. This movie probably did not have all the pieces and the sound was good for a dubbing movie, though I would like to watch the original Japanese version. Americans are somewhat worried about everything voiced for children. In this film, a young man with a Galaxy Express train crew hopes that he can do a technology-capable planet to make himself a robot. She wants to be a robot to revenge her mother who was killed in the hands of a robot hunting for fun. In the adventures, along with her trainers, she is friends with a beautiful woman named Matel, her mother, who was a mystery that Anime's movie with most women could be really good. For our young heroes or really bad. Since the Qatar has organized various stops, it travels from planet to planet and acts as a space pirate named Captain Harlow, who plays a leading role in his animated cartoon series, and Galaxy Express is in that universe. A very good ride with all the pretty strange and unexpected endings. It would have been a continuation, but it was not so good, but the end was as endless as it was here.
