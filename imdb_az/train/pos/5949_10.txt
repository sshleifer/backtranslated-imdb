Again, hello, romance and intrigue have to comment on this beautiful, exciting and convincing story. Beautiful and memorable music. Very good color film. Another movie that I later liked with Bing Crosby was the High Society. Beautiful music. Thank you for listening to Florence Forrester-Stockton, Reno, Nevada
