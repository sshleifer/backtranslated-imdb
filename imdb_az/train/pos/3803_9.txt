People are a series of 26 episodes, but not a start, average, and last but they can not understand this movie. Remember, the whole world has not been sufficiently studied. All this was shown on TV. <br /> <br /> It was great and surprising as the visual, as was the *** SPOILERS *** argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo, near the end of the film. I really liked this movie. I saw the characters I saw after the 26 episodes, agonizing in such a way, and making the Lian-Chu blade sharp and almost teary. <br /> Then Lian-Chu is fighting this awesome excellent dragons (shown in the beginning of this series) and Gvizdo threatens to kill Zoe in dangerous and indirect ways. * Strawberry * I was surprised that this particular scene was not mentioned more in the warnings. She does not really believe that Guizdone is the real thing, and that she is fully integrated into the little girl's drowning. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <strong> Get your favorite characters.
