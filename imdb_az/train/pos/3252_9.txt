The story "From Woman From Nowhere" is quite straightforward and very adaptable from an Eastwood Spaghetti West: A mysterious stranger enters an illegitimate city by working and fires on the ground. Even opening credits and music also feel spaghetti: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone will be proud of. <br /> <br /> This is really an interesting fact that a stranger in Harley is beautiful (!) Woman, Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) and a place in a city in Japan. <br /> <br /> In this action, a large number of weapons, some good, some predictable, and other spots are a bit hockey but fun. Ryoko captures his weapons with conviction and aplomb and gives his children the killing. It was a problematic challenge for him as well as a physical problem, but he worked very well. <br /> <br /> Oksu shows more player skills such as "Oshi" in the NHK drama, "Musashi." <br /> <br /> You are a fan of a Ryoko Yonekura (I'm adoringly am) and / or "Armed Girls" and admirable images. There's something unusual about me and the "armed girls" like "La Femme Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight". And there is a nice pen, such as the Ryoko, which plays a leading role.
