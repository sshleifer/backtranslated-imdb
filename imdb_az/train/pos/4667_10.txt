After seeing this movie for a few years in the VHS, I have not even seen a dream. Every time I see it better. Peter Ustinov wrote stars and his original screenplay (Academy Award nominee). Other stars you hear include Carl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov was just released from Britain's brutal Wormwood Scrubs Prison (he was liberal from the Conservative Party headquarters for being elected). He immediately began searching for a new employer and found that computers were a wave of the future. A social engineer travels with a London men's club and learns the identity of the city's best computer experts, stealing a Caesar Smith identity that just left the city for South America. . He talks about Ta-Can-Co-a, the American conglomerate headed by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Klemper Smith hires him and shows him a computer-centered, especially a blinking blue light. Ustinov asks the computer how to defeat his own security, and the computer says, "shut down the blue light." In the future, using the hacking methods in the future, Ustinov goes into the system and develops programs to create checks for various counterfeit companies. If Clemper's assistant Willard Gnatpole (Bob Newhart) sees that Ta-Can-Co is working with Ustinov's deceptive companies, the scheme begins. With his secretary Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov has been afraid of persecution and then happily lives. To explain how this is a very funny, romantic, intelligent and predictable image.
