This is indeed the biggest Swedish film of all time. Not only revolutionary in his story, but also among the first films that have a new generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindstr√∂m are two of the most intelligent and well-known filmmakers in Sweden today, and this movie really is a demonstration. <br /> <br /> "Vuxna mnniskor" (Mature People) is a story about warm and hearty and hilarious adolescence and the question we are about to be better without it.
