I liked this drama better than Sydney Lumet. The best I've come to describe is crazy. He lays his watch around for one hour and fifty minutes, and does not allow breathing until the credits begin to ride. <br /> <br /> Trust me, this movie will keep you guessing all the ways. <br /> <br /> The story is very well prepared and almost brilliant. It's almost a tough Tarantino story. It tells about all the potential, even small parts of the game, excellent pens. I also liked cinematography, it gave a real sense of it as an independent movie. <br /> <br /> This film is exciting, exhausting and heartfelt. It's hard to say, but you'll be glad you did.
