I'm a fan of Hal Hartley's films, especially the 1997 Henry Fool movie. "Fay Grim" is a continuation of the film and creates a similar style and sense of humor. But the plot is completely different. Fay Grim (iconic Parker Posey) starred in missing laptops on missing losers and found himself among conspiracy and espionage. Support movie (most of the first film, as well as Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows and a splendid turnover from the 90s, to the popular Elina Louensohn), and the film's surprises are numerous. The director claimed that if it serves as a series of "Empire Strikes Back" series such as "Star Wars", this is true, I can not wait to see a third payment! I do not have to wait 10 years for this.
