I have never commented on any movie before. Last night I watched this movie with my daughter. I read a comment saying that this movie is with you. It does. It was about 24 hours and I was still impressed. This movie asked me about myself. How can I compare myself to a similar, self-sacrificing example? I liked this movie. I love the movies that make me dream up and wonder. I feel the feeling of two emotions, happiness and sorrow. A nice movie and I feel very sad. I did not want both Ben and Emily to be together, but eventually they were eternal. If you have not seen this movie, get it and watch it. Make sure you do not care. You want to see every nuance in this picture. For a library.
