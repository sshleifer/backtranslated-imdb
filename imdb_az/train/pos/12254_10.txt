After watching the version of Paltrow, I saw this movie. I saw someone was very good and I thought it would be good ... but I was wrong: The English version was better and more enjoyable! I found Jeremy Northam "more than happy" with Mark Strong, but I can say that he has a strong Austen's Knightley. Anyway, both versions are good, but anyone who loves Austen books should watch this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> "My 2 cents"
