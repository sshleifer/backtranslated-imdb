<br /> <br /> Yes, it's a movie that's almost a big reaction. Personally, I accept all these advantages around you. But I will not use this very effective way to describe this film. <br /> <br /> So, if it's "perfect, one by one!" - consider it. <br /> <br /> So, if another Hamlet is to find a place to compete with a lot of theaters and all kinematics, then do not miss it. (Unfortunately, many people do not have the chance to see it, there is no DVD and the German version is pretty good - no format available) <br /> <br /> When deciding to take a copy: or more). There is no use and no entertainment, and a movie that is engaging in an exciting flow and architecture gives you a wrong impression. <br /> <br /> <strong> F.L.
