Kali's tears are an original, but flawed film of fear involving the actions of a religious group in Germany, a German psychologist who has learned how to control his own will and body to the point where he can "heal" others <br /> <br /> Film, Taylor- The Eriksson group is displaying a series of vignettes - this is a radical technique (which can trigger nightmare hallucinations and physical pain and torture). <br /> It is a religious group mentioned above. The first segment has slowed down the rest, but it works fine for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Let me note that it's been a few days since today. It may not be spectacular, but this concept provides quite neat and accurate spots. 8/10.
