I saw this movie 12 years ago at TNT. Susanah was York's birthday and Tom Jones (1963) featured this film as a dual feature. I have not seen this movie since this movie. I'm interested in seeing this movie because one of the stars is a very funny and talented Jim Dale, like Lusty Sailor. I believe that Dale is now making a story about the Casette Harry Potter, but at least she is laughable. This is a fast paced comedy. Not VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures must pass through the film collection and think of restoring and releasing this movie on DVD. Christopher Plummer is hilarious as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also pretty humorous as the Ramble sailor. This is a kind of movie that is no longer seen with great production values. *** ***
