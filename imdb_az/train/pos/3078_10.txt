I loved this show ... intelligent actor, intelligent dialogue, a great story with real people .... please bring it back or provide it with the internet ... really protect yourself ... Hope Davis really shines in this show. I love the idea of ​​SIX DEGREES ... In this crazy world, it really makes sense. Get these stupid reality shows away from you, and give this chance a second chance. Please bring it back. When I left the air, I watched on the internet and liked how I could follow the minimal breaks, in fact, the online ABC allows you to enjoy the show when you miss them at leisure ... endless assignment days. When you want to bring it back, I'm ready.
