The details of this film are amazing scenes of battle - absolutely incredible sword movements and martial arts are demonstrated. The original John Woo masterpiece. Despite the story, he thinks he's going to be a few weeks, but he never reflects the vast majority of acrobatic martial arts. If you're into martial arts movies, this is going to LOVE!
