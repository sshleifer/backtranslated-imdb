I was looking forward to this movie for a long time because I liked this movie as a political drama, played with three of my favorite actors; Al Pacino, John Cusack and Bridget Fonda. Though he was ruled by the unlucky Harold Becker, Pacino and his personality united in the Love Sea, which is one of the best of his work. However, interference with some levels (initially, some scenes on the original trailer do not appear in the movie) and tone change (causing future trailers to look like a tension) <br /> Which is very bad because I really like this movie . Despite all the corruption here, the government still had a great potential to be a worthwhile movie, and it was not a normal guys against bad guys, but a complex comment on that corruption. Here's a good move. Pacino and Cusack are also very good and give Danny Aiello one of the best performances in his career. But when the background is spent with his role, nothing is done and turned into a tension in the central story line, the film loses itself, soon ends on the final scene between Cusack and Pacino, and then falls down completely at the end. I want more than that, but not.
