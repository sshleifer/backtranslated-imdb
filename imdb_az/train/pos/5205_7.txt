A group of American students and their mentor decides to visit the most remote part of Ireland to learn ancient religious practices. Despite the repeated warnings from the beaten path (a local creepy Irish boy, natch), they are doing so and they have an unusual cannibals family inside them. If the porn stars and the budget horror automatically tone naked and horrifying If you think that you are equal, you will be able to raise the sticks of Scotland and place them in Emerald Isle because of the groundless structure of the film. then think again: The Evil Genus is mixed with adults, but in reality there is not too much nudity as she expects 'talent', and although the actor is worthy of Oscar, it's not all this <br /> <br /> In a fierce style, a few spectacular slaughters in a bad way. (Excluding Ginger Lynn Allen) campers: After some short canvas sex, silicone enhanced hottie is dragged from the tent and torn half; The man's legs and legs are cut and sprouted in saliva. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> is just twenty of the things you want to be yamyam chow and the fair amount spent in the form of terrible lying fear, the strange Irish Gary (Simon Peacock) and the worst of all. As the film looks like it will not go better, the director Christian Viel decides to take seriously: rammed gets a knife and beautiful blonde Gillian Leigh (not a porn star, but I'm sure there is a career there, she wants it). From then on, things that favor the baked foods are rapidly evolving and the film is turned into a true blood lake: Gary, a donkey in a machete (about time!) And drowned in her intestine; Ginger Lynn is a mutant in kick-boxes; Jenna Jameson, a predator, a predator and a silicone breast implant, is involved in a mixed lizard; a person gets decapitated with cheese wire; and Taylor Hayes will be bare, bruised and naked with a dead fetus between her legs. <br /> <br /> All of them will die, fewer things are worthwhile, and Evil Breed earns the 7/10 final rank. <br /> <br /> NB. As a result of a very difficult production and studio intervention, Christian Viel finally denied the project. Removals were taken and a US abdomen was released. A good news is that the movie may be both streaming and streaming, as the UK DVD (my version I've watched) is just as uncomfortable as splashes are worrying (only 13 cut off in the film).
