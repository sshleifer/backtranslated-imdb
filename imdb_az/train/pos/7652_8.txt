The player is fantastic. The story is incredible. The script - beautiful. <br /> <br /> There are several ways to describe this movie. Yes, it is slow and very talkative, but wants to listen to every little thing in life to learn more about the whole story of life and how the information about how it was thrown and gone, and how to learn more about this exciting and tragic story. I'm reading a book that says that the movie was shot and that I was giving more light to this story and answering some of the questions that were left unanswered in the film. I also read the "other" half of Gilmore's story, "Songs of the Expedition". This film did not think much about the word "piering on the other side of the glass". You've heard a song in Gary Gilmore's Eyes, a punk band writing a song like Gary Gilmor's eyes (as Gary was one of those things she gave as a transplant). And as you've just heard Mikalin's Gary see, you only see the whole situation somewhat differently if you just have a song here. This movie opened my eyes in this way and in many places. I'm offering this movie (and my book) a lot.
