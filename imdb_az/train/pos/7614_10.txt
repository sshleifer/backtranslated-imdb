I'm drowned! The story is beautiful and the show is highly addictive, but I love it. I've been in Season 2, on disk 5 and I'm telling you that I'm now joining the characters. It would have a serious impact on my voice for the show, which was bad for them. And Michael is now on my list. Violence ... I am very happy to see that it is one of the three seasons, because I think it will end with the disc. Now I am looking forward to seeing the rest. Thanks to Lost's directors / producers and actors ... I enjoy watching television again. Before losing I have to surf each channel that will suffer sadly because of my frustration on television, but I must say that Lost is the kind of entertainment I have!
