Although I agree that it is a very good, but not great movie, I still love it for a lot of other posters. One reason music: I draw attention to the beautiful appearance of Candoli brothers - Conte and Pete - at a well-scene scene at night club. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpets of the day and played a trumpet trumpet duet in each of Stewart's ear, pushing Jimmy Stewart's mind into convincing reason. Candolis played really well, though I was a true musician for this scene, both of them later. I did not know much about George Duning, he also borrowed credits for music (working with the Three Stooges more than once), but it was a real nice touch that his brothers wrote as jazz toys.
