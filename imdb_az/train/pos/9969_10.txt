Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all good movies. Great movies. But there is nothing, and nothing can say that the biggest Christmas movie ever lived up to Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The movie is very large and contains many messages. Seriously, this is one of the 10 movies you need to watch. When we say that Pitch should have a freezing dinner, we can see his sadness and feel deep sorrow, and then we wonder ... how bad is it about ice cream? Could it be that if we treat people as good as ice cream, they make us worse? Thinking about thinking. <br /> <br /> This movie has never been the best recipe for Santa Claus. Unlike other Santas, it is a normal person. We see him arresting children and spying on children's desires. Do we believe this is really good? It also tells Christ all the meaning behind Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> You owe it to yourself to look at this movie theater. We should not shoot or cast anything in this movie except for the episode 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie is 500/10. Whoever says this movie badly is an ignorant idiot.
