When I first saw it, I saw that I was worried about it later. This was the first part of the '68, and it still made tours in the cities of America, and recently there was a mass killing in my hometown where I saw a man shouting shooting. This dramatic story, coupled with a real story, is designed for the theater experiences that are very disturbed by the freshness of the event. It really played Robert Blake and Scott Wilson's excellent player. I met Truman Capote's novel based on a real story, and by Richard Brooks, scenarios and management transformed the event and Truman's interpretation into a strange kinematic adaptation. Quincy Jones is a music-enabled story. I have seen only a few times since. It was very real. It is almost like a witness to the crime itself and to walk with the murderers. I'll give this a possible 9.0. The society is so desensitized today for violence and crime that it may appear slowly and fictitiously and may be less exposed, but everyone over 50 will be a sign of this crime investigation.
