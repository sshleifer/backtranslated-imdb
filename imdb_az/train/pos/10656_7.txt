What a great Barbara Stanwyck movie when I see another night. The "danger" was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, set out with his wife Doug (Barry Sullivan) and his son (Lee Aaker). An isolated fishing trip in Mexico. <br /> <br /> If Barbara runs to a garage for a rope, it's the only way to get rid of the great accusation and get rid of it. <br /> <br /> There he is a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker - Barbara is a cat and mouse game, as he tries to do everything he can to return with Meeker to free his husband. </ p> <p> <div> <div> <p> <div> <div> <p style = "text-align: justify;" I did not expect such a big movie, but did I understand that Barbara Stanwyck is less than this good thing?
