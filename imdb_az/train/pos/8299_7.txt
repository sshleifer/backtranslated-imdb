The scientist and family man, Matt Winslow (Robert Urich), along with her beloved wife, Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and her son Robbie (Barret Oliver), and his daughter, are finally moving to the Micro Digitech Corporation's cosmic suit project. Chrissy (Soleil Moon Frye) is a large modern home in the corporation complex. His friends met with Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family fit into a completely new lifestyle and invited Tom Winslow to the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom, in Michael Digitech, tries to deceive Matt, who says he has a meteoric rise in each member of the club, but does not get fooled by Matt's suggestion. Then, the director of the club, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci), said that he was friendly with Patricia and agreed to join the club with his children. Matt feels a change in his family's behavior and decides to investigate the club's findings about Jessica and his members. <br /> <br /> In the '80s' invitation to Hell, this film, partly called 'Stepford Wives', reminds people that the behavior of suburban communities changes. I've seen today and have found a metaphorical message against big corporations that sell people to satan to raise their positions and earn higher wages. I'm sure the author is planning to tell this story, but I believe it's perfect. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus
