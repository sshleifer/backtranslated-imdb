Sarah Silverman is completely like a manic Zooey Deschanel and I think I'm in love with it now. Yes, if Jesus loves Christ, you will love it. If not, what is it? Kudos turned this into the comedy channel. My life has finally come to my senses and "Your car smells like a farts" is my kind of charm. I am a happy man. The first episode laughs me hysterically, and I was starving for the next week. It talks to Grease South Park. Totally ugly. Someone I read Sarah Silverman's phonebook. His delivery is accurate and oh so funny. It never jumps. When it comes to thinking about it, it's not a material choice. This is really a good thing, because it's the way he chooses to deliver it. Thank you, Sarah Silverman! Thanks, Comedy Channel!
