I first saw this movie a few years ago, while still on the untrained Trio Channel, and recently watched advertising on Sundance. For the first time I was amazed and at the second glance I was even more busy. Yes, some segments are not perfect - Amos Gitai's hysterical interpretation differs from the pain, but when it is accepted collectively, 11 09 01 is a common success. The latter part of Shouhei Imamura is misinterpreted as an attack on 'terrorists', like thick-minded Mick LaSalle, as modern critics, but now as an ingenious anti-war polemic; Samira Mahmalbaf's 11/11 victim aims to confound empathy with an important concern for Afghan children. and Idrissa Ouedraogo's entertaining childhood for Osama Bin Laden is almost a serious and successful case for REAL Osama. The segment of Youssef Chahine is a noble thing, despite the failure of Bin Laden and al-Qaeda to fail to recall the view that the American foreign policy and the CIA's creativity are largely creative, although Sean Penn's character research is still on the ground but still effective an anonymous movie trailer. Generally, the main view is a better view from the World Trade Center, which reacts to Oliver Stone.
