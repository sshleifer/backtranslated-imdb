Still reminded me of what happened to one of the most famous Cinderella stories in one of Beauty & Beast movies. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ font> <strong> <strong> I also liked some new characters (Pom Pom was very nice and I was like Prudence). Still, the story was somewhat limited, but still very sweet. So I vote 7/10.
