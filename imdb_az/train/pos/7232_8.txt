After the usual exploration scene, Jerry accidentally wind in an invisible ink bottle that is part of a chemistry set. He soon understands that it is invisible ... so predictable results emerge, that is, he uses his new secret position to torment Tom. <br /> <br /> <strong> Jerry often defends himself alone, but often he's just ugly that it catches the cats at the right time, even inevitable. <br /> Here Tom is here, his eyes are not in front of a mousetrap eye, or milk in a bowl. Tom can not get it anymore, so he's trying to sleep in the nightmare, but Jerry fires his penis! People, I hope that little kids did not recall these 40th and 50th animated films! I've always seen Jerry, cute mouse, cute worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The best part of this cartoon is to describe what happened to Tom Jerry, about two-thirds of the road and various ways to identify the location of the mouse (for example, to see footprints).
