2005 Toronto Film Festival official report; <br /> <br /> An annual night race is featured on a new film titled "Takashi Miike", "The Big Spook War" or "Great Yokai War" or "Yoque daisens√¥". <br /> <br /> Colin Geddes, the fearless programmer, said this movie was directed to children in Japan. Think of the "Lord of the Rings" or "Story Story" for Japan. After scanning, we can understand that they were going to this place, but the curse was "Takashi Miike". When filmed in the festival, the '01 'film directed the "Inner Killer" film, was screened. <br /> <br /> <strong> Life is a companion. <br /> <br /> This is not really 'young' for kids, really. Certainly, some of these spirits (even friends) are like. It's different from what I've seen before in the movie theater. A natural fantasy is a very funny (but dark) material. Please do not give us a warranty. Will it still hit North America? <br /> <br /> My rating = B
