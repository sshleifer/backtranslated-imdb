I was rarely seen to watch the movie with such a warm, happy feeling. I really had some good friends and had a good time. I'm very happy about this movie. The player was perfect, although I would like to mention that while performing a perfectly flawless performance on behalf of Bill Nye. Bill is a perfect actor and I would like to see him in more movies. Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favorites and always love to see them when they give such a solid performance. And Billy Connolly, as always, is absolutely beautiful. All of this was a beautiful ensemble performance. This is a fresh experience to see a well-written, well-functioning and well-watched movie.
