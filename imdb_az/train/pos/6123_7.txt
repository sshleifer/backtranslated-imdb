Before I comment on this movie, when I see this movie, I'm looking forward to a typical shit, horror, B-movie, and I just want to have fun. Jack Frost is one of the best I've seen for a long time. Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost, but in my opinion, there is a future for psychopaths in big time films if no chance is given. McDonald is a serial killer who has become a snowman with some ridiculous random blend of ridiculous elements. The snowman starts to move around, and you'll find it hard to laugh until you kill people. They said that the mistakes were completely flawed but really funny. The rest of the rash improves the film's foolishness, but it's a stupid genius. The scene with the snowman's teenage girl is really a classic B-movie, a horror movie fashion. I really hope this is a continuation and I'll be there to watch any cable channel. Of course, watching for the first time only is fun, and this is not a good job of movie technology, but I would like to see ghosts kill people. I gave it from 10 to 7, it's a great movie for late dates and couples.
