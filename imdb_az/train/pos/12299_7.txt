MGM has been featured in the English version, but the second portrait of Anna Christie in Germany has benefited from Germany's dialogue and benefits. Garbo looks more comfortable and natural under the direction of Jacques Feyder, next to Clarence Brown, and his silent film-like behavior has completely disappeared, making it all the sound. The force that landed on the ground remains, though, softened here, and Garbo has more to reveal Anna's weakness. Except for Garbo, the entire gallery is different from the previous version, and Garbo refuses to compete with Marie Dressler, who stole every scene she speaks in English. <br /> <br /> Feyder's director is more reliable than Clarence Brown, and his use of the camera and the way Feyder headed, the editing methods were not limited to Browne's new voice process. The film moves more fluently than the English language adaptation, and the static layer of the first film has been replaced by a stream that protects the audience's interests. Even the William Daniels movie theater seems to have improved over the Braun version. He captured the atmosphere of the docks with Garbo's luminesscence and style. Also, the scenario adaptation for European audiences clarified that Anna's profession had been evident from the outset and that the disclosure was only for watchers who were unaware of what was meant for Braun's filming. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the Garbo Oscar nomination, its recognition of the smooth transition compared to the soundtracks. However, some of the Academy's voters could see the film in German, and as modern audiences, under the direction of Feyder, Anna Christie was definitely worthy of Oscar.
