This anime is small and still. As I mentioned in four children's films, I am still coming back 10 years after I first saw it. One of the best films. The animation is not perfect, but the camera tricks make me feel 3D, and after the day I grew up, the story is still good, and I've seen those who fell like Neon Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. He has no place near the depths, but wants to see it from a clear view. <br /> <br /> There is a story to have fun, not to vote. <br /> <br /> Feel like a giggle over the more animated animes. It does not mean his children's films, it's an astonishing impression of moments, and it's all about a sense of humor.
