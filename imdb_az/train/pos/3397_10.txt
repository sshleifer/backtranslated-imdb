Soylent Green IS ... is a really good movie. <br /> <br /> I would never think of it. I did not really love Hester in his fantastic work. Like Superman, most of the time is one of the actors who control all sneery and unbeaten victories. I prefer the more sensitive heroes. <br /> <br /> The cold-bloodedness of the people living in the Caucasus is in this film. Soylent Green does no effort to create futuristic visions (what you know - it looks like 1973) and it's inactive. But I was amazed at the vision of a complicated, corrupt and multi-layered society, and I was glad that Edward G. Robinson saw such a moving, funny final role. <br /> <br /> Dear Honton, there are some nice moments as you distribute some valuable meals. <br /> <br /> The Soylent Green message is very important these days. corporations are up. Funny, it's not a prototype to see Michael Moore film Heston ...
