The story of Mrs. Patty Duke's life and the fight against manic depression was like my life's struggle. I behave like him myself. <br /> <br /> When I was shown for the first time in 1990, I saw the movie and was so glad to have liked this movie because of its similarity to my life. Anyone struggling with manic depression can get more of this movie. Do not think that he has a reward or what he has done for them. It's not a matter here. The problem is that Mrs Duke was a disease and struggled to save her. <br /> <br /> Duke is proud to be successful in struggling to survive a disease that is a victim of many diseases to succeed. <br /> <br /> If a person does not personally fight with this disease, they have to live with Hell. The film was a success for me because of the real problems and the way a person is depressed and manic. It was so real ... so real. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ em> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Bocka
