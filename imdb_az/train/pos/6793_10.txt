I absolutely love this game. I'm 9 years old (now I'm 15). It has great graphics, symbols, magic, weapons, additions and ultimately forgot the awesome dragoon shape! I'm still waiting for an update, prequel, or later on this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> You play as Dart, a young sword who has the potential to be a hero. In this adventure, you encounter miraculous creatures and cartridges battles. On the road, which is your own special element, you encounter friends. Fire, darkness, water / ice, thunderstorm / lightning, earth, light and wind. There are also things known as dragoon spirits that allow them to turn into legendary magic creatures. The creatures of dragons, wizards, winglies and evil creatures will experience the excitement and excitement of this adventure. One of my favorite games, the legend of Dragoon!
