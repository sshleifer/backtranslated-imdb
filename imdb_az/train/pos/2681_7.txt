As you probably know, Jess Franco is a productive man. Hes has shot hundreds of films, many are shit. However, a number of quality assurances between the operation of the entire assembly line were hidden. "Succubus" is not his best job ("Diabolical Dr. Z" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but has many trademarks for everyone who wants to get into his big catalog. It is erotic (changing between the full frontal nudity and some of the things that have been imagined) and flawlessly combines. This is a very imaginary movie full of beautiful atmosphere. I especially enjoyed the constant enrichment. <br /> <br /> There are still many users who do not like Succubus, and I can see where they are. Its slowly paced, but I can deal with it. More problematic discrepancies. The script ran out openly and I had no idea what happened to the movie in five minutes (and really did not come from that point at all). In the style of some articles, those who want to look elsewhere. Also, his fear film is really scary or even declining. Perhaps I was all hosted by this psychedelic silliness, and I really did not think of these great flaws. (7/10)
