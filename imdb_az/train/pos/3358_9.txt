First of all, there is a saying for this movie: "Wow." It's probably one of the best films I have ever touched, from her story to her performances, so beautifully performed by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. It was a great deal to do with the latter, because he really liked the character because it was a very difficult role. Still, both of them created a couple that surprised me all the way, showed on the road, a loving friendship, developed throughout the day, filmed. The story takes a long time, because the use of symbols for a long time, but at last we are replaced by a beautiful fairy tale of love and humanity. If you have the chance to see it, because it is a movie that will remain in mind many times. Simply beautiful - 9/10.
