A remarkable documentary film about the protection of women and children from acts of violence in the family of the Kumba Women Lawyers Association (WLA), south-west of Cameroon. According to Sharia laws, men can always imagine the difficulties of applying secular legal rights to women and children in this Muslim culture, which has always dominated women. After 17 years of unsuccessful attempts, the WLA leaders have recently won several wins and the purpose of this film is to share these winning stories. <br /> <br /> The leaders of this legal reform movement Vera Ngassa, the public prosecutor and the chief judge (Court Chairperson) Beatrice Ntuba. I imagine both, but on the contrary, they make films for themselves in the film, though they have subsequent hearings of real events for the camera. <br /> <br /> Four cases were brought to trial and all bidders were playing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Two cases involve the repeated sexual encounters of a repeated marriage partner; Forced sexual intercourse on a 10-year-old girl; and another one is related to a beating of a child by an 8-year-old aunt. One of the sturdy wives is looking for divorce. The investigation of the complaints continues to work on the results of the trials. In each situation, the results are good for women and children. Prostitutes receive severe penalties and / or fines; divorce is given. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The aggressive persecution of the child, It's also remarkable that all parties, including those who are guilty, are being treated.
