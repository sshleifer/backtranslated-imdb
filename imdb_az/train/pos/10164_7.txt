<br /> <br /> This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I agreed to watch a chicken flick, and how did I do that? <br /> <br /> But this is great! Eva, Lake and Paul give wonderful speeches. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd plays the character of Mike (he works very well) from friends. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own taste, but for this they understand the interpretation of a star I do not fall.
