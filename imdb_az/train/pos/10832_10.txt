If you like Deep Purple, you will play a key role in this manuscript with Stephen Rea. The story was about the most famous rock band in the 70s, the Strange Fruit, and they decided to play together again. But, of course, during their concerts there will be many problems. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are very beautiful and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to watch it.
