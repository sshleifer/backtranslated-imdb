I did not pay any attention to the trip. People really went to places. They gave a few prospective air to the Marxian technology and the origin of this era. I'm also upset about the effects, especially the Thunderchild scene, and I think this book is one of the most exciting. But I will not be able to rejoice enough for this film, because I'm loyal to Wells's story! Over time. Players are pleasing and their performances are charming. And it's worth seeing this movie just to hear Jamie Hall's really great music account. It was interesting to see that the same actor was both a writer and a brother in London.
