You are different from the stars you give this GREAT movie before you "see it for the first time". I had never heard of this movie before, and just because I had a very slow rental experience this week (and last). I do not know how this movie went through, but I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam. Still, it did. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great example of what to do if you do not have a great budget. It was very interesting and only to keep the viewer in the dark and characteristic; just enough. The whole movie tries to understand many of the artists (watchman) artists and turns. I would have shot 10/10, but some shots were very fake. I do not think too much about this movie, but I do not think it's a worthy one. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think he's a very serious talent. He must leave his beauty (difficult), he really accepts his role and does not stop to manage it with advanced emotion scenes based on his appearance. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam is primarily as good as a good geeky corporate mouse ready to cross any maze to prove himself. But it's night and day, as it's changed throughout the movie. I know Clev Owen, Jude Law or one of the other candidates would like to be the next James Bond, but Northam must comply with this bill. He is suave and cultured. There's a great Bond posture and sound. <br /> <br /> As we know, it is very important. <br /> <br /> Great movie and definitely this movie-buff at least once you love corporate espionage movies.
