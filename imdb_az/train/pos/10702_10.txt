As the critics and viewers have shown, BIRTHDAY GIRL should be a great fat clinker. I decided to rent my last night because I loved Nicole Kidman. He proved to be worthy of watching. Of course, it's not your main American comedy and it's not a genius to understand that it's a very British movie, but I liked it. All the other films around him were a breath of fresh air. Of course, there were some holes in the ground, but generally worked. First, Kidman was very different, very attractive, but still spectacular in a very sexy role. It is one of Hollywood's best talents. Not only a Russian accent, but also a long conversation in Russia, and when you do not know Nicole Kidman you can never question its authenticity. Harrison Ford should celebrate K-19. Generally speaking, it is a small, small film, despite the terrible noise.
