Captain Fortunately with San Francisco This is a very interesting film about the effects of Sandwiched War and some people among the two greatest parts of Spencer Tracy. <br /> <br /> Tracy and Tone are a few World Warriors. Like A Woman Who Loves Both A Gun stars Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone, the Tone is almost a poor character over the hill in the opening camp, but Tracy stops it. Tracy likes the young Wallace Beery type designed for her while she is still away from Fox. <br /> <br /> There is an opportunity on the front tone and during the battle he tries to go to a church tower where a German machine gun falls. Now you learned to shoot, and made a Sergeant York. But Alvin C York did not change the war. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Victims of the battle are in a hospital, Tracy goes to AWOL to visit his comrade and he and George are going to do something. Later, Tone and George, who were reported to be missing from Tracy's move, marry. Tracy is a class when she comes back and learns to marry, but she goes on the road. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film deals with Tone, who uses warfare skills learned by gangster trade. Now a cunning man and George does not really know what he is doing for a life. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that part of the movie that gave me some problems was Gladys George's. Speaking of The Twenty Years of the Roaring Twenties magazine, Humphrey Bogart's character is similar to that of Tone, though it's with him. is not the central character of the film. In fact, they also have the elements of a taxi driver and Clint Eastwood classic, A Gun that will be found in The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> The World War is staged in a very good way by the director of war series Woody Van Dyke. For some reason Leonard Maltin penned this movie, so it's much better than lending.
