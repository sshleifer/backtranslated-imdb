Domino was widely condemned on this site for its indefinable editing style and "sick" photography. These detractors are criticized for its semi-transparency and the placement of "item on style." He could not agree more. I believe that "Domino" Tony Scott represents the absolute height of his filming career. <br /> <br /> After completing a Hollywood-dominated movie for eighties and early nineteenth century, Tony Scott approached a more subjective cinematic style. From the beginning, "Crimson Tide" used his style to describe the inner worlds of his characters - the clash of clustrophobia and dramatic nuclear submarine boats combined with the perfect angled frame with the perfect use of long lenses. Then, with the "State of Terror" and "Penalty Game," it was a form of visual representation of the world of spying and spying. <br /> <br /> "Fire Fighting" was a very sensitive walk, with more artists making an aesthetic move to an artist. Here Scott used the old hand cranked camera and flash frames to express his explosive anger. Although completely unsuccessful, Domino presented the techniques needed to get full expression. <br /> <br /> Domino joins a shooting unit of an FBI surveyor, which narrates the life of the drowning hunters by disjointed parts of the memory. All of us remember, remembering, breaking the pieces, shouting and bumping. Domino expresses his story verbally because he expresses the sources of ideas that guide them, not the events described by him. His system has "traces of the mescaline", but individual sight is, in any case, unusual - a woman who is fleeing for the blessing of grace. <br /> <br /> It happens when Domino's capture would eventually lead to the collapse of Scotland. Together with cinematographer Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson, Williams Scott forms the postmodern canvas of modern America. Perhaps it can be Domino, though it is unusual, but it is different from the 90210 culture that he denied. This culture is more aware of the innocence that ruins through privileged children who offer the tracer narrative as wades through melange Scott. Finally, Scott describes his salvation as a single run from the surreal journey. <br /> <br /> Criticizing this film to be extremely stylized is to criticize Picasso or Pollock to recognize that he is human. Like any great painting, the meaning of "Domino" is on the surface and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> <strong> According to Qafqazinfo.az,
