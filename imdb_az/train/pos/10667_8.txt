After watching Broadway, I watched this movie. I love Broadway music and love the movie. I watched the movie as it did not belong to the Broadway show. I am a respected reader and I have seen what happens in most of the books when turned into a film, so I developed a philosophy really early. The film will be based on the book (or music in this case), but it will not be the same, though it's similar to the storyline, so it will differ and explain what it is. <br /> <br /> I danced 12 years before I made a choice. I'm a good dancer (like a child, etc.), but I was not super-talented. I'm a dance teacher and my trainer (I spent several months in the state farm for several months) and said I should choose when I was 14 years old. weekly days and 7 days a week, 3 hours a day .. or one dedicated. So I love dance and love this movie and many other ballet and dance movies. I just chose why for this movie, it's a great movie about emotion and humanity. When you are really difficult to get what you want and only when you can not get it depends on the power of expectation and heart failure. I love the movie. I love Broadway music.
