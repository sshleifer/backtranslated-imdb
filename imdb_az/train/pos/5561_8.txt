Okay, it does not need to be said, this movie will only appeal to a particular audience; <br /> <br /> In fact, it is mandatory to sell a copy of the head office to everyone who bought the first bone. What is Monty Python's Sacred Heart for geeks and nerds, this film is also for potheads. I've seen this movie for the first time ten years ago and still watch it every time. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <Div> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The film is a collection of different skits; The heroes of the movie wander around their legendary minds around Los Angeles. Nevertheless, the film has a great sense of speed and is never dragged. <br /> <br /> A few days ago, C & C's smoky cartoon was the best thing to do, but I have to say that the Next Movie is outstanding. <br /> <br /> So, laugh at one hour, darken, adjust, and remove your mind =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
