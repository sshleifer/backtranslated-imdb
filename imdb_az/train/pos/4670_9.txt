Those who remembered only the late Sir Peter Ustinovu Hercule Poirot or a professional rapper would be good to look for this charming part of the merciful 60s line. We see Ustinov on the first day of the taxpayer's appointment of a taxpayer who has been detected on the future computers (through real identity theft). a computer expert and an American multinational man. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (in the form of writing) is in the upper shape, like a delightful Maggie Smith, an unusual accident-prone cockney - naked dolly bird. Bob Newhart also exhibits an entertaining performance as a suspect who has designs over Maggie Smith. Additionally, Karl Malden Ustinov and Newhart's femininity chief are sleazy as they agree. <br /> <br /> How much do I love about this movie? Not only a well-thought-out 'kaper film', but also a small love story touching it; Ustinov and Smith are very convincing, as are the two defects against love (the whole scene covering the deck of cards is particularly effective). <br /> So what's not to love? Well, though the scripts believe that the late 60s should know the "big iron" business, most of the movies are not computer literate. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "> </ div> <div style =" text-align: justify; "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
