This film is in many ways "an enemy of the state", together with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, we have an innocent man who has been pursued by "the government" with all the modern technology he calls "human." If a scenario is copied, it usually results in disaster. This is not applicable here. Of course, I love everything David Morse, maybe my comments are not fair, but there were better things about this movie. The main baddy performed by Doug Hutchison was brilliant and the story flowed perfectly with such additives as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), irritated most of them. He was a bad joke, a place where he did not feel embarrassed by the audience. Or, something strange that you do not get started is your kinda (and its followers!). I did not expect much to rent, but I was surprised with a good action movie with comedy bits. 7/10
