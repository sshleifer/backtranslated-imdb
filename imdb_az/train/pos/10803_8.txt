I do not understand. I'm not a critic, I believe, I do not appreciate the quality of the actor who finds a good thing. My confusion is my content. These loyal women justify their curses by fighting and bleeding to ensure the continued freedom of their families and their countries. People should not have a forecast that informs us if they bring him home, and if so, what is their "spouse's" blasphemy? Do these women love to be shot when faced with death or disintegration every day while losing their paramours in a sense of loneliness? They did not consider their husbands at all! Only themselves. Pardon me, except for killing my husband.
