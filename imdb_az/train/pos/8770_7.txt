So I believe in a good way. Not true to life, it is not. The whole thing is thicker, but here it is - Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley and so on. I liked seeing Mike Mazurki - of course, the boxer played, what else? <br /> <br /> Flynn Gentleman is as beautiful as Jim, regardless of whether he is looking at 1 size or resting here, I suppose, but good, this is a cartoon and ask, that's all. Boxing scenes were pretty good, the registration of Ward Bond's viproeville acted as a rule, and it was like seeing all those billboards on stage several times. <br /> <br /> Really fun, Flynn <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus>
