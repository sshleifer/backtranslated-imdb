The Invisible man - a show of love for everyone! This old school recalls the 80th series (a-team, airwolf, knightrider) Special effects are small, but very effective! but most importantly, this is a series of entertainment. Indeed it shows! there seems to be the perfect roles in all roles and they can do everything they want! especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventresca. Ventresca really shines it! it is incredible for me that a very stupid actor is his player style. You do not go to a big movie (mr Tarantino, you have to guide! Instead of this great boring threat (csi) you can show. good value!
