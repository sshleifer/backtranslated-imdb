I'm convinced that this little movie was taken to misfortune despite the fact that it was ridiculous; Sentinel is a clever and inventive fear film that gives most of the day's most valuable dream stories to more than just a job for their money. Michael Winner has repeatedly acknowledged that he is not the best filmmaker of all time, and in some cases he shines with this film; but that the movie worked in spite, and Winner was able to make enough good talent in this regard. The area is rich in mystery and begins with the hunt for Alison Parker and his hunt. He finds that he can not afford the qualities he looks at, but believes his success has changed when he finds a fully equipped housing. His problems begin as soon as they move into action as neighbors do not like ... and this problem increases when the author of the property tells him that he is only one neighbor; an old blind priest on the top floor ... <br /> <br /> The cast list is really superior, relatively unknown Cristina Raines has carried a great deal of support. Chris Sarandon is a small wooden boat in front of Raines, but smaller pieces such as John Carradine, Eli Wallach, Ava Gardner, Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Walken call it a lot more than creating a lifeless image of sarandon. Michael Winner, because the block of flats creates a creepy and surprising atmosphere for the story, he does a good job with the center. The film is a little slower to start, but it's never boring; and Michael Winner's scenario is surprising, and that's a bit deserving. Like very slow, horrible horrors, it does not go for earning money - on the contrary, unlike many, the winner is shocked by all the spectators who are victorious, and the last truly human strangers are right; I say he does a very good job! Generally, this movie can be a clean man if you look at it; Sentinel is one of the best films of his kind and definitely a great sign for his director.
