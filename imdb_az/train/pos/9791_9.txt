I will not give anything except the explanation of this film, and the closest friend and comrade begins with the return of a young woman who committed suicide. It is a detective story that the woman who tried to figure out why her spouse was ending. When it goes on investigating and collecting information, it leads to an inevitable conclusion. The film is progressing in an experimental way, and in particular Talia Sharon, Ya'ara, who acts as a blind woman, is excellent. The Israeli film is definitely age-old and is now fully competing with other foreign films, though it has found a huge audience in the United States.
