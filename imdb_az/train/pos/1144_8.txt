In 1955, England's way was set out with a comedy named Simon and Laura, with Peter Finch and the brilliant Kay Kendall. So far, one of the finest examples of British comedy, and especially about how popular television comics are. <br /> So Soapdish was a movie that I had never heard before when I was late on TV. <br /> <br /> But as I know, the comedy was a challenge to work well, and I was a little skeptical. <br /> <br /> However, I was amazed at watching a very smart satire on American television during the daytime. In fact, it's been a while since I was so laughing. <br /> <br /> <strong> If you love your spouse, it is advisable to see it. <br /> <br /> The main actors? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty? it's just a great job to do, revealing how fast and futile the action is. As you can see, I was thinking of myself: what is the dimness of this ghastly reality in real life? So, do actors have no real life? As you know, Peter Sellers, for example, was notorious to conceal his true identity behind many characters, so nobody really knew the real person. So, when I watched Sally Field play Celeste Talbot's Maggie, I thought before with Kate Kendall playing a play on a television comedy before Laura's Peter Finch from the previous English movie ... <br /> Some actors Are there nervous breakdowns? Celeste eventually crystallized when she was having her daughter (played by Lori, Elizabeth Shue), and emotionally replicates the so-called lines used in the previous episode of the daytime soap when the hero meets her daughter! Are you wrong? <br /> <br /> What is the true meaning of life? <br /> <br /> Indeed, it is not like this, but the dialogue is striking in terms of originality, comedy, bitterness, anger, immorality, duality and even love. There are many stories in this movie, all interwoven and all together at the end (of course, not a Robert Altman movie, okay!), Not all of them are finally solved. Life is not always true, right? The speed is almost naked and you really have to listen and listen carefully to capture all the gags and subtle jokes. Spend 97 minutes of your life and watch it; <br /> <br /> So, from now on, you can avoid any problems. Perhaps the funniest exchanges between Robert Downey and Cathy Moriarty, and for my money, the latter are stealing many scenes, taking my voice as a prominent player. I have not taken you to a newborn, she is fasting a whole new face ...
