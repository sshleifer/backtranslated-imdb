As with "seafarers" in the "seafront", this is far from the classical pupils in terms of music quality and quality of songs, but it has its own charm. Kelly has three great dance rhythms: One with Tom and Jerry on Jerry's fame, with a little girl and a fantasy sequence with a Spanish lover who is determined to reach her lady on the same balcony. Grayson, who serves as Kelly's shy, inexperienced friend Sinatra, as well as love for men, reads most of them. It plays a few beautiful pianos. In about two and a half hours, the light is slightly far from the musical, but not dragged.
