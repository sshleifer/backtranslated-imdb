If I recall, the lyric and brother of Ira Gershwin, George, presented the Gershwin catalog for this film and leaked by the manufacturer. In many ways, the MGM had more than 50 typical movies by Freed Unit, and helped Gene Kelly, driven by Vincente Minelli. <br /> <br /> The Gershines, of course, are all the largest Broadway music groups, but in my opinion, George himself was among the greatest of all American composers! Gene Kelly, of course, was one of the two greatest male dancers in the film industry (someone is similar to that), and I do not think his cast is doubtful. But I think that part of the rest of the story should be explained: Oscar Levant's personality and George Gershwin's true friend should be in this movie. <br /> <br /> He is a talented pianist and even a mid-level talented composer, as well as the mentioned neurological and hypochondrias, and as always plays a role here. <br /> <br /> Leslie Caron was unknown at this time, and he is the French "gamine" type. A talented dancer has never been a beautiful thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> George Guétary, who plays part of Maurice Cavaleri, is Henri Baurel's Greek and French, Even though some of them are very young, the gene's hoofer may serve here, but Guétary has better vocal equipment. Although Gene was somewhere in a better place, perhaps even more than his character, "Singing in the Rain", shows himself to be something of a healer (He is not for nothing, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> But the film's goal is to create a long ballet based on artistic music in the end of the film, great French impressionist artists. <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Gene and Oscar I find it hard to believe in the struggling artists, and I do not think it might be like music. Gershwin's music works well in this movie. <br /> <br /> The DVD is beautifully handled well with graphics and mono sound is good, q slightly neat.
