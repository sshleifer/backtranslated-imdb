This is a story of the Winchester Rifle Model, 1873, entitled "Gunning the West". A man, a smuggler, a peace officer, or a soldier, Winchester 73 owned a treasure. <br /> <br /> Winchester is the first of its founders among 73 directors Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. new, psychological depth of the genre. Steward sees the story behind a man who killed his father like Lin McAdam. Lynn, with Dodge City's trusted friend Johnny Williams (Millard Mitchell), comes to the Dutchman Henry Brown (Stephen McNally). However, Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) can take all the weapons from entering the city, and they will not be able to shoot at all. On the contrary, men who compete for winning the Winchester 73 rifle win Lin's success. However, as the Dutchman can not leave the city with a perfect prize, the Dutch are striking it, stealing rifles and throwing them into the city rapidly. <br /> <br /> Lin, as well as the man and the rifle of the rifle, followed by the hijacking of the rifle several times, each time adds an extra dimension as a calculation day for each approach. The criterion for the so-called "psychological West", Winchester 73, is a story of a worthy man who manages unlimited intelligence with an event in the past. Tho shot shot in black and white (landscapes, which are just one of the units, are still breathtaking for the eyes). Tony enjoyed a hill at the horse scene, such as Lin and Johnny, on the silhouette, on a hill while on the way to Dodge City. <br /> <br /> The US State Department spokesman said the former Mann Prince of the United States is one of America's best and most versatile actors. Casting support is not too bad. Shelley Winters is perfect as the only woman in machismo, Mitchell, McNally, Geer and always adds an extra class to the great Dan Duryea processes. There are even parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, even the last far-reaching extension of India's courage. <br /> <br /> The first film was prepared for Fritz Lang, even the script was ready to run away. But Lang ran away and blessed Western supporters. Under Mann's guidance, Borden Chase & Robert Richards set the wheels to change the genre's course, as it is a bigger director. Not only by the efforts made by Mann & Stewart, but also with the ones affected. <br /> <br /> Budd Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller's acclaims drew all the notes and surprised western parrots and further moved their psychological torch. <br /> <br /> A great hit in the cassette The Winchester 73, released today, is a magnificent movie that has yet to collect fist pens. 9.5 / 10
