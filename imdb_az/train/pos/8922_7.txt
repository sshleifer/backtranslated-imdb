One of the most remarkable things about this film was the role that Steve McQueen played in the first major role. <br /> <br /> McQueen's ability is enhanced and crude, but it's refreshingly honest in a small, fantastic, horrifying part of the camp. <br /> <br /> Then, McQueen said he hated this movie and said "he hated this movie," Steve said, "anti-blob, which would become a polished symbol of the film industry." But everyone should start somewhere and The Blob is sweet, fresh, and innocent. <br /> <br /> It's really fun to see Steve McQueen before becoming King Kool (and Anita Corsaut) before Andy Taylor's girlfriend. has sent me back to the DVD for a while and is a valuable addition to my Steve McQueen movie collection.
