This is a very entertaining movie. Several reviews I have read on this forum are written by people who think that the movie is a serious drama effort. THERE IS NO RELIGION .... This is an extremely enjoyable movie played in a tongue. All the actors are entertaining when entertaining us. The sequence of the struggle is vibrant, fast and, above all, indispensable. It is not "terrible" as I read a review called "Green Death", which was used several times. Several reviewers were critical of the battle of martial arts between Doc and Sea near the end of the film. Hey, illuminate ... Again I remind you that this is a fun movie. Each stage of this "fight" took place and was added to the fun. The actors did not try to imitate Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan. This is not one of the martial arts films. Ron Ely looks great in this movie and Doc is the perfect choice to play. Another pleasant touch is a unique way of dealing with the last fate of "bad man" (Seas). I promise you that you will not try to take this movie seriously and you will spend 100 minutes in the happiest, if you just look at the entertainment value.
