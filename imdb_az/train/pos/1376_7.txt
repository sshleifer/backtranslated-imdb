It is a translation of Claude Monet's as it should be, but it is actually an event in the French synchronized swimming team about three teenage girls. <br /> <br /> Pauline Aquart: "There is nothing that I invite." the youngest, only wants to join the team that is so admired. He is looking alone. It is still far from juvenile growth and has long, bony legs, big feet and no derivatives to speak. She drew these full lips with prognathous and sporting. <br /> <br /> Adele Haenel is a bigger, better, physically developed one. An attractive figure cut off her grape suit, shouting long hair hairstyle, grieving her boys. But it is not as it seems. Or is it I thought a lot. The French are in paradox for a long time and sequence. <br /> <br /> Luis Blacheri's character has many uncertainties. He's in the team, but he's dumpy and straight, and it's sensitive about it and there's a tight shock on Francois. Blachere adds to the character's character with a good actress and his performance. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the relationships between these three meanings of intrigue, deception, secret feelings, and everything else. to associate with young girls who often spend time with each other. This is of course a challenging topic. It is cunning in the gradual development of homoerotic relations between Pauline and Adele. Do not expect it to be a mild porn movie. <br /> <br /> In some cases, in many cases, in many cases <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Adele is a girl who is envied by others, and she is quite distant and happy about her. Moreover, he sees every boy and man in a clear fashion, if they are able to use it in any way, from a gorgeous, but terrible Francois to a bus driver, unusually impressed by his experience in the change, as well as joining Paul's swimming team Adele looks at her during the appointments with the children, but you know it is a pretty and self-styled narcissist, but then the unwashed prostitute takes Pauline under her wing and Pauline is still a virgin. Adele finally starting to get closer to their children, admits he wants to save himself and Pauline wants to do it for him. Pauline, now sexually asserted to Adele, is delighted to do his job. Now, Adele really wanted to get one, the older one and the more experienced. So he takes Pauline to a weld and dances with a boy until Pauline goes to the dusty room. Two girls look at each other and do not expressly express their interest in sex. But Adele is approaching, so Paul's slowly keeps himself in his arms, and Adele kisses her lips. <br /> <br /> Adele is back, she smiles and says, "Now it was not that bad?" Then she goes to the club. <br /> <br /> Among Pauline and Adele - but what is hell? Adele first sees Paul as a close friend, as a potential lover, as an irreverent child and responds to Pauline, Adele. How does Pauline use those men? Now, is Adele forced to know that he has another person in forced bondage? I dont know. <br /> <br /> As a third member, I have deceived Louise Blachere, but her statement is always dumbfoundedness but at least thoroughly heterosexual and first <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Military operations against the people in the Caucasus continue. Anyway. (Compare only to typical American movies about middle school boys.) For men, some have not penetrated the female mystics, and it can give an idea as if seen in the middle shot.
