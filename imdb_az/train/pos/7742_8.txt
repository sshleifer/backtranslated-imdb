Strong actors such as Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward are united to win this contemporary film. <br /> <br /> Patrick is an old boxer and a mentally ill person in this shirt. Wow, this is just for an interesting guy! He looks thirsty, but he is not. Ward is a rebellious, seductive, charming, intelligent, and compassionate enthusiasm of the worst abduction plan. Bruce Dern is also in the mixed and Dern never fascinated with any movie. <br /> <br /> The film may be considered a downward hit, but I find it attractive ... and I do not like movies that normally feature films. What I found was a kind of quirky crime movie. Take a look and do not see the agreement. It's just a good story and a good job, it's a very uncertain movie that should not have this status.
