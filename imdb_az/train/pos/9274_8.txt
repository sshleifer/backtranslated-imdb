For decades, pressure from radical regimes has not been a problem in creating a fictional theme for another fantastic film from one country. Panahi receives a different approach this time with a reactionary comedy and a favorite, non-professional player mix. While facing the message he still sees as his natural mistake with his country, he does it without the need for a heavy story. We look at a country, especially its people, that the people of Iran need it. Unfortunately, it will not be released within the country. Insular, paranoid The Iranian government claims that this good-looking filmmaker is only successful in foreign countries because it is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them. Artists who have grown up in the course of the revolution and who are following the scientists, are showing great enthusiasm for continuing their work, not 'artisans' who have been trained over the last 25 years. In fact, the realism that has been achieved by shooting at the World Cup qualifier is actually taking you to the event. The truth of 35mm would be great for this project to use only one digital format. It looks fantastic. It is really working in this movie with the insistence that only non-professional actors use. Good speeches at all times. After watching many films showing Iran's problems, we have to push the people and the government to the government as well as the media outlets explaining the facts. This is not the opposite. They still love the same things and are not too far from the absurd rules of the Shari'ah laws, which can be laughable and make a better change. Some feminist filmmakers call Panahi, but I think he is only fighting for the most depressed demographics in Iran. Young, independent women.
