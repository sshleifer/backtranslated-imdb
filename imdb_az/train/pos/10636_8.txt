<br /> <br /> This story is a complicated and beautiful story of the last Haram of the Ottoman Empire, well illustrated, and now sees the inner world of a world and learns the people living there. <br /> <br /> The story, heroes, players and scenes delighted. <br /> <br /> Many scenes that have been said to have failed to do a fantastic job have been made quickly by the main character, Safia Marie Gillain, and sub titles have sometimes disappeared very soon. By doing so. The scenes with him and Alex Descas (Nadir) are charming and charming. <br /> <br /> I come to this movie for anyone who wants Hollywood and more to watch the world more.
