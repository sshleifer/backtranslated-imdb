Being respectful, I think that everything is good in this movie, there is no reason to go to the theaters, the film is awesome when fx is awesome, There are a few boring moments. The story was a very good movie, after a little girl, but all of them thought it would give me the necessary details one day. The first part of the film went directly to a video where they killed a little boy, the story was based on a little girl and mother who visited her mother who was transferred to become a writer, her property was sold to the Witch (Gear Fairy), where everyone lives, If you want to see this movie, it will be a great danger if you do not really want to give something far away then it is worth the rent price
