Dirty Harry has to explain the revenge that killed the criminals before killing the victims of aggression. Perhaps a more attractive punishment will survive the first time and suffer eternally as well as her and her sister. Anyway ..... A story that resumed in San Francisco and Santa Cruz. The chief aggressor who was played by Andy Drake is, of course, bad and will eventually be fined (of course!). Not a classic movie, but better than others, except for the original Dirty Harri.
