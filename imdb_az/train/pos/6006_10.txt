I saw it as a child, answered all my questions and left any fears or misconceptions that I had. This animated film is unrereatening, because it's easy to watch. There is no moral approach or "prehistoric" aspects, so nobody should object. It's just an unpleasant film that gives you the facts of menstruation. I hope to show my daughter.
