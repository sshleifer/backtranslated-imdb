This is one of those films, like Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero. Light film rarely earns Oscars, but Kim Sabundu cast, and deserves one. It's still nice to watch how the different spheres are developed after seeing the movie and coming in. True, all dramas are melodramas; but it is fully fit for a movie in the background of a soap opera. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Why can not I write something like this now?" Unfortunately, television and web censors require all these unnecessary sanitation.
