For the first time I saw this documentary released in 2001 and really had a great impact on me, so many of my friends were forced to see me through repeated demonstrations. Bottom line: none of my friends are sad (never!). This perfect film, using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.), creates absolutely fine sheets, and is the temporary state of everything about the Scottish concept artist Andy Goldsworthy to create pieces that can eventually return to its natural form? Goldsworthy, along with its temporary artwork, has created several other large galaxies in the world, along with long-term facilities. German film director Thomas Riedelsheimer leads photographs and makes this meditation a creative process, both in the eyes and on the ear (music music scored by Fred Frith, music is generally a highly empirical / noisy techno-guitar, and musicians a skilled ensemble). Although this movie is available on DVDs for a few years, if you find a movie that emphasizes the revival of this beautiful movie, look for it (a great movie screen for a big screen is enough sound to live right in this movie). There is no MPAA rating, but there is nothing to betray (insulting or worrying when a sheep is born on the screen)
