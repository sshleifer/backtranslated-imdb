The first truth about the Shinjuku Triad Society was not like the movie Miike, and I thought that such an idea could be cliché. But like all the clichés, this is based on the truth. All Miike trademarks here are hard to compromise with violence, black humor, homosexuality, taboo test, and central character. Shinjuku is one of Miike's most beautiful films. In an interview he says that if he changed it again, it would be different, but not better. I do not know if the film really has an attractive energy and raw edge that it may look so fresh that it is better than a sophisticated or technically complicated film, but it's better than duplicating or refinishing it . <br /> <br /> As expected, violence is entirely violent, and bloodshed and strange beatings are accomplished with a fantastic scene in which a woman is facing a cage. (Only one Miike movie can allow such a sentence.) The film has fantastic speeds and remains unchanged from the start or end of the Dead or Alive. Dead or Alive is dealing with similar issues, and Miike clearly disturbs the relationship between Japanese and Chinese in the post-war era, and this emotional theme is well understood here, and when you understand its past, the central character really is alive. <br /> <br /> The definition of Shinjuk is enough. I do not want to go too far. Before beginning to use CGI to revive his films, Miike remembers something like Kitano Sonatine. The middle symbols are superbly executed and you will begin to create it again, even though the ending film ends.
