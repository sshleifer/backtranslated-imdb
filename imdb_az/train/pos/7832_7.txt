Finally, I would like to see this movie in a movie theater. I saw Fritz Lang a few years ago. <strong> <p> <font color = red> <br /> <br /> Terms are perfect at Cinematheque Ontario. Cut printing full length. An English translation of the symbolic, original Gothic-script intertitles in English, precisely without much unread. Live piano accompaniment. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The film's magic sputtered for a while, but eventually failed to catch at least for me. <br /> <br /> I knew this movie had nothing to do with Wagner's Ring, but some could not. Wagner suits the 13th. Niebelungen for their own purposes. Fritz Lang is part of the epic - "Siegfried" - but there are many things to get to know Wagner's listeners. Kriemhild's Revenge, Siegfried's wife, Kriemhild, King Etzel (Attila), who wanted revenge on Hun and Xijn and Günter, Nibelungs, again killed Siegfried. The magnificent confusion in this film is probably expanded and expanded in the Wagnerian myth to the end of the Gothterdämmerung, the Liquor of God and the end of Valhalla. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is spectacular. The Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916) has many rivals, "Cabiria" (1914). Their decorations set a new dimension in honor of barbarism. Angry, Enchanted Huns and Art Deco have a huge cast of Burgundians. And battles. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild succeeds in suicide. He tries to destroy everything around him. The devotion to the martyr, Siegfried, will not depend on love or loyalty, but on something close to psychosis. Lady Macbeth drowned, "You're here, leave me alone!" He knew that he was emotionally unprepared for what he had to do. But Kriemhild does not reflect any normal human emotions, and, of course, it is equal to the principle of femininity. He was "filled with the greatest tyranny" to owe Shekspir's promise. Margarethe Schön and his director make it glow. I do not want to exaggerate, but this shimmering is the only expression for Kriemhild's face to "revive". This is the last one in recorded speeches. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, the number of people called up for military service is a bit higher. Some see Kriemhild as a powerful hero. Only see the film as a religion.
