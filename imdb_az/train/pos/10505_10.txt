Yes, that's right. I am sure that the N64 and the strange-looking controller were also designed to make this game available. The first time I saw it, its great environment and colorful characters, and now it's incredible. Game control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful and always have the Nintendo charm, which is a somewhat inaccessible place to be denied. A must have for every N64 owner and one reason to get N64 for everyone.
