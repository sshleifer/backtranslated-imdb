With mixed reviews, I did not expect so much, and I was pleasantly surprised. These exciting heroes, perfect portraits, writing without hesitation, and a very fun little crime movie with a good pace. Funky looks good also. As you can see, people either love this movie or hate it, and I'm the one who loves it.
