The first and second seasons started with jolts, episodes of good episodes among the mid-episodes, and occasionally kliched stories. But once he began to build the universe, and when he began to develop more characters, he became more fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main reason for this show is four people: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry feeling is much better, and Peter's leadership is excellent and makes any episode more fun, and Joe and Paul will never succeed in creating a comic, exciting episode. <br /> <br /> After you understand what the show is, you will recognize the characters, and I suspect you will not like the show. I suggest the episodes of 'The Other Side', a good episode and 'Window', a classic comic relief episode for those participating in the show.
