Samuel Fuller, this entertaining, bare story, brings himself astonishing and chic, and is able to create one of the uncovered stones of the 1950s cinema. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark is a tiny guy who plays a tough guy's walk on the New York subway station, and a series of films that featured a young woman's (Jean Peters) wallet and many talented microfilm pieces. This is 1953, so the microfilm is the property of the Commie spies, and nothing to stop you back. When the girl is seen by Widmark's water pipe, sent by a funny lover, Vidmark gives her and her "comrades" a great deal of money. <br /> <br /> Fuller sees the love of love in an irritable way, but it gives a feeling of insecurity than bad writing or direction. He was a love story during the period of violence, and so deliberately incredible. Love stories were often in Hollywood movies. Peters delivers a stunning performance like a New Yawk cookie, a piece of gangster moll and a strange part. When subjected to violence against him, we are really paying attention to his goodness, and a happy ending is not necessarily a prejudice that Fuller denied. <br /> <br /> The main success of The Pickle in South Six is ​​that of Thelma Ritter, a playwright, stands in the tired shoulders all over the world, and she is a lady who can earn any money like a tie-up or police inspector . Ritter gives his career performance; In a breathtaking monologue, he never feels the need to speak to his sad trajectory of his life and to wake up to the world of struggle, crime, and troubles every morning. Each night of the night, Ritter united before the moment to empathize with all the emotions that he had not been able to venture into other films. The stage is to emphasize the film, era of the Fuller film and the 50's. <br /> Level: A +
