This film has scenes that come to me in the most delicate moments - there is a spectacular scene with Mr. Muckerji that tells Ms. Melandeze that someone who is chatting with someone shows that the girl is pushing the window through an image of a woman fitted to her image - - From Greece's emphasis on "Mr. Muckerji" - and then when he sees that Boyer puts his poison on his head, he dies - it's a taste! "Fools - Fools - all my life" ... and so on. - you get the point ... I need to get it. I love Dan Seymour - he is usually a sophisticated foreign sultan or a police chief, and comes out in many beautiful pictures of Casablanca.
