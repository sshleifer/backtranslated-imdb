I do not know, I'm not strange, but I like this movie very much. <br /> <br /> The return of the lake back to the lake, of course, is after the lake of Lake, one of my favorite films. Actually, I think this movie is more than just a first one. I also thought that the shooting in this movie is great, Judd Nelson is always good! I also liked the whole area. This second film was delighted to have Stanley direct to Stanley's filmmaking - this is not a totally unnecessary film by strangling Stanley's other girls. - If you are looking for some deep meaning, this movie is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for an entertaining way to spend two hours, keep going and watching. Perhaps I've been filming this movie for at least ten hours. :)
