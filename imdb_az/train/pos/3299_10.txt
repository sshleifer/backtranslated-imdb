A great movie that requires a taste. If you go into action, you are deliberately and hate your favorite stories, but not for you. Otherwise, if I want to sit in front of a good smart movie, I now recommend it at a very high level. The best film produced in Bollywood this century is easily. <br /> <br /> Another Indian movie that I'll give 10/10 is Language Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then this kingdom comes second.
