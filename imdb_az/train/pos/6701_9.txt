I really liked the first 2 seasons. because many good characters then disappeared. Most shows are primarily slower, and then better in the seasons, but this is definitely the opposite. Jenny from the 1st season and friends of Valarie Sabrina from the 2nd season, I really did not care about others, jenny and Valarie were his best friend. I think for some reason, our producers do not want us to love our college friends for some reason and that they are very cruel to Sabrina. but my favorite episode, cat showdown and favorite season episode from season 1 is witch garbage, meaning the funniest episode. I was thinking about how popular Libby was, but always Sabrina was jealous and did not look like a real boyfriend, but always wanted to be with Harvey. I just wished we could do the better ones. During the opening credits of the first 2 seasons, I liked the fact that Sabrina would say a few words while wearing a suit, and as I was in a pilot episode in a magic suit I said, "It's not me" and then I think it's trying to do something else, but it's really nice a show. it's like a charming griffit show, because it's good at first, but it's good after color and barney fife. but I still want to watch, but then the only reason behind the season is the patience. What would I say about the sequence of opening: The opening names of the season 1-3 show Sabrina in front of a mirror with different suits and outfits because the names of cast members at the bottom of the screen are quickly illuminated. In the end, Sabrina would have been punished with a permanent article and then disappeared. the fourth opening sequence of the season, contains characters from the bubbles. Sabrina features various locations around Boston in opening credits at season 5-7
