Stacking Story: It's another review for me, and it's still one of the most popular Amicus anthologies and though I know how senseless a movie might be for some, it's so easy to see why; I doubt, of course, the choice of director Peter Duffell - Death and Maiden (this is a classic piece by Schubert, which is featured in Peter Kushing's episode). Even though the connectivity itself is not all that great, the episodes are equally attractive and pleasant. Because Duffelin is very valuable to the budget, production values ​​have emerged. The latter film has such a non-kinematic style and undoubtedly regrets that it is desirable to remove itself from the genre (more typecast, rather than) <br /> <br /> Individual stories now concern themselves: <br / > <br /> <br /> "Murder Method": The opening segment does not offer any real surprise, preparing for it is a quiet and sometimes heartfelt thing (Tom Adams is looking for Boris Karloff's long brother's brother as "Old DARK HOUSE" [1932] ); also ends with a DIABOLIQUE-type twist and plays a rather dense role in Denholm Elliott's leadership. Waxworks: For the second story, we offer a very unusual charming romantic mood for this kind of movie; Peter Cushing and Joss Ackland also have a good (both flawlessly dressed) roles in a two-color lover of a woman who has long been involved in protecting such things, and the friendship rivalry only benefits them in blindly and dangerously; The deadly hallucination scene with Peter Cushing is good enough considering limited resources and Ackland's inaccessibility or unwillingness to go beyond the city, Bunel's FIRST SPECIAL ANGEL (1962)> "Sweets to Sweets: it is perhaps the best story of all - here, in its indefinite role, Christopher Lee continues to demonstrate his versatility, and he is compatible with Nyree Dawn Porter and Chloe's deceptive crime, Franks (as Lee's daughter). The secret film here is thin and powerful, with a strong and extremely cold 'curtain'. Trivia Note: Chloe Franks looks like a grown-up person on the disk and when I see him, I immediately gave him a sense of familiarity, but he did not put it on my finger. Later, when I read his filmography, I was told that he played one of London's long-term adaptation of The Mousetrap at West End in London. This is my brother and I am fortunate enough to catch up with me. We are on vacation in the summer of 2002! There was no doubt that at one time he had created such a delicate and surprising, surprising idea, because of his personal appearance and devil's smile! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <strong> Cinema and Christopher Lee at one point !; John Pertwee is surprised to see the camp horror starter, who has more than just the bargain while trying to bring a true dimension to his work; Ingrid Pitt sends a beautiful look, though his role is somewhat connected to the performance; Geoffrey Bayldon (also designed to look like Ernest Thesiger) also has a memorable quirky bits; "silent cinema" style was quite brave enough to attract the audience - and, despite the fact that some humor slipped into a period of heavy loss, "FALLI VAMPIRE KILLER" (1967) or THEATER BLOOD (1973), it is very contagious finishes with a high-definition (and quite unusual) recording! <br /> <br /> Video and audio quality is relatively satisfactory. The main culprit is some stunning print hits, but it's never too bad to avoid the use of this movie. As for the extras, starting with Audio Review: Obviously, this is one of the best conversations about a genre movie that can keep me in touch; Jonathan Rigby thinks more about the moderator, but his effort allows Peter Duffel to touch every aspect of the production (there is nothing else you can do with some movies!). ) and, therefore, is an extremely enjoyable way of completing the essential features in a really good way. A-Rated Horror Film is a worthwhile effort at the central stage with Peter Duffell, but this time also producer Max J. Rosenberg and star Chloe Franks, Ingrid Pitt and Geoffrey Bayldon. We also get a movie poster, glance, bios and a nice poster / galleries gallery (modern look is something new and welcoming).
