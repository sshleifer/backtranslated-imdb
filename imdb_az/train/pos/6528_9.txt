I saw this documentary in Cannes Film Festival at a small 200-person movie theater at the top of the main building in Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I did it completely. I love the blend of beautiful heroic scenes. Beautiful design set. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Documentary tells about the awesome Blues men's black-and-white old-fashioned scenes of black man's guitar and singing. This is really nice. But it also mixes with new bands, and maybe this documentary did not like something. These blues are often used in contemporary contemporary rock bands. I have not evaluated their way through the buggy to play the unique Blues songs. This is like the great music taste I've seen while watching Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club. <br /> <br /> The film was a documentary on this first show in a small movie. this documentary was shown to everyone on the Croisette beach and outdoor tourists in the open air theater. Although sand, the quality of the projection and the sound quality would be bad, it could not have been enjoyed by thousands of people sitting in the sand at that night.
