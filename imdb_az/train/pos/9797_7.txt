Batman: The secret of Batwoman is the video / DVD movie released from Batman, the latest live animated film. <br /> <br /> Batwoman, a new offender in the Caucasus, was personally involved, for any reason, when he stopped sending a large gun. <br /> <br /> Although the film is quite interesting, it's not as good as the "Phantasm mask", "Sub-zero" or "Joker's return". The main reason is that it does not eliminate the emotional appeal of other films. At the end of this film, we're not grieving to anyone, especially as we did to Sub-Zero. Other animated films do not have a real tragedy that we have special. Even Batwoman is not really a "tragic" character (Mr Freeze or Phantasm). The Batter's alter ego is just a 'tough' lip that looks like Batwoman's alte ego, which is why the audience caused it to be masked, or what's happening at the end, and that's the main reason. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, found. The audience has moments as Batwoman really is who he is and when he sees an old slavery back in the 'Batman: The Animated Series'. <br /> <br /> If Batvimin's back is more interesting, this movie would be better than in my book "Joker's Return," but as it is now, the "New Batman Adventures" cartoon From the middle of the 1990s. The score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated movie Batman, but still good. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD, because it's a pleasure despite its flaws. But keep in mind, it's not as good as other Batman animated films. <br /> <br /> 7/10
