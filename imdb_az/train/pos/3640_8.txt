This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid is in the act of a man who rescues his desire to become a baseball cube when he gives him his arm and is convincing. As a high school coach, he is struggling to win a championship title by saying he will try for a baseball team. They win (for all the exercises with a coach who can go partially over 90 km / h) and he / she keeps the bargain and signs it! <br /> <br /> If you decide to try something new and terrible just as adults, Jim Morris's story will resonate with you. It's moving and inspiring, and human relationships are real. <br /> <br /> But this is just one thing. Dennis Quaid is just an open-minded thing and a beautiful looking baseball movie that changes a gland, paradise is my idea. Ladies, if you feel your way, check it out.
