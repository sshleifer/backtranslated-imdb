Curly Sue with a 6-year-old haired hair and a thrilling life. He and his father Bill (Jim Belushi) are trying to live on the streets thanks to their little craftsmen on the streets. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in an expensive car park when Curly's screams about suicide and brawl for alleged victim. Gray (Kelly Lynch) is a very high-level advocate. Not only do scammers earn some money, they get to spend the night in Gray's plush apartment. Later, Gray feels that he owes them more, and three of them depend on a magic. Gray does not know anything about lucrative law and life. Who better than Bill and Curly, to teach these brilliant experts about the realities of life? But all good things have to end, and there is no legitimate expert and few people's lives. Or are you? This is an unexpected sweet and funny movie. Curly is, of course, entertaining as Shirley Temple, but of course quite edgier. Belushi provides a rare touch-up as part of its failure and Lynch is snooty but brilliant as a soft touch lawyer. Writer and director John Hughes shows us a magic touch once more for the screenplay to be live and unexpected. Just go Curly and Bill one night, get out of Gray with no money and watch the humorous results. Do I wish you a happy ending, a long time, and finally delivery, among a few indefinite moments? This is your ordered movie.
