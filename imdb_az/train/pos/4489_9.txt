This movie is not a cat and mouse fight as shown in another statement. She lives on the cat that uses 8 out of her 9 lives and now lives in fear of losing the latter. The cat is always afraid of dying and is afraid, so the name of the "terrible cat". Fraidy Cat's previous life is followed by a different period from which he is trying to kill him, but the number one is represented as a cloud of 9 and the most feared of his ninth life, which sparks his light. It's too old, but it's still fun for kids when you're back up. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie every day as a child: o)
