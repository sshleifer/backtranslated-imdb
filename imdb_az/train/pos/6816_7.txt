I did not like the movie of this family and liked it, though I'm not a child. Susan (Elisha Cuthbert), based on the concept of a girl of a high school, is convinced that a key chain key from an elevator in a top class building has turned into a machine from time to time when the elevator locks back. . <br /> <br /> Film shoots are taking into account some uncertainties regarding the time of day. <br /> <br /> The film is not a science fiction science. You should not see the paradox of ordinary instability associated with changing the past with the time travel, that is, in the past 1881 Walker's family has been changed to prevent the poverty, but the change never comes from the family's financial problems. Susan's mother talked about financial problems, meaning that Susan's past did not change her mind first! But there is also a few nice touches inside the story as an old elevator panel, which is hidden in the apartment of a woman who has invented a secret and builds a time machine, and has no space for a lock that activates the time machine feature. As with many stories for kids, we also will not share amazing information about a time travel device with a parent or other adult, but should instead think of hiding when a traveler? Some scenic scenes and speeches occurring. (Elisha Cuthbert, Gabrielle Boni, and Matthew Port) were very convincing. In a scene of the 1300s, local Americans watched them and photographed them. But in the instant look of this blond, the white mud girl did not be surprised in her unique dress. Their reaction is simply to stop what they are doing and to go quietly in the direction of Susan. On the same stage, an Indian mother carries what needs to be a baby, but obviously a puppet (she is white and scratched around her head). <br /> <br /> First of all, Timothy Busfield, a prize-winning actor, gets a reputation in the old "Thirty-Thousand Union" TV, a bit uninteresting and sometimes unforgettable. Other extreme Michel Perron, like the Italian building manager (janitor), also plays Richard Jutras in a strange neighborhood. </ strong> </ strong> <br /> </ strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> In spite of these conflicts, I am a movie for children. Along with the exciting story, there is also a number of educational costs, but also shows that technology and social norms have changed for less than 100 years.
