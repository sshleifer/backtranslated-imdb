It's a very dramatic and suspense film. There are many areas and species. The story or the director opens question marks on the order of death or involves the crimes committed by the black people. This movie is well managed by Arne Glimcher and James Newton Howard's sounds are very good. Sean Connery and Ed Harris's powerful performance. If you like it, do not miss "Birth of Crimes" or "HURRIKAN". My wife and I gave it 8/10.
