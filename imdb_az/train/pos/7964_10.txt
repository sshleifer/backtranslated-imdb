Although I really love dogs, I am glad that I love this movie very much. Fox, Field, and Ameche Chance, Sassy and Shadow, and the animals themselves are just beautiful. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie 72 times (I know it is scary, but it's true!) and the scenes that end up every time still get me. I advise people of all ages, and especially animal lovers. This is really my favorite movie of all time!
