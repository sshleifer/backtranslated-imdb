Five Deadly Venoms are bloody and not severe as Ricky or Super Ninjas Story, but Hong Kong makes some of the best hand-to-hand combat sequences in film history. Director Chang Chex creates most of his acceptance as his masterpiece. This film launches a career of five people who play poachers. Meng Lo plays another bad donkey. He would continue to be Super Ninjas. Philip Kwok will continue for Kuo Chui, Ricky's Story and Hard Cooked. Any adorable admirer can apply it. But I still think it's not as good as Super Ninjas (also by Chang Cheh). But the whole socky chop is good and this is one of the best.
