Together with Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston combines one of the funniest movies of the 2003 season (by the end of May) and the most horrible and personal memories of Carrey's past comedies. With Carrey's still up toned down with just the old self zap and the Carrey antics with the jacket, Carrey resolutely decides the laughter of this movie and some dramatic, tearful noisy moments. Elements of jim's true ability continue to appear in this film. This beautiful summer adventure, along with heroic moments that perfectly matches with this script, strikes most of the buttons, including dramatic elements. While still incomplete in the beautifully polished ensemble of comedy / drama, Bruce deserves a credit to become a great film of history and deserves a parody of such a message and gentle moral cynicism and good-natured taste. Eight people from ten stars.
