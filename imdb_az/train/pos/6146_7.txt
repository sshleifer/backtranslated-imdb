Maybe Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins but this was a very different story and Angela was happy, while a great singer for the great Julie Andrews. Lansburi said it was a perfect toy and a magical performance. There is something very unpleasant about his character and he's been given great support by David Tomlinson. Tomilinson has a melody, but she's not as much as a singer. It was such a gift actor that you did not notice very little. Most popular stars, like Roddy McDowel, give more than one-time favorite stars, a winning performance and very little-known Tessie OShea. It's great to see Sam Jaffe and Bruce Forsythe, the King of the British TV, in smaller roles. There are some nice songs in the account, especially sea and unbelievable age. Portabello's highway runs to the harbor, but has lots of theatricality. The effects are a bit stupid today, but the scene with the German invaders who attacked by the film's most brutal army is quite impressive. Children are not as annoying as other films, but are struggling to understand what the youngest man has to say. I liked the rally of the home army. The guardian at home was very important to the British and it was a warm welcome. Animation is unpleasant, better than Pixar, and I find something so strange. A sincere happy movie and a miracle performed on the stage.
