This is one of the best films I've ever seen. It makes me feel like a roller-coaster. I'm laughing, crying, hating, happy and loving! All in less than two hours! <br /> <br /> All actors are brilliant! Of course, I need to speak to leading actor Michael Nyquist. He does something remarkable! I also love the actor playing Tore, who is so convincingly involved in this mentally challenging young boy! Gilbert's grape reminded Leonardo di Caprios roll! <br /> <br /> Therefore, I recommend this to everyone to see and enjoy.
