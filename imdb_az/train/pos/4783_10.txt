Straight Story is a really good movie about an old man named Alvin Straight. But this is a major synapse ... This is a lot more than this movie. This was the last role played by Richard before he died, and he is definitely something to remember. He is a stubborn old man, but unlike many older men, you and I know. <br /> <br /> Straight Story is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives. If you have at least one heart, it will be and will touch some of you.
