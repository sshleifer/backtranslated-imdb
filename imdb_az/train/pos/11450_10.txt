This movie is strikingly beautiful. Goldsworthy's art is really the most beautiful, moving and changing-looking, and actually benefits the movie's profits. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone. I can think of something else to say about it. This is the kind of movie you have to see, because it has the ability to see and refresh me when leaving the theater.
