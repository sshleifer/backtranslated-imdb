Almost every line and every character flawless, there are few comedies like this. It's soooo funny! And there are many satirists there. Sally Field is truly a leader in the field of prominent actors and does not do a good, perfect job with the television diva during the daytime. Sometimes his activity is only slightly wider and higher, but 90% is rebellious! In the same league, Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr and Whoopy Goldberg (unfortunately, there are so many things here). Downey Jr can not completely agree with a comedian and is always wrong but fights with the most ungrateful part of being honest. But here's a shining star, Cathy Moriarty like Celeste, if you are a badly secret person (you'll see the real stunning final!) The real bitch. Unfortunately, Elisabeth Shue never looks comfortable on his part. I normally love Ms Shue, but here it is like a fish, and sometimes it seems to be in a different movie. But this is not a harmful thing and at least it is at least adequate. Otherwise, scrolling through memorable lines and situations is a comedy for watching on television or anywhere.
