I do not love this movie as anyone else. Once again, the noteworthy dialogue that will try to explain for its virtues of uninitiated, but at the moment there are a few pieces of note, probably all the cheek tongue. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "<br /> <br /> <br /> (Another song lyrical) "All the cotton is bastards, whisper, or bad, and England is an e-hole in the universe." <br /> <br /> (An "arty program" during a television interview): Mr. Mackenzie (Barry replies) Flamin 'bull artists! <br /> <br /> (when talking to a naive young girl): Mr. Mackenzie, are my Aboriginal slaves in Australia? (Barry replied) Abos? In my life I have never seen Abo. <br /> <br /> This is a taste of the busser Aussie's sad flick, you can take a copy of it, look and enjoy.
