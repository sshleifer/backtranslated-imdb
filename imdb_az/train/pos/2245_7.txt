Salva and her eldest son, Bigardo, were in the margin of law in most of their lives. To forgive them, we see that the pitch is panhandling in underground cars, and it does not give them anything! A hardened criminal, Salva, does not have any free-of-charge quality, which means he will do what he can to a reality show on television. Religious and show business is something that Salva is capitalized. <br /> <br /> He and his son, Bigardo, are in jail following the death of a cousin who criticizes the couple. Salva shows that the reality is something natural to the show. It turns into a person like Christ, who instantly succeeds in the program. Espe, a quiet woman who is a show producer, Salva can not escape her unusual attention. In the end, Salva is the victim of her success. <br /> <br /> Jordi Molla, the first directorial director of this film, has succeeded in bringing the film's role to the market. Spain, sensitive to such programs, has seen the strange part of the director's imagination being attacked by the public and wants to set his story in terms of people who connect people. <br /> <br /> The ensemble's film has some good moments. Mr. Molla would have been more effective on the picture in front of the camera, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons to watch the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and others responded well to the new directors.
