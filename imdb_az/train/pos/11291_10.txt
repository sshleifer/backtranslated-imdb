Did anyone get this movie? My uncle "Hutch" was a Real (Real) pilot who had his wings thrown into the air and then fired by the pilot's wings. <br /> <br /> He only has a few seconds on the screen, but my family liked the movie. He was only 24 killed when he was shot dead on Italy. <br /> <br /> For some of the movies, I would like to say, "I want all of these old movies to be cheap because DVDs are so cheap these days. <br /> <br /> If you know where I can buy a copy, @ yahoo.com Thank you very much.
