I've seen this movie a while ago after ordering a friend who is a great Dominic Monaghan fan. The film itself was also very interesting, though for me it had positive moments for me, the type of Donnie Darko "wtf?" the factor after the film's end. <br /> <br /> Of course, negative points come from positive. The young girl in the movie was incredibly good and Dominic Monaghan did a good job. Unfortunately, I have no idea of ​​playing Daniel Burke playing Lonnie. It can be me and I do not claim to be a serious critic, but I think it's not as convincing as an actor. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is not a critical one, though I'm attracted to it. Interesting, surprising, and you should only see it.
