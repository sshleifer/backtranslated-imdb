Jackie Chan is a synonomus for the name stunts. This movie will never downgrade you. The opening scene's best discovery scenario and polarized scenario is a scene, if it knows the meaning of fear, is a miracle. This movie is close to Jackie's best. The main difference is that, as in this film, Jackie's film is made up of three stars that will carry on the shoulders completely. This was probably the star of this movie, the greatest martial art track followed by Bruce Lee, jackie. There are also nice comic touches in the movie. The film's work is Jakie's ability to show his esteemed side of his contract as a hero of the ordinary martial arts. This film was followed by a good post, but was rather discreet compared to the predecessor.
