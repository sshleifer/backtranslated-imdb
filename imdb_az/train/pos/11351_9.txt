Excellent movie. The entire picture was taken in Budapest, and I am proud of it. My minor problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the Hungarian State Railways (MVV) and did not see them using the train, rather than on the local railroad - local railway stations that took their victims for the story of Cicatillo. Apart from that, the movie is very nice.
