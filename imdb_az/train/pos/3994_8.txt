I went to this movie, just because I was dragged out because the audience was mostly older, and I was out of the room. But the film was absolutely charming and targeted for older people. Heroes were all very real and convincing, and I discussed myself with movies, characters and stories a few hours later. There are a few enjoyable scenes, but they are necessary and help to better understand the situation. Generally, this is a great and valuable movie - it's a little open, but it can not be used by people who favor the film's foundation. This thrilling and exciting movie experience.
