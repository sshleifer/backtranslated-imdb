This is Antonioni's most critically acclaimed film in the mid-1970s when he was looking for 'defective' American youth culture / politics. For this reason, I found more exciting and memorable than most popular films, L'AVENTURA, perhaps more emotionally and emotionally than somewhere. The story is simple, but Antonioni's criticism of America's consumer culture, student life, counter-culture, and all anti-state, war-torn strikes, is used as a very prominent framework. <br /> <br /> Even technically even this is a very well prepared movie; the cathartic finale (in turn, the Wild Bunch), which uses the 17th camera structure, the turn-key loans, the strange outdoors, the use of billboards and the right-to-bottom hook. Also, the Antonioni screen has chosen Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful to gratify, a hell of a leading lady. There is nothing 'moving' because it feels more like a documentary-drama, and therefore it is quite effective in this context to use non-professionals as a constructive couple. And the soundtrack is packed with just fine music, its use is also impressive (remember that the film's beginning, especially with music selection - by Pink Floyd - improves the visuals). Contrary to professional opinion, this is a fair success in cinema, and I would like to recommend a taste or dissatisfaction to anyone. One of the main films of the 60s, which requires the restoration and release of DVDs, is worth seeing.
