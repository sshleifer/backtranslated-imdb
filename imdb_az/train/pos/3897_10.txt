This video was the first exposure of Eddie Izzard. We had a couple of friends overnight and in the evening they gave the HBO as if they were either giving each other a channel. I'm a guy named Eddie Izzard. In the first few jokes, I did not try to laugh very loudly. The rest of the group did not want to "take responsibility" to use something that killed me. When I smiled more than health, as I left (we were not stoned, we talked about insurance and scholarships) ... Then we drowned. Story lines, plot, strange along the sketches, but magnificent relationships are nothing more than glow. After me, I was dependent on every Eddie-Izzard-comedy, and I could buy my hands. His work is even genius. His comedy looks weak. It looks more like a hysterically funny friend who is hanging in your home and you are missing out on this or that ... It's annoying, funny. He gives you the impression that jokes are amongst you ... just a spectacular miracle. If you're disappointed with this video, there's no sense in humor or humor for what you say in England.
