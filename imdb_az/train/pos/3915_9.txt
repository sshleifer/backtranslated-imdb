I've seen this movie at least 4 times after '84 ', and it's always even better when I see it. <br /> <br /> This is a very interesting version of the Carmen opera. Flamenco dances, bare bones kits and, of course, wonderful music. <br /> <br /> This story of Carmen is a story in a story, each second, until the disaster strikes. Surely low budget Spanish production, the movie is danced by Spanish premier Flamenco dancers. The combination of rising opera music and dance boots on the wooden stage tells the story even stronger. <br /> <br /> This is the best of the film and probably the foreign film.
