It is also known as the Big Spook War. The Great Yokai War, Miike's also a family movie attempt and a damn good job. The problem is that I can not imagine many parents who want to involve their children in this film. The best children's films are scary or mildly disturbed images, Neverending Story, and returning to their own stream, but the Great Yokai War is probably a little farther in the Miike's case. In fact, during the screening, I was the one who presented a recurring movie for two families, probably not very relevant. <br /> <br /> The film recognizes itself and begins with the young hero of the story. about current family problems. This short span is suddenly violated, because the cow is a horror that is a horrible thing to a person that something unhappy comes before it dies (it is possible that the creature's compassion is some strange Quato respect). <br /> <br /> The main baddie is through the rise of the apocalyptic army after an incredible introduction to Kato and his sought after Agi (amazingly attractive Chiaki Kuriyami). The story returns to normal for a while, but not a long time ago, all logic dropped from drainage, and a young group of Miyazaki refuses to quit the evil magician. <br /> <br The area of ​​the film is mostly hackneyed in a surprisingly surprising way, with all the selected movies appearing entirely out of place in such a stereotypical film that regularly breaks, but with a magical world of simple magic helps with the inspirational vision. <br /> <br /> It's just a Miyazaki movie, which is a lively action movie, though it is more than a tremendous, much larger and more common Miyazaki movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The evil robot monsters, which do not demonstrate the best CGI in the world, have the practicality and danger, which is more hazardous than imagining them. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly perfectly, just when their characters look perfectly natural, most of them are priceless when considering that they are full body makeup or latex suits. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the wonderful excellent behavior of the Kurdish people surprisingly, lumbered even Aggizi with a ridiculous bee. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of solid elements in the movie area; cute creatures, little heroes, a thoroughly evil villain, a sense of seduction and adventure, and the lack of violence. <br /> <br /> There are elements that ask questions about how Miyaki will be directed to such a film. <br /> <br /> The Robot Army is a terrible threat to everyday things and extra chains that have been transformed into terrible beasts of the T-101 skinheads. . These animals break down the numbers; <br /> <br /> Yokai actually feeds Yokai's giant horn in a form of hate, which spoils Yokai's flesh and fills his angry spirits with metal pieces If children think that Anak's eyes are bad, one person sees a dead man burying in one of the wounds of a minute of melancholy before becoming a disgusting car of a motorcycle, with a hand-foot cut, in the case of a hand drawn in front of a dripping camera, in a fair amount of sexual energy (Agi, especially wearing a dress for fan service and looks like a dream with Kato as a motivation) <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> > <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> Spoilers This is an example of Yokai just big b When the party thinks they are interested in the last battle, the next battle is more than just a celebration, full of beer, tight surfing and strengthening. <br /> <br /> A scene from Agi's lovely furry creature is also designed to appeal to the masses created by pokemon overkill. <br /> <br /> The Last Spoiler At the end of the day, the Greater Yokai War Miike's strongest recent films. Although he is deprived of some of the feelings of Gozu or Two of the mistaken attraction, he constantly leads the audience away from the common mischief. <br /> <br /> The most attractive film of the scale is, of course, a sincere heartfelt attitude to this topic. </ Strong>
