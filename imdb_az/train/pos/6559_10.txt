Set of flowers. <br /> <br /> The mix of ancient western and hip hop is perfectly mixed together. Apparel styles, scenery, and what exactly the director wants. <br /> <br /> For five years, twenty-seven banks have been robbed, and then disappeared without a trace. Now, a small western city is under siege and her first victim is Rachel's sister. The Rose Gang is ready to ride again. <br /> <br /> Five years after Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash). When Rachel's sister was killed, she ended up rubbing her friends and shifting her back on track. <br /> <br /> The western version is good around, muck. <br /> <br /> <strong> Looking at old babies, this is a bit better on the ways of the female characters. <br /> <br /> I gave 10/10 because characters, puzzles, and scenes were prepared for me.
