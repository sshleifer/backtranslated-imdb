I agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies! I watched it as a child and I absolutely loved it! The scaffolding scenes are brilliant, and this person can really be sure because he is being treated from abroad. The rocks of this movie are beautiful humor and fantastic kung fu! Kung Fu would like it if you like it!
