The Wooden Horse, II. It is a very clever film about a very smart and successful escape plan developed by the British POW during World War II. Moreover, with a sense of humor, especially butterfly, Leo Genn is superior to those lines. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later Mary Banks at George Poppins) are as beautiful as two heroes. Moves in height and direction. Highly Recommended.
