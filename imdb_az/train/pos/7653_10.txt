Fire in the heart is wonderful. The murdered man who wanted to die was brilliantly describing Gary Gimor's condition. The family of the smiling, which is thrown into my heart, shows that it is hated. This movie is an incredible psychological job and it is a great impression and encouragement. 10/10
