This movie is more than Lupine, especially from Funimation. <br /> <br /> The first day will last until 19:00. Lupine is trying to get a big treasure. Fujiko is trying to get out of something by using Lupine's weaknesses from women. <br /> <br /> Other Lupine films are family members of Cuss with many Lupine words. I think that any good Lupine fan would be pleasantly surprised (after I heard very bad things about this movie). Small animations can be a little better without lending loans (a little mushy), but in general, this is not a bad movie. Lupine III is good enough to be one of the few people to watch again.
