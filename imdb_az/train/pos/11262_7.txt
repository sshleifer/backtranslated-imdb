THE GAME OF THE YEAR It was my second attempt at the production of Joseph Sarno, and though I say that the painful, boring and unerotic, than the Swedish WILDCATS, is still a bit slow and uncertain for my taste. <br /> <br /> This is a former "leader" of a group of vampire girls living in a castle. To do this, girls need to dance around barefoot, kiss each other and say strange things and, of course, need some blood. <br /> <br /> If a doctor and his brother need to stop the car and stand in front of the castle - they provide an ideal wing for horny vampires ... but they can not be as desperate as they are ... <br /> <br /> <THE DEVIL'S PLAYTHING 70's early sleaze exploitation is a good example. Nudity includes many, including full frontal, some sleazy weaknesses - incest and, of course, lesbo-bloodsucking ... but these scenes are still good for today's standards. Some pretty hot women would once again benefit from sexually explicit sex, but they could not have all this. He also took advantage of some severe violence, but because he was a vampire movie, but the purpose of the playmaking game was more than just blood and skin. Still a little slower - and most partial move is completely wooden - but this period and something to expect from this budget. It's a valuable thing to exploit your fans - others may be a bit boring for their loved ones. 7/10
