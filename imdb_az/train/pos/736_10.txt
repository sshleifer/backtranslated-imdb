For any punk rocker, this Ramones is a movie that renamed the house in the early 1980s (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). It was one of the first and best of American Punk Rock films, with a classic status of a culet there with the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Producers wanted the cheap Trick as a star, but the release of the Live Budakon album found them in a low-budget movie like superstars and a very profitable item. For Ramones who want to get out of the underground punk rock world, they are very happy and in the main market (not just after the bands' death). In particular, Dee Dee did not like more than 80 films in the band, but while waiting for the Ramones show, fans will always be able to read and enjoy the most of the movie. Like most classics, this movie is foolish fun with some of the classic Ramones images in some of them. Do not wait, you will not find it. It is very entertaining, so enjoy it. Another classic film, Allan Arkush, is similar to the legendary heavy punk band Fear Lee Ving.
