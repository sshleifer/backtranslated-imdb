It was more pleasant to see these tales of dignity, jealousy and revenge, a sharp picture and a clearer picture on DVD after the PBS broadcast. My only condition is that the plot has some unforgettable moments and I find that some of the strongest Masha's accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, he does not leave such a word and does not enjoy it here: the main actors are ideal. Robson Green brings a secret smile, curly, and athletic physics for his role as a young surgeon who is desperate for his wife's wife in a hospital where he has begun to work. Francesca Annis is one of the 50 most surprising women in the world; her acting opponent beauty. (The love images that are between them, better demonstrates how important the age difference is to them!) Each supporting character is sharply drawn and described perfectly. A blend of rough dialogue and passionate resources makes this beautiful miniature. As you have already mentioned in Russell Baker's presentation, you can not be morally uplifted by viewing "inadequate" - but you will be entertaining. (Later, part of the DVD box is a wild and still two-hour fine).
