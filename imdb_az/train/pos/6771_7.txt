Yes, this is nostalgic watching the 1st episode, because it's an episode I have to remember. I enjoy watching the first season, and yes, our full show-up shows now appear to be a clever manifestation. but surely I love the "less severe" part of the show, and the story line is more than just new ones. I thought Belisario had a similar theme with Airwolf and JAG - the leading actor (Hawke and Harm) is also looking for a relative (brother, father) of the MIA. <br /> Is Robert Belisarion's personal life imitating these two demonstration topics? <br /> <br /> Question - Everybody has pictures of the Hawke cabinet. I like my cabin (like a kind of ghost cabinet) and one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf.
