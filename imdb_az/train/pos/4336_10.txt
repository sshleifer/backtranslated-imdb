Things about my folks are a good movie about relationships - first of all, with a mature son and father, as well as with the child's spouse, sister and mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The film is entertaining, biased and thought-provoking. This now led me to re-evaluate my relationship with my parents and my elder son. Peter Falk is as good as Paul's father - his role could not have been better. I hope both Mr. Falk and Mr Reiser are honored with the first film awards for their efforts - for Falk's performance and Reiser's script.
