I do not agree with other good comments. <br /> <br /> <strong> Pudras is better than Magnolia or other celebrated films. <br /> <br /> I think it's a special idea about non-real heroes, as I've just written, I've just been in Spanish society <br /> <br /> Spanish actress Antonia San -Juan <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> movie, good societies, personally I have not liked American contemporary movies (I love classics and some Andy American movies, but very few). <br /> Do you have a movie about the Constituent Constitution? a person likes it or we all make mistakes, but some of us can learn mistakes.
