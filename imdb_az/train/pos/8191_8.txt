The Possible Planet and the Satan Brain include the two best episodes of the 'new' Doctor's second season together. It should be noted that most of the story is transmitted to space in Quatermass and Pit (1967) in an area where the history of the universe is intertwined with Beast 666. These episodes are emotional. Relations between the Doctor and the Doctor, emphasizing the increasing self-confidence of Gul, The Loved Tameb is to build it as a supporter of equal rights with our Lord. It should also be noted that Matt Jones is a joke scenario. This reduces the dependence on a liner on a doctor and plays the role of all the hookahs, especially the captain of the great Shaun Parkes, Zachary Cross Flane.
