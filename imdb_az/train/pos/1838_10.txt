WAQT is a perfect example of a chicken soup for you. <br /> <br /> <strong > at the first film of Indian cinema at the first cinema, but for the second trip, all stereotypes are given for film formulas. Although Vipul Shah was convicted to show something like a bank robber in AANKHEN, he does not have the ability to live in a whole package of WAQT based on something he can only think of as a father-son relationship. WAQT, adopted by Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu in a Gujarati game, has a sensible storyline to back up a public message. A mature view of relationships with the father and son does not bear responsibility for the father or son's family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who built the whole Empire from scratch, lives a wealthy life with his wife, Sumitra (Shefali Shah). Their only son, Aditya (Akshay Kumar), did not make any effort because he had everything he had prepared and spoiled. <br /> <br /> Dear friends, you still believe in everything. Meanwhile, she is married to Papalias Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishwar hopes that the marriage will be a more responsible man for Aditya, but she is disappointed. <br /> <br /> Aditya still carries out her dark life in the best way. <br /> <br /> The endurance of endurance comes when Ishwar leaves Aditya's home. A sudden change in the attitude of his compassionate father towards him and his expectant spouse Aditya baffles. There is nothing else but to do his best for the survival of his wife and the dead child. <br /> <br /> He begins to become an independent person, but the relationship between him and the father grows. <br /> <br /> This story is simple, and the symptom scenario is a very elemental approach. Both can easily be identified and coordinated by the trustworthy symbols of their father and son. If you are not one of these two, at least you may have come across somebody like a real-life person. <br /> <br /> Add him an easy-to-manage script for the director Vipul Shah. For a family like this, any director on his site added a melodrama in the movie, based on the kinematic laws of Bollywood family drama, and turned the film into a compact discourse. But for most of the film, Shah is far more efficient than emotionally charged. <br /> <br /> A clear example of his unpopular course on his pre-interval scene, when his father's father took his son out of his house. in a very simple way. The purpose of the scene is to get something in the brain of viewers. Now in the second half of the divorced father, there is a saying for the scene that this is contradictory. <br /> <br /> However, after reaching the point of difference, the WAQT may still be surprised that it is still unsuccessful. into? The problem is that, despite the fact that the WQT differs from others in its league in terms of treatment, it causes defects in packaging. What is the filmmaker in the first half and now in the song n-dance? There is a singing song from Johar kinda, a Chopra kinda Holi song, a father's latest disco dandia song, a dream song and a dream audience coming true song that brings enough yawns. This picture ... the father took his son out of his house and his son and his wife were singing a song in the Moroccan mountains. Unfounded! For the real reason! <br /> <br /> In the first half of the film the drifting and real story begins only in the second half. The director did not make much effort on unnecessary elements. It's not too bad to talk about the charged sequence, nor is it getting back. But Akshay Kumar's taandav dance is simply ridiculous. Imagine that it is compatible with this (unconscious) cheerful histrionic for the starfish in the movie. Add to the peak at the final stage of the star hunt left by the boy's emotions. Here is archetypal! <br /> <br /> Anu Malik's music is a good thing, though it's not unnecessary in the process. Though Santosh Thundiiil's camera work is sufficiently high, he still needs it. Aqat Kapadia has signed a good dialogue for dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> Boman Iran and Rajpal Yadav make light moments in the film and are very effective. Rajpal Yadav has lately been accompanied by comedy features in many films, though this time it is his character and is completely restricted. <br /> <br /> The healing Shah is pleased with the role of mother. It should not be considered a scenario, but it is both flawless and 'looking for itself' in the game. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Akshay expresses his deliberate intention to know his responsibilities because he is an expressive father. <br /> <br /> Despite the dramatic breakthroughs on Bahreyn's scene, he shoots along his glowing film. <br /> <br /> Generally, the WAF items are like a delicious and nutritious soup, Very appetizing.
