After this article, John Carpenter's "Halloween" is approaching the 30th anniversary. It's 7 times since this year, an update, all imitation and every year around Halloween there are always 'Top 10 Most Dangerous Movies' listings out there. Its budget is quite surprising for a film that costs about $ 300,000 and has since been demonstrated almost completely unknown and future young talent. I can go, but the big question here is: How is the movie being played today? And all I can say is fantastic! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Process: Simple, An unforgettable and sparkling discount account by director / co-writer John Carpenter and Alan Howarth. Great cinematography. Carpenter, which holds the stagnant position, has some great shots on the top and focuses on not showing a lot of people. Better speeches from players who are better off than ever. Great sense of humor. Michael Myers is a scary, evil man. Many exciting moments that will stay with you. Speed ​​is slow, but stable and not drag. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, unlike most of the other films, it is much more about anxiety and terror than the number of blood and large bodies. <br /> <br /> Producers: Probably not as scary as it is now. Most Ghetofs really differ. <br /> <br /> Recent thoughts: I want to start by saying that this section is not my favorite movie in the series. I know it's not a popular idea, but how do you really feel. Nevertheless, it is really an important film that continues to reach a new movie scene. And because it is rebuilt for a new generation, it does not mean it will be forgotten. <br /> <br /> My rating is 5/5
