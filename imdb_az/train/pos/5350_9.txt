I have seen Running Man a few times because I am a fan of Stephen King and all his films, but now it is even better, because I did not know about my website for about 2 days and I did not understand that Paul Glasn, at the same time Paul Michael Glaser, who was watching at the Parisky Starsky and Hutch television show. It's a pleasant surprise for me because I can not say how often I cry when I'm wounded by Starky or Hutch. The episode also cried after the death of Stars (Kill Starsky). My dad had to get away from the show. What do you expect for a 12-year-old child? Now I'm here to look for movies or programs related to anything that is in the hands of Paul or David Soul and Stephen King !!!!!!!! Just say happy birthday Paul !!!!!
