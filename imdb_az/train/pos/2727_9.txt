Truman Capote was one of the best real crime movies in his book, which invented the genre of genuine criminal novel, and was very loyal. Haunting Quincy Jones's music account and Dick and Perry, by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake, are horrific as the killings. <br /> <br /> Black and white cinematography and editing is the top of this movie. The rebuilding of the crimes is frightening, and it is more than scary, shotgun than it is because of the fact that the real murders are to your imagination. The film was filmed in the Real Clutter House, which was sold to another person after the killings. The film has a very documentary experience - along with scenes in the real Clutter House, other stations were shot at the gas stations and the killing was actually in stores. Nancy Clutter's favorite horse, Babe, is so in the movie. Will Geer has a great turn as a prosecutor at a short trial with jury members, not just filming in the courtroom, but also as a jury of the film. <br /> <br /> This is a solid film, you see it scary every time.
