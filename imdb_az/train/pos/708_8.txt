A full movie about Downs syndrome. One mother has twins, one is very ill, and the other is good, but there are ends. She does not think that mother can raise her because she has given some people to one of the 11 children with 15 children! my mother is not like this and she is thinking of joining with the family (and I agree) to the court, and the mother and daughter of the deceased are not really called makeup? I think this movie is good, but the plot is familiar, it's still good, and there are a few unusual laughs!
