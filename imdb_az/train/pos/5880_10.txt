Contrary to the above-mentioned person, I felt that this scene, especially in the scenes, was pretty funny. I still do not want to give a story and story to the untrained people, but I will say that Paresh Rawal does not play a role like the former Priyadarshan films, such as Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal is an incredible part in a small role given to him, and John Abraham is equally good, Akshay Kumar proved to be less in this film than in almost all films after Time and Andaz. Despite the fact that all three heroin in this film were on a debut, they did a very good job of Nargis, who was very good and warm. If you like Hungama or Hera Pheri, you need to watch this movie.
