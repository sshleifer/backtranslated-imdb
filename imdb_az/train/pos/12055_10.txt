I'm lucky enough to watch it. I was surprised to see the image of the soul the next day and the day after. I have watched it 3-4 times and every time I value it. The settings are brilliant, there are beautiful lighting effects in the night city, swampy long boots, and the house itself is grown with enough mosses. The main hero is so unpleasant and kind, that he is sincere. To the person who complains that there is not enough "spark" in this film, I say that the whole fight against this soul is carried out only by one person. It's a slowly progressing movie with an unusual amount of time spent in the ordinary and business life to develop its character, with previous and subsequent excitement attacks. DISCUSSIONS DISCUSSION / <br /> <br /> When I come to the particular place, he comes to the main city and meets with the person who helps him and explains to the spirit. He describes the black women, and then says at the end of the conversation that he's coming back, for what has he been harmed? The other man says, "you can not go back ... alone!" and give his hero to his dog. <br /> <br /> A cute little dog gives a small stamp of funny relief, entering inside the house and even in a locked room. <br /> <br /> Many casual images of the ghost really amazed me. The woman appears to be in the middle of the church, not afraid of the church and that she is not ashamed or afflicted home. This is from the very beginning. Another incredible memorable scene was with the children on the street, watching the funeral. As the camera puts a pan on the right, it appears in the background among female cemeteries. The old man will not even look at him, but the children resemble it and look like it. Crreeepy ... Usually the ghosts are hidden in the shadows, haunting at specific locations or people. As mentioned above, the spirit's anger and anger are in fear, and I feel that it is attacked, and the end is perfect and absolutely right. Finally, the hero went home and underlined a great mistake. Or perhaps she saved her daughter, no matter what. The man who plays the hotel manager is very convincing and really well fills his role. I'm telling my friends how much I love this movie, and I'm sure to see the same feelings of others. <br /> <br /> I think some people have summed up this film saying it was resolved. Ghosts are asking if they can harm a person. Night .. I plan to watch this night again, and then The Changeling, yes. <br /> <br /> Thank you,
