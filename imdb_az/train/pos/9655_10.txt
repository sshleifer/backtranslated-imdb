Maybe "Presque Rien" is not the best movie ... But it's better than most of you. <br /> <br /> Americans have become accustomed to a very precise start, development and outcome. But European films are less narrative, but they think and feel. <br /> <br /> Many of you did not understand the meaning of the film. It's just a simple summer for us to live in love and live forever. "The summer holidays and the beach are just a joke, and every one of these films is related to those guys Someone has shown this movie as 3 parts flashbacks These are the three moments: - Summer at Pornichet, when they encounter and love - Mathieu psychiatrist who lives in Nantes for a year and a half. Cedric was brought to the hospital, and then he talked to a psychiatrist to find out why .-- Last part, Mathieu will only return to Pornichet in the winter ... to think about how his life changed, how his life would be and how he wanted to find himself <br /> <br /> Some people did not understand all this well for all the scenes are intertwined, but as I said before, it's not a funny movie. <br /> <br /> Dear Ryan, a young man who wants to show us how cruel his life is , is not sure what his feelings and what he will do in life. Mathieu just wants to get away from home and try to live the type of life he thinks he can bring to happiness .. But it was just as perfect as he thought .. then he is not as good and uncomfortable as he thinks, and feels lost in his life. He is lost and does not really know what he wants, or makes him happy. Finally it turns into depression and suicidal. <br /> So is it funny? Not a fun movie. Very hot scenes? just a few .. but this is not a movie for fun. About feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, happiness, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like others, feel that life and Mathieu problems are related to what the director wants .. a movie <br /> <br / > The best gay movie ever for me.
