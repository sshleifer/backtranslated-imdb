This is one of the coolest, most comfortable and beautiful animated movies I've ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the movie, sounds and music can feel like you're in the movie! This movie is not only for children, but also adults. It teaches your lessons so you have forgotten who you are, if you have the courage to think, you will be courageous and courageous. This film can also cry when it's a nice touch on movies. This movie is funny, sad, sweet and keeps you on the edge of the seat! Some movies really give them a fuzzy feeling after seeing them, and the "Spirit" is one of them! With 9/10 voice sounds for a good idea of ​​animation, music and a movie, she gave me a lot of energy!
