Alain Chabat is a good actor, writer and director, but when Aristophanes still read 'from the beginning', it's probably a "idea" for a story they've had. However, as I said, Chabat is a great player and he can do it when it is needed. I also gradually eliminate going to Charlotte Gainsbourg, which has a successful performance. If you insist on knowing it, "plot" is a person who is 40 years old and is more than just the content of being alone. It does not sit well with his mother and five sisters and makes a "correction" with a colleague's sister to pull him back - for fifteen thousand euros - give your new girlfriend a romance, a festive fruit, and then burn it down, get off the fork. Of course, they are confused, but there are a few Benedek and Beatrice dueling along the way, and all of these are quite painless ninety minutes and they do not produce the same results as the French box office.
