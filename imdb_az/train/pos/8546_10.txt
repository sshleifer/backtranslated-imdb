This is one of the funniest and best movies ever made! I just saw the forty minuets and I have to say that it's a good movie. If the excitement is funny, and there are quite a few sexes in this movie. It's really funny, and I do not see how anyone can get this movie. In fact, I really want to watch the rest of the movie. This is a bit of a patient scene (I trust it, it's not very nice), but this is another movie. I appreciate this movie 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 at sexual content and 10/10 in the field. If you're an admirer of your American picnic and want to watch a movie, there's a whole sex movie. <br /> <br /> 10/10
