It's a very, very early Bugs Bunny cartoon. As a result, the character is still in transit - it does not run as it did in the past, and its voice is not entirely right. In addition, chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is a vulnerable bunch of bugs from a pet shop - there is no weapon or desire for rabbits to blame for his charges! Nevertheless, this is still a very unpleasant film. Early memories were more harsh and cruel than his subsequent embodiments. In subsequent films, Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others talked about it because they had started - they were rabbit. But in this film he is more like Daffy Duck at the end of the 1930s and early 40s - the irritating love of others! Instead of the hero of the next cartoons, he is a true "anarchist". It's fun to watch, although it's not among the best Bug Bunny cartoons, and it's interesting to see how much he has changed over the years.
