I do not like people who usually protect reality shows, especially from the success of American Idol. <br /> <br /> The world's comedians are short-sighted for famous talented priests, and if they want, these guys will be sent on a daily basis to a real audience. . Later, he chooses to live in a ten or twelve comic homes and choose "Survivor" style contests with comedic tactics. Then it will be designated as a "Last Comic Standing". I want to raise a comedy, so a reality show should fit my interests. There are so many funny comics there. Alonzo began his career as a Boden, Ralphi May and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> Show a drama that negative negative criticisms are likely to have many of these comedians selected for their true contribution. First they lived together in a house like "Big Brother", but now they do it, thank God. <br /> <br /> I also have many comedies I feel, they are funny, but they are racial, ethnic, attitude, gender, and so on. Because other comics clearly beat them. But in general, there is a well-prepared reality show, so far I thought it was an oxymoron.
