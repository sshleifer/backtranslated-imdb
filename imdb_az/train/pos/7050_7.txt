I do not want to spend a long time here - you see the trader, and if it is not online. I do not advise to see this - poorly prepared, and I have not collected any of the laughs or spells from the film. So, because of an angry trailer that does not film this, it should give it a chance. Very funny. I was blown up in this film with prudence and originality. The first 40 minutes were on the hysterical grounds - my problem was that it was the worst Austin Powers movie in the last 20 years. However, the rest of the movie (in normal condition) is one of the few films that I do not like the end of the campus. Everyone gives a great performance (especially Joan Cusack) and there are many great things in the truth. When I go out again, I plan to see it again - at first glance I laugh to catch all the details!
