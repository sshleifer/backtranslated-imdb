I'm sorry to say that I did not agree with other people in this Columbo episode. Death is a Columbo type that is open to me. Several times, I was bored and changed the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Millan, but in this episode the story was weaker than others. First, Robert Culp is a investigator for Ray Milland's character. He hires him to explore the scene of the young marriage performed by Patricia Crowley. On the contrary, Culp's character blackens his betrayer who wants to drive his scheme to his husband who violates his career. Culp, who came out of anger, struck him with his face and killed her. I dont know. Maybe I did not think about it. Of course, Columbo ends it. Just ask one question.
