Unfortunately, many consumers who write reviews for the IMDb make the low budget even better. Regardless of the need for this film, the more budget is really part of it. Huge kits and many special effects turned him into another Lara Croft movie. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> /> <strong> His wise little smiles and familiar looks are strange, and you want him to dishonor his face. This is a case where little-known (at least in the United States) Nicholas Coaster-Waldau's work can lead to an unusual cerebral curiosity of Nikolai. He can only aggression with a jerk and aggression with "stop the endless stop." then he was shot dead in heavily armed, but suddenly obliterated obedient ones. <br /> <br /> In some cases, Staden, who has the biggest problem for me, is not convinced that he can handle the humble mainstream problem. Coaster-Waldau was beaten with athletic and muscular looking guys. He's just a Peta Wilson or pump-up actress, not Hilary Swank, but a credible blow. <br /> <br /> Staden, Coaster-Waldau, showing himself humiliating himself, as with his little sister. <br /> <br /> This is not really a motion movie, it's not a big flaw. I hope these are better and if they continue.
