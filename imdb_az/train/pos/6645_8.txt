It causes strange (and lethal) behavior of each of the ultra-modern home residents in the rich neighborhood. Or at least Col Kennedy, the character of Lara Flynn Boyle, claims this. After a series of fatal events in a closed house, Col knows he needs to give something. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also meets stars like mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My idea: House Next Door works because of Lara Flynn Boyle and the sights (beautiful home) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress who does not have to say anything completely unusual. He brings the character reliability and is interested in the film. Without him, that would have failed. The home clerk declares a potential buyer "It's so alive." Yes, it is alive. But the story itself is not so much. <br /> <br /> Barring Boyle's presence does not happen here, like a large amount of movie, waiting or waiting for the house to affect its current owners. The results are predicted. But I liked it anyway. The cinematic film gives a polished look. 8/10 tall, ultra-modern home premise, places and cinematography, decorations and wardrobe design.
