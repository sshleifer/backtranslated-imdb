This is a great movie for McCartney and Beatles fans! Everyone has a good time. Spectators (Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas celebrities) are as beautiful as ever: small children, sixties.They know the words with their hearts and Paul Paul "yesterday" is all "loving" and all his treasures in his catalog (John Lennon and Dylan Exception "dark" - Lennon and Harrison played a solo for the first "today's here" (the title was the "best way" in 1982), and then Paul gave a ukulele <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I remember when people in the early 70's were despising Paul, when Paul's voice came, the key moment was "long and winding" Paul was forced to change Paul's mind on the grounds that he was not involved in politics, as his past associate, Paul is a loyal artist: "Glory is a great cause to blessing." There are distinct areas, an artist who mankind is something else.
