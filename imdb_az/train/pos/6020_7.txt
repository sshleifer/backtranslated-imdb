A beautiful new copy of the Zabriskie Point is played in Paris and looks good in the Latin Quarter. It's time for a full assessment of the film. Hopefully, the new edition will mean the future of DVDs, some deep "extras" in the near future. </ STRONG> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I follow ZP and remember that when it comes, I think it is a collapsing hole. This time around me was in my heart and classified it as a "close miss". The first part of the film is a time spent in the late 1960's in Los Angeles, then I lived there and Antonioni did a great job to capture the essence of the earth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is forbidden to anyone under the age of 16 (or I do not remember 18). I suspect that there is some reversal in this pressure. SPOILER - I'm surprised at how much the desert scenes were cut off first. <br /> <br /> Today's events are in line with existing standards. <br /> <br /> The movie does not have music music for about 1 hour. Radio broadcasts and so on. Antony was so brave to do this before he heard some sounds. I remember how long it was to remember when actress Mark Frechette and Daria Halpin were lacking in acting skills. This time, Frechette did not bother me. <br /> <br /> The weakness of the solution, as the film continues, is gradually improving. <br /> <br /> Most of the pupils' protest protests seem to be scenes for me. A stroke is different in appearance and distorts the large screen. Of course, there are actually scenes, but not so much. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to figure out how Antony used the Frechette shots flying over the plane. <br /> <br /> As some flies really seem to have - there's no blue screen or couple of shots. <br /> <br /> I hope to return to see the movie for the second time. All Antonioni fans are highly recommended.
