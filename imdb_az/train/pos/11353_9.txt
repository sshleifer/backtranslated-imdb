This movie was excellent. This is a dispute between a detective charged with the ignorance of the communist regime in Russia in the 1980s. I describe this film at a high level that it can not prevent the creation and development of a judicial investigation in a world-wide isolated state (through the "Regime"). This is a graphic film. It presents the opaque appearance of violence and these tragic balances. There is nothing to distract from excessive blood with "sugar-coated" or a harsh reality on the screen. This film is based on the Russian series murderer Andrey Cicatillo. I got acquainted with the true story so much that it is a deep gratitude for the truth of the film. This is not a comedy, but the film should be one for those who appreciate the dry and dark humor.
