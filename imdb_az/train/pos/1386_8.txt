Three hugging girls are triangular. The triangle has a base. In Apex, Belmondo is a strict, short and sloping tomb that has a facial structure. His best friend is physically and psychologically controversial: coquette, chubby - I say fat and wish a boy for the first kiss, but I'm not ready for the first sex. <br /> <br /> The other leg of the apex is a beautiful "pile fatale" yellow vamp. It is deeply involved in competitive sports, synchronized swimming. Marie sees a competition at a local public pool. Marie drives herself to vampire life by using a desire to become a synchronized swimmer. Around the vampa there is a factor in becoming a prostitute with any young person in the orbita. Marie does not leave the stage for this reputation. <br /> <br /> The first half is set up. When we meet three girls, we'll see a lot of synchronization. Finally, the narrative is separated from synchronized swimming, and prefers peak relationships between the three. But this is what happens when something unexpected happens. <br /> <br /> This is a trademark of French films on the audience, with wisdom nuggets. This is no exception. Here on the ceilings and the dead. See the movie for more information. <br /> <br /> The director says that it is advisable to use synchronized swimming. Only women's sport is a metaphor for a girl's life: on the surface is pretty feminine, while she's working and competing. Many scenes point to this point: the gentle movements and smiles for the public, the unhappy underwater footsteps. The French title is also striking: "prieuve" or "octopus" also offers a decree seeking to trick many pressures.
