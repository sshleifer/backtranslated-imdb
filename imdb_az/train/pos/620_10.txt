Stardust's beautiful story is written by Neil Gaiman (MirrorMask writer) and a really good story. I believe that any Labyrinth, Princess Bride, or the 10th King's supporter is still unique and stands on itself. I also feel that the story adaptation of this story is better than the work prepared by Neil Gaiman. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is a son of a deadly and defective slave, hiding in a lying area. The story begins in a city near a wall that separates the magical world from human beings. Whenever a falling star, Tristan promises to get her back for an exciting girl. He did not know that in the world of fairy-tale, the star took a girl's image and was there after her. <br /> <br /> This is really a good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. It's charming and I feel I can be viewed by kids and adults of all ages. Just magic. A true classic fairy tale I have not seen in the movie since the 1980s.
