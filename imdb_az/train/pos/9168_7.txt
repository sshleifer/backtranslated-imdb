It was a nice fit of Jane Eyrein. Zelah Clark did not like his only problem with him. I thought it was too old, and Jane seemed very scary. In the book, Jane seemed to be a very strong character. I really was disturbed by its description. Rochester wanted her to marry her, and she fled to her and embraced her and made me laugh. I think they've made a bad choice to beat her. but it was absolutely beautiful like Dalton Rochester. This version of Jane Eyrein is worth seeing. The quality of this movie is something that is not 100%. I know that it was made for television on the eighties. fiction film and better quality would have been perfect. My main complaint is that Zelah Clarke is definitely too old.
