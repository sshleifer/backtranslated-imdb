The process of intense compression between comedy and drama is one of the most harsh actions in cinema. <br /> <br /> This stunning little ship of a movie will give you a great smile, beautiful scenery and a very beautiful look. well a buzz. Especially after the white Europeans enjoy the concept that a doctor of history is alcoholic and uses "other races", the illicit marijuana is undoubtedly true and proves a legitimate race that is explicitly populated by the population. <Br / > <br /> The extraordinary "DVD Supplement" comments ... two factually ... all the movies continue with both actors and writers. I'm sure I'm not in the first movie, but then I realized how easy it was to miss most of the thinnest comedy in the first shooting. What hoot! Do not miss it! 9/10 stars
