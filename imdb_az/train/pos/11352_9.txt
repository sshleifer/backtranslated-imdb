This is an interesting account about hunting the first famous serial killer of the Soviet Union. I'm looking forward to a half-decent television movie, but I've found myself telling the story to be compulsory. As others have said, there is plenty of room for admirers in the great screen releases that can create pessimism. <br /> <br /> Most of the loan should go to Chris Gerolmo until his smart screenplay and leadership draw the viewer. it is impossible to emotionally participate. Moving through all shooting, especially the two leading Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland, are also outstanding. <br /> <br /> Their convincing images are characteristic of springs with great reliability, and the stage where the first committee meetings after the Transformation really touches. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br />
