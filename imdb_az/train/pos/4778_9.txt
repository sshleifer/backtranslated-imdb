As his first masterpiece, "The Elephant Man" Lynch proves that his detractors can say a straightforward, simple story without losing its artistic touch. This is a real story of an old retired man who decided to drive a tractor in several provinces. He is now applying for his last visit to his alienated brother, who is now at the gates of death. Badalamenti is a beautiful film, a delicate photo of the village life (I love the roots of this air) and a harsh filmmaker who has revealed the basic humanity of man - this is a beautiful life movie. Its very slow pace can force some viewers to sleep, but those who want to stay for a ride will be rewarded well.
