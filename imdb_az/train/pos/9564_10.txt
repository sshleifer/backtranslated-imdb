<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> During some scenes, I was seated outside my seat, frightened by others, and drowned in my tears after tragic ending. <br /> The film has made a deep impression on me, with sharp, stunning, violent scenes with severe and compassionate "love" scenes. "The film does not deserve the Cat III rating, or "kiss." Not all people, whether severe or severe, have the tender side. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this movie 10/10. <br /> <br / Edison Chen is a superb job by playing a part of the lethal Pang. This should definitely wait.
