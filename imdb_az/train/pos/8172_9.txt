When I was young, I remembered that I was afraid of the movie, and it was getting less and less, and I'm sure some of the other viewers are convinced that the lacebacks of the past few years have been so exciting for me that I was not scared or screamed. <br /> <br /> <strong> "Dental Story" has turned around. <br /> <br /> The installation seems simple: a foolish unstable dentist is angry at the mouth and maybe objects. Although a clever twist, the dentist is the protagonist of the film, so instead of being a dimensionless bad guy with no clear motivation, his development is the most comprehensive source of any character and is very human and convincing. Hence, I hope that the viewer will love him to become a victim and find a way to cover his own path and return to normal life so that he can expect justice to come to an end. <br /> <br /> In reality, the "fear film" is violence. And the "Dental Story" is better than any movie I think. First, the film has tons of tension. This is the lack of modern core films. On one stage (), the dentist is emotionally depressed and should first see the young child. Upon reaching the child's mouth, I hope that the dentist and the child end up without the encounter. I'm going to spoil what's happening. Secondly, when the body comes, it hurts the worst, noisy nerves. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there is a movie that you have never heard of. Most importantly, for fans of fear. Also, as the other person who has been reviewing, over a period of several days, there is no background in the characters. And the tension is a bit diminished until the end. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Of course, we want to know about the background of the fact that the truth proves how good and most of the film is in tension any minor delay can be justified. <br /> Heroism, after getting used to filming for several years, suddenly does not want to cover my eyes in blood. The "dentist" scared me and thoroughly disturbed me, and that's exactly what I was up to.
