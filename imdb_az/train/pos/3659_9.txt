This movie was the first contact with Mr Sika, so I did not know what to expect. But what I saw was a great disruption to all expectations. <br /> <br /> This story is not a complex and shows us the link between the life of a child orphan and, especially, the poor people together. simple metal plate houses set up a hood. This small town in another city lives on its own, and everything is fine. But one day there is a water source and a rich noble man is interested in buying a place. But as the headline of film guides - there is a miracle happening. Our character is a miracle dove from his dead mother. <br /> <br /> This was just one masterpiece of natural comedy. The behavior of poor people and money and property can be spoken and played by people. It also includes many comic moments and scenes - with the sun shining at the start and with more places. <br /> <br /> So I'm not a comedy lover, so you need to see this movie <br /> <br /> I really liked it
