One of the best films I've ever seen in the last five years! Casting is a spectacular gem in a story of young love and bravado on the Lower East Side of New York. Attractive, seductive, sad and inspirational, it is completely renewed in the youth of the city. Larry Clark's often puts it in a place where he has a heartbeat ... I have to admit that there is someone on Bully's normal expense. It's a movie for you to lose yourself for Victor Vargas's removal ... so do not miss out!
