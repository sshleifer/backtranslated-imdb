Like Arabian Nights, she plays with storytelling conventions to feel that there is a plot, plot, plot, and more: When it comes to the frame of the blind man who describes the story of her life, about half of life is still missing, up flashback. (It should be accepted that the second half does not match the promise of the first one.) Like many Arabian Nights, many things are possible as motives of the Middle East people. A free genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, fantastic mechanical toy, sea trips, an intense marketplace, a bad visor, jewels ... I do not know why all this, but it does. Everything is very beautiful. The sets are beautiful. June Duprez is beautiful. Rosa's account is particularly beautiful. As usual, Hungary sounds; but in some ways he is trying to convince that Hungary is in a Persian way.
