Wendigo is a pretty good psychological tension, there are some great dramas among the movie's characters and some of the best creepy scenes. Acting is good, the characters behave as a normal family. <br /> <br /> The effect of "Wendigo" is good, "Deer Form" reminded Rabbit a bit at Donnie Darko. <br /> <br /> The film sees a family that will stay in the house for a while, but accidentally a deer, hunter arrival and one of the huntsman, Otis, begin to argue with Father George, who will go home after the car has been removed. Last Miles is shaken about a little deer, but parents try to say that the events that will happen to him are natural. On the bed tonight, he starts to see strange things in the bedroom and goes to the city the next day and Miles shows whom to whom the statue is, and tells him that Wendigo meets a man with a little statue. A man at the counter told him that the owner only worked there. After returning home, George threw his son off, and when he left the candle, he collapsed and Miles followed the wind, looking for George, and finding himself on the edge of the house. The hospital says that Sheriff Otis shot him, Shriff, Otis, goes down to the place where Otis heads his head with his hammer as Vendigo pulls him down the road he finds. <br /> <br / Wendigo is a very good tension with some cold moments. Check it out. 10/10
