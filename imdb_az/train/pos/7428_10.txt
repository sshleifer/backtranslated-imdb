When I first saw this movie I swear I cried! A STAR IS BORN is a film that lets you know what love really is, despite the obstacles faced by John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand). At the end of the movie, you're experiencing something like losing love. Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry together and the music is fantastic! Wait again when Streisand reads / Watch now, it's pure magic! This film has made Evergreen song one of my favorites and Queen Bee is such an entertaining song. I also love the fashion of the 70s (apart from Streisand afro, it's also beauty). A Star is my favorite number one movie. This movie is watching and ultimately heartbreaking.
