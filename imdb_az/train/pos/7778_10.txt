Director Douglas Circus said once, "There is a very short distance between high art and garbage, treacherous debris is close to art." <br /> <br /> The slogan melodrama, as expressed in many words, is perfectly grounded in its cinema, classic scene adaptation, adventure and war movies, western music and, of course, dramas. The music gives it a tone for its mastery style, and each shot of its brush (Circus is also an artist) turns on the screen and creates a strong look on the canvas. But this is not life, its representation, imitation of life. The circus never tried to show the reality, but rather. None of his descendants did better use all the technical means provided by Hollywood (especially Technicolor) to distinguish artificiality. Remember that his golden age coincided with the time when Hollywood films focused on social drama (Blackboard jungle, no reason without Rebel). Circus always knew that the movie meant something else. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> That's why we were in a hall full of mirrors wherever there was no difference between real and fraudulent dreams, no one says that Hadley is a real person. it's not realistic with the dirty oil pumps in the area, so it is exposed to action in this world, the scenery is fraudulent, trickery may seem a bit less restrictive (eg, Dorothy Malone's sex concepts with oil tower). <br /> <br /> The circus was also critical and theorizing. <br /> <br /> These angles are the director's dream lighting is its philosophy. " In the wind, we follow in the geometrical way, as well as the fall of the traditional lifestyle in terms of light and shadows. The Hadleys house, which has different levels of spiral staircase, is completely metaphorical. A house like a tomb, no one can be humble. As the tragedy moves day and night from day to day, sneaky photography is part of the interior of her characters, and they are also the color of the dress she wore. The drama belongs to every element of the director's artistic service. <br /> <br /> The circus thought it was "wrapped" after its twisted style and standard material. A good example of the wind is a good example. <br /> <br /> Frank Turlin was the fortieth melodrama for the 50th comedy, which used some strategies. Their movies are full of American lifestyle, television, television, jukeboxs, washing machines, sports cars, vacuum cleaners - reflecting its spaciousness and decay. I have to think that films are differently evaluated by modern audiences. The game was played by both sides and was a camp. We now consider them to be "cult" or "weird" because we are not the viewers anymore. For this reason, Todd Haynes's "Far from Paradise" is a past, because it works as if nothing is present between Sirkin's work these days. Then, hanging on the Circus art galleries, it is becoming the subject of the debate on Julianne Moore and the gardener's film. Circus perfectly understood the elements of melodrama. There were always persistent characters (here Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall), able to collect some split ones. It's noteworthy that its balance through antithesis is not surprising, and it is also interesting to the Circus because we are rooted for split characters. Robert Stack blew up the plane and when we hit 'Lauren Bacall' with all the world's ease (clear Faustian echoes below), we were strangely surprised by it, because we show the past with the devil's nymphomaniac little sister <br /> <br / > The "happy ends" studio often used in the circus universe does not have a negative effect. In fact, they just worked great. The Circus loves the Greek tragedy and ends his Deux ex machine before his day. So the final courtroom scene is good, and we should remember that the whole film was recalled, as we will talk about the tragedy that still falls under Hadley's regime. <br /> <br /> There are many similarities between the Wind Saga and the Wind Writing. I totally agree and not parallel coincidence. Both share the story of an old father who is trying to keep the empire intact while protecting his family. Jimmy Caa's son-in-law, Sonny Corleone, characterized by Robert Stack, has a beautiful resemblance. The fight against her brother's friend is symmetrical. The elderly man's trusted son is common in both films because both families have the names of their own cities. Detailed information such as door access to houses giving access to property shows that Coppola was written in the wind while writing. Both films deal with the subject of power: power acquisition, manipulation and inheritance (even Kyle Hadley's sterility, the event that has provoked confusion is a matter of easy focus on power, and weakness is sexually active). Another major film that deals with power and represents America's life is Citizen Kaneni. Initially he did not consider similarities between Welles and Circus films, but as the origin of the family's fortune he began his oil business and received Charles Foster Kane, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson), by a patron of his own father. Surprisingly, the same actor (Harry Shannon) fulfills all of Wayne and Kane's ancestors. This detail can not be coincidental. <br /> <br /> In every aspect of the wind, performance and vision, style and technique, this is something in a great director's career. Some say that this is the best film. In my opinion, it is as good as "Sacred Splendor", "All Things of Paradise", "Tomorrow Is Always" and "Imitation of Life." Those who have Circus at the Dallas or Dinasty level wish them a happy ending.
