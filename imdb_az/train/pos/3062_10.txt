I saw this movie a few months ago in cables and it was fantastic. William H Macy is one of my favorite actors and his performance was just wonderful. Although he has done something wrong, he focuses on his character, and Neve Campbell gives performance with the best performance I've ever seen in an actress this year. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland is just as stupid as Macy's father and as a shake in the midst of everything happening with John Ritter. <br /> <br /> I want it to be in the theater, because I feel it's a movie that's seen by a wider audience. This is a shame because hell is better than most of the new films are coming to the theater right now. <br /> <br />
