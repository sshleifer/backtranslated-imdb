<br /> <br /> This is not the best movie, but I voted for 10 stars. Basically at the end of my feelings. All people around me and all around me just touched. You do not often feel that. We all feed a bit of kinship and smashing, lazy manipulation, or adventure in modern movies. The story of the movie is one of the friendship centers on the edge of a growing crisis between MNN and a young woman around Jane and a friendship between her and Richard. It could easily have been a dull and worthy piece, but it's amazing, humanistic, and emotional, that's a good movie for odds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A player from Branagh and Bonham-Carter, Chemistry between the two raises the film. <br /> <br /> Master's title is Richards' masterpiece, an airplane and old-fashioned works. Richards and Janes, flying here, are symbols of life, one for which one can survive and the other ends. <br /> <br /> A nice and funny movie I recommend to anyone. Do not allow the topic to extinguish.
