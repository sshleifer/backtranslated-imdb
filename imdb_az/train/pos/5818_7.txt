In fact, this movie has a claymation part, as well as a misunderstanding of Joe Pesci and the child section and worse than other MJ movies like The Wiz, Captain Eo, and Ghosts. But almost as strong as Michael Jackson for eleven years, (Yeah, I have half my life, you guys!), I can not complain about this much. Just to see this beautiful guy and hear beautiful music is a journey to Paradise. But as a movie, this is not good, and I'm afraid that if my sweetheart Mike had not played a role, he would have got a lower rate for me. But no one except Mike, Moonwalker, needs to get 10 to 7 of me.
