A beautiful old thriller, "Red Rock Western", a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, suffers a bad job after the success of a veteran unemployed oil worker, Mr N.Cage. A empty gas tank and a bowl of coffee in a ute town enough money is enough. Mr. Cage may have been down since the start, but he can not and does not, but he can not even steal it in today's difficult situation. Because Mr. J.T. Walsh, a man in charge of killing his wife, calls on her to warn her husband of her intentions. That's why Mrs. LFBoyle has offered him more money to kill Mr. Walsh.Mr Cage. he still decides to stand in front of him, but when he leaves the city, he hit a man on the road. She did everything she could to handle her, taking her to the hospital where she was shot. Mr. Cage is kept by the deputies seeking the Sheriff's office, Mr. JT Walsh. The events lead to a more complicated shift when escaping from arrest, and Mr. Cage keeps away from escaping the real cunning set out to fulfill the commission. Now you can be forgiven for thinking of "enough", but it's a totally illogical turn of events happening on the screen. At this point, the narrative flow of the film seems to be permanent. Mr. D.Hopper, like Mr Cage's USMC veteran, was easily dismembered as a hired killer. A small part of this serendipity, thinking of Mr. Cage's deadly trio, did not heal and sank a bit, but still unbowed. Everything that is being done on paper, as everyone is involved, is actually a tense situation that gives a great performance. "Red Rock West" is a film-lover movie. In five minutes, you know you will go somewhere before, but you'll be happier during the trip.
