I accidentally filmed it in this movie and could not leave it ... It's a beautiful movie that allows people to learn American history through the Vietnam War, the time of flower power, and the struggle of racism ... It's a 60-year-old race, racial conflict. I was born in 1980, so I did not know everything in advance ... France is a priority not in the history of the US, and this movie really has learned a lot of truth for me! By the way, I think all actors are big; especially by Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. You can now see this movie one more time each day! This is really a great thing ... it's a shame not only hidden on TV in cinemas ... <br /> <br />
