At the age of 13, I saw this movie and then liked the calf plateau, which played roles like kimberly drummond in different strokes. I do not think it 's trash .he did not mean to be a continuation of the documentary. about 3 kids going after just trying to find the boggy creek monster on a cute kid's movie. men are harming and the children save them with the help of the creature. The surprising shooting of the arkansas waterfalls and scenes was impeccable. this is a good movie for kids, no real violence threatens to a few mild, but a good entertainment for young children.
