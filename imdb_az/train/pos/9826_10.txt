It's a cheap erotic tension from this budget that has some good points, but it's a bit worse. A woman is a lawyer to clean up her lover who is accused of killing his wife. The reason for being a soft film is that she is hiding under a lane club and having sex with a possible suspect. As the fields go for this genre, it's not bad. The scenario is complete, and in story 2, it does give enough meaning to explain one another. But everything in the movie seems cheap. Leading actors are not bad, but very supportive is pretty bad (a girl is as drunken and / or high). Cinematography is bad, when everything looks to the mouth and ugly. The sound is so terrible that people can hear what they say. The worst thing in this movie is the reason you're watching it - sex. People are watching these things because of the Golden Shoe diary for hot sex scenes with really hot girls. Sex scenes are sleazy hot, and everything is stuck in porn style where everything is just a master shot of her going. The woman looks like a refugee from a pornographic shooting. I do not want to work here roughly or well, but all of them have breast implants and a burnt look. Even the title "Deviant Obsession" sounds like a Hardcore flick. I do not have anything against the penguin - in fact, I love it. But my soft core and my difficulty are separate. What happened to actresses like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Will women who move make you totally fit? What happened to B erotic thrillers like Body Chemistry, Nighteyes and even Kill. Certainly not one of the masterpieces, but at least I felt like a movie. Moreover, Hollywood was pushing the envelope beyond the humble positions of sexuality, sexual obsessions, and insults. Now they take hard-core movies without heavy sex.
