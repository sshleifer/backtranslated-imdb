RELIGIOUS PROMOTION (RASHOMON style), from a pre-eminent way, to create a simple accusation that started in hesitantly, without hesitation from the COUNTRY. Around the clock mark, Sidney Lumet makes this movie more than just a piece of fragments; <br /> <br /> As with Lumet, she tries to collaborate in an exceptional way. exits from the star lantern, without a very magnificent or hypothermic imagination. Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of his best roles, is Ethan Hawke, a complex, mysterious and exciting character and often a dwarf, who plays Hank's brother. This does not mean that Hawke is not bad; in fact it is sufficiently superior to its style, in a troubled role. Marisa Tomei is excellent for a relatively short look (she cooks her body). The character of Albert Finney (Andy and Hank's father) is most interesting and, in my opinion, is a bit more worthy of the screen. Amy Ryan is also doing his job properly. <br /> <br /> The country is not a pre-eminent film from the country, but Lumet is still a famous career near the top of the game. Most features and trademarks are here, at least they use their symbols. A killer script (no purpose), intelligent dialogue and pacing, and a decent score. A real underrated gem. 8/10. 3 stars (from 4). Only in 248 we have to enter 250. Recommend.
