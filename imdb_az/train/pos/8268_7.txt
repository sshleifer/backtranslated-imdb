This is the second time that this film was filmed before 1911 and 1918. And in my film, OXFORD A YANK recalls. Both films come from one of the best schools in the world, and as a result, they show a slow pace of learning about teamwork and animosity. In this film, William Haines plays Tom Brown and his main opponent, Bob, by Frances X. Bushman. And in supporting role Jack Pickford - always remembered as brother of Mary. After the triumph, Pickford's Tom's dresses are as good as the sympathy loser - it has some amazing scenes, just like the dramatic moment before the Great Game! It has all the standard stereotypes and offers a few surprises since it has been filmed since many times before and since. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, try Harold Lloyd's FRESHMAN for a better silent college movie - this is clearly more interesting than soccer scenes, and Harold is much more enjoyable and more sympathetic than frustrating Tom Brown. FRESHMAN is probably one of the best college paintings of the time. Another reason for the slightest appearance of BROWN in HARWARD is that William Haines is the same and repeating and repeating (but also like WESTPOINT and SMART SET, among others). Well done, but of course it's not genuine! <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> It's just one rehash of these films Everyone who has given 10 films recommends viewing these movies. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 = This is the smallest movie in IMDb since 1920! Also, rate it as rated! There are better and better movies with them - who's guessed that this is # 1.
