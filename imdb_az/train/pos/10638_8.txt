When I think about this movie, all the adjectives that come to mind are somehow a matter of physical admiration in the world. The texture, smell, color, I think, should be evaluated in terms of this movie. Look at the rich golden tones surrounding the bed of the fireplace or the sparkling Turkish bath, and enjoy your senses, with a soft cloth, smooth skin, fragrant oils, flickering flames, satin rustle. Just be watching and listening, laughing, droning the story.
