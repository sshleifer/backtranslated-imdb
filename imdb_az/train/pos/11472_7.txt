As a fan of the phenomenon, which has been the subject of school shooting, this film has made an interesting and distinctive approach to the idea. The film presented by two troubled men (like a boy or teenager) can be presented as a series of video recordings, zero-day preparatory months (code name for the day when attacking the film) to present the weapon from the opposite side. They intend to describe the pain they suffer, but are now focused on preparing literal. The problem is not directly conveyed in terms of emotion. The only point where emotions are exacerbated has come to an end, as expected. However, they are moving towards this point, and it's not really clear why they're planning on it. They call us a compelling story, but the film also contradicts it. It was a great attempt to ruin the film and it was easy to say that it had a great deal of intentions, but it was short-lived due to the nervous filmmaking. All directors are amateurs to further enhance the concept of home cinema, but story and persistence are weak. The film does not want viewers to make a decision, but continues to notify the audience of such an event. The last moment does not seem to have ended and everything that the film has started.
