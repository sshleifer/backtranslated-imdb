Established in Japan, Ashura is the story of demons who are on earth. The stage is more complicated, but the arching storyline should not be forgotten. Japan is in confusion with Demons, who seizes the human form of the earth. In general, Demons looks at people and behaves, but it is bad. The Japanese word we use is not only demons but also a classic 'ogre' form of mythological creature with a few historical origin. <br /> <br /> But it is the green eyes and green teeth that appear when put in any human form. stress There's a Demon-Slayer to rescue the world from Demons. Trainers and experienced warriors who find and defeat any devil that protects the passage between hell and the real world. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the festival in the local city. In these festive events, 3 people are wearing all the black color and intentionally hurt them. The villagers, except the devils in nature, work except for those who open their eyes and try to kill them. Demon-Slayers kill the majority of demons. Here's a story interesting. The whole essence of the story begins when it comes to the three goalkeepers of the devil who describes a story going to hell, revealing the arrival of Ashura. With him, human rule will end and the demons will begin to rule. Ashura, however, requires the first step to take place during the opening fight, but requires some merging process that will not be described until you see the movie. 3 The devil is a murderous, wise, aged, mighty, but inexperienced, and an experienced and compassionate warrior. He immediately seeks to break the fragment between them, the old man who wants to stop the demons, the stronger, the desire to twist ego mania, and the third to seek the second. On the way, when he begins to fancy, he meets a woman and has a special relationship with her. In turn, it is any good brigade by the authorities. When it finally comes face to side, he puts his hand on his shoulder and suddenly sprinkles with a hint on his shoulder. Of course, the brand is not a good sign. <br /> <br /> The point that this movie has given me is nothing but a point for me. I would think it would be a horror film with demons or a horror movie with many bad and nasty creatures to be seen in Rwing and Ju. I was wrong in the best way. A similar story is the adaptation of a very old Japanese game, and in fact, it combines adrenaline scenes with a great concept, a beautiful narrative, playing in such a way and thinking more than just sitting on the lane. Many scenes are painted in a luxurious dialogue between the two characters that will never appear in the Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> The film uses a number of beautiful scenery and camera work compared to many beautiful Samurai films of the day, but also a well thought-out and classic plot. It should be in my book, with excellent acting, great music and a staggering scene. <br /> <br /> It is almost as though it is not for everyone that we have to give up. Its cheap camp is not horrific, walls are not wall movements. His film was a dreadful film that filmed. He can speak too much and spends time to do it, flies in front of an understandable liner. As with Japanese games, exchanges between characters can take a few minutes to come together for a quick and magnificent battle scene. You can do such a thing, it is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> If you're thinking about a good movie with very little plot and excessive naked flicks, then you can easily look at something else. <br /> <br /> Generally, for me, this movie is unique and incredible and has fun. good writing, good motion and good direction. All this is a solid film.
