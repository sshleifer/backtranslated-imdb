This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Perhaps, I live a few miles from the village because the story takes place and I know how to work in Sweden. The movie tells the truth, I believe! He also criticizes and honors Dalarna's lifestyle, and produces the people watching the film more closely with friends and relatives and wants more attention. <br /> <br /> But in another small country in any country in Sweden (or in another country) you will get acquainted with this movie. <br /> <br /> Thank you Maria Blom!
