The next two seasons of the original series were less than thirty. The disastrous change in the last season has led to the three-season short-lived life. <br /> <br /> For the first time after the first season, when we get out of the season at the end of the season, we will probably achieve a cul-de-sac. <br /> <br /> In addition, the first season was really fun! It was smart, intelligent, hopeful with great writing. Excellent seasonings of the first season include the right ingredients - characters / actors, storyline, etc. A comedy about a paparazzi reporter was also original for boot. <br /> <br /> Nora and her fellow "photographers", day and night, day and night, exclusives for the day. <br /> <br /> Many things are not logical for me. Gross Pointe never "did it" - like this show and my other fav. If only Naked Truth and Grosse Pointe's first episodes were broadcast on the DVD, would I ask everyone there?
