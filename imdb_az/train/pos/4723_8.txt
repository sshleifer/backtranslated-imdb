I really enjoyed this little movie. This fight is a moving film about sacrificial and especially friendship gardens of different peoples (especially the kid playing Miki). There are many large-scale unidentified films around the WW2, which is a convincing way to break a small story from the norm, and that's something original. And I'll add that this movie is too far away! Of course, the horses are beautiful and the scenery is scenic. You award this movie especially to anyone who accepts animals as a part of the family. Fans seeking a little different thing are offered to fans.
