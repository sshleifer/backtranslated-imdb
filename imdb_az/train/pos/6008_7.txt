When I first saw the movie in the early 1970's, I fled from fear of this movie. Vision and the events in Europe and the United States were linked to the fact that Antonioni was trying to say in the last 15 minutes of the film: the foundation of "tyranny" businesses and great business interests in your mind. Reproduction of a beautiful home in the middle of a desert is a portrait of a major female character in psychedelic designs (even british a few years ago), which has been copied by advertisers all over the world for decades. <br /> <br /> After the release of the film, Pink Floyd increased her love. <br /> <br /> You will see this movie about 30 years later and you start to wonder why the same movie has lost its appeal. Today there are more articles than anti-creation films - facts, documents, beautiful speeches and perfect scenarios. Antonioni seems outdated; a defective genius. <br /> <br /> Today, watching Antony's film "Blow Up" is a part of this: <br /> <br /> Why should Zubriski Point be evaluated when it is released? Unlike torn television screens, if you see a large Panavision screen, it's a great movie. The film's visual and bright (Mick Jagger, Kiet Richards, Pink Floyd, and others) are still in the movie. The lead pair did not have great actors, but they were cute and naturally. One of them (Mark Frechette) died in prison in the United States. <br /> <br /> Today, Antonioni does not appear in "sync". Look closely and regular actors - Rod Taylor, G.D. Spradling, the ladies in the pool, the cops at the air strip. Instead, realistic voices are non-conformists. Antonio was 30 years old, but the middle part of today is also questionable. He knew what he was doing.
