Okay, this was a pretty damn good episode. <br /> <br /> The camera work is beautiful. The best yet. I love this last shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are great, and the guest (the helpless ones) is strong. <br /> <br /> What I do not like about this episode is something that is not explained. Why Does Sex Change? What is the purpose? and they are aliens? how? <br /> <br /> I give this episode a high star. It's still one of my favorites, but I'm worried about the pit holes. Still, I do not need to destroy my entertainment.
