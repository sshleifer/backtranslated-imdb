One of the 80's favorite shows. After the first season, Jan Bruce did not go downhill when he decided to add Scott. Deborah Pratt was beautiful and fun with him, and the character of Ernest Borgny went with each other. He was one of my favorites during the second episode. Unfortunately, in those days, the Roma did not last long in television shows. Part of the second season is good, but the third season was about more people than Airwolf, and was almost not shown at the end of the show. It was disgusting when you went to the US!
