I do not mean that this is not a good movie, but a very good version of the real event and good image. And if you have a WW2 buff, this is a treat for you because it's three of the four saboteur members who play a role in this movie. <br /> <br /> I personally must have been hundreds of people because I was one of the heroes of nearly two-thirds of the World War II. <br /> <br /> So, an action extravaganza, renting private Ryan, is the truth about the far-reaching pain, ugly endurance and the desire to fight when it's missing.
