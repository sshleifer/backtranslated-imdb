The narrative confirms the classic description of good and evil in the form of a brotherhood struggle against a brother. The main character James Stewart plays Lin Macadam represents justice and righteousness. Steven McNally, a native of the Dutch Henry Braun, stands by his side as a classic scene coachinger who has been violating the law in the west and killed his father. The world of the story is the classic dystopia, the only way to prevent its residents from killing each other is to eliminate their extinguishing as long as they enter the city, and the man responsible for keeping this law and order is a classic western lawyer, Wyat Earp. <br /> <br /> Today, there are also typical western typical heroes, for example, Indian martyred warriors, besieged cavalry, and girls with a coat-tipped coat. <br /> <br /> Another important archetype in the film is a special Winchester rifle that gives the name of the movie. The weapon can be regarded as an appendage to the prizes awarded to honorable ones. After being stolen from the rights holder, it brings tragedy to anyone who connects with it. In this sense, Lost Ark resembles the other symbols, such as the sacred cage in the Raiders, and the letters bleeding in the individual Ryan Saving. The film is, in fact, an element of reality, not a genre that is beyond the west, an unfamiliar form for esoteric themes and symbols. <br /> <br /> In fact, this element of revenge is shared by Jack Arnold's No Name in the Bulletin and many other examples, such as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> Winchester also has an issue of rape '73. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the men who played very efficiently by Dan Duryea, captured the woman after killing her husband. Volatile cowboy toys, with a spitting husband, send a cats cartoon in the insect before cutting his head. Waco Johnny Dean finally arrives after he's in contact with the failed Winchester rifle. The main story of Winchester '73 is reminiscent of Jason's mythological tales and his research on the golden cliff as described in Apollonius' Argonautica. Both stories deal with the purchase of a sacred object with some sort of immaterial quality. Like Jason, Steward's character continues to look for one type of adventure on one of the adventures. Another topic in Winchester is a struggle between brothers who are like a mythical fairy tale. In the antiquity, several stories deal with this issue, such as the story of St. Cain and Abel in Hebrew, and vulgar tales of Romulus and Remus. When it comes to the subject of theft and aggression in the film Anthony Mann, he takes part in many mythological works, such as the European aggression in Ovid's Metamorphosis. <br /> <br /> Winchester is a delicate example of the western genre of '73 and provides objective correlation for many classic American western and ancient mythological themes.
