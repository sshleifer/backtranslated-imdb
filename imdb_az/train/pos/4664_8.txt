"Hot Million" is a nice comedy that has been further enhanced by the presence of beautiful pumps for this. The film respects the genius of Peter Ustinov, who records the screen game and looks like the main figure of an entrepreneur invader. <br /> <br /> The film, directed by Eric Tillin, has not shown quite a few signs, like some others since then. <br /> <br /> Marcus Pendleton, a friend in the center of life, corrects income tax forms for a surprising supervisor, who is surprised by the government's debt repayment before being released from jail. Marcus, a genius in numbers, sees opportunities that others do not have. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> but Pendleton is a talented person who finds a way to take advantage of the system and creates various counterfeit accounts across the continent. A secretary with a flat in the Marcus office is appointed. Bravely Patty acts as a bus driver who manages to avoid everything. Patty's heart is owned by Marcus, a successful pianist, when she decides to go after her, but when it comes to no fear, she is a flutist and we build beautiful music together. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Peter Ustinov. Marcus clearly understood how the film was played and filmed. Mr. Ustinov gives a reliable account of the internally displaced. <br /> <br /> The perfect Maggie Smith is doing everything she can to get Patty, a dignified woman who admits Markus and invests in the money she finds in Marcus's pockets. <br /> <br /> Karl Malden is perfect as America is responsible for the corporation. Bob Newhart looks like Gnatpole who wants Patty, but can not get his interlocutor. The magnificent Robert Morley looks like Caesar Smith, whose identity Marcus cope with. Cesar Romero's airport looks like a community inspector. <br /> <br /> "Zero Millions" will be delighted to be looking for an entertaining time at this unusual but tempting Marcus Pendleton company.
