Jean Eustache could be seen as a coup in sex, a "revolution" (but I use quotation marks), poetic, loving love for those who do not seem like writing and directing Anna and Whore. There is a message to this movie, and I hope this message will only come after offering the character of the Ben-Hur length, I hope for somebody to be honest, to be honest, the level of happiness is real. Is it possible to have two lover? Some may try, but if someone does not really have what they want, what can be the result or even they can even say what they want? <br /> <br /> What is the truth of Alexandre's (Jean-Pierre Leaud) relationships with women around? She has had twenty-one things, not a single job, and she lives with Marie (Bernadette Lafont), a little older woman, and usually, if she does not always, her lover, the last possible love -life has left her and immediately afterward he saw a woman in Verona (Fran√ßoise Lebrune) who sees in the street. Soon, what happens is that the psychological poems are the smallest triangle of love in the film, with the most brutal words and the most remote part of the traits. At first, we can think of what happens to Alexander, but we're wrong. <br /> <br /> Women say that sex is part of a revolution, and if love and sex are talked about and talk about this issue is not entirely practiced (perhaps I can not say that I did not see the first hand), freedom and lack of inhibitory behavior. But if Eustache's point is not entirely a message, it's impossible to have these two ways: people will not love you and will not wait for the last friendship with "f *** ing". the character applies again and again. <br /> <br /> This is a fear that when you are mentally stimulated in the talk speeches you see in a movie, as well as Mom and Whore's powerful theme, the absence of monogamy. And we're looking at a character like Alexandre. Probably, he says he or she is talking about a bad thing from the movie or past, Eustache himself is not ambitious - but it is ambitious that it's just what they need to use alone, morning and evening alone with their inner deficiencies . <br /> <br /> If you were thinking about movies before sunrise / sunset, you did not encounter it if you had a conversation. But in Eustache's dialogues these symbols are sometimes emotionally or negligent or not boring, either deeply or negatively, either sexually or sincerely or sometimes extremely extreme (or extravagant). On the contrary, for those who can not get enough * good * talky movie, this is exceptional. <br /> <br /> Eustache's new wave touch symbols, then reverberating. <br /> <br /> Realism, which is a part of the attitude, is timely, irrelevant and shattering, and without embarrassment. All three actors are embedded in their characters so that we will never be able to recognize them as "emotion" or melodrama. It is almost certainly natural / realistic, but there is no other way around in Eustache's material. Fortunately, Leaud gives the ladies the chip of her career and the ladies, especially Labrun, such as "prostitute" Veronica (who claims to have been denied a strange kind of film). Like any other touch, often every directing director is in a quiet moment, listening to himself, listening to a record, and in a strange or calm affliction. This is probably the biggest impact of Jim Jarmusch, an entirely (and lovingly) scene, dedicated to Eustache's Broken Flowers movie, and especially from the late Parisian approach. Eustache or I have never heard of this movie before shopping for Broken Flowers, and it has become very difficult to buy it (not available on the US DVD, and in the VHS it has become rare for a few months at different libraries) . It did not frustrate for a moment; Mom and Whore are a really nice job, one of France's best-selling relationship dramas, perhaps even the most strikingly clear I've ever seen in the country. It's sophisticated, sweet, cold, swallowing, and very long, perhaps too long. I also agree on the level I have compared with a Scenes from a marriage; 35 years after the release of each film, true discoveries about human condition are emerging.
