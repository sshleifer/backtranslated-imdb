When I was a child, I watched this movie and, of course, it was tears with this story of a bumpy family. Fantastic scenery in Hokkaido, a great storytelling, and the latter provide a rare proximity to heroes of the finest movie creations. I am still looking for a copy of a gorgeous soundtrack. It is useful for German viewers to know that DEFA's dubbing is something that needs to be listened. I'm bandaged (DEFA and BR), but I just watch the first.
