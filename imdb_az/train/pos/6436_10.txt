Ingrid Bergman was considered a temporarily poor Polish of Paris in the 1900s and found himself pursuing the most common and glamorous figure of France, and he engaged in shoe arts. This is one of the most important issues in one of the most sensitive areas in film history. General's behind-the-scenes are political torture, downstream balloonist, and Bastille Dai, but this gorgeously-directed film is the crazy upstairs / bottom intrigues that cover randy slaves and just a few limited aristocrats. Yes, this game redux rules. Even before Gaston Modot puts a jealous jerky look in the rules - less like a gypsy! Things are a little bit thicker and faster, resulting in some confusion for non-French languages, but what is heck - Elena and Men are a deeper human Renoir work.
