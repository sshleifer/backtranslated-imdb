This show was great and I was always looking forward to watching it. All the characters, in turn, were funny and awesome, each episode provided an incredible laugh and was completely fun and different from many other shows. Everyone was just laughing and breathtaking, so you can not help, but you would not love this show. There were several dead weight episodes, but the '70s Show was always able to create any unpleasant atmosphere, this matter.This was one of the best demonstrations ever to be broadcast and I'll be able to watch this show at any time because it will never be old, it is useless and is never interested.
