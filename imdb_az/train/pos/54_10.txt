The house is busy with high school photography like Columbus, but not with hashing about the emergence of the film, but what happened to the victims, their traumas, guilt and denial. <br /> <br /> Spoiler * The shooting itself is regarded as a result of a shootout of a middle-class student, with no other action, except the reaction of a young SWAT team. The film has three heroes; <br /> <br /> A detective who investigated the murder of Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps, both of whom were innocent, and two young girls survived the incident. Erika Christensen, though only around 24, has been acquainted with a very strong and reliable player. Busy Philipps, who was three years older than Christensen, and I was completely unknown to myself, drowned me in the presence of great dramatic force and screen. <br /> <br /> This is a big movie, and it is intimate with the fragile and growing relationship between the two traumatized girls.
