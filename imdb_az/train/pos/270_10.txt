I have to say that Seventeen & Missing is better than I am. <br /> <br /> Dedee Pfeiffer, daughter, Lori (Tegan Moss), Lori (Tegan Moss) did not attend a weekly vacations, but Lori does not see her mother's wishes and leaves for the party anyway. <br /> <br /> When Lori does not come home, Emilie knows something is wrong, and begins to take on the story of his daughter's vision and her disappearance. <br /> <br /> Seventeen & Missing is better than many other television movies. this kind of thing will not be foreseen. Pfeiffer is the foundation to see this movie, and most comes in convincing. The LMN Genuine Movie was released last night. 10/10
