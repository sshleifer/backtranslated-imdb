Claire Denis has repeatedly demonstrated that the film does not have to explain a story, it is enough to create an experience that allows the audience to take things and make what they want. <br /> <br /> An Outstanding Idea In the framework of a non-linear film, an elderly man on the French-Swiss border, a man dedicated to the bride, still has a lover, but the cardiac condition is increasingly endangering his life. She has a small family but only meets with her, but she sees a need for a heart transplant that she chooses to go from Japan to Tahiti to get a heart transplant in the black market and to renew long lost relationships. a year ago Tahiti women had created. <br /> <br /> Denis uses this camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the broadness of nature, the interaction of man with humans, and so on. The film is more than mandatory, but this is because we are so tough to combine all the points laid out before the beautiful pictures. <br /> <br /> Life is such a thing: we look, see, observe, integrate, process, and do it. <br /> When using the form of this movie (very 'beautiful Beau Travail') Claire Denis developed a signature technology. Whether or not the viewer finds a finished product's reward, it is also very relevant to the individual methods of visual and conceptual data processing. This is an interesting and intriguing movie, but many viewers will talk for a very long time. Probably will still follow. Grady Harp
