When I set out to prepare the top ten of the 1990s, I revisited Grand Canyon this year ago. I first saw the movie at the age of 17. How did I hear it? <br /> <br /> <strong> Reviewed by Sissel & Ebert in 1991 and recommended at a high level and shot a year later. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, a strong movie, listening to really listening to each other. Now I've seen six times, and it inspires me and inspires me every subsequent look. But why is the poor looking for this movie? Maltin's movie guide gives two of four. Very melodramatic, very coincidental, very neat, most read phrases. Yes, there is melodrama in this story, and yes, it's a coincidence. But it provides a fresh, visible density and strength. In the Grand Canyon, such as driving, police surveillance, earthquakes, a love affair, finding a baby in a bush, a fever, a driver for the entire "plan" as a result of a new accident, and secular advice from a homeless person The film won due to clever performances by Kevin Kline, Steve Martin, Mary McDonnell, Alfre Woodard, Danny Glover and Jeremy Sisto. This is due to Lawrence Kasdan's skillful direction and writing. It's not just a movie when you think of a sequence of Kevin Cloe's four black-eyed young people at the beginning of the film. Danny Glover plays a tow truck driver who helps Kline's character, but before being harassed by the leader of the gang. <br /> <br /> Listen to the dialogue as the child offers Glover: "Are you afraid of me or have a weapon?". <br /> <br /> The Grand Canyon is full of a concept scene. Steve Martin is a filmmaker with a heart-shaped film, and is a well-supported actor and then a candidate for change in mind. In my opinion, it is a virtue of idealism that can lead us to the character of "good", but we are warning that we must fight for a lasting, not sustainable struggle. <br /> <br /> I will disappear forever on the scene of the new releases on the Grand Canyon video store. However, those engaged in older releases up to 99 cents, I would like to ask everyone who reads this to us, thank you after renting, Grand Canyon is a special thing. Magnolia, you love a movie that is a great ensemble of deep humanistic topics, you will love Grand Canyon.
