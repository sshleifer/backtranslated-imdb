Gandhi Dad is a beautiful movie. Describes the life of Gandhiji's eldest son, Harryl. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his resistance, his failure, his ego .. Akshaye Khanna Harilal's role is completely justified. Not only did he behave well, but everyone in the role he played. Darshan Jariwala, the best screen I've ever seen is Gandhiji. <br /> <br /> Firstly, the movie was fifteen hundred twenty minutes. Secondly, the film has taken more of Harry's character. Somewhere, the character was incomplete. Also, he did not associate with his brothers. Gandhiji's other child was not mentioned in the whole film. <br /> <br /> Harilal's character must be the least different brothers and I believe that he should consider the selfish nature of Harilal. <br /> <br /> Well, in spite of some shortcomings I liked the movie.
