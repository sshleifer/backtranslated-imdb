Let's not just mention Pierce Brosnon's best performance. Of course, Greg Kinnear is always good. Was it really bad then? I think this movie is incredibly bad! The use of colors in this film is a different thing in today's movie world, where each film has a Payback blue filter. I also love using Asian songs. <br /> <br /> Recalling that he thought he was a bit cheesy as a couple of times, he could actually put it right. <br /> <br /> This is the first feature when I go out. My film did not have anything in the genre that was free of being a hit-man movie. After seeing, I'm convinced that the process has an impact on me. When I came to IMDb, my movie was pretty cool to recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know what others are related to, and I'm more interested in it. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
