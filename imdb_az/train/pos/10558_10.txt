<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman appeared in a strange metaphysical moment, but this Canadian gem gave it a boon. <br /> <br /> Like most strange movies, they talked better about something better, but the scene was determined by two friends, Anthony and Dave, since they have been together since childhood, have no understanding of the world, and eventually they have a long time. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie very much, I smiled after the last credits, and there is not a lot of massive "nothing", a rare experience. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this. <br /> <br />
