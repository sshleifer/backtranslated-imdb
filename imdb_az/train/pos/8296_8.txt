Everything in Suburbia has a new job in a father company and is idyllic when a small family moves. But no paradise would be completed without a snake. Strangely enough, it's as if the family joined the unmarried local country club and, of course, kept secrets. The Father is not a carpenter, but the one who joins in the neighborhood and in the work is joining it. Robert Uriet's good guy is a little surprising, but Joanna Cassidy is like a good-looking housewife, who has become a treacherous betrayal. Sus√ßan Lucci is a sensible and well-prepared refrigerator as head of the club board. Look at Michael Berryman, who is fond of a smaller section like Valet. Film captures the sense of paranoia and special effects are waiting for the final. I've seen this movie a few times.
