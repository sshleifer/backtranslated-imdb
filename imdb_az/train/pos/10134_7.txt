Horror masters: The right to die, married couple Abby (Julia Anderson) and Ciff Addison (Martin Donovan) begin to go home one night later, but Cliff collapses on a tree falling on the road while talking. Cliff's airbag is OK, and he is facing minor injuries, unfortunately Abby does not belong to him, and when he was thrown out of the car he ended up as a toaster and burned his whole burnt petrol. Abby's life was saved. He was seriously injured in a fire and was taken to the hospital where he supported the aggressive life. Cliff must die, his selfish lawyer, Ir (Corbin Bersen), wants Abby's death, car maker abuse, and Abby's blame for the Pam (Linda Sorenson) Cliff, to be rich and save Abby to think of. But Abby himself has other plans ... <br /> <br /> This American Canadian joint production was directed by Rob Schmidt (horror film was originally a wrong turn (2003)) and Horror TV Series Masters 2 season 9 was episode. I saw Die Right, the best masters of the Horror episode I've ever seen, all of which still do not come as bad as Screwfly Solution (2006). John Esposito's script is not a new thing, it's a little incomplete, it uses the first 15 minutes to direct the horror to the story, but then goes on when Abby's drama becomes a drama like a legitimate battle for 20 minutes He entered into a state of tranquility and took Cliff to the center stage before returning, and this would not be a heartbreaking heart. . A little clich√©d, a weak man, a wounded lawyer, a protective mother, and a young man who is sexually exploited for the desires of the character, but all serve the purpose, the dialogue is good, the story <br /> <br /> Return to me somewhere for a few minutes I earned the right and generally liked it. <br /> <br /> Director Schmidt does a good job. and there are some effective scenes, it runs an alternative between low basic spooky atmosphere and out-out blood and gore. As usual, there are fantastic special makeup effects, and Abby has burned his whole body and shows his teeth with his teeth, as there is no lip and no makeup effects of Hellraiser (1987) and similar scenes, and then Cliff is a basic lesson that draws skin closer to each other and squeezes the skin immediately. Put in a muscle and a refrigerator box! Very horrible. There are also different types of body parts. Here are some nudity when at least a few beautiful ladies are naked ... <br /> <br /> Technically, the right to die is very good, special effects are brilliant, and most feared episodes have no masters. Actually, if it is based on truth, It looks like an exhibition. <br /> <br /> <strong> ATTENTION <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> The deepest scene! An hour for those who have stomach cancer ...
