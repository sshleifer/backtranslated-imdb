I accidentally saw the kind of "Fever Pitch"; He was playing on the plane to Europe. Actually half is not bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the # 1 Red Sox fan in the world, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks can be aggravated by that. The film is a very interesting look at how world events can affect people's relationships. Now that Red Sox's 80-year career has come to an end, they are especially eye-catching. I guess that such things happen all the time, and they just do not tend to see them. <br /> <br /> Some movies are a movie that shows an unusual attitude to baseball. 2000 "Frequency". Check both.
