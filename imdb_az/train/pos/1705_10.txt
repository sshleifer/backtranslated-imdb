"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest films I've seen. I understand why this film was not a good critic, funny, harmless, and sweet. I was watching this at the age of 11 and really liked it. Two days later I took over VHS: -P I have shown so many friends so far, and everyone liked it, but nobody knew the previous movie. I think this problem is almost unknown to anyone, so it is almost nobody likes ... This movie has no real chance, it's sad, "SI" is really Monsters Inc. "or" Spaceballs. "Okay, enough dissatisfaction - I mean, if you want to laugh at your head, look! Even if you are not crazy about it, it's worth it! -> Prepare to laugh, landfall!
