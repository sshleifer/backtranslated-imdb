To my surprise, I was delighted with Disney's latest animated installment. The film had shortcomings, but I generally felt that the story was strong and related to symbols. It was nice to see a non-musical Animated Disney movie. We are limited to Tarzan. Fortunately, they rested on their music. Another good thing about the film is that the comedy does not diminish completely (a la Hercules), but it is fine that children are still laughing, and adults do not feel trivial or just stupid. <br /> <br /> It was a frustration animation. You will move along with all the great animated cartoons out of the Disney studio and think that they will hold you a little. There is one thing about the tradition, but imagine the possibilities of the story of Atlantis! Generally, the movie was fun and definitely worth a visit to the multiplex. <br /> <br />
