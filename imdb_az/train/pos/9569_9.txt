As I understand, China, after misleading Hong Kong, sad Cat. 3 The Hong Kong movie film disappeared. At least so far and this is a beautiful movie. I knew it was going to be a rough crime drama, but it was the first Cat. <br /> <br /> Recently I bought what I was not sure of. <br /> <br /> A Cambodian clashman went to Hong Kong to bid a judge's wife. The judge corrected the injured man because he threatened to divorce the judge and take all his money. All this is known in the first ten minutes, so nothing is removed. After the Hitten, the cops find the cunning man very fast, but several policemen and civilians are killed to catch him. She is leaving the police and now she is ready to catch the boy before fleeing Cambodia. It's a never-ending movie, and it does not give the viewer the chance to breathe. Yes, it is very violent and tough, and many police are killed, because the man proves to be very difficult to follow, and when they find him, they fall. On the way, a cunning man trying to hide in the street finds that a woman is being harassed and is condemned by a man. He helps him and rescues him from the boy, and pleases him to take him along with the cunning. I liked this movie very much, only one move led to another, and the police are sometimes acting as a bad guy or bad, and as a roller coaster with high speed moving. The player is pretty good, and shooting and photography are in the breathtaking time. There is nothing like this movie, even a very incredible end. The latter is incredibly incredible and is an end to all acts and violence. Yes, violence is sometimes cruel, but it's not a bad crime drama that puts off your socks. "Dog Eat Dog" should be broadcast more widely, including an R1 release. Great movie, highly recommended.
