Movie is definitely a masterpiece! Goodnight Mr. Tom has been one of my favorite films of all time. No one should ignore this movie, it is good! Mr. Thom is perfectly described by John Thaw as a tough old man who has become a soft father when William Beech (Nick Robinson) was sent to him by provocation like "City mouse and country mouse". Real heart stripping movie. The director knew exactly how the book was for the film, and he did it in a very good way. The film was so beautifully drawn that the characters' emotions and the events that had taken place had created many feelings of fear that fostered love, and these emotions could turn six pins. During the era of World War II, this film shows differences between cities and villages, which are almost identical to different countries. It should be absolutely sure that they are not missing in a really nice and bright film.
