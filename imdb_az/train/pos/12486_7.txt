Yes, this movie is really a difficult thing. To keep you upright, this movie does not contain many story stories, but it does not want to know how to end it ... but now I'll tell you something ... never tense and splashed in my life! This movie is sure to bring jokes and excitement! To be fair, I was watching for almost half of the night, so I was sleeping in any case, perhaps for that reason I was telling you not to jump ... or maybe that's the movie! It's about a couple who lost their children mainly in a tragic event. They decide to rent and rent the mountains looking for a cab ... they look my peace and quiet until the first look (the main character and I think she brings her husband) ... she sings her husband's sounds at night ... checks him and things really do not really go wrong ... they do not have to stay another day and nothing is wrong saying nothing is left <br /> <br /> Short cut a long story ... learns what happened in the last few years and will decide to care for her. <br /> <br /> This is not a Hollywood blockade but a big budget, but I ask you to extinguish it. It's creepy, tense and very charming! Just give it a try :)
