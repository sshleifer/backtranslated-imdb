<br /> <br /> This film is great for raising souls. <br /> <br /> Every time I watch, I see and hear the funny little things I've been doing before. <br /> <br /> It just sounds incredible. <br /> <br /> Mick Jones (Foreign) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) have stunned their songs, making the stranger the best thing in today's music scene. Unfortunately, Strange Fruit is not a group that has not started because of drug use and domestic violence. <br /> <br /> Fruit is inspired by Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who'. <br /> <br /> Each Fruit member is quite memorable. Stephen Rea broke down and died as Toni Costello, who was asked by a festival initiator to reunite his team for a group's reunion tour with hopes to make money. <br /> <br /> Juliette is approaching the old Karen Knowles, a song performed by Juliet Aubrey to help her dream upgrade the past. <br /> <br /> Juliet, Jimmy Nail (Les Wickes) David 'Beano' Baggot) and the glamorous Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). <br /> <br /> Juliet is looking for the last member of her heroic group, not humiliating, hippie-toker-jokester Hughie (Billy Connolly), who never allows the burning of the fire <br /> <br /> Composer Brian Lovell (Bruce Robinson played together), the members who come together, fight on one another's rusty talent, like the old times. <br /> <br /> Then group a small Dutch tour, prepare for the festival. With Luke Shand (Hans Matheson), as the young Hendrix, replacing Lovell, the crew continues on the road. Sparks flames their memories as they flush and threaten to burn their unfinished goals. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to laugh, read, manifest, and cry as these memorable characters return to your hearts. .
