This is a pretty surprise. Hero's quest is a sweet little story, a very astounding metamorphosis, a four-prissy-in-the-be-spinster type, and a bare DD-cup sex queen. <br /> <br /> Not only for the two-actress, but also for the costume and makeup of the actors for the outstanding eyes. <br /> <br /> When you return to the positives: The film is spiced with some unusual outdoor camera shots that you do not expect in a soft core. With squeals, I loved the scene with absolutely classic potential. It's a little negative for a few odd scenes (because many of the smaller areas have stopped moving away from swindling in a short time). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
