AMICUS is the third horror anthology of the house, which is home to a building. If it had been included as part of the MONSTER CLUB series, it would take eight classes. Although this movie is very different to others <br /> <br /> As I love when I am young, I am fond of Amicus anthology with great memories. <br /> <br /> I've been working for many years to watch this movie. The stories from the stories were attractive because I was finally going to pay a significant amount of money for a copy. As the movie was big, I finally felt disappointed when I saw it. It was not as good as we believed. <br /> <br /> <strong> Even though it's better than two predecessors, I'm a good indicator, and I do not have a good place as the fourth heir. <br /> <br /> An affair, John Bennett sees as a police inspector watching a missing person living at a mysterious age. His travels begin with the local police unit, who learned the stories of previous occupants. The connecting story then went to the real estate agent selling the house. This related story continues to be praiseworthy in practice, it is straightforward and lifeless and is easily the weakest of the Amicus anthology. I could not help, but John Bennett could not feel that Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry was a poor man. I would see one of the two actors out there who took over my role. There was even one here - one of the police inspector and the second one as a property agent. <br /> <br /> I thought that the movie brought this poor element of the movie to a better life. <br /> <br /> The film consists of four houses and each one is standing on a resident of the house. <br /> <br /> Denholm Elliott sees the first floor as a writer of crime. He goes into an exciting story about a fascinant, and even goes on to draw a sketch to help his writing. Coming soon, he begins to see his vision of his creations. Particularly with the choice of camera angles, Peter Duffel's some great features reduce the limited scenarios. Elliott's performance is as superior as an angry writer, and it also helps raise the story. The story ends with half-twisting, but I will not be able to get the meaning of a script that does not allow it to compromise its potential. <br /> <br /> Peter Kushing's home on the second floor. She is still a naked man for a beautiful young woman who pushes her at once and holds a picture. Cushing's performance really implements this emotionally-charged story. She helps the filmmaker who chooses to pay attention to Cushing's mistake. This is taken even further with a great hallucination scenario that helps Cushing see inside my mind. In any case, Cushing sees a figure in a nearby wax museum that resembles his daughter. Of course, his disobedience is growing, but this romantic story ends. Joss Ackland plays Cushing's opponent, but his performance remains massively shattered by the delayed great Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> The third story and the best of all, she sees Christopher Lee, the most beloved actress of all time - his daughter. Mr Lee here gives you a cool ice-cold performance. She does not have any love and attention to her daughter. She even brings school guidance to her education. Nyree Shafak Porter tries to find out if another player in the other prizes is wrong. Gambling plays a role without being too far away. Christopher Lee's participation is really exciting at every stage she's in. Chloe Franks deserves a special recognition for his massive nonsensical performance, such as the little girl who is easily the most surprised in the entire movie. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching the movie even if it's just a story. <br /> <br /> The final story is almost completely played for laughter, but of course it is fun and it is important. Jon Pertwee plays a fearsome movie player into the house. Drawing producers is very dissatisfied with the approach they see as cheap and counterfeit, especially suits. So he decides to buy the original cover for the ultimate vampire role. Geoffrey Bayldon has a perfect community of dealers who sell Pertwee as an old dresser. When Pertwee puts a coat, he begins to develop the teeth and turns into a vampire. Pertwee's performance should see. It's really funny. <br /> <br /> Ingrid Pitt is also involved in this story, but his talent is a role that needs to be greater. <br /> <br /> The closing story is closely linked to the final story. This is especially looking for the inspector Pertwee and naturally decides to visit the home. The rest can work for you. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> > <strong> Despite the events in the Caucasus, he does his best with its director Peter Duffell. <br /> <br /> Military operations against Caucasian refugees continue. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; amicus anthology, admirers of other Amicus movies and fans of portmanteau movies.
