One of my best films, since I went to the punk scene at the end of the 70s, and since I went to many hazelnuts concert, the movie was a good story line and moved with a very good nuts and it was not until Phil Daniels was coming out of his latest project about Eastenders sure If you're greedy, if you keep your eyes off the perfect performance by many actors you're expecting, many of the British soaps today exp: Carver's Bill Bill, still have a night with video, do not forget to drag the safety pin to the nose and the heavy black eye makeup and head Mochanian style shave .... Enjoy
