Yes, it may not have gone and it's not as funny as a lot of high-budget comedies, but it's really fun when you really look at it. Tim Meadows always has fun with me at live show on Saturday night. I laughed at the show when this character would do. After seeing one night playing in the Comedy Center, I decided to check it out. All the movies were so impressive to me because he did not mean to win any Oscars or comedy of the year, but on the Saturday night, loving the character of the Ladies Man, he was entertaining the live fans. This movie is packed with some of the precious lines that are read for years to come.
