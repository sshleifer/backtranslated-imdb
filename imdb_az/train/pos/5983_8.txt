For the first time, I've seen this movie as a teenager. Heavy metal was the time when he controlled the world. Trick Or Treat has every element for a film full of clips. How can you go wrong with a castle that features Skippy's Family Ties, Kiss Kiss, and a Preacher of Ozzy Osbourne? Returning bad message is played over vinyl! Yes it is true, they use notes in this movie. At one stage, Eddie (Skippy) listens to a message from a bad rockstar on a record player before things get scared. The monsters begin to emerge from the speakers and have a stereo. As a teenager, she hoped to get my notes back. About 20 years later, Trick or Treat is still one of the favorite films of all time.
