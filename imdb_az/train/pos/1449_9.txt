This is one of the best crime-drama films in the late 1990s. A large fortress filled with a powerful story and many of the participants gave great speeches. Pacino was great; must be a candidate for something. John Cusack was as good as Louuu-siana did not pay attention to. If you can not stand this dialect, it can be boring. The interaction of Pacino's character with Cusack's character was incredible, dramatic, and sometimes funny. Danny Aiello was always as superior as ever. David Paymer was great in supporting role. Bridget Foundation was good, but not memorable. This picture has probably reminded many of the many characters. Let's remind, what was Zapatti? After much cross-reference, you have to stop and think just to recap. There were not many sting at the end. It was so long, and then it was a little longer. It was a problem with the movie. Forget about the fact that the film was not "billed" as the "big, destructive" big screen limit. Pacino and Aiello were very nice, but the lack of "splashes" in the film could have caused no nomination. The home market was semi-successful and the audience is still learning that the name is there. <br /> So you have a lemon pudding (see) and watch this movie!
