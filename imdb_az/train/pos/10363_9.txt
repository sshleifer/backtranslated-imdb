Spoiler Followed: If I took the book "Bad Angels" when I first appeared, without knowing nothing. Just before the start of questioning the press and the Austrian people for a break, I began questioning the Gameley blame. The author obviously meant that the reader understood that the public was jumping to the conclusions they had made. John Bryson said that the story had been cut short by Cameron, the keys were still made, bloody fifty diameters and so on, as John Bryson presented to the jury members (and selected by the press) of the artery spray, coin (?) Plates. he could not take away all his clothes. After all, they were experts in their field, without any reason to lie, and did not clearly see that the evidence was completely wrong. It was a high technical evidence that was hard to understand. From this point of view, it was difficult to say that in the experiments, there were no clear dumbbells on the edge of some explicit statements; People did not believe that it was possible. The public suspected the Church of the Seventh-Day Adventists, whose roots seemed to be a cult, and all kinds of honest beliefs about them led to the guilt. If it were not for self-sacrificing lawyers, who had been investigating the case and persistently persecuted to prosecute, finding out Azaria's clothes would not have been enough to remove Lindy from prison. The book therefore compressed me, and since then I have not yet come to a conclusion about anyone's guilt (of course, except OJ). I did not think that a movie would be done about it and that it could be done in a better way. I always love to meet Sam and Meryl was always perfect. Beautiful photography, amazes music. In my opinion, this is a very important film, not very good. Very bad, he did not get more propaganda when he was released.
