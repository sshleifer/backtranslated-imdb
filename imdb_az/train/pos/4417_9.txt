This film is a lyrical and romantic memoir, described by the eyes of a 11-year-old boy living in the Cuban city of the Castro Revolution year. It is the true worth of labor of love. <br /> <br /> KUBA LIBRE and KUBAN GAN are simply trying to sell them as an action movie. JULIAN'S FALLING gives more meaning. Compared with RAMBO, it links with European cinema and the revolution is just anxiety for people's daily lives and desires. <br /> <br /> In Cuban history, this film is more honest than most of the works that cover this period. <br /> <br /> The excessive use of the voice narrator breaks the story, but it's inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Like cinema criticism of movies about CINEMA PARADISO fair play, but the main pain of the loss is Hollywood movies clips. a lifestyle that exceeds a lost love. <br /> <br /> The Revolution will never end as JULIE movie.
