One of the greatest science fiction works of all time, Blade Runner, or even Gilliam, shows his Brazilian as honest and thoughtful. Willis performs the best performance here, but he's gone out of a shining way than Pittin's past or present. Even though Stowe is here, he does not go out of his league. The story is very worthwhile and offers a lot to think about. The climactic scene is magnificent and the finish lines are perfectly matched. The scenes of the mental hospital are creepy and still laugh with themselves. It's a dark dark miracle here. Fantastic production design and strange kinematography. At first.
