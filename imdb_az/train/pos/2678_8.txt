Now, I can not argue that Jesse (Jesus) saw all the Franco films, and although many seemed to be there, it was a very good thing for me (and darkness). I would say that it was something that happened in the late 60s / early 70s, and it has been something very unusual for me lately, and it is very important for me to do so. In any case, this is like a big bad dream that some of the parts look right at different points. This woman is an actress or something, a "fake" torture act in a theater in Berlin is for an admirable audience (!!) And it seems that this problem is falling asleep. The fact that the real and what is not in this film is really the focus of the real things and is not the desire. It appears to exist in a deja vu case. I will not say many things in this sense, but it's pretty wild and strange and funny. Berlin's photographs appear to be a single and creepy place in addition to the atmosphere. Finally, it is extremely sharp, although the film will not end and the band is black and there is no need to tell you when it's over. My image was from the Euro-Trash collection of Anchor Bay and I want to say that I do not throw more Euro Garbage, I can not get enough of this crap. But that's a good thing.
