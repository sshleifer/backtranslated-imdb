I must admit that I did not expect anything good at first. <br/> <br /> <br /> I was expecting the only sweetheart film to promote the image of "Night" and "Hyde", but I'm happy to say that the offer is more. Yes, the actor is not so big, but not suck or not, all the cast is good disciplined and their characters give enough power. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm talking about the events in the Caucasus. The development of the heroes, their doubts and feelings really hit me, and I think of the film's foundation. <br /> <br /> It fulfills any expectations for good thinking. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
