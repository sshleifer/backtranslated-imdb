What can we say about this movie? To say the truth of the truth very well is a lot of fraud, like many rifles and hoods. Even though charlie's glimpse I do not know it was the truth. If they had believed, they would have been fighting and humiliating. But scenes with pressure and hot oil look very real. the last needle in the eye area is strange and is probably the only thing that shocks me.
