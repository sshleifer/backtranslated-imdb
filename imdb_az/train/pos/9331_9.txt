This movie was last weekend and the quality of the movies at that hour of the day (approximately 6pm) was almost unbelievable (at least here on Mexican TV), and I could not access the TV. The story about Madelene Moore really touches you. First of all, it is not primarily sympathetic, but when you see the whole movie, it will only succeed. You really think of this movie. And mainly, thanks to Brooke Johnson's great player. I have never heard him, or I have never seen him in another movie, but it was a great game. Brooke praises. Soon I would like to see him in another movie.
