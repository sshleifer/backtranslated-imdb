I have to admit, the only reason I got this movie is that I'm a fan of Gackt and Hyde *. I was expecting a good movie with a lot of films, and we say that it is a pleasing but beautiful little story. I want to say that the synopsis really sounded there. Now I've watched it - I feel the world needs to say its brightness! Hyde and Gackt both gave heart-storming speeches, and still my eyes were still warmer than the last half of the movie. If you filter out the story, you really feel for the latter characters. The element of vampireism is my favorite, but it is very easy to destroy or destroy the movie - it is not accidental add-on to the story, it is merely a story character to do something exotic. At first I sorted out the 10 to 9 ... then I went back and tried to think why you gave the last point. It did not come with anything. Ten of them are from him. After all - I am not very critical - I'm worried to write any reviews, really hate or really love the movie. You can tell me I'm with Moon Child.
