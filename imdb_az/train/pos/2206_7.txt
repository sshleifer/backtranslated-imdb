Do not believe all the negative reviews of this movie. Yes, it's cheap. Yes, his eyes laugh. Yes, the player is sub-content. But this is an example of an early whistle-blow, and if it's not your "thing" (ten mines!), Then you will enjoy it. They have enough good features to avoid having to compensate for the shortcomings of this film. First, it is well-considered by the unknown Christopher Young, which emphasizes the very fierce and violent. It is a good impression from the unpredictable results of the majority of the latest films. And last but not least, what made me do for the movie. The creators of this film could do a better job to make sure that the college was more convincing. However, if you can overlook this defect, the setting is great. Four colleges just wait for a single demolition in a large, abandoned, judiciary building .... the probable reaction. When watching, let some of your imagination work and love this movie as much as I do.
