This is the first time I've ever seen a movie I've seen and I have seen it several times over the years. <br /> <br /> In short, the comedy does not have two sides: the equality of labor and capitalists. Only Sid, apart from the classic struggle, is responsible for the problem himself. <br /> Spoiler warning: read more if you do not see the movie <br /> <br /> This fantasy is presented in a fairly fitting way. Ask yourself: can someone combine most of his weight into pieces? <br /> <br /> Simply, any support from any side could be reduced. <br /> <br /> Also, when you move to a busy street, Sid uses a cluttered cloth as a shield. Favorite symbolism. <br /> <br /> One day I'll give it to a DVD.
