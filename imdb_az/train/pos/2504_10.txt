When I first saw this movie, the first thing I thought was this movie was more anime than another movie. The reason is that there are vampires making incredible stunts. The Rods Matrix has a lot of bullets kinda thing and as much moving as it moves too far to jump very far. Another reason why the film is good is because it is a very interesting animation film. Gackt makes his friends' faces or just as they move, LOT ANIME. I think it's a really good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this movie is not 10 (Gackt and Hyde is not 10). ^ _ ~ If you are a fan of Gackt and Hyde, you should see it.
