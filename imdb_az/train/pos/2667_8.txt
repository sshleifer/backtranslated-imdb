I have never been a great admirer of horror films. They generally try cheap tricks to scare viewers like loud sounds and creepy guys. They usually do not have the originality and contain a lot of them. The only fear movie I liked was Echoes Stir with Kevin Bacon. It was a good job and a great event. <br /> <br /> The film's shooting continues for several days. <br /> <br /> The shooting of the film was closed for winter. When it comes to the staging of his wife, the last relative was embarrassed and killed his family. But Jack was convinced he would be good and could use quietly to remove the writer's block. But after months of loneliness and silence, Jack becomes charming and then violent. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest parts of Kubrikin's film is Kubrick's insistence. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are large but always empty. Jack's son is also calm when passing biking corridors and cycling. Jack Nicholson's performance is one of his best, I'm afraid of the hell that comes out of me and I'm sure he'll come out a little. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is when talking to a spirit inside a picnic cooler. <br /> <br /> The Shining, in my opinion, is the top scare for horror films, Ring and Blair Witch Project. It may be an old one, but definitely a blessing. 8/10
