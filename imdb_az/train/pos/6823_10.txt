Watching John Cassavetes for the last week - I started with a 'woman under the influence' and ended up with 'night out'. I, especially with these two films, completely and completely blown. from the first minute to the end of the "opening night" was absolutely swept away. I've had it only a few times, but when it comes to the conclusion that this movie is perfect, there were about two-thirds of the total until the credits were created. everything about this film, as it is shot, is the genuine performance of Gena Rowlands, credits, opening, music, structure, deep emotions, pace, longing, originality, symbols, little moments .... for me, it is really high. I can be more content with the previous comment on how to draw a desert island to see something deep in this movie. If you were unlucky enough to have a house fire, you will save a copy of this movie because you try to make a final trench of the money beneath the bed.
