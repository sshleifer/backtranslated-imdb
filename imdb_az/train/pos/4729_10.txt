A fighting actor finds the best way to enter Hollywood by hitting the competition. But a Break is a saddonic look at the existence of a real gem fight (and not so) of the LA actor who makes a Foot Break. This brings us to the world with unbridled mockery and intelligence. Monica Mitchell has a polished look and versatile direction. Break A Leg is one of the rare independent films that do not pay for production levels at any level. Text is intense, the first degree of dialogue. Cassini is an actor and his role really shows his talents. The climactic scene between him and Rene Garcia is instantly classic and can be as low as one of the most entertaining Hollywood scenes of all time. I saw it at a premier demonstration and everyone in the audience laughed and then raved about it.
