I hired a movie (I do not think I've gotten the freedom of the theater here). The front views were horrible at the movie. In fact, I was very surprised to watch it; almost an ensemble is written loosely as part of a film. There were many funny moments in this regard, and despite the fact that the show was flawed, people were not afraid of an effective satire and show. <br /> <br /> This basically leads to the terrible noise of "comedy" effects, but is generally honest and generally true to create a show on the way to Altmanesk or Larry Sanders. <br /> <br /> A fashionable moment that criticizes Jerry Springer is an easy target. Springer could have created Citizen Kane and declared the worst movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in the show. A flawed but innovative and exciting movie piece.
