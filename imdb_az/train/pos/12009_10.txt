I really thought they were doing a very good job, there was nothing wrong, the first commentator did not know how to scare me and turned me into tears. ) but I'm not trying to cry in the movie because it's embarrassing, but it's got me. SOOO was good! I hope they leave the DVD because I will definitely get a copy! I felt that my faith was refreshed and I was hoping I could not explain it, so they forced me to make a better person, they overcame them and accepted it as we deceived. In contrast, I feel that my own experiences are nothing. Yes, it's nothing, but they make things worse. I liked it. Who played Emma?
