<br /> <br /> It was very exciting to see this movie because I always heard it was very scary. </ Strong> <br /> <div style = "color: red;"> Japan with the original crew! In my opinion, this film ... was more Japanese (able to succeed in contrast to the American-American horror movie floppies in Japan), but it made the American audience a bit unreachable. The film, which frightens Japanese culture and fears American culture, has taken part in the film. <br /> <br /> It was working well when the bigger nerves were afraid of the danger: great, busy, unaware, a fish in Tokyo lake. <br /> <br /> The storyline was also quite complicated. As a typical Japanese fashion, it is very complicated and confused. The beginning of the film is really the middle of the story, and we always move forward and backward, at the end of the film we see the ending and the beginning of the whole story. It was too complicated for me to keep up the course of time. Also, I did not think that there was a good explanation of some things, and I should explain to them from my husband (he has already seen and even more than the story). <br /> <br /> In general, the American audience's love, dark appearance and darkening details have a lot to do with the tune in the tones.
