Understand your involvement, release your logic at the door and have a great time with this maniacally funny, totally absurdist, ultra-camping live action "cartoon". The magnificent MEN is the sending of any superhero whistle that you've seen, but its probably super-wannabes are quite interesting, and they think they are their memorable characters. It combines this humorous fantasy with true humor, terrible calmness, neat movements, and even a moment of touch or two, for those who are deprived of their beloved. Mystery Men's comedy ability - including a Mystery Woman - is a perfect foil for Wes Studi and can only be described as a bargain base Yoda and Geoffrey Rush's most off-the-wall (and strange charming) villains are a Dark Horse funny never go to the book's pages and go on the big screen. Do you say laugh, presence and huh? enjoy more than once ....
