The Iphigenia, breathtakingly with the incandescent Irene Pappas, is a part of Homer's epic "Troja" with Brad Pitt once again. Those who are in a natural environment with Greek-speaking actors lend to such a truth. In one of the many direct channels of DirecTV, the encounter with this movie was of interest to me despite my concentration problems. There is no shine or "bling" in this film, just a strange story, a real story from the actors, in fact a family's silence. Even if Homer was genuine, I would be proud of these words. <br /> <br /> JLH
