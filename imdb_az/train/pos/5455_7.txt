Excessive pre-coded film is actually a film that has been strictly adhered to the requirements of the Hayes Code. Barbara Stanwyck stars like a young girl who does not have trouble lending his lover's loyalty to his father's customers. When you die in an accident, the nubile body is left to the world knowing that the body can take whatever it wants. She goes to New York, and the corporate ladder keeps on going to bed one at a time. There is no doubt that there is no sexual contact, though the film is pretty sleazy. Unfortunately, after the fall of the initial shock (Stanwyck, when a rail car inspector slams, he can travel for free), the film is a little fresh and boring. Stanwyck itself is the only thing that sits on a worthwhile film. As always, it is fantastic.
