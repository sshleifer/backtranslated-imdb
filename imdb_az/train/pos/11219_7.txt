/ * light spoiler * Before Evangelion, Hideaki Anno was an idol and home name for many anime fans, and prior to getting Gainax's fanfavorite status, Waybuster was made. At that time, Honneamise wings and the famous Otakon shorts or course designed by Gainax made some harsh moves to pursue Gunbuster. <br /> <br /> As it has been considered, Gainax has decided to make this a six-point media (direct directive). video) series. This allows the array to have a larger area if the movie is turned into a movie. It's too boring and too long, and it hurts the tricks and fills along the way. In addition, they made little effort to use the space opera mechanics used in Macross and Gundam and many other popular space operas. <br /> <br /> First, it shows Okinawa High School for mechapiloting with Noriko. Noriko, the daughter of a respected shipman who died in battle, was still a small child. This makes life very difficult at the academy, as some of their classmates doubt that Noriko's preference for professors. The first episode is pretty much comedy drama, with a lot of attention to the heroes and the school. <br /> <br /> When declaring the danger of an outbreak, things change quickly and are chosen to help the fleet of Noriko and Kazumi (the best girl class). <br /> <br /> The central part of the daybuster is also focused on personal drama and activities. Several more characters are provided and Noriko's previous sections are re-dragged. In addition, the alien threat is getting closer every minute, and Daybuster, the last hope of humanity. The writer was as clever as Okada, he combined the principles of time dilation to spice up a few things. In short, time is slow for those who travel light. This means that Noriko may be part of a war that demands almost a century to come. The dramatic aspect of this is striking when you see your friends again, when you return to Noriko, the older you are. Science can not be perfect, but even some of the episodes giving a brief overview of the scientific principles used in Noriko, Kazumi and the trainer series are presented in some convincing way with some of the SD sci-fi theater shorts. /> <br /> The animation for a series made in the 80s is definitely good. Designs, of course, are retro styles of the 80s, but it's a charm. The animations are fairly elegant and treacherous suits, but the characteristic designs are beautiful. <br /> <br /> Gainax, some of the fanservis anecdotes, will be put into use later. The scenes along the show, very cool and very cool with Gunbuster as a killer machine. The last episode was completely black and white. We generally believe (but have not confirmed) that the whole budget is implemented, though it gives a totally different atmosphere to the series which is perfectly suited for the latter part. <br /> <br /> Music is a very special place for opera. Places where, very common and absolutely no bans are prohibited. This is often in line with the series, but sometimes it works very hard. Tanaka is not really a famous composer, and the only respected series is Dragon Half. If you think about the 80s anime music, you'll know what you are expecting. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, attention goes slowly from the drama to the space opera into an epic battle, but this is hardly the case. The step-by-step drama will be dropped and the fighting will take the forefront. Both sides are not completely abandoned. The last episode of Noriko and the crew fights for the existence of the human species, and in the final battle, outstanding people are asked some questions about the position of the human heritage in the galaxy and how much can they go on to maintain. They still offer interesting dishes for their thoughts even though they have never been answered. The final episode is a very nice, but quite predictable end, though all the ends should certainly contain many embarrassing shirts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> GÃ¼nbuster, primarily, can be called by foreign occupations, foreign wars and some personal dramas, such as overhead space opera anime, and much more. But it is done in a very good way for a change. Instead of continuing a lengthy episode length of old elements, Gunbuster offers us a major epic heroic change from smaller dramas. Along the way, we meet with various interesting and good fleshed-out symbols, which have many varied mutual relationships over time slit phenomena. The instruction is very intense, although it tends to look at some points. Very dramatic events and very unattractive mecha attacks could easily be avoided. Generally, visiting the Gunbuster is very comfortable, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic. It could have split the boundaries and limits of the Cosmic opera genre, but at least a little bent. Highly enjoyable anime classic, but without flaws. <br /> <br />
