Another small part of the Holocaust painting puzzle was turned into a documentary on the Rosenstrasse Protest in Berlin, which began in late February 1943. The presentation is listed in the following appendix: this review. <br /> <br /> Film gameplay makes the story of this protest another, a contemporary story in New York. A Jewish woman, who did not see her husband dead, shocked her children and others, demanding an extremely Orthodox banquet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The angry daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader), for the first time, Hannah leaves everything and goes to Berlin, and this woman, Lena Fischer, now finds 90. Hannah can easily convince her of telling her story. <br /> <br /> Then, focusing on the events of 1943, the film covers the protests of the imaginary central character opposed by Mrs. Fischer, 33. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A hero, played in the game. from time to time again came up to the agenda and once again in New York. <br /> <br /> Although scenes are saturated in these days, the 1943 scenes are getting stronger in blue-and-green tones. <br /> <br /> The quality of the operation is generally very good, we have a deep reservoir of talent. <strong> Germany's and Germany's most influential female filmmaker, Margarethe von Trotta, is an old actress. <br /> <br /> The story of protest is simply explained. </ p> </ font> </ font> </ font> "Rosenstrasse" is not a good idea for the majority of film critics. Extremely long, unnecessary, worthy of the stereotypes, the manipulative of music: so go to the usual belts. Too long. But in this film, I found a strong, strong, spontaneous, and totally convincing protest of the women who went outside the Rosenstrasse, where Jewish brothers and others were kept. I did not find anything amazing, modern or manipulative in this description. <br /> <br /> The absence of extreme violence (no one's being physically or otherwise physically intoxicated) has intensified my tension, which is increasing as the film's rise. You expect some flawed attacks to start any minute. The hardness of the film was with me. The night I watched the movie often woke up, my mind was filled with awesome, melancholic, chaotic images and emotions made by the movie. It happens to me rarely. (German and English). My rating: 8/10 (B +). (Seen on 05/31/05). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Turned to 2-4. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jews are very close to the Germans, Adolf Eichmann, hoped that keeping apart from other detainees would convince members of the family to be sent to work camps of your loved ones rather than to the worst places in the occupied Poland. /> Normally, the detainees were imprisoned two days before the train was loaded on the east. But in spite of the fact that detainees could be in this situation before deportation, women and other relatives drowned in what was happening at Rosenstrasse, first and foremost, in double and then ever-increasing numbers. <br /> <br /> Some six thousand people have joined the protest as well. Women demanded one day a day, a week for their wives. They were faced with the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich, unarmed, unarmed and unarmed. <br /> <br /> Gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin, Josef Goebbels, was cleared of this race and was responsible for the public morality of the nation. At both ends, she was worried about the possible consequences of women's actions. Instead of hitting women on the streets and frightening the "Final Solution," with the fear of Hitler, he left the prisoners of Goebbels Rosenstrasse, and even sent them to Auschwitz already! <br /> <br /> In both Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was postponed indefinitely. But it was wrong. All those released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. Women gained a striking victory over the destruction forces.
