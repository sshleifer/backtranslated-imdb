"I'll get you," she says, a weak man who loses his spouse to another and finds a potential ally in the blind day. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is a language-in-cheek situational comedy featuring Rogers and Sheedy with little attention romantic. A very entertaining road trip and a few horrible moments continue to move, stay fresh and have a good time for indie lovers.
