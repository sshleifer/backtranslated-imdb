I liked this movie very much. I've read some of the other comments and I'm sorry for those who do not understand it, but I agree with some of the criticisms. Strangely enough, I love this movie more. I accept that the general public has received a very good form for a clever film to rebuild, but it has so many levels and is still great to watch. I also love it as a movie that has caused many debates, theories, possible endings and hidden subtext. <br /> <br /> P.S. When I went back to Mexico for the first time I saw it, it was late at night and I was forced to return to my hotel and I had a great paranoio! Where does the ending of the dream begin?
