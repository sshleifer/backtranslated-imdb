Once again, I look at the discount video box and we got this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the films he found in boxing is a shit (I'm incredibly terrifying), but they are getting better at half an hour. This movie is better than I am. <br /> <br /> It's not something in this direction, but the story is interesting with a few good excitement. I was expecting more comedy, but I did not like it. <br /> <br /> For a tension, this movie is surprisingly kind. There is no bloody violence, no blasphemy, nudity, no sex. Usually these films require the fourth of these elements. <br /> <br /> The PG rating is good - the word "f" is not like the "Eighth Psalms", which is used twice, and has a short incomplete scene. <br /> <br /> Only Corey Haim and his Love interests could have been more advanced. The film's weight is heavy and potentially pushing the subplots to the side. Instead of developing a chemistry between them, we watch a romantic three-minute montage. <br /> <br /> The "dream machine" is a boat, but good, clean entertainment. <br /> <br /> My Account: 7 (More than 10)
