The talented detective Mr Philo Vance (William Powell) abolishes his travel abroad to investigate a sharp and dry suicide, and the main reason for questioning is undoubtedly a very complicated crime! <br /> <br /> If you are going to kill mystery movies, this is not a better one. It's really hard to figure out who this person has for a good cause to kill suspected characters, a dog show, and kill all visible suicide bomber Archer Coe, but it's really hard to watch one's head down, but it's interesting to watch. The cops, coroner and district attorney also have a colorful, strange look that adds to the unexpectedly realistic level of realism in the work and strengthens the overall "entertaining" factor. I love the comic scenes with Etienne Girardot performing with Coroner (comedian Erien Girardot), who seemed to be rude and untimely, with the discovery of corpses or injuries, especially during this period. Eugene Palette's Detective Sgt. Heath, often commenting on criticism during Vance's investigation, often responds softly to his own account. Perhaps, since this film does not have a particularly good history, in fact, I do not think there is any valid criticism to give this movie. Despite the film, they do not stop straight-in good entertainment. Look, and you can tell this headache around the mystery. Try too much!
