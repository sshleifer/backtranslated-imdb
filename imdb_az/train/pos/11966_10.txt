This is a nice set. If you smile, you will cry, these beautiful people will be part of the family. This is a great example of how our family will care for each other and how to help each other in the face of crisis. There are many good things and there are some bad choices, but they never support the family and work with problems. The youngest girl, Michelle, is the most delicate thing I've ever seen. His middle daughter, Stephanie, is better than anyone in the family with Medium Children's Syndrome. The DJ, the biggest daughter, is growing up to her father's absence. All of this is to miss their mother. Danny (Dad), Joey and Uncle Jesse love these children very much, and this is clear in every episode.
