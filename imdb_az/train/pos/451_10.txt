If anyone is wondering if he will not shoot a movie that's similar to what he's used to, it's a good evening, telling people how they're doing in Italy and England, and those who are trying to become a new, better, and different thing with conversation, character and friendship. Other days, at other times, became a spectacular comedy in 1992 with key roles Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson and Michael Kitchens. In the direction of Mike Newell's brush stroke, these actors perform lively memorable performances in the eyes of a subtle fine artist. This film, reminiscent of the century-old theater bedroom, can be a friendship farce and watchman who has become a valuable experience in the growth of romantic nature in every character. An artistic telegram about the importance of caring for our surroundings.
