The essence of this delightful MGM music is sometimes only glamorous and romantic, but the main purpose of the film is to play with Tommy Dorsey and the orchestra, highly skilled and athletic dancer Eleanor Powell, Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Although Red Skelton is the ultimate computing share with Powell and he and sidekick Bert Lahr are given most of the comedy minutes, he can be persuaded, even though Skelton is more effective, Virginia O'Brien is really like the dancer's dancer's companion to the film's humor. Powell's technical glimpse is proven during an incredible scene that Buddy Rich has to do with his drumming skills and must be reviewed several times in an incredible way to breathe. Director Eduard Buzzell, despite the very different scripts that he needs to negotiate, uses a large casting rod to make good movements and allows Powell to manage the kantangent capabilities properly.
