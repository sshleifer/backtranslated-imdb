While on the bed, Ann Lord repeats the name "Harris" and remembers it when he was a successful singer in the '50s, and New York's rich friend Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer) in Newport. Ann Grant (Claire Danes) was welcomed by Lila's spirits and impeccable brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) in the seaside Wittenborn cottage, and she was actually friend and servant Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson) in war and medicine. Then the bride-to-be confessed to Harry's true feelings about Ann. However, when he meets Ann Harris, he suffers from it and has a brief relationship with Buddy during a night stand when the tragedy occurs. <br /> <br /> The mother's daughters, Dangerous and Unstable Nina Mars (Toni Collette) and her happy spouse and mother, Constance Haverford (Natasha Richardson), are disturbed by the mood of their mothers. <br /> <br /> "Evening" is one of the best speeches she has ever seen in a movie with spectacular performances. The striking example of Mamie Gummer's mother, Meryl Streep, is beautiful and has a performance worthy of her mother's name. Places, suits, scenery, cinematography and soundtracks are also wonderful. Unfortunately, the plot is mixed and I did not fully understand the message of this movie. Why is it important for motherhood story? Constance, Ann and Harris, fired for night stand and would have been their father? Why Ann and Harris did not stay together if they really liked the boy as he had encountered in New York? What issues did Ann Rabbit have after his visit to Lille Ross? Buddy Wittenborn was a love affair for bisexual or Harris? Why Nina Mars changed her mind about motherhood? As you can see, scenario writers or directors failed to make sense to a beautiful love story and failed to fulfill it. <br /> <br /> <strong>
