When I was watching the Gundam Wing series for the first time, while watching the series, I reaffirmed my belief that this series is not just beautiful animation, plot, gundam design, character design, and depth of character. executed. Although it seems to be a group of boys, the elegantly attractive part of the characters can only be part of the great art, and individual personalities make clear and striking differences between the characters. As a result, it is extremely easy to get involved in any character. Personally I liked Heero because of Stoic's personality. Although I'm dumped into part of this show on a part of my childhood, can I fully answer Gundam Wing's questions about war and world affairs (how can we get peace)? , at least to say the least.
