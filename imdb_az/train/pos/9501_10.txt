I've seen this movie when it's released and when I'm 12 years old) And still remember the beautiful scenes of heroes when the hero / hero faces danger, and the best feature of the film was the description of the tyrant! I think many of the so-called action movies have been copied from this movie "rescue scenes"! When I see this kind of copy, it never gives me impression, it always raises my appreciation for this masterpiece! Going actors made a nice move. The slow and realistic development of the chemistry b / w hero and heroes has been described in a very natural and beautiful way. As kids did, b / w felt that love was very natural. Through all the difficulties and difficulties encountered, children were able to understand the value of genuine love, sacrifice and care. Whenever a chance is given, I suggest everyone to see this movie! - Vijay.
