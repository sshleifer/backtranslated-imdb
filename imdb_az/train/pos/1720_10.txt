This early biograph was very entertaining to watch briefly. D.W.D. the second one on the disk. Griffith's "Discovery Years" DVD set (highly recommended) has three great releases for the main results and Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, Nation of a Nation) and many other things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes it was incredible that they would not hear the arrival of the wall, but hey, maybe the wine had something to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (the father of the silent player Raymond Hackettin) sounds bare, and this melodrama is added, but in a surprisingly funny way. At the end of the best moment. When she gets into shock and fear, Henry takes on her instrument and "admirers" when she realizes she is convicted. Maybe it was unexpected and very strange, and I lost it and laughed at me. His expression on his face! From that moment, Henry B. became attractive by Walthall.
