I understand that this film is a debut feature, and it is very impressive. There is a sense of "real indie," but director Todd Yellin has a photography and editorial vision, decree and decision of mature and experienced professionals. Shooting is well-designed and thought-provoking and helps keep the story forward. He and a screenwriter, Ivan Suleiman, present a story with more depth and lyricism than the typical "paint with numbers" type scripts. This is a story that requires a characteristic talent to open a firefighter working on Judd Hirsch. Judd is fantastic as usual; Like Scott Cohen and beautiful Susan Floyd. Real surprise is Elliot Corte playing Adam Groden. Yellin could combine the nuance of a young actor in a role that could easily be offset by stereotype or overreach. In any case, I found the film to be refreshing and entertaining.
