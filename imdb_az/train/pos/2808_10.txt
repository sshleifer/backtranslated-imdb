This movie is neither morbid nor painful. It is sad, because in the early 1990s AIDS was sad. <br /> <br /> Mary and Tom were long-term, kind. Immediately understanding their commitment to each other and seeing a truly heartwarming force and commitment when the AIDS spread and become the cornerstone of your life. Silverlake Life was first released, I was deeply involved in HIV / AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a consultant in the HIV / AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me as another AIDS movie of the day because Mark and Tom were real people living in real life. I knew that they wanted to watch AIDS beforehand in live, young, healthy people; When I saw Mark and Tom in the movie, it was just as bad as watching my real spouse's deterioration. It touched me that after all these years it still affects me.
