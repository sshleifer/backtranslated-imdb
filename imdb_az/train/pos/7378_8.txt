After watching this movie in Sundance yesterday, I realized that many of Nakata's style was first made in this movie. Here we have many of the same elements of the RINGU series, especially the source of the media supernatural. Instead of a cowardly camcorder, there's a scene studio and strange look in the movie. In fact, the strange images appearing in the film bring to mind the video cursed in RINGU immediately. The only thing missing was plunged into water passing through Nakata's next film. The final scenes are quite surprising, part of Murnau is reminiscent of the nosferatu, which opens by himself and dreams into the room. A refrigerator that will think twice about going to a cat.
