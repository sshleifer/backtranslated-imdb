Cinderella was one of the first films I've ever seen, and it's timeless for me. A beautiful looking movie, with magnificent animation. My favorite animated scene - I love these mice. These songs are not as good as Snow White but they are a taste to read and Tchaikovsky is reminiscent. Do you dream of a dream and love it? There are standouts. The symbols are also a delight. Cinderella is idealistic and powerful, and mice provide great comic relief. These steps were as good as Lucifer. But I liked the thing best, she was really bad, compared to a great character named Fairy Godmother. True, the film is dragged to the mice of the mice, but they were really funny, so I do not care about it. Do not you think that you are disobedient and unfounded? Television is rarely played, but the really lasting result is regularly performed at Cinemagic. If you want a great Cinderella adaptation, try the good feathers and flowers that are not nice or well after Ever. But if you do, take it for granted that I am wrong, because I thank you. 9/10.
