I'm really shocked to see the number of reviews that made this movie a reality. This film is not intended to be a "deep-minded" film, but most analysts should think about it. Indeed, if any movie does not change the way a person thinks and creates a deep, twisted, mind-boggling area, they rate it at 1 or 2 degrees. As you can see, do not stupid the movie. this genre, people. <br /> <br /> This film was an Activity / Comedy shout and it was all about to be. A very good work for an Action / Comedy was done. <br /> <br /> Indeed, I did not have a Jamie Foxx fan and I did not have anything to do with it. a typical offender goes out of prison and is thrown to the place where the evil man is stolen while trying to clear his movement (Blue Cats, Hudson Hawking, 48 Hours, etc.), but a bit of a technological twist. <br /> <br /> In some cases, "bad guys" are really "good guys" and REAL "bad guy" is uber-geek. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx plays a joke that really convinced her, but at the same time she did not try to miss the humor side of the film and very clever and serious. This movie is not for you in "Matrix" or "The Matrix" Mice and Men, but this movie will not disappoint you, as it is performing in raw material movement, fast-paced movie and entertainment. I normally rate this with 8 votes at the same level as Die Hard Trilogy, but instead try and experiment. <br /> <br />
