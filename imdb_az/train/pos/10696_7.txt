I see Nicole loves her every time. I like a movie like this. He will not just give up a woman, but he will break his heart. I know that the first film of this film was Human Ears Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey. In this film, the Russian language is small, and it is good for people who can not speak Russian or Russian. It's funny how people miss the point. No good guy, the Russians also played well. Finally, as we have already noted, I had to raise my hat for Chaplin, he was playing a stroke with great dignity, and Nicole had a few heat between him. To think, children make money, mindful.
