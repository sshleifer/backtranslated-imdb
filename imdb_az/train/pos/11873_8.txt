In 1983, Director Brian De Palma began to make a film about the rise and fall of the American gangster, and he made it through a terrific scenario by Oliver Stone and an impeccable job by a prominent cast. As a result, 'Scarface' with Al Pacino was one of his most memorable roles. The story began in May 1980, when Cuba expanded its harbor to Mariam, Cuba, to allow Cuban citizens to join their families in the United States. At that time, 125,000 Cubans living in America were for free pastures and most honest, hardworking people and thanked for their opportunity. But not all. Among the 'Marielitos' flushing in Florida, there were about 25,000 criminal records, and there was nothing less than the Cuban prisons, who thought Kastone was the only survivor of the crime. As Al Capone thought about Chicago about fifty years ago, they also viewed America as an opportunity land. Among the most ambitious individuals there was a man named Tony Montana (Pacino) whose employees were known as Caracortada. Scarface. <br /> <br /> Now he was liberated from the communist yoke he grew up; Montana asked for his feelings and wanted it now; After leaving the ship in Florida, he decided to have everyone. Riches and power - it was Montana's dream, and made a good start to a man living in the city of Miami, named Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia), doing the best. Lopes, one of Castro's, had a brother in Cuba who had been away from his usefulness for Castro, and there seemed to be a "Little Havana" with Montana now, along with all the Cubans, waiting for the government to await their passage to their new lives. . As soon as Montana sees Lopez's brother being hunted down, he is embarking on America's underground world. <br /> <br /> Lopez is a wealthy businessman with the right connections. Upon returning to the case, Montana and his wife, Manny (Steven Bauer), are released from the prison camp and are doing their job. In his day Capone could have prepared his case as a means of selling it with illegal profits, but it is equal to the modern day of Lopez, and that is more profitable: Cocaine. Lopez takes Montana under his wing and drives him to life, but once you look at your taste, Montana is not happy with any fracture she has been fit to take on Lopez's path and she wants to be "top." With cold bloody, iron, Montana decides what to do, whatever it takes to get there. but before the end, he understands the value of his dream and will pay; but for a moment, perhaps he knows how to be a human. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pacino, It is affected by the stress (he has studied to make sure that he is guided), body language and behavior, and this shows that Montana is convincing and realistic. The role that is involved is nuance and style, with some actors (De Niro can be one). This is not necessarily a sympathetic character, nor is there anything you can easily associate with Montana at a personal level; but Pacino's appearance on the screen is so powerful that it is difficult to get emotionally involved with it, but it's a thoroughly laborious character. <br /> <br /> Michel Pfeiffer has a solid performance, even when putting it on a stardom path. Elvira, as an integral part of Montana's imagination, is subtle and simple, meaning that under the influence of Pfeiffer is extremely cold and distant appearance. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> F. Murray Ibrahim (Omar), Paul Senar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein). Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch," De Palma's Scarface, reminiscent of the critics, is a definite American gangster saga, many of which have recently lost Traffic and Impact, with much of the violence more graphic than graphics. but it is still a matter of concern for many, but there is a lesson to be learned at the end if you want to stay in it, as in many lessons in life it is very difficult at the most valuable times. it's always worth it, and it's in the way of this movie., I value it 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
