<br /> <br /> The first was a typical high school student, a Shakespeare class, and I really did not like it, and half of it! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Shekspe will be nothing but me. Second, it lasted 4 hours! <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> This movie was very spectacular, very nice, but I understood that the whole language was actually implemented. Now, in this film, I watched the script's scripts written in the same script, which was incomprehensible to me in the Shakespeare class. And here I was opening my mind and I understood it. I was skeptical when watching the movie! But lo and see ... when it's done, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life. This version of the state showed me that Shakespeare is a master of a really great story. I saw it on the big screen, especially in a high-budget key movie theater (with beautiful cinematography and photography) and by Brannagh in a strange way, and in a way .... I realized what was happening. What was not. Language is awesome and passionate. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, the The North Star Fist (animation, English dub) - this will allow you to emotion more emotionally if you can not describe anything. The biggest movie ever made. No movies make a great fun. But it's really nice for a movie's Fist to come closer to this position (coming closer to Hamlet) .... it's terrifying. Not a movie. <br /> <br /> There was something more amazing, thank you. Amazing! Wow. Strong. Strong word. It's one of the rare, powerful powerful movies. <br /> <br /> It takes 2 hundred trillion stars from endless stars. Yes Yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, you have forgotten all of the children in the Shakarpir class. You waste your time. You must see the works done. They will be given justice only.
