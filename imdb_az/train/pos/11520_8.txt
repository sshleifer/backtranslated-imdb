This quintessential way movie ... one of the way the movie includes three wizards with Eastern Europe emphasis and Claire Forlani in your opinion. (One of the four is not bad ...) A talented magician who looks for Shoumenship (Max) is watching a very talented collector (Hugo) in New York. Hugo's (Max) a) mind, and b) a dazzling double-minded managing managing the imaginary inventorship after convincing that he needs a partner to want a wizard for a scene that despises Milo) and a delightful attentive attribute of Lydia. There is no possibility of getting into a van (Hugo has been acquired ...). Havoc comes out. Anyway, it's funny, well written, and the end is surprisingly good. It was a strong comedy and a totally unexpected thing with a warm heart.
