<br /> <br /> Ernst Lubitsch has won a better victory with this favorite movie. With a brilliant dialogue (with his long-term collaborator Samson Raphaelson's courtesy) and a great performance by many talented performers, she created a truly memorable movie. Always watching the audience's intelligence and beginning to believe in the sophistication superiority of the rifle, the director has created an unprecedented synthetic kinematic repast with this tough, mysterious quality, known as Lubitsch's touch. <br /> <br /> The story is set in Budapest (and there is a difference between players), which does not produce any results. The simplicity of the site, any major American city or small town can easily be a locus for action. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan romantic lovers and then everyone else - without knowing. Their dialogue, therefore, has been handled as if it were quite natural - for the spouses they want, their confusion and calmness. These are one of the movies' classic love stories. <br /> <br /> Cherubic Frank Morgan has a more serious role than ever before, a woman whose breakthrough in her small world was found to be temporary. Steal an exercise scene, it allows you to escape no emotion unvented. Additionally, Morgan provides the most delightful few minutes of the movie - closest to it - when the newest employee of the store, the poorest youth, will spend an unforgettable Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut adds a more vivid image this time to the list of screenshots, and to Lothario, a sociophany who successfully accomplished his charm. <br /> <br /> Sara Haden attributes a small role of a merchant. <br /> <br /> Sexual Felix Bressart really has the role of a movie star, as a family man, who has no opportunity to deal with intrigue. <br /> <br /> Sara Haden,. William Tracy is not as hilarious as an ambitious guy who uses unexpected events to use himself over the sales force. <br /> <br /> In the little roles, Charles Halton plays no nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell appears stunningly looking doctor. The film's cartoonists will recognize Mary Carr & Mabel Colcord as well as uncredited - Miss Sullavan's grandmother and singer's only scene.
