Success! If I were really not affected by this movie, I should admit that I was technically well prepared. It's 7 for very high production values, but when it comes to entertainment values, it's pretty weak. In fact, I think this is one of the most appreciated films of the 50s. Oscar won the best picture, but the film is sometimes boring with dance, dance and dance. This is because, in contrast to some music that has a substantial number of songs, along with a powerful story and action (like meeting ME ST LOUIS ME), this movie is almost all singing and dancing. In fact, this movie has the longest song and dance number in history, and if you're not part of it, the movie will take you a while. Give more stories! As a result, with a large number of products and a weak story, this film is like a weird nourishing diet - not just long-term. <br /> <br /> It should be thought that this is the best movie for a movie titled "Wish for A Tram" and a "Place in the Sun"! And to make matters even worse, "African Slave" and "Ace in Hole" have not even been nominated for this category! What's even more beautiful is that the film "The Ace in the Hole" was lost for the best script, script - "The Americans in Paris" almost never talked about, and mostly dance and song.
