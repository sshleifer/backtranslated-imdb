I saw the last five or ten minutes of this movie when I was lying in a bed in 1998 or 1999, and I loved what I saw. Since then, I've been cleaning up TV listings in DVDs / DVDs, but I have not found a copy after selling some Internet stores in the near future. Later, I did not order a world-class procrastination. Finally, just a couple of weeks ago when I was traveling to Portland, OR, I found a DVD copy on a Circuit City. <br /> So what do I think about the movie? This is a good. It is not as good as I remember and expect, but when it comes to cost I'm worth $ 9.99. After seeing the whole movie for the first time, I estimate it as 7/10 and has 8/10 potentials. Then I need to have a better sound system so I'm less sleepless and not falling back to some dialogues.
