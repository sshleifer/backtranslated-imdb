When Antonioni prepared this film, he actually showed a few "cojones". He went to America, which works on contract basis from the best studio (MGM) and made the most dangerous portrait of the American society I've ever seen. When LA sees its first hand, it is the most accurate image of the densely populated, overheated and impersonal city. Only when Antonioni acquainted with Bill Hicks ... <br /> <br /> The next graveyard of the studio is understood after such an investment and carefree turn. People are scared because they do not see this movie as Antonioni is rightly believed. Here he predicts that the hippie / civil rights movement will end in American politics. Everyone is more interested in entering their pockets and living in an unusual (yet beautiful) desert and outdoors. <br /> <br /> I would like to curiously interest the film and interest the DVDs. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid to see Zabriskie Point openly and openly. <br /> <br /> We have a really unique film that makes us comment on a turning point in the history of the most powerful people in the planet, and we have forgotten it. <br /> <br /> An unexpected stone.
