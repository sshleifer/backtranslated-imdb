This is the first movie experience for a few people in the filming process. All of them are experienced actors and play a few television series. Shahan Gökbakar is a famous comedian in Turkey. It is strange to see him in a thriller while he is at the peak of his comedy career in Turkey. This film is a very first experience of Togan Gökbakar's first long filming and director. But all of them did a good job. We are happy to see such brave young cast. They look very promising for the future of the Turkish film industry. Doga Rutkay is a talented actress who has long been known for her role as Shahin Gökbakar's beloved daughter, at the 27th theater play and several television series.
