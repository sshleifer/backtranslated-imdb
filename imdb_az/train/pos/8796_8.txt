<br /> <br /> Everything is relatively elevated by the direct director, eleven from this set. To say that it can be the number one priority for people like Bush, Blair, and the Company can not be too many people, ordinary people. The most important thing that has ever begun from the opening of the scene, which begins to influence the students of an Iranian teacher, is that it does not surprise the children as children are more affected by their neighbors and similar things than anything that can happen in New York or in the United States which consists of documentary pieces, proves that every person is not equal to everything as world chess players try to prophesy. The attack on the World Trade Organization (WTC) was a complicated event, both politicians and television operators tend to blow up everything - these numbers. Did the same reaction at the international level come about when the attack was called Lagos or Djakarta or called Rio de Janeiro? I do not think so. The news appears to be distorted depending on what happened: in an earthquake in Italy, more television times are said to be 10 times more destructive in External Mongolia. Great distances reduce the size of the disaster. <br /> <br /> Eleven numbers help make this series better perspectives - or perhaps it's likely that every filmmaker, who has somebody's full freedom, owns a story, is perspective that it's impossible to estimate all the benefits, individually for the minute segment. <br /> <br /> This should not mean that it is an anti-American film: it will be a very simple way to read the various messages that appear through the segments. Not Americans as well. Eleventh Segment Different Behaviors and Common Communication - if any - WTC attack disaster should appear in perspective from a different perspective. Only then will George W. Bush begin to understand the planet he lives on. <br /> <br /> There is a clear indication in one segment that I have been living for two years: America has not received a lesson. The lesson is that the United States shares this planet with the rest of humanity - it should not reign with ruthless economic persuasion or straightforward power. Instead of learning that the United States can not continue with anywhere and anywhere, Blair (and even Aznar) supported and political leaders were more arrogant and more sensitive than anybody in Afghanistan or at present, Iraq, not in places. The mentality of the White House is completely denied: The United States and Britain have occupied Iraq and cause all the chaos and therefore eliminate the turmoil - insist on finding a UN and a helper from the other nations. Get out of confusion. <br /> <br /> The radical positions taken by the United States (even Israel) for a few years will be met with radical stances from the Islamic people in order to cover their own fraud by creating fanatic fundamentalism, namely, to kill women or simply from the top to dusty soil. <br /> <br /> It is a terrible confusion that has led to the longing of a few rich countries that look like many of the world's prospects or not. This film accurately describes this horrible and terrible position in eleven separate pieces.
