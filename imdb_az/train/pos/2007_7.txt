In my personal opinion, this film did not give any real story line to the first carpenter's vampires, but I do not see any interest because I love it. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this movie. I think he really is a human being I do not really think would be a great ROCKSTAR. There were some bad things about this movie. A story similar to the storyline had to be more. The movie should be the continuation of the movie, and they should have kept the same basic characters in all three vampires. People liked their dresses and their choice in Mexico. How I liked the old Mexican, not the new Mexico. clay houses and old fashioned churches. I was a little confused with vampires and started walking around the churches, but it was good that Dracula did not follow the vampire rules.
