After the 1929 stock market penalty and depression, the American Music Theater was destroyed, in fact it was the last death blow for the vudeville. <br /> <br /> The theater director, James Kagney, faces a brilliant idea to stimulate the show economy and its own economy. The stage is based on the prologues of films featured in various cinemas that are rooted in an overnight night theater. <br /> <br /> <strong> Some rivals continue to get wind and competition. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite Busby Berkeley movie. James Cagney gives you a chance to show the diversity as a dancer, a difficult boy. In his retirement, Cagney said that he could have trouble with some dramatic films during his time between very little and too far music. <br /> <br /> In some films, many films have been shot in this movie. <br /> <br /> In some cases, however, watching is very creative and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell, Footlight Parade, Ah Moon Here, begins singing three songs with the Honeymoon Hotel and the Waterfall, with the last two Ruby Keeler bites the group on the screen. Ruby is reading and dancing with Powell over the past two years, and Footlight Parade is partnering with James Cagney from Shanghai Lil at my favorite number. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is a naughty girl at the Cagney Theater. As with Blonde Crazy, he is a man with true brains in his prayer and his quick thinking ensures that he can recover from some of the inner problems of theatrical ones. <br /> <br /> Blondell is one of the best screen roles. <br /> <br /> For Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern, look for the IMDb pages for everyone. John Garfield is seen in Shanghai Lil in a short time. Producer Guy Kibbee Cagney takes the stage to a movie theater showing John Wayne's leading role. The voice of the duke is clear. But something more unusual, a short clip shows on the stage with Frank McHug, who plays another Cagney assistant at the Footlight Parade. I think the brothers Warner was playing a little joke there. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus
