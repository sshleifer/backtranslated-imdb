After the afternoon, My Sweet is a spectacular, modern, rare, magnificent symbol filled with dirt paths and, of course, swirls characters. As you can see, most of the truths of the past two or three decades are in the South, where men have become flattering, and the ladies are in their hearts. Why? Because hooooottttttttttt. And because everyone looks better moist (at least men - sweaty women leave me clammy). <br /> <br /> Anyway, there may be some spoilers here. <br /> <br /> This film is a good example of everything that should not be neutral (although some people with a disorder are referred to as 'slow'), a precise and well-designed tonal atmosphere. Noir, if anything, about mood and relationships. That's why adults are not mentioned in the traditional definitions of your "great" activity (see Baker, Mitchum, Hurt and Nicholson) - they were (and their symbols) something, but they were real, but they were styles, is something). or rapid adventures (still all big sounds appear as a slow burn like cigarette). Great noir makes you an environment and you only live in a few hours of symbols. <br /> <br /> Let's do it after My Sweet - and let's enjoy the company with many interesting and complex characters. But Bud and Collie are interested - never let the viewers really know what to do - and Patric and Dern (I also love Bruce Dern), the pitch perfect, especially Dern (see previous comment). Draws the foundation outlines of a character, gives depth, and reveals our sympathies. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also interesting. There are better areas in the world of Noir (there is no mystery here - basically, it is slow), but it is strong. If anything, simply 'okay' has something to do with Jim Thompson's writing than anything else. The plot with Thompson is almost at a moderate level; Hammett and Chandler's labyrinthine tales flipped into easier stories with more strange, more confusing characters. See a novel in Killer Inside Me and instantly see what's happening (from the headline). As for Thompson, it's not about what it's like, but Roger Ebert's proposal. So really is a relatively simple proof of kidnapping and if you do not like it, good jokes. <br /> <br /> Why is this 10star a leading 8star film but not the leading cause of women? It's not bad, it's not just Angelica Huston or Anette Benning (unless you know Jim Thompson does not talk about The Grifters - this is a good movie, since it's the best of the 1990s and Chinatown Blood Simple for the best name). He just does not have a shaver (or looks at this issue), and though he and Patrick have some chemistry, I'm not with him. So.
