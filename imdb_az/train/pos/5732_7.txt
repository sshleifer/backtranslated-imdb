From September of last year, I am making four-six films a week from the Harold Washington Library, an effective DVD collection. (The HWL is actually a circulating library: at three in three quarters at any time!) Recently, I was thrilled to find David Lynch's Short Films. Yesterday, when I knew very little about the animated series, I took Dumbland. <br /> <br /> I'm here to tell David that he has watched eight episodes for Lynch supporters. <br /> <br /> The most striking feature of these short works is their voices. Every episode has its own rhythm. Respiration and digestion systems provide percussion. Ugly voices are emphasized that ends. Provides physical violence. Sprinkle the birds and bark slots along the edges. Many other elements fill the orchestra. The pacing of the raw animation often continues to synchronize with sound, but as Lynch's main interest in creating and distributing this work, the noise hit me. In short, these eight shorts are unique Lynchian rhythms. <br /> <br /> Behold, the situations are hell, ugly, deep, dumb and funny hell. And there is plenty of room for people to think about how absurd it is. I can not say that I will still watch the collection, but for anyone talking about the actions of the Indian Empire, Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time.
