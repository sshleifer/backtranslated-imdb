I really liked this movie, yes, I know it's pretty far away, Shelby's not able to stay on the road, as well as all the shooting controls and other gameplays, but all but a good movie. Cage was excellent, as was excellent, and the rest was very good except Brit Bad Guy, did not you think a little "too" too? Anyway, great movie, great car and a great move. I was convinced that my car was locked at night in a remote controlled garage. :)
