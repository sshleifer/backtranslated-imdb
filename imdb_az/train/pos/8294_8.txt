This movie has great fighting scenes. It is true that now the movement is a bit rude. But if I wanted to see a film based on acting, I would watch a movie like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with the true martial art and using wires with Amazing stunts and killing the matrix like flying in the air already throws air like many movies around. Watch it out. Now there are two main stars in a child show that the child demonstrates power demonstrators and another cast member of the show takes part in this film. But battle scenes are enough to make Jet Li pimentos. And sticks are worthy of Jackie Chan to throw and admire to sit down.
