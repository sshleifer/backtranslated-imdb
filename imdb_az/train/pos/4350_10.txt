The film is one of those who have been familiar with this movie. A local, basic and thought-provoking movie ... and smile. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a visit that you will not forget. The soundtrack is beautiful and varied; The film itself is a breath of fresh air. And it deserves recognition for both the movie and the actors! Finally, it is a work of art that explicitly stems from a love story and often escapes special effects today. In my heart, I am not in a movie with such a deep feeling of warmth and thought; Someone felt like he was clothed with a flawless pen cover. Seeing this movie is to find the true treasure and taste.
