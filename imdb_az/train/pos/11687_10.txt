For Chris Rock my darling changes with his films, I hate him after Lethal Weapon 4, but after the movie I hate everyone. I feel like myself and do not go back like dogma. Well, this is the best one, and I did not expect it to be good. I've heard all my time. Chris Rock presents a sweet story supported by some of the comic comedies I've seen for a while. I loved it.
