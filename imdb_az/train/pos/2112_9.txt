In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (like Klara Novak) is in a gift shop; where he works with James Stewart (like Alfred King). They do not do two things, because each one has been in love with a pen that is unseen. Ernst Lubitschin is unexpectedly satisfactory, directing these stars inevitable. <br /> <br /> The presence of the suspect shop owner Frank Morgan (such as Hugo Matuschek) is a better proof. The recruitment of a private detective confirms that 22-year-old husband has been sexually exploited by a minor employee. Morgan understood painfully, "He just did not want to get old with me" and the supporting characters are what keeps this movie old. <br /> <br /> Stores around the corner (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
