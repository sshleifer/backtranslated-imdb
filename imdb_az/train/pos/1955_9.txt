It's just my favorite movie. Some very good English actors, as well as one and only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) manipulates the lives of a well-educated group of people playing with their frailties to collect the experience to write a murderous mystery book. She plays well in female psychopathy when she uses her extensive sexual references to convince her that she can be considered one of the last black widow. Tramell freely participates in sadomasoic cracks, with the use of dark places in the community and the fact that the city has never visited the dark. From the very beginning, there is no R rating from dialogue. A deadly femme without a dining plan can also be described as a deadly woman, Hannibal Lecter.
