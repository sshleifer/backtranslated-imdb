I really love this movie ... When I started to watch, I thought I would soon be bored, but I was surprised ... I thought it was a great movie, and I've seen it a few times. The characters are convincing and I have to say that I am in love with Brian Austin Green (for the first time at Beverly Hills 90210). I would recommend this movie if it is an admirer, but I agree with another statement that ended with the disappointment of the latter. I would love to distinguish it a bit! No mind, good stories.
