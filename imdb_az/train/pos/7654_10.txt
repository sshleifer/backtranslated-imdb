The original 1932 version with Preston Foster was good, though there was nothing more decent since 1959, or more impossible to find anywhere, so I'm not sure with Mickey Rooney. Never before has the work been so magnificent that the sparkling or the scripts could have been more thoughtful and could not have been developed on the original. In the 1970s, after some of my subsequent follow-up films, I read an article about Mickey Rooney's death journey, and as I have seen, I felt with people in similar situations. The article was as short as the main character here, and I would not want to clarify that even the language of the detainee is extremely frustrating, even in the language. . . . . . One of my main problems with the death penalty is that, of course, many innocent people are not so remarkable, so equally and impartially they are not applied in such a way, and thus unnecessarily sent to fulfill this destiny. However, I have a problem that does not apply at a fair rate or even to the public! In such circumstances, the Holy Bible is a special point regarding its attractiveness, its inattention to the darkness, not only by the public, but also by its direct involvement. When it comes to those who do not want to prove that they are statistically indifferent, is not that kind of impugnable punishment? In addition to having a problem with the reliability of the data provided, there is no doubt that there are no objections left behind in such a large number of barriers. However, I also have a problem with Robert Duval's being punished in the Prophet's Mosque, in particular a "crime", or involving someone in such a libel. "temporary madness" will serve as if it were the only reasonable excuse for its position. . . . In addition to various questions about the reasons for Mickey Rooney's visit, I doubt that he is repeating and that he has a religious character that is the main suspicion of answers that I can only try to guess. I do not know if the organized Christian is unclear, but now it is a special point to stress that it is possible; However, as everyone should know well, this is a special category for the eye to look at in the eyes when it comes to the most powerful way to blood. Nevertheless, I have no doubt, in writing, that not all of them, but most of all, will have the same fate as the Lord himself. As a result of His sacrifice on the cross. Nevertheless, the attitude that the soul or Christians are most respected for me is an issue that encourages the death penalty; The Lord, who seeks everybody's salvation, contradicts himself (Ezekiel 18:32) (2 Peter 3: 9), they are jealous of their ways to find reasons for their condemnation! . . . These superlatively things that can not be seen to be enough to assess on both sides of the burning issue, are as dynamic and gentle in nature as the Lord is difficult. Both sides of his nature seem to be incompatible with nature, at least to show the oppressor with any serious human account. However, no matter how difficult it is to understand that water and oil are miraculously irrelevant to nature, there is no doubt that if something shorter or fierce or fanatic falls on one side or another, adequate and unacceptable. Indeed, when I saw the most blood-thirsty thirst for myself, in contradiction with self-denial, in many cases, when the guilty conspirators of death faced death, even though the most rational, well-balanced Lord died for all, all would be saved. To accept all this, it is necessary to repatriate, accept and accept the same times, that is, repentance (Luke 13: 3-5). Can nothing be more meaningful? . . . But what is the commandment of the Lord to humiliate you and to provoke you to forgive the enemies of the persecutors? One of the difficulties faced by such feelings, as the Prophet misinterprets, is to simplify the true meaning of forgiveness. The gift of forgiveness is a voluntary pardon of any person to be pardoned. If one receives a well-balanced view of God's attitudes in his attitude, it is indeed a successful desire to find the way to the end of a forgiving man, to see the light and to gain grace. Of course, this attitude, of course, indicates that he really was sorry when he said that his preaching to Nineveh had led to his repentance. Yunus did not want them to repent, but vindictively wanted to destroy them. It is like kindness, coldness, and Christianity's most treacherous behavior, and even its reasons are surely the best! How much treacherous Yunus would betray me! However, a forgiving person's repentance and any forgiveness he receives from the true Christian will not help him. It is the only Christian who can benefit from such a situation!
