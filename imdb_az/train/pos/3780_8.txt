A few years later, at my second glance, I understood two things about this movie: (1) very glad, and (2) its fulfillment is tougher than the earth itself. Before I started to update my initial protest, we made our movie laugh - valleyspeak and loogies and anger (not even good * sensitive ambition) are essentially funny, especially when taken long. But, despite the end of the movie, Reeves and Winter and Sadler (and Hal Landon Jr.) make this beautiful comedy look so delicious (such as not knowing a certain resident of Ted Hell) . <br /> <br /> The combination of Winter and Reeves is very good, and Bill and Ted (all spending only one scene in the film, spending a disaster that does not fit each other) are not totally limited. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Surprisingly good entertainment.
