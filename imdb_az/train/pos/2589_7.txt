<br /> <br /> The brothers with psycho-kinetic powers (yes, really) did not just love the love of Debra Wingers, but actually put them on a secret that they hid from their childhood. <br /> <br /> Surreal touch (a fire brigade performs as a Greek chore), but it also has humor, intelligence, and romance. Soundtrack is also great. And they can use a great Wolf song similar to the American Werewolf in London, but I can not stand the fire and I do not think Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid) can not forget. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film (US I have ordered a DVD and you do not leave comments on people who want to be happy with Blond 3 ~ try one :)
