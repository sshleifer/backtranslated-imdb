Not for the first American film and time that has been successfully adopted by the Europeans, especially the French and the Belgians, for ten years? That's what all good art should do in the last days of the summer break between the first and second classes of three high school girls in the Crown Heights neighborhood in Brooklyn. </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> <br / True is complete, full. The film breathes, survives, lives in real time. The story tells herself. Medium and its works, once, are not messages. The film undoubtedly, in fact, transmits the childhood perspective of its characters; does not apply its adult meaning or morals. The emergence of themselves does not push at all, and therefore becomes more realistic and stronger for their clarification. Although there is great pain in the Crown Heights, the largest black ghetto in New York and the true social reality of one of the most dangerous places in the United States, the theme is not gait in childhood, but ghetto itself. <br /> <br /> Documentary footage of Jackie Robinson Steppers' practice sessions, a bandwidth, is punctuate regularly with the film's color, motion and sound burst. Otherwise, the camera is very close, very intimate, patient, sly and invisible observer. The language is rich, spontaneous, effective transparent. Some images, for example, lolling about girls, reveal each of their deep fantasies. The confession of Lansa's acceptance of his death by random violence is the most shocking thing in the deepest traces of ghetto. <br /> <br /> Social reality is promoted, not promoted: all three girls are raised alone. All of them work the same way and admire the challenges of adult life, with confusion and fear. Mothers, only one, Lansa has an active father in his life (and, incidentally, these three are most emotionally stable and empathetic to others and most self-esteem). Two of them suffer from asthma and are disproportionately ill. Gunfire breaks the conversations just one moment before a daily event. <br /> <br /> This is not the best dramatic American film, but one of the only girls, Joy, hopes, controls the future, and the second is desperation for different levels. for many years. Look, look, look.
