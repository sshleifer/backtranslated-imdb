<br /> <br /> This score has changed because of the bright and surprising look that each of you has watched and watched the movie. <br /> <br /> The word of Chris Rock is King! I'm going to see this movie before, and I'm not on it, and now I'm gonna knock on the Chris Rock website. If this movie is really funny, if you are not really laughing at this movie, really need therapy and upgrade your humor comedy, which is targeting all levels of society: race, prediction, love, wealth, employment, desires. <br /> < There was a little disappointment for me. When I entered this movie, I did not really realize that in 1971 there was a rebuilding of a better movie made by Warren Beatty, "Heaven Can Wait". When I watched this movie, I was very surprised and suddenly resembled an old film that I watched a couple weeks ago on TV. What movie is this movie, in my opinion, is that the two films and because Chris Rock's Warren Beatty is more spectacular than the second day of any day on any week of any year ... you will win the picture. <br /> It's good for the real movie area. <br /> <br /> Do not break the experience for yourself! Do not read the field! Just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on IMDb so far that it's crazy about it, because it's the most fun thing you've seen for a long time, we can go and see it because it's a movie experience, The price of the tickets is like a drum. You can see it's a good movie!
