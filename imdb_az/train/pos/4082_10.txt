Hayao Miyazaki is not the same as handwriting animation in handwriting, but often compared to Walt Disney. Watching Miyazaki's films as an outstanding artist is so unfair. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, Laputa is really a great surprise. <br /> <br /> But I can begin to portray a movie with such a magic and breathtaking film! Miyazaki's works will not surprise me. Laputa is a great-scale adventure and I'm surprised at how a film goes through its details and dreams. Ask yourself this question: If you are a child growing up and dream of a magic adventure, what will this be? Answer, bend yourself in some places and look at Laputa because a truly childish fantasy is true. Every minute of the film is rich and rich ... from the train to the beautiful air, flying sequences ... and the sailing castle is a spectacular sight. You can not talk about excellent account by Joe Hisaishi! Everything you want from an adventure movie is here.
