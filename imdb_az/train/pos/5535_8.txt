The first image of the movie shows a mountain chain in the autumn morning and I think: "It's almost perfect". And something like that: landscape and animal images that are perfectly romantic in every detail. Even a girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic and beautiful. It may seem obsolete and fugitive, but it corresponds to a story that has a silent beauty between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince, on the border of life and fairy tales. I'm glad every minute. A simple, slow story, only one actor, and an extraordinarily inseparable part of a film that has a tremendous effect has shown a powerful magic. Therefore, this wealth is sad when it is presented at the last minute, with only two additional actors (the woman and her son who is growing up). Another drawback is that of Hollywood, often intervening, and sometimes inappropriate: it did not bring the English pop song along with French mountain glory. I went to the movie with my two little daughters, but given the high appreciation of such a film, I also recommend the adults. Obviously not everyone.
