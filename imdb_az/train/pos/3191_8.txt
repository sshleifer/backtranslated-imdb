In the visual comedy, former Edward Edward Sedgwick has successfully performed this Hal Roach show, which uses a large number of Roach's trusted performers, offering a fast moving and adroit scenario and perfect dumps. Despite the fact that the film was originally designed as a tool for Patsy Kelly, the sunny Jack Haley Joe Jenkins, who likes the auto repair business and loves the young Canans traveling in Hollywood, tries to dive into the role of the screen for his favorite girl. - Prepare Cecilia (Rosina Lawrence). Sedgwick enjoys using the entire MGM studio as his own, as Cecilia is always here ready for the audition, coming together for the next paramour, starring Rinaldo Lopez (Mischa Auer), a musical comedy with Broadway head Lyda Roberti. Laurel and Hardy provide a few unpleasant interludas, including well-known skits covering small harmonics, and we're looking at nice shifts like Joyce Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. The balance must be given to the shores of Mischa Auer, directing a direct creative role as a star of a romantic movie and bassing Busby Berkeley's filmmaking capabilities.
