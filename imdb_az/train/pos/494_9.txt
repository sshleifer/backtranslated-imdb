This is the beginning of the new and exciting Star Trek series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Ancient sayings" "Something unsettling (the entire Star Trek series really) describes such a gloomy picture of equality between men and women when they take a very positive picture about everything in the future. (Earth has stopped fighting, scarcity etc.) <br /> <br /> Here are two women characters, T'Pol, a man of volcano and communications officer Hoshi. <br /> <br /> Some crew behaviors are a little American (unlike most international parts of the TNG-crew). Hoshi is quite elegant and T'Pol "vulcan babe" creates interesting dynamics. <br /> <br /> A very good pilot though a very good team.
