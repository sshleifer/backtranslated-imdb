Perhaps it could have been a part of the start - I'm not sure why it happened in the Asian part of Turkey. Starting from the Mediterranean, if today could get closer to Lebanon than in modern times, <br /> <br /> A camera and crew went to the Bakhtiyari tribe and started the incredible 48-day road. 50,000 people with 250,000 goats, camels, cattle and horses appear to be the fastest-moving Karun River. Goat skins are protected by swollen pigeons - you can see where the head and legs are removed. The other "bank" of the sea was very steep - I'm guessing about 60 degrees rise. <br /> <br /> Simply, it was incredible, but there was more in the future. To go to the highlands, they were forced to move to a large mountain, which was about four feet tall, though not the least. The ability to climb the mountain was pretty good and it was, but they (and all the animals) climbed to the bare feet of this mountain! Yes, barefoot. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a number of negative names, starting with a poor attempt in humor. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a documentary from a silent epoch, or do not conquer the incredible difficulties that this tribe will not only face. This is an incredible document of a group of little known people who face any difficulties.
