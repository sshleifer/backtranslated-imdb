This "B Series" is Noir and my voice reflects membership in this genre. I watched this movie last night at the sol-bank cinema in Paris. A two-week film was shot here. <br /> <br /> As we have previously seen, the drumming scene is incredible! (A-films could be banned from entering the B-movies) and the plot is interesting. However, I invite you to agree on Franchot Tone: to me, he is in a mysterious way; creepy just right shade. We must not forget that a German expressionism here (director, Robert Siodmark, a German who came to Hollywood during the war), and therefore, the dullness of the exterior corresponds to all this film. At least for me. <br /> <br /> Along with this, his only third performance performance is the famous Ella Raines, trapped in the movie for the audience. Gene Tierney is a powerful "Girl Juma" type, a miracle that has not been turned into a home. But it is so good that I have ordered another movie on the Internet ("Impact") and it is not possible to wait for it.
