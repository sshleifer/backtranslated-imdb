Surprised, I watched this movie for the first time 13 years after its release. There is a story related to any father or brother ... a brother is a bit 'wild', the other is a typically older child. Craig Shaffer is very small as the oldest brother, but Pitt is beautiful and Skerritt is thrown as a perfect father. The fishing scenes in Montana were breathtaking ... I did not know that fish can be very attractive. The film follows closely the book, with only a few changes to fit the film format. Unlike most of the movie's stories, this is a bit further measured. A perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie.
