Although Debbie Rlunolds interlides musics and dancing tots, though it's likely to take as much screen time as likely to be a psychological chiller to watch. But this movie is very entertaining. The two stars and Curtis Harrington's elegant direction easily eliminate their flaws. Films in the 1930s are colorful and elegant with a very tight budget (see Debbie's dresses!). Increasing madness and hysteria are a creepy day with a shocking finale that will follow you. Or you could easily forget the silly "Goody, Goody", which works through the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Davide Reynolds is one thing to follow every chance of happiness! <br /> <br /> From 10 to 8.
