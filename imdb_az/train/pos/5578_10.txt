The joyful and delicate perspective of the dating world was first described by writer / director Peter M. Cohen in this off beat comedy. Heroes of four men are opening up a weekly show to meet at a local meal. Get acquainted with Brad: a beautiful-looking, wall-street playboy, quickly and hastily; Zeek: a keen, sensitive writer; Jonathan: a handsome man suspected of having sex with hand creams and masturbation; and Eric: A married boy once a week with his friends hopes for some excuse for boring and banal married life. Tests and challenges in the lives of men in New York are entertaining, reflecting the City's Sex and HBO's new comedy, "Married Man's Mindi," and brings a sinister sensation of shame. The story takes a twist with Mia playing by three singers Amanda Peet and all fall for her. It is consistent with each person's personality that he exhibits, with his unusual ability. When they understood that all women were acquainted with the same woman and had fallen, they chose her friendship. The delivery is a realistic illustration of a world of acquaintance that the critic can not recognize. In simple language, they missed the point. The protagonist is the caricatures of real people here. Ashuras are hysterical, satirical and modest, and show disrespect of critics that they should not be taken seriously. Look at this movie, laugh from start to finish.
