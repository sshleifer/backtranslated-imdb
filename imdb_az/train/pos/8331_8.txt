this film is very comfortable, romantic-comedy, and is a great pleasure. Meg Ryan, Albert Einstein's only brother, is doing well, but believes in his skills. Tim Robbins, after filling her car with her fianc√©e, is mechanically doing the same thing as her love for her. I liked Walter Matthau as the only and only Albert Einstein. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie very entertaining, especially when it feels very attractive. old scholars - they thought they were fab and cheerful! This movie seems to be unpopular. If you have a crazy sense of humor, this is a movie for you!
