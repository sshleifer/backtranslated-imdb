Antonio Margheriti's "Danza Macabra" / "Blood Castle" is a triumphant, seductive, atmospheric tiger in all fronts. Black and white looks totally beautiful and enjoys beautiful creepy Gothic vibe. Flaner Foster is an English journalist visiting the American fears writer Edgar Allan Poe. Poe bets told Foster that Poe's friend Thomas Blackwood could not spend a night in an abandoned house. Foster, locked in the palace and starts to horrify! Atmospheric and feared me from hell. The crypt sequence is really heartwarming and tension is almost unbearable.Barbara Steele may look awesome as a terrible hero, Elisabeth Blackwood. "Blood Castle" is one of the best Italian fright films prepared easily. Early 60s! A masterpiece!
