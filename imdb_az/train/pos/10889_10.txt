What are all negative comments? After seeing this movie for the first time this evening, we can only say that this is just a good holiday comedy, which will boost the day of any human being. Drew (Ben Affleck) just wanted to cry when he saw that he had ended to spend his holidays. If you want to know why you need to see the movie. In addition, I liked Tom (James Gandolfini) and Alicia (Christina Applegate) some time later, but if you ask me, they were real snobs. But this movie smiles and feels good in me. Before I finish it, I would like to say that Mike Mitchell has signed a clean holder. Now, I am very fond of this wonderful festive comedy, which ends with any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan, who does not see anybody's day.
