The main reason to see this film is Warren William, a sheriff campaign manager who has a high form. He finds ways to deceive the nation and defeat the rival party in the midst of major disasters. Williams is a great actor - I have never received his right. Girlfriend Bette Davis also stares in a written role. Personally, I find that Guy Kibbee, William and others, are not as bad as a bare moon candidate they are trying to rebel against the public. It looked like a blank canvass of a man. I preferred not to be a non-character, but a real character. The story itself is incredible, the mind and the clich√©. But Warren William and Bette Davis should also watch.
