Radio is a 24-hour 7-day week when it's been growing up in England in the 1930s, because Child Clock was a treat for me when we were a spare battery for children and power. That's why several similar programs have created a great impression on my young mind and reminded me of 3 Toytown, one of which is about all the animals in the zoo, and Gray Owl speaks about the animals he knows and names his brothers. Only recently I learned that Gray Owl is not "Indian", but the tribute given by Sioux's head gives me "A man's dream". Archie Gray Like Owl Belaney, I would like to be able to imagine the world as a variable and auspicious thing. Can a new Gray Owl affect world leaders for environmental pollution?
