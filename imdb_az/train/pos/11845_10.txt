I really do not like Shrek movies. <br /> <br /> As for the word "Spirit: Cimarron stallion," I just became an admirer of animated films outside Pixar, which was only watched for the first time last month. *** Spoiler ahead *** A horse root named "Spirit: Cimarron's Bear" is born and eventually becomes its leader. One night, he sees a strange light at a distance and directs him to it. This movement ultimately leads to its capture and many things. We've heard the story throughout the film. Though the horses do not speak, it is one of the thoughts of the Spirit. The film is so goo. They (filmmakers) took back the real horses to make the horses' voices; none of these sounds were made by human beings. <br /> <br /> The soul is greeted with rain, a wonderful mix, a native American Little Creek. Little Creek then Releases Spirit and Rain, so they go home to escape. <br /> <br /> I'm never a big fan of Brian Adams, but I'm going to get a soundtrack for this movie in the near future. <br /> <br /> Follow this movie and you will not be disappointed.
