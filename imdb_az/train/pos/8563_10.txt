The film follows the "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni" novel by Marin Preda (a very controversial book and film), which can be translated as "The Most Liked One". or Hamlet's story, which is very popular and difficult because of its satirical content on the communist regime. The "humanist" dramatic of an intellectual man is in a "red" world. It's a movie full of great stuff for a movie, passion, fear, sex, and a great movie prescription. One of the biggest Romanian films, despite his psychological accusations (a European film after all).
