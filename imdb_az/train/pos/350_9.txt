Since Denise Richards and Marley Shelton have seen this movie, I wanted to see Valentin because they played in my favorite movies. When I watched Valentin, I was surprised at how great the story line was. It kills because it's not so low, because it's not terrible. Actors and actresses played a beautiful piece and were brilliant and cunning as they came to an end. Some scenes were somewhat incredible or poor, and I acknowledge that few smaller parts are very boring, but generally non-fun and entertaining. It was a mind-wrapped line of story that you have guessed and did not deserve all the excuses you have acquired. I would like to watch this movie anytime, especially on Valentine's Day, because I'm sure to give a ton of tremor. Oh, and even pay attention to your trailer's OR rating, please do ...
