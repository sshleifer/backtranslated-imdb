"The first war will be 100% foreign aid". Dan Ackroyd's line tells all this. It is difficult to describe the film; comedy, satire, action, screwball. Dr. Strangelove reminded once or twice, especially scenes featuring Ben Kingsley (which I think are a remarkable workman). The film did not have any special expectations, although I'm a big fan of John Cusack, so let's just let the movie go away. As a result, I enjoyed it. The political satire has been severely and completely stopped by the US military-business complex. The subfields were predictable, but the last relationship between story lines was worthwhile. I understand why this film is not very popular in the US, but it's a fairy tale for the rest of the world.
