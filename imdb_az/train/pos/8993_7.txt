Rock n 'roll is a scattered job and DiG! demonstrates this skillfully. A genuine and passionate project, the film director can combine seven frustrating years around two strange rock groups. At the same time, the abundance of good quality materials makes it possible for the film to attract audiences. If you are not interested in any area in the music industry, this film will definitely remain in prison. The film is worth the price alone, although it is smaller than the necessary cutting and pasting. I saw DiG in the morning! I went to a straight store to get the Brian Jonestown Massacre album (which I already started from Dandy Warhols). Firstly, the film, which is based on rock music, will succeed in other deep levels. DiG! sincerely and objectively looking at the destructive and changing nature of the creative process and those who are trying to oppose these forces.
