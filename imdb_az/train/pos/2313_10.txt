<br /> <br /> The "Come to Life" film, two young girls, learns about Dani and Maureen's life and loves writing a post. <br /> <br /> Robert Mulligan director, "Kill a Miracle Bird" does not make any mistakes. All actors are perfect. Reese Witherspoon like Dani is making a stunning movie debut. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie with beautiful pictures and looked at a perfectly directed and edited movie, I felt as if I were looking through a window instead of watching a movie. <br /> <br /> I have watched this movie at least five times and I can be honest, this is one of the best films ever to be young, to be in love, and to have young adolescents feeling, difficulties and changes. Families with children between 10 and 15 should look at each other and use it as part of a discussion. Because there are a number of issues related to fraternal competition, how to behave in love, parental responsibilities, and so on.
