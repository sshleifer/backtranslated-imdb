Greetings from the darkness again. It will be compared to the "Princess Bride" and it does not fit into the classic, but it's very entertaining and well-prepared. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> They say: Claire Danes is happy to get a fallen star starring him. But the suspense party comes with the evil witch who wants to rebuild the "ruby" necklace "played" by the prince son of Michelle Pfeiffer and King Peter O'Toole. <br /> <br /> On the way, you will encounter the most bizarre pirate (including those from Caribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare's role - it's tough inside and we're in contact with his wife. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ricky Gervais is a trader who speaks rapidly, and this is good for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> Your typical pursuits, not your age, fantasy film, but director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake) are worthy of the audience. Unfortunately, a poor marketing campaign can prevent you from gaining any money. As far as I know, the video will be a great success.
