I just saw this movie in Toronto Film Festival last night playing under Midnight Madness. The only reason I went to this movie to speak directly was because he shared his name with Radiohead and my companion had not really chosen because: -DDI waited for it to be a semi-strange flick though something like the Lamb's Silence. Someone already said he did not like any of the characters and that he was absolutely right. The character of the potent, if taken from his heart by the heart, could not really care less. I have rooted to the homeless to fulfill the character of Potentine simply to gain desserts. Christopher Smith certainly did a great job with the visual aspect of the film. But this story is very weak, but still the whole point of the film was to frighten you, and it was quite effective. The Insects Bristol band account was top notch. <br /> <br /> It was a really decent part of the Basbug and it was pretty fun during the Q & A session. I hope he will make better films in the future <br /> <br /> This is a genre for fans, but I urge non-fans to try it anyway. It was a fun way.
