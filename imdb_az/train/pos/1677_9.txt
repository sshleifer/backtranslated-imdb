La Coda Dello Scorpione (Scorpion Tail Case) director Sergio Martino's stranger was Strano visio della Signora Wardh. Quintessential giallo that loves and loves all sides of this genre. <br /> <br /> <strong > The best behind the camera are trying to do this job around the Argento gialli. He also adds his touch as director, writer Ernesto Gastaldi, Bruno Nicolay, musician George Hilton, character actor Luigi Pistilli and buyer Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> Behind all these abilities, Scorpione delivers? Your bet. The film works on different levels. It is a thrilling criminal mystery, a tense and fierce fear movie and a tense tension. <br /> <br /> Caucasian> At some points in the film, it is about approaching Argento. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong>? Hmmm ... just small ones. First, it's a scene where you can not watch the murder or watch romantic romantic romance. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, before killing, the killer will never get out of it and you will not be back. <br /> <br /> At the same time, when it's over, wrinkles are a bit strange. I would like to say, what purpose do the scrub pins serve? <br /> <br /> However, if you do not pay much attention to this dialogue, you will be easily defeated by twisting, tactile stories. <br /> <br /> However, these little squares are drawn aside from La Coda Dello Scorpione, an entertaining film for intense, suspenseful, classic and giallo fans. Call it!
