Gundam Wing is a delightful show from beginning to end, and is delighted to watch every episode. The story is a typical Gundam recipe, and in the future, the Earth's population grows to create space colonies to expand. The story is completely different from another Gundam show. After 1954, the Colony, after 1954, has been a violent seizure of liberated colonies by the corrupt government of the Earth, known as the Earth Sphere Union. To attack the Alliance and further threaten to attack the colony's 5 super-powerful mechs to the Earth to attack the worst danger (within the Union, a bad militarist organization hiding on Earth and the colonies), it's time to refuse and keep up the threat. <br /> <br /> This Gundam, known as the Gundam, is struggling with OZ and, as it is at the forefront of its own, completely overthrows the Alliance and tries to restore peace in the colonies as it controls the Earth and its colonies. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is the happiest Gundam series I've ever seen before in my mind. For this reason, a large part is the difference between this series and any other Gundam series, and stories are deeper and more complicated than most other Gundam series. Gundam Wing has more depth and feel than any Gundam show I have ever seen. This particular series focused more on the characters than the epic space battle, and the relationship between those characters. Now, I am not mistaken, this show still has many epic battles, and the show still keeps the epic atmosphere of the other Gundam series, but this story comes after an ensemble of six or seven characters <br /> <br /> < strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Generally. Show sports saves some wonderful animation and superb action, but coming back for much of the story's depth and intricacy. The heroes are drawn to the end of the show as much as you end your love for each and every one. <br /> <br /> Perfect 10/10!
