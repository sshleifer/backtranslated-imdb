Perhaps the best picture manufacturers Releasing Corp have ever prepared, this small piece of fear has shut its focus from first to the end. Director Frank Wisbar knows a good story when he writes and is more important to know exactly how to perform the full shock potential on the screen. It is not only attractive and attractive to the heroes, but the world of this world! All the moves occur either at night or in the midst of a gloomy, scattered fog. This healing atmosphere is enhanced by Wisbar's ingenuity and his convincing speeches drawn by all players. Beautiful Rosemary La Planche is an ideal, yet sensitive, beautiful, inspirational heroine. Edwards, a portrait of a local downwatch, is a nonsense of his usual, although it is difficult to believe that Robert Barrat is a sweet, neat guy who plays his son later dullsville writer / director Blake.
