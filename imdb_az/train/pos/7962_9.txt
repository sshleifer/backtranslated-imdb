Very few "remakes" can be as good as the original. This border crosses flying colors. Just repeat, I do not think so! I saw it at nine and it was completely fun and captured by the movie. <br /> <br /> The film is comparable to his colleague in 1963. The previous film is also a fun and entertaining movie, but it usually resembles more than a film of nature. This update is more epic and kinematic. Still, I strongly recommend both films. <br /> <br /> This film, of course, should be for an animal lover. We have a wise old Golden Retriever, shade; sharp, sarcastic Himalayan cat, Sassy; and young, amusing American Bulldog, Chance. <br /> <br /> Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox sang in the film brightly. <br /> <br /> There is virtually no insult in the film. There is a little scatological humor, but nothing. <br /> <br /> Exciting, scary, moving, and above all, I was really surprised to see me. The film did not receive any awards. Nevertheless, I have to say that these days the best picture candidates are as good as some of them.
