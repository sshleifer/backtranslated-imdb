Holes are a nice movie to see. There is a good message, for example: to be a good friend, never give up, and so on. I would recommend it to everyone. I'm still telling you that the book is better than the movie, but the movie has a lot of money for the book. Also playing Xleo Thomas Zero. It really adds! Lol !!!
