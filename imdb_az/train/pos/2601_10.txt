<br /> <br /> The Daddy Army, the best program in the United States, was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft during this war, not as good as the Dads Army, but still very laughable. <br /> <br /> India. While trying to convey the most episodes to the Concert Party about BSM Williams (Windsor Davies), a bunch of violets said the forest. Always unsuccessful because he was a great supporter of Colonel Reynolds (Donald Hewlett) and stupid Captain Ashwood (Michael Knowles) concert. The concert featured Bombadier Solomans (Giorgio Layton), Ginger Rogers Impersonator Gunner "Gloria" Beaumont (Melvyn Hayes), pianist Gunner "La de da" Gunner Graham, aka Padarouski (singer Gunner "Lofty" Sugden, Gunner Parkins (Christopher Mitchell ) (Williams Parkins was his son, was very wrong), great eater Gunner "Nosher" Evans and animal emperor (Kenneth MacDonald), he was Percy Edwards. Rangi Ram (Michael Bates), Char-Wallah and Punkah-Wallah (Dino Shafeek and Babar Bhatti), a loyal Indian businessman who participated in adventures, also supported Ram. <br /> <br /> Almost like the Dads Army, he left many stories. Rangi Ram said to Punkah Wallah, "Do not be so clever," and he ended many instructions: "It's a very old Indian writer here, for example, when we get in touch with a good friend, we can stop protecting your home from flaming fire." <br /> <br /> This is always the "Shuddup !!!!!" saying, "Oh darling, how sad it is, I never thought" and when talking to Gunner Graham, he does not enjoy the same identification with the Dads Army show. It is probably related to a taste issue: It looks like raw. Williams calls Williams a hole, but calls his men "Puffs" homophobic. Some people think that Rangi Ram is a race-based element of humor, using the mix that Rangi has been mixed with to play Ram (Bates really was born in India and spoke English), so the BBC has acknowledged that most of the show's people are not racist show I know someone with a half Hindu, and it was not a minor disgrace as they were and I agreed this was a very funny show. When I see an episode for the first time, I laugh more at the other sitcom, but when I look at it for the second time I do not smile at all, but how many times the Dads Army <br /> <br /> The best episode: Banu Path, series 1, Episode 7
