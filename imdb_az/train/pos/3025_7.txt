Bacall is good here - especially I think he is only the 2nd movie. This has always shaded because of falling between two major successes: "Being and Being" (1944) and "The Great Dream" (1945), both of which combined with Humphrey Bogart. That's why it's not parallel to other films, but there's no fault. I think there are a number of examples of British women describing the upper crust. There is no accent. In my opinion, all the strange habits were amazed - Boyer, of course, was no Spaniard. <br /> <br /> I loved black and white cinema. Mood is used for great effects - especially the fog incident. <br /> <br /> The grocery store is just beautiful. Boyer did not fit the role of a romantic lead man for me - and Bacall was a bit strange together. It is not a great chemistry - and, of course, no Bogie and Bacall are magic. But I still like this picture. It has a great tension and is doing quite well. I say that at this time the little girl's murder was a lot of courage. <br /> <br /> Like Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre. The goalkeeper of the hotel, Paxinou, is completely foreign and bad in his picture. Mr Muckerji is quite disturbed by a scene where maniacally laughs, as he leaves after disclosing him as a child's killer. Lorre is also very good at Conteras's bony, snake image - a terrible coward to the end. Wanda Bendrix is ​​very good at describing the child to another - especially considering his first picture, and he was only 16 (although he looks younger). Later, Auie married Murphy, who proved to be a short-lived, fierce marriage.
