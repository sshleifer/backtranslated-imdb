The ship may have been sinking, but there was no movie! The author, James Cameron, has resumed the 'Terminator' with this beautiful picture. One of my favorite scenes is the 'Dining Table' where she and her friends talk with Jack after Gul's family and friends. <br /> <br /> Rose and Rose looked at the faces of each woman at the "ONE" meeting ... She has eyes when she and her partner are in the room together. There is a link to 'MOVIE STUFF' but it's a good movie. We have a distinguished mother, and all the elites have compressed their fellow worshipers away from the wealth of their husbands. Rose is about to commit suicide, but the Gilbert grape star rescues it. I liked the dependence on the boat scene. <br /> <br /> The film was long, but fantastic! Good story, good stream, good actors! If you want it, you see it twice, its worth!
