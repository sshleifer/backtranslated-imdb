Jacknife is a masterpiece of 80's. A film that breathes with a beautiful, functioning and very interesting router touch. At Jacknife, both lovers of both European and American movies can coordinate everything. The script is very spectacular and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris is one of the biggest performances ever to date. Each movement describes the alcoholic hero who is forced to feel the broken heart in each line. Robert De Niro considers us one of the greatest actors of all time at one of the simplest, but also realistic performances in his career. Jacknife will never waste his drill as he shows that his heroes are cleansing from typical characteristic Hollywood characters. There is no hero after the war. Everyone is a victim and this is a simple truth. Like the heroes of this movie, everyone can not make up the pieces after a war. About Jacknife's warlike soul disorders. Just a spectacular movie.
