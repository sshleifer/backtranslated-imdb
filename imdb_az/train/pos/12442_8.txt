To talk about an inaccessible schedule and no budget, the film was much better than the previous two films, more than your Peter O'Donnell books and your comic strip. At this time, you can read the ribbon on Titan Books or Comics Revue monthly installments. One of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time. The movie is not great, but unlike most low-budget movies, it's the one that's getting it and responds to your interests. In the DVD Addendum, negotiations with Quentin Tarentino, a clear flood, are a gas. Some people accused Tarentino of communicating with the film's name, but nothing could be done without it. He is a fan of modest Blaise and chose a good writer and director. 8 star value considering everything.
