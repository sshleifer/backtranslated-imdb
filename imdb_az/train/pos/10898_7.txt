This movie is not as bad as I've heard. It was pleasant, funny, and I love going around the holiday season. In the mood for the Christmas shop, I am completely in the mood and listening to music. When this movie goes on DVD, it will replace the Christmas Holidays in my collection. After the Thanksgiving, there will be a movie to watch for the best time of each year. I heard that Ben's character was a little bare, but I just add to the movie, and why can it be so serious at all times? For this, get a Christmas comedy with a love twist. I liked it. No, this is not a Titanic and will bring only one rose or two that your heart will not conquer with anticipation. So laugh and a good time :)
