This is a very short film by David Lynch and David Lynch is enough for many people. This is typical Lynch short. A blonde and a dark dark room. <br /> <br /> With many silent moments, but with the noisy music of Angelo Badalamenti, on the one hand, a strange turmoil. It's a bit like a short "Mulholland Dr", a favorite movie, and that's why I liked it. Especially for Lynch supporters, but there is a chance.
