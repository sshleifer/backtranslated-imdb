If you delete the first twenty minutes or the sound of this movie, you'll be split into a fantastic comedy. That is why I found it was still a very good movie that I did not do a little job, despite the comedy that was put on the scene. To put it mildly, this movie is not even funny, even a great start. However, after some decades, things are going to be a good comedy after three decades. Of course, if you are a young employee of Lemmon and Matthau, she wants to see her previous job.
