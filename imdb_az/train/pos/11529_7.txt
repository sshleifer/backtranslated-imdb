As a biological film, "Red Hair and the Woman" (director / producer / playwright David Belasco brought an unhappy marriage to an international scene, divorced Mrs. Leslie Carter), of course, not with another Warner biopsy. a similar vintage, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (what?), but "Lady" is also a pleasant movie and shares many common features with Cagney classic. <br /> <br /> Like Yankee Doodle Dandy, "Red Hair Lady" has been decorated with the taste of the show business in the old times. (Among other things, both movies are in line with the sequence of luxurious theatrical board, and inevitably scenes are similar to space and theater managers' offices). Also, as in "Leydi", as in Cohan's biopics, and the beloved actors of the period, we're making the highest note we all remember. <br /> <br /> Again, Yankee Doodle Dandy, and "Red Hairstyles" does not allow the truth to go on explaining a good story? But like "Dandy", he controls the "Lady" with fame - to show the essence of life more than the life of the show business - the giant hero. Everyone knows that Cagney has always destroyed Cohan in the bright and neat description of Yankee Doodle Dandy, but a few cinemas know that Claude Rain is similar to David Belasko, "Red Hair and Soul" - and has done it <br /> <br /> Like the rains, Belasko perfectly sees this legendary showman galvanic identity in all his glory. Like Broadway's once called The Wizard, Rains offers incredibly pleasant, perfect observation and pretty real-to-life performance. Claude Rains will not wait to see David Belasco's jump on the film in order to move on in the "Red-haired lady" (as a hell of a good time for every hell). <br /> <br />
