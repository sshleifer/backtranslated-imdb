Richard Brooks is a brilliant companion of Philip Seymour Hoffmann's Oscar awards in CAPOTE in 2005, in the novel, "COLD GAN", in the novel of Truman Capote in 1967. They really play together (try them on separate nights). Meshu's films are more than 38 years old. They really enhance each other. Although the actor plays the role of Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two actors are a good mix. In Brooks's films, only a part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) is weak because they later call him Capote. First, I will follow CAPOTE, then INOLD BAND. This is for a powerful experience!
