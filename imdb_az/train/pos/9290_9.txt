This is not a lot of movie that John Wayne is known to. He is a diplomat, a man who works more and more convincingly than physical activity. <br /> <br /> Film is open-minded, ill-considered and thought-provoking, this film is an interesting part of history. <br /> <br /> There are two stories. The great story is embedded, isolated, and facing the disappearance of America's expanding American environments. The story of a tiny man does not like the return of a foreign barbarian (Wayne) and the first hostility of a civilian geisha and mutual respect and love. <br /> <br /> Films are very good and all actors play their role well. The two leading roles are perfectly performed. John Wayne, as well as Townsend Harris, draws attention to precisely the right force and talks in the relationship with the Japanese. Eiko Ando is also perfect as Geisha, a charming and delightful name. The interaction between John Wayne and his character is particularly good. <br /> <br /> How would these two people (as shown in the film) act? <br /> <br /> The scenario is very well written. Not all pomposity. and a realistic description of the events that can be described. Heroes are not real people, but conscious "big" figures. In addition, the clash of cultures and interests is characterized by great skill and modesty. Indeed, the traditional and traditionally strong, isolated Japan rising along the ocean and a new powerful nation war is very well ending in a swap between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains about the killing of seafarers who come to Japan, and even ships can not be put into the harbor for water. Baron wants to leave Japan alone. Wayne's character is that Japan is at an ever-increasing crossroads of international cargo transportation, and if everything goes on, it will depend on whether the nation will be regarded as nothing more than a brigade group that damages a significant road. Each of the two countries saw a very realistic summary of what they saw as right and the other as wrong. <br /> <br /> <strong> It reflects the history of the confrontation between the two self-righteous peoples who are in conflict with the interests of conflict, a constant theme that reflects the present and the future. <br /> <br /> Kinematography and Japanese illustrations from the middle of the nineteenth century are excellent before accelerated industrialization, which will be followed later in the century. A visual treat and a bright look at Japan's ancient civilization. <br /> <br /> If you give a chance, I advise everyone to be a fan of John Wayne to watch this movie. Keep in mind that there is not only one action movie. A slow boiling love story (very surprising) to dominate the place of interest in history and the representative of time and the privacy of the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Explain this film before ideas, allow yourself to tell the story and use it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> Generally, a perfect movie.
