On August 19, 2000, the cinematography of the state of Cleveland, Ohio, viewed a modest Cinemascope edition of the film, "Zabriskie Point" by Michelangelo Antonioni, about two hundred members of Cleveland. <br /> <br /> Cinematheque Director John Ewing, who is the best-selling filmmaker in the world, said the audience had just passed through Italy for this figure. <br /> <br /> Spectators have spellbound on the big panoramic screen of the movie, so the artist opens it. Watching this beautiful article showed Antonioni's intention, and he knew it was truly a modern art. It was more appropriate to place the series on the University of Cleveland Art Institute. <br /> <br /> Antonio's works were created for the Cinemascope landscape. Balancing his beautiful appearance, bright use of colors, rooted choreographic movements, all of them are the work of a real artist, using the screen as a canvas. <br /> <br /> Finally, the audience could understand the Zabriskie Point. As the story emerged, it was not a story about the essay, but rather the artist's impression of the obsolete scenes of the subject. Determining the activity of the sixty-six people is just a dramatic tool for the artist's broomage. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not bound by traditional artistic standards and may at any time pause to work with magnificent ornamental items. The spectators pay attention to one of the great images on the canvas, because the audience was eager to see the flow of their imagination. The audience could only speak verbally in character relationships, although the topic is human aleina, the director's regular topic. <br /> <br /> No pressure on Cinemascope, less than or equal to this original, will not be able to justify this special impression. The audience was more grateful for the fact that Zabriskie Point appeared in the original, breathtaking format and eventually ridiculous applause.
