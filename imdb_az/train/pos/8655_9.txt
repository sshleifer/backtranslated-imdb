"California" is one of my favorite films of all time and can easily be labeled one of the best psychological works of the 90s. The film has a very elegant face, but behind them the horror of the murderous manicures is very disturbing and honest, and the persecution of others. One of the most powerful aspects of the film is the performances, Brad Pitt, Early, as a trailer-trash psycho. Pitt is frighteningly packing the fearful character. As Juliette Lewis is simply playing his sweetheart daughter, her innocence is almost entirely heartbreaking. "California" has an hour-long, slow-moving, and very simple structure, but Pitt begins to kill a sudden killing, as revealed by his psychotic identity. There are a lot of shock scenes and all day brings you to the top of a power house that will follow you. "Cilician" is a film that needs to be looked closely at, not how terrifying it is, but for its violence and protection.
