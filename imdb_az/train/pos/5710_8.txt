Rene Clair's groundbreaking music. This is where you want to see if the songs are primarily a story. This is the story of a young hunger-striking young artist who won the lottery, as creditors call. Unfortunately, his ticket was handed over to the prisoner, who was convicted after a while in his girlfriend's apartment and ... oh but that would be the case. <br /> <br /> This is lightweight and sparkling (most of which I did not think up to Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). The film they did not go on again and rarely do. The first few days of playing as a movie five or six years later. Clair Camera is acting in the same way that Busby Berkeley did not even do (Berkeley was essentially performing dance numbers on the stage, and Clair should not compare the two filmmakers to the "real world" camera). Its a beautiful movie. and just a charming charming movie. <br /> <br /> I can not say more. It's just a nice movie and this is something that really needs to know.
