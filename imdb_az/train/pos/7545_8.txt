Although I was reading, I was very worried about reading. As an admirer of anime art, I can fully understand the art of this art, though I believe it is against my cultures and believe it. But this is the world of art .. !! The film's start is very intense, it's hard to understand content that is strange and confusing.it respects me. Many people who are so hungry can make such a daring movie. Not necessarily for children, characters are passionate about some of the worrying adventures that can not be cleaned, even though the characters are cute and adorable (memories are sad if they are sad).
