"Before Sunrise" should be a beautiful love story and my best 5 favorite movies. Dialogue and mobility are great. I love symbols, thoughts and ideas. Of course, there is no romantic Vienna present in the movie (you will not be able to find a poet sitting in the middle of the night) and it's impossible to go all over the place for one night, or (especially a stranger and your first night in Vienna). But this is not the point. The relationship between the two characters is more important and this part of the story is completely unreal. Although nothing will really happen, the movie will never be so elegant. The latter is really sad, without the "Titanic" or something. If you do not like love stories you should watch this movie! I'm a little hesitant about the continuation of the summer. The first part, in my opinion, is perfect.
