This documentary explores a story covering Pilger's latest book, The Future of Liberty, published in 2006. It is a shock to the local population of the Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos islands in the Indian Ocean. <br /> <br /> Diego Garcia is a British citizen, as the British colonies are technically British. Like Mauritius, the local population was used as an island close to the exile. However, the British government has denied the desire to return to its homeland, as the US military base used the US as a basis for Iraqi and Afghan bombings. <br /> <br /> <p> <p> The patch has shocked the situation in the ordinary cases, particularly because it documented the treatment and poor living conditions of the remaining island. Pilger also uses a dramatic reconstruction that reflects a number of changes. recently released documents have explicitly clarified British descriptions of the local population. <br /> <br /> Interviews with the touch of these images and the music of the islands really enhance the effect of the film. <br /> <br /> This is not an easy appearance, but the "Theft of a Nation" is John Pilger's best. Recommended.
