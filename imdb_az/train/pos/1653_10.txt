I agree with everyone who says that this series is the best of the "spyware" genre. My husband and I watched each episode for the first time in the United States. At that time I tried to get a series (I found all this), but not by WGBH. I even wrote to Ian Holm to see if he could have a copy! Like others, I've bought and read the Deighton series (to understand partial complexity). If the original version was on the DVD, I would be among the first to finish a copy. The images of Ian Holm's sensitive but courageous Bernard Samson were incredible. (He is always beautiful.)
