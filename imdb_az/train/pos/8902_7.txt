I imagine that Steve McQueen knew that he was going to be a symbol, and if he started filming "Missed the Dead", he would not have done that if he had been in the same year or after two years in Legal Dining. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The last lines of the film are: <br /> <br /> Lieutenant Dave: At least we stopped him. Steve Andrews: Yes, Arctic is cold. <br /> <br /> 52 years ago, never could have imagined that Arctic would melt. Blob will return soon.
