Especially in this film, Othello is so delighted that darkness and Desdemona's usually have no fair hair, as always. Casting played very well, and I watched the original text of Shakespeare so loyal. But for some character like Desdemona, I have to say that some scenes behave very wrongly. I always thought it was modest, and that's why it's not right to show Cassio in the bed - though it's just Othello's dream. At first, I was a little surprised that the love area between Othello and Desdemona was clearly shown. But in general, I liked the movie, and especially Desdemona was crying.
