Of course, the original is better, but that's not as bad as everyone is saying! Yes, it's 3 stories, but hey, what? Being honest was very good. Actually, my favorite Anastasia has changed a bit, showing what love is. The stories were not bad as well. <br /> <br /> I liked Cinderella's voice even better. I do not have anything to do with his voice, but it sounds better here, I think. <br /> <br /> So, I'll give Cinderella II: Dreams Come True 7/10.
