Completely shiny. Strong and evocative. The most solid documentary series on warfare. This voice offers a striking difference to the often-gung-ho attitude toward media coverage of World War II. Instead of choosing to shout about the horror of war, Sir Laurnce Olivier's silent sounds let you look back to the real war scenes: corpses, explosions, terrible civilians and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, thousands of lives, the torments of innocent people. And most importantly, this really brings people home where they can succeed when they are removed from all normal rules of "civilization." There is a Hobbesian thing about a human being in a true nature, and he will be able to become a monster again capable of crimes that are still shocking and delusional for 60 years. Perhaps a calendar series called the War of the Century for the seventh century was really horrific. I feel it is a great mockery that it's an event that has killed 50 million people.
