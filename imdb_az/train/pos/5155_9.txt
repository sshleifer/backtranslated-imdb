<br /> <br /> "Hitler: Raising the Rain" has been debated before publishing, and this controversy may cause the movie to be captured. <br /> <br /> Those who criticize the film that they do not see are, in a good faith, a mistaken idea of ​​how Hitler is going to give way too much sympathy. However, they did not misinterpret this point: bad Hitler's humanity did not forgive him. It is much more uncomfortable to realize that one of the greatest traitors in history has been committed by one person. One patient, the patient is a doubt, but to be sure of a person. <br /> <br /> It is necessary to know the story of how Hitler came to power to prevent it from occurring again. <br /> <br /> "Raising Violence" is brilliant from Robert Carlyle, and Hitler is in no way a human being in any way without buying it. Carlyle sees the speaker's appearance and behavior impeccably, nevertheless, never let fertility turns into an animated film or distance (Anthony Hopkins could hardly describe Hitler at The Bunker)). Carlyle must be the owner of the true Adolf Hitler, giving Hitler a tyranny and virulent ant-Semitism, giving him some magnetism and power. <br /> <br /> The author of the article, Fridz Gehrlich, is one of many hard-core nations, with the most solid features, Matthew Modine, Hitler and Nazism, to draw attention to the truth. Although Modine's performance is slightly stylted in Part 1, it appears to be settled in Part 2, the character gives a real-life hero in a film full of cunning. Peter Stormare and Liev Schrieber also provide strong support. <br /> <br /> Part 1 of this two-part mini series, look at Hitler's childhood, loans. And in part 2, the only part of Hitler's relationship with her and his wife Eva Brown is less successful than a central division, but they serve us to further deepen her mental and emotional state. <br /> <br /> Finally, no movie about Hitler can not understand us. The average person generally gratefully acknowledges that a person who is trying to destroy the race of all people can not understand. "Hitler: The Rise of Violence", works less for Hitler to understand, and helps us to understand how much more power is coming. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "<br/> 9 to 9. *** 1/2
