War Inc. is an entertaining but strange movie. Players are pleasing, the movie is also fluid, but I do not know how to describe the plot. Then I will go to the deal. This is a movie with some strange casting options. Just as John Cusack did in Grosse Point, a few years ago, when we saw him. <br /> <br /> Here is a Russian pop star named Hilary Duff Yonica Babyya, or something like that. His character is alone. There is a scene that pulls his pants off. And hit Hauser (Cusack). There is a twist of twisting the two symbols. <br /> <br /> This is the only casting option I have. Because it's just strange. The whole movie is strange. But sometimes it was incredibly laughable and I was never bored. We have the best players here. Excluding Miss Duff. He is not good. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a man who named the Hauser (Cusack). Omer Sharif (not an actor) is sent to some Middle Eastern city to hit a oil businessman. While trying to deal with her personal problems, she must help the popstar's wedding (by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a news reporter by Marisa Tomeii. There is something about Popstarla. Hauser surprised her. <br /> <br /> There's a scene that looks at some of the wrapped up at the end of the movie. I have not seen anything about twisting. But it does not matter. It's a strange, funny, and fun comedy. I love most of the actors. <br /> <br /> War, Inc.: 3.5 / 5
