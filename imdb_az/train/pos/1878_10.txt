Written by Steve Gordon. Operation time: 97 minutes. <br /> <br /> The first comedy comedy was the first. Sir John Gielguee won the Academy Award. Even at VH1, I was singing "I Love 80". And it looks as good as it is today for the first time. Arthur is a famous comedy classic about a drunken millionaire who must choose between his beloved wife and his / her lifestyle (played by Dudley Moore at the Oscar nomination). Although the main plot is a big click, there is nothing about this combination of intelligent dialogue and funny fars. Arthur Bach is actually nothing but an ambitious silence, but you can not help him. In particular, he said, "I am yours, am I aware?" Archetypical also differs from the heroes of the film: unlike the richest characters we see on silver screen, he is not ashamed of being poor, and on one stage a man tells him, "What do you have? "It's great." Moore gives a character that he hates such a character and attraction, and Gielgud is just as brutal as the slave, and his wages are dependent upon him, and the master appeals to the extreme ugly. a scenario that hates an academy - full of original laughs and loud voices - this is a movie that you and your spouse are sincere in empathy with each other, along with a group of poker friends. Do not let a mother star die or get sick i have a number of comedies trying to get the drama (including Giraeus elderly men), but at least a little, we did not care. This movie makes a suspicious decision to destroy butler, actually works because we really love these people. Why should you see Arthur? The answer is simple: because it is a whole innocent pleasure. At a time when movies are getting worse, Arthur remembers thinking of going to the movie and just having a good time. <br /> <br /> - Classic
