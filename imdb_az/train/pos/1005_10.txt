Verhoev√©'s film was full and completely trash. He needs to be ashamed of the director's disgusting hack. <br /> <br /> Chapter 2 of his book reads, is lost, and everything has been decided to be dropped from scratch. <br /> <br /> Heinlein, he. <br /> <br /> This animated film mainly captures its title, preserves the book's policy (which is a good part) and throws it on T & A, T is perfect, but at least I can say exactly.
