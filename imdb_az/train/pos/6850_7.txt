The Killer Outfit takes a sexually explicit nightmare with Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson), and then the day she visits her psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliottu (Michael Caine) sexually disappointed for the marriage. Kate then goes into a museum and chooses a stranger, when Kate was abandoned, returned to his home for casual sex, but blacksmiths attacked and killed buildings with a knife blade. The prostitute Liz Blake (Nancy Allen) detects the terrible scene and sees the killer and tries to escape. Detective Marino (Dennis Franz) says he is suspected of Liz's death, since there is no other witness between Liz Kate's son Peter (Keith Gordon) and the real killer, the name of Lizin, to see the justice seen. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Brian De Palma. I was dressed in a slaughter, a good psychological crime. Although the scenario is sometimes measured and slow, you really care about the character, knowing that Kate is developing a character before all the first twenty minutes suddenly killed, and then the film is focused on Liz & No one. Kill Outwear is so absorbed and attracted in this way, unfortunately, the character itself does not look like this. Some of the dialogues I sometimes found in Liz's dirty debate on his mouth were quite funny. The motives of the criminals are somewhat convincing, but I think you need to be forced to do everything Kill's Clothes offer. It was a good movie, but I was not too excited and really did not find any character to root or love. <br /> <br /> Director De Palma and style of an art museum in the pursuit of a car in the series focus on looks and vision. all these have been perfectly arranged. Imagine that every shooting in the shore was a lot of ideas. I felt that the movie was sometimes a little flat and helpless, something really exciting about me. Katenin stem knife killed by the murder, if it is the right word, nudity, sex and violence and some are just a minority. <br /> <br /> Some budget of approximately $ 6,500,000 KÄ±yafat Kille, a Hollywood film feels brilliant high production value. Places in New York are beautiful, cinematography is good and in general good. I thought music was inappropriate and far away and far from interference. Acting is good, but despite his high billing, I think Caine has come out on the screen. Allen married De Palma director of the Kill, two of the four films prepared by De Palma in an interesting way, emerged by & Blow Out (1981) and gave it as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> Kill is sometimes a good tension, worth seeing, but I did not think it was very well understood. this is a great element. Well, but not bright.
