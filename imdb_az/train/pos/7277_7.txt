This is a strange film about an ancient archaeologist studying the culture of ancient Hohokam Indians. He takes the mummy out of a cave (actually fake) from the grave and brings it home to study it. In a very short time, he starts strangely, and this mummy speaks. After a while his son has a mummine spirit. Even when the soul tries to destroy the woman's family, even strangers occur. This is, in fact, PATTERN, and you will fall asleep the first few times you try to watch it. But if you continue to do so, you can end it. <br /> <br /> Ahah! What is the secret of mummies? Does the spirit of Mumya angry that the soul is removed from the cave? <br /> <br /> <strong > The story has been described in a surprising, dull way more accurately as it sets out the story of the movie. Is a dull movie really curious? Well ... it can do it in some way. Maybe it's a good movie, but it's a very difficult way. I dont know. Admirers of Spider Baby will be interested to know if they use several music tracks used in this movie. (including the instrumental version of the theme song). <br /> <br /> There are rock and stones, which are rolled up by a fear and a fair sequence in a fair sequence, and eventually attack some people. Other scenes in the film are simply scary or strange; but this scene is really scary. <br /> <br /> See it! It's strange and worth your time. You may even want someone in your office.
