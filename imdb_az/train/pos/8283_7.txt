<br /> <br /> I love it as Jake Weber. Its efficient delivery is renewed at a time when it comes to the best performances. I loved the relationship between father and son. I like family dynamics. The Wendigo looks foolish, but the child represents a toy and dead deer. See this merger? This is not a psychological story, but Freddy is not suddenly a delightful flick. <br /> <br /> You're gonna be able to watch him, think about the inner child and require the movie to tell you. <br /> <br /> Beautiful job.
