In fact, this is a story about an ordinary fate of a boy growing up in a coal mine in West Virginia, a teenager called Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal). But Homer saw his love for the sky and the flying rockets, the minbar's father's horror, and the eyes of the townspeople in general. As he is sure, he and three of his comrades begin to build a rocket that will run through the stormy torrents at a distance of eight miles from the city. Thus, the community does not endanger their numerous strokes. Unfortunately, most of the city, and especially Homer's father (Chris Cooper), waste their time. However, people are intrigued and soon begin to droves to watch 'Rocketboys' send home missiles. Only one teacher (Laura Dern) at the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they can be nominated for a national science fair, and the college budget is a prize. Now, the network should learn how to perfect their artwork and eliminate many problems that they've hit the stars. Director Joe Johnston is always ahead of other films that have been a popular name for Jumanji & Jurassic Park 3 and "October Sky". No doubt, "October Sky" is its best effort and, of course, the best film. This is really a very good film, not just a film shot, but a movie as well as everything needed for high-definition movies. And besides the unusual direction of Johnston, there are some exceptional speeches. Jake Gyllenhaal was around 19 when this film was released and would have been a nice and natural performance. It is a perfect actor. Like his father, Chris Cooper also gives a great performance. The same goes for Laura Dern and she looks amazing. Even the rest of the performance is very good. The background was good. Highly inspiring film, high on your soul. One of the movies that inspired you to do all of your life. An incredibly inspirational movie along with the fun loads. Must not be missed.
