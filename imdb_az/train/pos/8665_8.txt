I am frustrating this title by Grindhouse Vol. 1 clean Euro-Garbage movie collection. But this movie has a nice stamp and should be worth a better transfer than those there. It's Stupednous ... it's a pleasure! I did not care about watching this movie ... How did Sergio Martino do that flick? Edwedge Fenech (previously unaware of his name, but he had a nice community at Hostel II). Double-crosses and triple lines are weak and this film is cemented by cooling under pressure from Lee Van Cleef, from start to finish. Should this person go to Italy to reach his potential or to allow the studio system to pass through this guy? In addition to Lee's most famous films, filmmakers have to try and try to figure out that Sergio Leono's epic dimension will be dropped down in the United States for a while (and 1/4 of the budget). So refreshing, should be taken at home in the daytime and make a wooden matin√©e
