A 65-minute long little ghost little bead, a little less visible, My name is Julia Ross, an example of the Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes - back to the English tradition of what he does not see. Disappeared Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a ghost in a new employment agency in London, and worries her if she is a relative or a lover. After reporting to the task, he wakes up in a stack like a magnificent Manderley, as George Macready's wife-in-cotton wife shows an interest in the cornish shoreline, knife and ice pitch. Despite being surrendered to my mother, Dame May Whitty (this time Lady is occupied by Vanishing is a noisy efficiency model on the other side of good and evil). The dark appearance of this tale is claustrophobic; We know what's happening, but it's weak to tell the poor Julia. This film has a reputation for being of interest, at least (and very few English) movies. I think this old dark stones and the city's corruption are closer to the old dark home tradition than the Gothic of America; However, it brings a more modern, psychoanalytic argument. Whatever you say, it remains a tension that is a source of convincing satisfaction.
