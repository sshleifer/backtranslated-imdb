The best rock'n'roll movies are not good at all. And it's not just fun. There were really smart jokes. Of course, I love Ramones. But all the film "Anarchy" and "Hate Higher School" is not a very serious thing, it's a big deal. <br /> <br /> I saw the first film in the spring of 1980 and recently I saw it again. Ever since I went to high school in the late 1970s, he gave me a nostalgia. <br /> <br /> As I said, this film does not take it seriously and is not as ambitious as the seventy, eighty, and many other youths of the 90s. And to talk, it's really dirty or disgusting. Only rated PG. This category is rare for a movie. A great religious classic and really incredible time capsule.
