I love this movie, and I've seen it again after 3 years. This movie is perfect, great player, great story, great director / camera work / music. It's a gift to show you one of your favorite ones. very bad jaco van dormael did not shoot more than that. Top 5 jobs. Truly! <br /> <br /> Comment above 3 years after 3 days today. never had more than 10 errors. Anyway, yesterday I saw "le huitieme jour" again. There is no doubt in the top part of the film. 3. "Cinema Paradiso" is a masterpiece. Soundtrack is also really good. I'm really interested in the new movie "jaco von dormael's". I hope he will finish my third part of my movie. If you see this movie, rent it. Or better. buy. You want to see it again.
