Nude and fascinating French novel is not bad for this, by focusing on the story of the first person, adapting to a faithful and humble middle-aged software engineer (or something). The philosophical and strange joke is the best way I can describe both films and novels, much more like an intellectual Charles Bukowski (CB is an unwanted disrespect). Mordantly funny, as well as a painless analysis of social and sexual relationships, is a great achievement of the film that reflects in such a well-known way to ask you: Why are not other movies so? One of the rare examples of a good book is equally good.
