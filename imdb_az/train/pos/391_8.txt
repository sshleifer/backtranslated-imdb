"Zu: warriors from the magic mountain" and was an effective classic! You have never been created in 1983. Tsui Hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (The Trilogy of China Ghost Story and then continued to do so in production.) Even now you can measure up to other films in this genre. "Legend of Zu", "Zu's Warriors" from Magic Mountain! It is not necessary to see this movie to understand part of this movie, everything is moving and adventure! I would always wonder what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hands on CGI ... Now we know that he made this movie, but sometimes it is a lot, but it's a general result It's not nice to be a critical thing in this matter. There's a lot of things happening on the screen, you just do not believe it's a great shame that this movie is not shown in theaters in the Netherlands. shouting, this movie can easily defeat Hollywood production with Superman Returns or Xmen 3. The only thing that I mentioned is the lack of humor! Most of the films in Tsui Harks combine drama with fantasy, martial arts, and humor. Again, I'm not going to pick these small issues. " Zu fsan…ô "action will see the most amazing special effects. A true classic!
