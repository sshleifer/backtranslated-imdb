This movie is right. As an old USAF Aviation Cadet, I can say that this movie is all about. Features of the application process. Waiting for the word. Joy of reception. Of course, worry about doing so. Wash grief to watch one's friends (perhaps the best). The gigantic price - the misery of the angry student airlines. The fame of the graduation. Always flying, flying, flying. Many are called, but few are selected. Whatever we want, we have to pay for what we have paid.
