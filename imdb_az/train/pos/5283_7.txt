The premiere of this film is simple and scenarios: an elderly Muslim, his younger son, takes the pilgrimage from France to the old wagon of the same age, to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, and can therefore fulfill the sacred Muslim obligation. he dies. His father is a devout devout man, but his son is not modest; she wants to be with her (non-Muslim) girlfriend if she does not accept her religious commitment. Father stubbornly believes in many things that his son does not understand, and is a device that keeps the confusion of drama among them, though it is often very irksome. There are oddball characters encountered along the way, like any good road movie; For example, a woman in Croatia is back in the direction of Belgrade, and she carries her hand somewhere, but talks on a map they can not find. In Bulgaria, a man confirms that he could speak French after asking another person, but then he gave a broad explanation in the Bulgarian language. Sometimes there is humor - a boy eats egg sandwiches in a country and wants meat - they are given a goat, but unfortunately (probably fortunately for the observer) the father avoids performing the killing ritual. Finally, they are at Mecca - to the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a multidimensional scale. For the West, it's all strange but interesting. The film is not complicated but in turn it's a kind of National Geographic.
