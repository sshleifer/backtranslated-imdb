When I rent this movie to watch it, I know that this is not an idea. Instead, I thought it was a blasphemy of the truth that someone would get a serious beating. And you know what works. Kurt Russell had a remarkable role in showing the soldier who had acknowledged what I felt. If you're doing this movie with the guys and want to watch a good action movie.
