"Movie noir" is a common expression used to describe films. Every crime drama looks like noir. <br /> <br /> In connection with an incident, "Where's Sideways Done?" is a really good example. <br /> <br /> In a very short, many operations (Andrews) accidentally kills a goodnik who works for mobsters. The father of a murdered woman (Tom Tully) meets Andrews and falls (Tierney). <br /> <br /> In order to save Demir from Old Sparky, Andrews captures the rest of the temple and leaves it alone. <br /> <br /> Morally guilty police talk about the past. His father was a thief who was killed trying to get out of prison. But it does not forgive her after she has been deprived of her accusations of self-defense. He goes to the phone immediately to report the incident, but hesitates. There is already a hot water in the department and it can be finished. Then the phone plays the wrong time. Andrews's partner and Andrews tells him that the suspect is not at home. <br /> <br /> What makes a guy so dumb to do something? Okay His job was at risk. But now he has committed many felonies. At least they think they should be too. <br /> <br /> I thought that justice, an attack, a body that did not have permission, had prevented the body from being dropped and that it was a first-class mopery against a neighbor and a false witness. <br /> <br /> Finally, root for Andrews. Suspect was not worthy of death, but after the whole accident, Andrews said he was a hero of war and could not say "there was a silver plate at his head". Perhaps, this is some kind of uncertainty, which does not cause anything like the other things like the characteristic lighting. <br /> <br /> If Noyer does nothing but black-and-white photography, murder, crime, mystery and suspicious women, then we have to add all Charlie Chan films under this section. <br /> <br /> Andrews is good. He was suffering from a kind of Mark MacPherson ("Laura"). It never smiles and rarely smiles. This situation laughs at many men when Gene sits at a restaurant in Tierney. There is no sense of humor. He has some foolishness. When he put Stoolini in a booth and stool says, "Take care, hit my head," says Andrews, "All right, taxi is kept." Andrews may sometimes look like wood, but it calls for stubborn and humorous determination and manages it well. Its main advantage is partly perfect. Small twitches or blinking his thoughts and emotional states. And therefore, director Otto Preminger deprived him of the "BOO-let" and the police "POE-bit" as a bullet. He never kept thinking about Gene Tierney. She acts well in the role of Tom Tully's daughter, but she is perceived as Marilyn Monroe, that you can not distinguish the accepted behaviors from the true personality traits. Does Tierney really have such an innocent, almost sacred personality? When answering the phone in the home, does the sound have the same sound quality as the screen shows? The weak Tierney has gone through some bad psychiatric substances before being an effective substance for bipolar disorder. And Andrews, the beautiful guy, even though, apparently, fell into alcoholism before he finally healed and made public service announcements. <br /> <br /> Peter Muller's DVD description is unpretentious, informative and sometimes fun. / <br /> Well, in any case, this is a good movie, and a good example of movie nerve. Good guys are not good, though bad guys are bad. Perhaps this uncertainty makes a picture of a popcorn perfect. For children, only one shot is thrown on the screen, and no one is bursting. Sorry.
