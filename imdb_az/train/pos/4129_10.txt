It's an American dining contest show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can be less careful about eating, but this show is just fun to watch. It's a really good way to spend some time watching television. <br /> <br /> Marc Ecko can criticize the show shown to guests ... But ... Meh. It is fun enough to watch and generally deserves the award. <br /> Yes, yes, yes, yes, it's not a new iron chef ... <br /> <br /> Ala Cuisine!
