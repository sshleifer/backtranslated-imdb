<br /> <br /> I've been watching the trader for this, and I thought it would give me a whirl for 5 minutes and my first thoughts were, "What is hell?" But after 10 minutes, I was hooked up and pulled out the jaw after my 20th birthday. This film is a great example of how a movie will be different and is also French. This movie is a highly artistic candy wrapped in a neur packet, but it's very smart to take action, and although it's not completely for me, it's a gray black and white animation style. We wanted to end the movie and make it all the same. I think it would be very easy to destroy it if it were not for many respected actors that many sound actors did not feel the characters (a perfect example of just seeing a Hong Kong legend in English), because I feel new and new, though I gave it to 9.
