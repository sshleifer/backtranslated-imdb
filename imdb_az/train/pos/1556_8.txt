Like other people who commented on "Fr√©ulein Doctor," I have never heard of this small ship accidentally by night or by day. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, a strange mixture of pulp fantasy stories about sexual, but unscrupulous anti-heroine, and real-world and well-researched combat images on the other hand. <br /> <br /> For me, this is one of the top five WWI films, one of which is "All the Silence of the Western Front", "Glory Roads", "Canakkale" and later "La vie et rien d'autre". And the scene with the poison gas attack is really cold; horses and men look like their apocalypse driver with their gas masks. <br /> <br /> I'm just like a movie.
