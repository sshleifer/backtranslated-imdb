I do not think I will never understand the hate for Renee Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was cool and she gave 'Cliffhanger' to one of the world's most awesome action movies. <br /> <br /> Sly is an old rescue climber, Gabe Walker'la while visiting her old city 'visiting the old town'. his ex-husband, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), helps the rescue work on a mountain summit. Walker has come back in a relaxed time, because closed people are actually an advanced group of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In fact, Cliffhanger is another Die Hard clone, in fact, . The scenes created only to trade in the Nakatomi Plasma, the Rocky Mountains, and the weaknesses of our heroes and keep them deadly. Naturally, the Stallone character is easily squeezed into fragments as soon as the character easily flies away from a large number of bullets and hit several rock sides without a few side effects. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting action movies around the Cliffhanger. A showcase of great scenes and stunts. One of the most important of all, I'm one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie, and if the rest of the movie does not get better, it keeps its motion. John Lithgow's victim is a fun guy and a bad friend. <br /> <br /> "Cliffhanger" is one of Stallone's best efforts, with the best effort and a very exciting action film - of Renny Harlin - 9/10
