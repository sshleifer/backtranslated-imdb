I was really surprised if this movie did not have a higher rating on IMDB. This is one of the movies that can easily be downloaded by someone, but for romantic comedy, "Moonstruck" really is in one class. This setting and ethnic charm are things that are accepted by humans. Casting is just about a nearly perfect movie. The few films of the 1980's were as good as Moonstruck and were funny. **** exit *****
