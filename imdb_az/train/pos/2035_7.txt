Well, I'm going to fight against this film. I did not know how long he was waiting for me to be a terrifying admirer. After 2 or 3 minutes, I really scared myself (very rare). Undoubtedly, the film has a small budget and is placed around the cross station, but the lack of movies should not be overlooked in the story. Yes, the story has been somewhat elaborated and does not explain itself very well, but KREP is a class action and continues to break and shatter everything that goes its way. MESSAGE for Women !!! YOU ARE AWARD FROM YOUR BEAUTY OR PROPOSALS! <br /> <br /> Everything is a good movie and is a change to see a really good slasher movie scary.
