I bought this version of the DVD to compare it to the 2005 version (bright) of the BBC. In 1985, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy adapted for the TV and adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, who died this year (2005). Especially I am very good from Rigg and Elliott and moving music. (In 2005, the music was much simplified, but it is very explanatory.) To get other commentators at several points: Richard Carstone is not Esther's, but Ada Claire's companion. Ester's uncle did not. Charlie Drake did not play Krook in any version and played Toby Esterhase at TTSS! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in 2005. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions are the dignified and surprising adaptations of Dickens's great novel. Read the book now! Not perfect, emotions can sometimes weaken you, but you do not cry and laugh!
