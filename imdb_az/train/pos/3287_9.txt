My friend and the Hahraman section randomly chose a paper paper "Paperhouse" for a weekly excursion - they did not hear us, but the box above the box was really promising. <br /> <br /> Anna Madden, a 11-year-old, takes a home and visits her in her dreams. When he sees his house, he is definitely dreaming, but in a sense, is something entirely different. Taking into account subsequent events, it does not seem like a far cry from the truth. In any case, she finds that she can add home, content and surroundings by adding pictures. <br /> <br /> As she continues, Anna is becoming increasingly ill with fever, and is also fully compatible with home and her painting. Moreover, he and his mother are dealing with his father; <br /> <br /> Okay, the paintings sound pretty good - but there's really something really there is a danger about it. The dreamworld eerily surreal - for example, the house is just a gray block in the middle of an empty space. The filmmakers have made us worry about this alternative world / the ongoing sleep ... <br /> Anna looks like a child who adds home to her, Mark seems to be the same patient (I do not give her the same son you know from the moment you see it). In fact, Mark can not go because of a disease; She can not go in the world of painting, because she has not gone anywhere. He blames himself for real-life illness and tries to improve the situation, but ... everything is really strange. With disastrous consequences, he brings his father to the office, which does not belong to him. <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm sure that after watching this, you will not die with your palsy when analyzing the death of this thing - As you can see a simple story or are there really meaningful layers? I do not know, but in any way it is quite interesting. "Nightmare in Science Street" - this was a quality, so it is time to cut off the reality and dreams. <br /> <br /> <strong> Even though I may have some results, I was pleased to have ended (some of the sensitive species are Kleenex- may be necessary!). <br /> <br /> Even though Paperhouse really does not really work after it's really over. But if you look at it and continue to go back, it's a little nervous. <br /> Good movie. Well done and acted - especially as Charlotte Burke Anna - top notch. Burke is a work that has never been seen before or in a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <BR> <div> <br /> <br /> Give me a chance and do not regret it! And maybe you should read the book ...
