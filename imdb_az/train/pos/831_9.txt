That's exactly what I liked, this movie was limited, mainly to Pierce Brosnan, but it was one of the most funny movies I've ever seen. It almost begins as a tension, but goes on to a delightful part of a work filled with Pierre Brosnan and Greg Kinnear, one of the liners and the great comedy energy. Also, while telling that this movie is a comedy, it should not forget that sometimes it has a heart and can be touched when it is needed. When I went to the theater I did not know what to expect more than a mustache, but it was one of the best films I have ever seen. I left the theater, I was very fond of the movie and planned to see it in a wider broadcast. I recommend a well-written comedy and everyone who appreciates the big mustache.
