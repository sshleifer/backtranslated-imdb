I'm probably the biggest supporter of Nancy Drew. I read it three times each and Nancy played a lot of games. I liked this movie. You have fun all the time you look around. I went with about ten friends and everyone loved it. There were three women behind the back, and I asked them how they looked at the age of 40 in the last 30s, and they said they loved me! So this will be fun for all ages. You just have to give a chance. And it teaches you a lesson, make it your own, even if everyone around you is exactly the same. In general, this move was great. Now I'm going for the second time! So stop him. Its a really good movie!
