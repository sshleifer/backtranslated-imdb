In the same year he shoved "Braveheart", and danced two costumes. I made a decision against Mel Gibson, but I have a rational advantage for Rob Roy. Both "Braveheart" and "Rob Roy" show the history of Scots bloody and romantic. "Braveheart" is an epic piano for individual honor and courage and a beautiful revenge fantasy. It's melodramatic, anachronistic, and maudlin. Remember to use his cornball on slow-moving shootings. Violence is both ugly and dignified. This is the last quality that is more attractive to adolescent mindset. When the "Braveheart" exceeds the level of slaughter at Rob Roy (which does not mention the attractive working time), the final film is ultimately more mature and satisfying. His actions are clearer, but more striking and clever. Her sex is less showy, more erotic. There is a better romantic interest in Rob Roy. Her dialogue tries to anticipate the poem of the era. Actors try to approach the dentist in the rotten teeth of their mouths. And Tim Roth is a pretender. Also recommend: "The end of Mohicans" and "Patriot". The latter are more similar to the old "Rob Roy" tone, calling it "Brotherhood", emphasizing the bloodshed. All of these films are worth the R rating for violence.
