Everyone who lives in fear of divorce will be confident with a terrible little boy, the protagonist of this indie movie, which is considered to be a zombie secret. Jake (an admirable Anthony DeMarco) simply transmits the trauma of two crashing parents to an understandable image? Or is the creature true? Writer / director Shelley Ryan balances both of the possibilities and estimates the audience. <br /> <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are angry, but like loving parents, they are quite convincing. But it's a creepy little character, Ms. Bender (Barbara Gruen), unheeded babysitter and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a foolishly durable Real Estate Agent. Jake's Closet is a dark inspirational portrait of childhood as a kind of hell.
