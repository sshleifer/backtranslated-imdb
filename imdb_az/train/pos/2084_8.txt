The main problem with my film is that it takes too long. Moreover, this is pretty good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who intends to marry through regular marriage. Luiza is a servant girl who married Rainer Muni. They live in Muni's father's farm and they're pretty bad. Finally, getting more money to buy more land gets drought and nothing is up. Everyone going to the north by Muni star is left behind first. When they leave and come to town, they see that they are not working and that they are worse than before. Even his little girl is about to earn some money but think about making a decision. When a group begins to lure the city, it looks like a military unit and begins to carry out people. Paul Muni does a good job and Luise Rainer won the second Oscar for this movie.
