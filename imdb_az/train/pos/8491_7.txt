I saw this movie when it was new. After three years of lease, I leased in Japan and was scared when I saw the toughest sense of my expanded international experience. The film surprised me with the exact picture of the cultural conflict between me and Japan and Pennsylvania (where I am). <br /> <br /> I have been living in Japan for several years and I continue to use this film for unilateral treatment of both sides. In the story. Interestingly, although Japanese-American actors speak the original language in Japanese, dialogue is available in Japanese version to cover the second-language delivery problem. <br /> <br /> I noticed that a reviewer used this in a Japanese classroom. I think you can learn more about what you do not expect from Japan to watch this movie (most funded in the 80's and promoted by Japanese companies). <br /> <br /> Do not drag on the average rating of one-star viewers, seeing that Japan is not something that does not want to build cars in the United States. (Of course, there are many factories in Japan to be close to customers and avoid trading friction). This is a very hot and funny movie that will give you very high degrees, not just about 80 clich√©s, but also cheesy electronic disco music as a dance around it. Michael Keaton has never been fun.
