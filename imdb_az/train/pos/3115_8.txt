In the first place, "The Bourne Ultimatum" is a breathtaking, virtuous, super-action film that says it's not a genre. <br /> Secondly, cartoon superheroes are a feline thing. Thirdly, the film is a complex, important matter for the criminals themselves to become criminals. <br /> <br /> So, in the hands of Paul Greengrass in the last Bourne series, the last of Abu Ghraib or Executive Division's Bourne Supremacy 2004, and United 93, last year, is a significant success, maybe but also in fact, has not diminished with the inevitable extensions of this species. <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned "breath" depicts a free face and physical sense: from the first frame to an armchair of more than an hour of spectator, visible, breath-taking, relentless, wind-frustrating. <br /> <br /> Oliver Wood's revolutionary film, no change in the rhythm and gravity of the film, your romantic film, Robert Ludlum's 1990 novel (ten years ago, Bourne Identity "), which makes the best of Tony Gilroy's scenario. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is once again inevitable, indispensable Bourne, the CIA agents fantasy deadly, taking the entire agency in search of the mysterious agency program this time has turned him into his personality, his past and a lethal machine. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> His quiet heroism, such as Edward R.

Bourne Ultimatum Bourn√©, with its geography, time, weight, and, generally, resisted the limits of physics, this time away with an old man-world bits. <br /> <br /> All this "real world" magic - jumping from country to country in second second, exactly where, when and how much needed to come - special effects and super hero eradicate cartoon inadequacy. And yet, only the "clueless pedant" "facts" allow Bourne to interfere with fantasy entertainment based ecstasy.
