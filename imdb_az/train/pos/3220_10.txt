Soldiers can not be academics or Lucas special effects, but this is definitely for me. I'm not sure what to say about you, and I'm sure you're reading your summary. This is a great condemnation of future action / science fiction. Kurt Russell does not talk much, usually looks at his face kick or eye, but it is in line with that character. There are great moves and fighting scenes; some scenes are inaccurate, but Hollywood believes in lands where we have to run away from normal life. I did not see Soldier 2, but that's one of my favorites. I am lucky enough to have a spouse who has won a boy's films; but also love this movie and recommend everyone who loves hard-core / fantastic movies.
