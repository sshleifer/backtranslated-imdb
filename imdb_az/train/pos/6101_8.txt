That is why I will not destroy you, it will be very short. There are some nice players and comic strips in attractive shooting. A young graduate of Harvard's School of Medicine (Brian White) does not know people as he thinks. Since a girlfriend (Mya) left her for work as TV Production, she goes to a small hospital in Florida for internships. His Chief Resident, Wood Harris, admired by his 'creative worker' (Zoe Saldana), accelerated her. They help keep the careers and helps them to have more opportunities than just being a compassionate doctor for a player who wants to earn a living (seems to be for many of my pre-med friends).
