Okay, my head is foolish and it almost sells that flick. I watch Siskel & Ebert talking about this movie and then playing a clip or two. Although I was a conscious man of Rno (I can describe Snoop Dogg, Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer), I was not interested in talking about the movie. S & E showed the scene describing how the group chose the group (using some "shady" logic and a group of "prepared" facts) and then attempted to involve the group and their opponent's school (and, of course, NWH has gained good grades in the school with some "information" about how the opposing group leader was lost because he was in the annual committee). <br /> <br /> In a few years, this thing appears on the HBO and I note that at 10 am my laughs are laughing. Yes, there is a "Spinal Tap" kind of rhythm ... even when documentary clips get the same "tone" and the group is similar to a similar way (now Behind the Music phenomenon - small time group has good chemistry, well-known, very fast money Collecting, controversy, medication, some types of death, band breaks, then compromises, ends with more hope for the album, but it's just a little bit more successful in the past with Spinal Tap, but it's dragged at a point and in my mind The smiles that are set up in the scenes are decreasing, and this is the place where the rant, which is about to eat the snack, wants to go to "ELEVEN", this guy is pint-sized stonehenge and so on ... <br /> <br /> The more "unexpected" humor In comparison with the FoaBH, you can see some of it, but there is no bigger installation for every joke. Sometimes jokes can only be seen in the movie Cundieff and other actors in the band were real chemistry, and direct references to Vanilla Ice, Hammer and many other cartoon-type rappers really worked well. It hits me like a one-time movie for the main story and laughs, then comes back and watches to look at the subtle jokes. And the songs. Is "My Geoffrey" better than "Big Bottom" (Spinal Tap)? I do not know - but both are cursed. <br /> <br /> The awesome video of Tone Def's "awakening" stage is so strange, but still very funny. <br /> <br /> I can go on a little, but you save your time and do not lose CB4. I watched the first half hour, I sank it. You are not bored at FoaBH. There are some funny moments, but you will not say anything good about it. Probably one of my favorite scenes is that Ice Cold and Tastey Taste are the same girl sharing my same ripoffs (if I've never heard of it) .... at one point, there are two indicator guns on each other and the next thing you know is the manager, photographer , the girl, and even Tone Def, think the weapons in the room, showing each other, the targets are back and forth. <br /> <br /> I was convinced that NWH managers were exposed to similar flaws like Spinal Tap's drummer (although I do not think anyone is spontaneous though). I can not ignore the possibility of Cunduff's "Spinal Tap" before writing this movie, which is more clear than the hip-hop Spinal tape. While there are some similarities, humor is different, and the movie resembles a real documentary (perhaps we know the guy who played the "Lamar" from the "Revenge of the Nard"). Generally, this film is, in my opinion, a "street queti". Kinda is like NWH.
