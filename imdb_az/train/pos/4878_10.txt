Kabei: Our Mother (2008) is a poem and beautiful beauty from Japan. A real breakthrough! I heard great reviews of the movie and hired Netflix. I was happy! In many ways, this movie reminded me of the old style of Japanese classic films, as I have seen in Yasujiro Ozu since the 1940s and 1950s - the titles began with the same color, with red colored Japanese letters on the neutral colored sheets. Immediately thought: this director loves Ozu. The same style was also used: mostly internal devices with several open scenes. Roger Ebert calls them a few "pillow shots" so. The film's strength is based on the love of the characters. <br /> <br /> This story is made from a Japanese family life, during World War II, and after. Mothers are motivated by the best of things we can do for the growing girls after their father (a university professor) is arrested for sympathizing with war. He has never been released, and only a few short sessions with his wife before he dies of starvation and illness. Along with that, a former student of the professor often comes to care for the mother and two girls. She is in love with her mother and is the father of two daughters. But the war is starting and it is drawn up and they must break through. Will they express love for each other? Will he still return from battle? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is almost a Madonna type, she is very nice! Great-looking eyes and flawless skin. The actor who performs the student is also extraordinary: his name Tadanobu Asano. Sensitive performance. There is no match; He is gentle and kind. Of course, I would like to see these two films in other films. I think I'll check them out to see what's going on. These two small children are also very nice. <br /> <br /> The movie is only broadcasted to the American audience on NTSC DVD and it's easy to read English subtitles. I gave 10 to 10 IMDb. I was pretty much cried with the Japanese film Seven-Four Eyes (1954). Do not miss this movie!
