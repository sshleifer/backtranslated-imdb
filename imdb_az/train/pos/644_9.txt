A is a female friend who has a relationship with a SOB who has a long-term girlfriend. SOB, of course, is very beautiful, attractive, and so on. Dude is a very intelligent woman. Looking at the character of Jean Pierre Leaud, it's like watching what's happening in real life when some of these guys are killed by our female friends. It's a catastrophe, and you know it's a lot of trouble, but there's nothing you can do. Leaud is brilliant. Completely empty. <br /> <br /> When Leaud and Lebrou loved, the scene took two hours and the next morning she was a record-breaking and very sweet and seductive, she sings to entertain. <br /> <br /> It's a long film, but it's a long time I'll be in my memory. in a walk, preferably in cinema. It takes the time to enter, but the time runs out.
