Great and unfounded Marion Davies, this beautiful night (1928), shows itself in a silent comedy that shows beautiful William Haines. Davies crashes Hollywood with the help of Haines, playing a shot from Georgia. They appear to be "discovered" by Marion and appear cheap comedy up to a great dramatic star. A great lamp in Hollywood and his claim. Davies & Haines are a wonderful team (they have never been discussing each other) and Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glinn and Marion Davies are a hoot. For any serious film buff or for anyone interested in Marion Davies still unjust!
