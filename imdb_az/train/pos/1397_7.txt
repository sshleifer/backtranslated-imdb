"Shore Leave" is basically an average Star Trek adventure. There's nothing wrong with the episode yet. Simply, this is not the best representation of the show's fans. Lightweight, more fun. Nevertheless, I am pleased to see that this type of TV show is in a good sense to get away from serious intergalactic conflicts. In this episode, Kirk decides to spend some time with his crew, and an opening party shines on a planet similar to a perfect place for a vacation. As usual, the planet is not as peaceful as it seems. There are some moves and tense moments, but most of the story laughs. Well, but indefinite.
