<br /> <br /> When I was 9, I saw The Glacier Fox in the theater - I forced my parents back three times. I started looking for a video about five years ago and eventually found a copy on an online auction site, but I was taken by a new distributor and later understood that I understand the original video is the The Family Channel, Disney, and so on. and have the right to be purchased by you on a regular basis. It is an interesting film that draws on the story of a bumpy family in northern Japan, which is narrated by an intelligent old tree. Perfect soundtrack is a good appreciation of the movie. Today, it would be a good dealer, and today children's films are better than many of the weaker victims.
