Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra have been filming this film for several years and have been closing in for several years. Bondon Sinatra asked for some singing lessons, but Sinatra (Nathan Detroit, Skye Masterson) wanted to be the star singer in production and did not want anyone to be better than her . He told that Brando was missing, and Marlon went to the field at night to get back to her. When Sinatra had to eat, eat, and eat, she would eat cheese. Subsequently, Sinatra gave Brando the nickname "Mumbles" or "Mr. Mumbles".
