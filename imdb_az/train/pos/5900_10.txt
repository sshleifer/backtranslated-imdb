I'm sorry to hear that this charming and strange movie (the first time I first saw it in the early New Year) had such a bad visit recently. In my opinion, this has been very small - perhaps perhaps more appealing to the European space (for example, America): Perhaps we can better understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations in Europe because we have some of them in real life! Particularly exciting, "Beautiful, Beautiful Night" is a limited but memorable song limited, but good music, especially in the fifty years of the HMV 78rpm record (in my opinion, labeled 10 inch apricots!). If you give me a chance, I do not want everyone to make a try: it can be a pleasant surprise.
