It's a totally delightful and unexpected movie. After a young man hoping to enter the qualifying soccer match between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, they will go to the World Cup in Germany in 2006. The problem is a young girl and girls (or women) are not allowed to play soccer matches with "men". The following was a beautiful comedy, a small band of skill that he produced. The film explores the absurdity of restrictions on women's freedoms (and for young soldiers who correlate these issues). If one of the girls needs to go to the toilet and, of course, there is no toilet in the stadium. The camera work is the simplest and in some cases this story can be explained as a scene game. But it is a small scale that delivers the movie's delight. Great cinema? No, it is not likely; great fun - sure.
