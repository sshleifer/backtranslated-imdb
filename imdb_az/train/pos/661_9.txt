Ho, ho, murder mania! The awesome power of the terrible tale of a great AK Command is one of the best episodes of the crafted TV series. Director Robert ("Back to the Future"), developed by Zemeckis, Fred ("The Night of the Night", "The Monster Squad") by Dekker, Ellen Trainor, married Zemeckis when he played a role in this episode), a Marshall Bell by a good community) killed his polished jerk with a shot poker on top of his head. An assassinating killer escapes from a nearby shelter, shouting like Killer Kringle, a murderous treacherous, and when Trainor decides to host a host of hostility. Alan Silvestri's scary, blurry account and Dean Cundey's usually polished cinematography adds more fun to the macabre. And his creepy hiccup is for Gucci, a demented sparkle with his brilliant green eyes, and a leering, with a really bad grin, for Sweet Sensational Saint Nick and Larry Drake (Sweet Slim Giant Benny on "L.A. Law").
