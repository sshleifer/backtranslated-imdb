This is a great movie. If this is any indication, Hong Sang-Soo is not really the "most secretly hidden in Asian cinema". There is a similar resemblance to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and I cover them all the way in the thematic, but I like one of the films. Although open minimalism is still here, it is a little less talked about in the works (the camera will never move) and in a way I found myself less than self-conscious "slow" from the movie Tsai Ming-Liang or Hou Hsiao I think that I love it more. Of course, it does not keep enough subjects like Hou. I felt as though I was somewhat "full" and less open (slightly less) than some of the movies, though it resembles something moving forward. I believe that Sophia Coppola will not be directly affected by the movie "Missing in Translation" (it would be a difficult time), a young woman walking around her could not help languishing in the hotel room wearing scenes and punk dresses.
