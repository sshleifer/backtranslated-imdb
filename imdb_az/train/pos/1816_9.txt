Most comments on this page indicate that this movie is a bit dark for children. It depends on the child. This is not a 2-6 year old movie; More than 8 years and more. When I was 10, I saw this movie and I absolutely loved it. Most animated films were a little bit more for my taste. This film deals with more serious issues and therefore has a slightly more emotional impact. The characters in this movie may be SIS and send it to HELL! This gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes they threaten their lives. Good guys are always perfectly sweet and beautiful (like other cartoons). They have "real" motives, such as revenge and greed, as well as compassion and friendship; <br /> <br /> Perfect movie
