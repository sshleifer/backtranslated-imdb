After Batman, a superhero movie must have another exquisite taste: The Dead End stimulates only our tastes and more will leave us! It should look and feel like a real superhero movie! Even this is a tough movie. It's a fact that is not paying attention, character and action. Despite the fact that these limited resources are produced, large budget, star-cast, erroneous products embarrass the films of "other" superhero. Here, the main and supportive characters move and look like real people. Finally, a Superman that looks really "super" and looks like a real thing! The naked rubber molded body should be without the armor to hide hidden physicists for paid actors who do not need to reach the battery. I'm just a sensitive Warner Bros. I want the exec to give OK to fit the full length of this author. Despite going to theaters or DVDs, I would not be tired of watching her. The plot is worthy of my dough, which I earned for myself. Take a look at "bigwigs" in Marvel & DC production and look forward to what you need to look at real good production superhero movie. Never again has the Batman and Robin fiasco or Hulk, Daredevil, and so on. Learn from these little time makers and repeat "repeat" the movie's hero in theaters. Mr. Collora ... We need more managers like you!
