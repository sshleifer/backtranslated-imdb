It was the best battle documentary. Sir Laurence Olivier, since the beginning of the first episode describing the horrific events in Oradour-Sur-Glane 'The day came soldiers arrived.' When mushroom clouds appeared to Japan during the final days of the war, I never missed a second part of this classic series and remembered it well despite being back in 1974. Each aspect of this tragedy has been reflected in detail. This whole series is a must for all children of the world to avoid the repetition of the World War II tragedy and not to be mixed with patriotism or religious longing, hate, hatred and intolerance.
