I love Monte Carlo and I love this movie. I thought everyone was very good. I did not get acquainted with Richard Lewis, I thought his character (Julian Peters) was very unpleasant, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good at the girl who was turned into a golden heart. George Hamilton was a charming and perfect Italian gigolo. There's a day like John Candy festive day. James Belshy's heart is heartfelt. Cybill Shepard has shown a very sweet performance as a housewife who has been very sensitive. Cast Delightful Ensemble. Many talents, intelligent scripts, lots of going and in beautiful places. Take me just for a beautiful day of ghost. Especially when you are traveling to Europe in the winter when you are no longer in the horizon.
