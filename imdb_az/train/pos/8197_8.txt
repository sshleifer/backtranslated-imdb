**** Excellent <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - I will do my day! <br /> <br /> The fourth picture in the series was driven by Eastwood (what the Magnum Force was referring to most of them), and brought back the violent society from the first two films, but the film has not yet influenced or credible. Regan and young Republicans were released early in the 80s, and the attacker's revenge did not appeal to this term, which would have been better for Enforcer, which would actually make a good movie. Like on the street, it was already in the middle with Harry. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3 STAR
