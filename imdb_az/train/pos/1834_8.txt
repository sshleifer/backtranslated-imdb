This movie is very touching. People do not think what they say about this movie, it's a very good movie. The deceased father, Amitabh Bachcha, is great because he wants to teach his son how to manage life if something happens to him, and Akshay Kumer is great as a bad Aditya Thakur. The supporting role of Shefali Shetty, who played the role of Sumitra Thakur, was spectacular. Priyanka Ã‡opra was good at her small role in the film. Ragpal Yadav, a brain-dead pistol and a Boman Iranian law, had a very good connection and the comedy scene was exciting. The target is very good.
