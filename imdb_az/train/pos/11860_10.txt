This movie is all there. A classic illustration of events covering thousands of Cuban immigrants. Antonio Montana (performed by Al Pacino) is one of thousands of people in America to get the chance to choose their destiny. Miamis' Narcissism Empire is a very accurate description of this cinematography. Brian DePalma takes an incredible job of directing this picture, so the audience also deals with each character along with the story. Brian DePalma, Tony's symbols are very convincing and powerful, with Steven Bauer (Manny, Tony's best friend), Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (Gina, Tony's Sister), Robert Loggia (Frank, Tony Boss) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elvira , Frank's wife). I enjoy every minute watching this movie, and still look at it weekly. This year, this is the 20th anniversary of the classic crime movie, and in another 20 years, people will admire this movie with admirable numbers. This movie is shocking because I'm very dramatic with other criminal films.
