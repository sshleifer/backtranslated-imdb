John (Ben Chaplin) is a single bank worker living in a small town far from London. Despite the Internet, he appealed to the Russian bride's agency. Sophia chooses (Nicole Kidman? Man can be lonely and shy, but of course there is a good taste?) And when he gets to know one another, he understands that he does not speak English. Communication with one another is mostly restricted to sex (still imagine a horrible situation for a boy, there are only a few old Nicole Kidman!). On the birthday two Russian friends visit them. Then there will be plenty of surprises. I liked this movie: first, it's almost impossible to be labeled. A black comedy, a movement, a tension movie? I believe all the choices are right. Nicole Kidman is as beautiful as usual, and I am very interested in Russians: Is it true to say that Russia is false, or is it just fake? In any case, I found him a bad movie. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "color: red; ">" Jesus Perfeita "
