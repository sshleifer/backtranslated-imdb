Roman is easily over-priced and is one of the best parts of the film, written by Greene; Quiet, but strange humor, like the murder of a murdered boy, who came into the scene with Boyer and Lorre or had some plot. <br /> <br /> Where the film goes beyond the film, it is prone to ridicules. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I do not want to say that the movie was not bad at all. Always looks at the section and the story remains as good as it is. Some of the smaller characters were stock actors who could turn their hands on something. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that the film does not exist on DVD.
