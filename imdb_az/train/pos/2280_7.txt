It's hard to classify the movie - maybe the avant-garde spy thugs? The Mom Night is a very good Vonnegut novel and, of course, one of its easiest novels is to adapt to a lengthy movie. The adaptation of the film is very loyal to its original book. The "indie" approach to how this film is produced may be more effective than funding a large Hollywood studio. These days, I suspect that an intelligent novel, Mom Night, will get a green light from the great Hollywood grindo. And normally this is very bad, but not in this case. The main night has a tight density and a solid cast. Nick Nolte, who appears to have a pretty good role, has a "cadence" who still has the opportunity to have different characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and beautiful as always. I always thought it was better than it came out of the entertainment industry. I think that although the television show has become a minor event, the role of debuting with a little air and a dead girl (Twin Peaks) is not selective. Anyway, this movie is absolutely nice and you do not have to read a book to understand the movie. In fact, given the current geopolitical realities, the novel may seem historic, and some young history-trained historians will be completely confused with what has happened (I'm talking to you, from the students, geographically industrialized world, history and lord know what else!).
