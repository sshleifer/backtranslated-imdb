I've seen this movie many times and I'm not tired of it. In every sense of the word, it is a classic. The film is hysterically funny and at the same time pretty much all touches. Open your mind for those who are not "subtitles" or those who are not generally fond of foreign films. This story is a great movie for "beginner" because it is very entertaining. Do not get me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and it works), but everyone will get something (even though there is only one big laugh in one of the main characters called Aoki - I do not think this movie smile I love it ... and I think most people will.
