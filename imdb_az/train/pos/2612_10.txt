This is a very nice movie. When I was producing, I heard mixed reviews and waited for her release! Director and all actors delight. The player on the pitch gave Eva Mendez what he needed. Like everyone here, the last part of the film is like a gravel. Katie Cassidy did a great deal of work, but did an amazing job with his character. There is a lot of career ahead of him. I was surprised at his performance. I absolutely loved the film, I asked for my values ​​in life and in my priorities, and for that I'm a better person! The movie has a great message. Exclude, so you can enjoy it all!
