I absolutely loved this movie. I'm not particularly sure about it, but it's fine and it should be available for the DVD. Women were strangers, and they were still well enough to spend their time in Italy at the Villa. Actors, in my opinion, did an excellent job. The heroes were all different and still used smart stories. There are humor, drama and relationships all the time. It requires 10 lines, but I just do not want to repeat it, so I'll get 10 lines. So I'm so sorry. What else can I say for a long time since I last seen it? I hope to see it again, but it does not exist.
