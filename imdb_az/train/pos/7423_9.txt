Recently, with Cudi, I watched the '54 'of this movie, and when I appreciated the story and music, I noticed that the film did not hold me. The '76 repetition was expected to be the same story, except for the twist of the rule. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a realistic and modern look of fame, money, love and value. This version is more realistic than any other '41 'with a better music, better functioning, more captivating plot lines, and, of course, a deeper love. I do not understand why the previous movie was in the top 100 list of the American Cinema Institute, but this decisive remake does not give any clue to any critics.
