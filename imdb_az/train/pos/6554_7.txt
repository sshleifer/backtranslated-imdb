OK: <br /> <br /> The movie was very nice. I'm a great Nancy fan and I read all of the original book 1-56 and went to read more. Now I am 96 years old. Take a lower class than those who are afraid to give this movie. All the tips point to a beautiful movie! I liked everything. So what is Nancy right now? It is still old fashioned as it is in the books! People who have not read more than 5 books complain about Nancy's appearance. I've read it all and I think Emma is perfect and Nancy is perfect. Part of the movie I found sad. I liked the exciting speed of the car and got into one another. I liked the tips. I've solved myself secretly! It was really nice. The people we have complained about Nancy Drew know nothing about a good movie and B. Go see it. Oscar can not be worthy, but a really good movie.
