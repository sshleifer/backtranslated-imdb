Albuquerque is a movie with all the elements outside a movie: a movie B or C. A story related to a movie. western color, but now seems very primitive today. Nevertheless, fun, original color and sound for people who use the Old West are well-preserved on the recently-released DVD. Gabby Hayes is a good sidekick, as Lon Chaney always is and Randolph Scott is a bit cheerful to the usual. In a movie called Albuquerque, you will see something to remind of the city, but the city shown here can be just one place.
