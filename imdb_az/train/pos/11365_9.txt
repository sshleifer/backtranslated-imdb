Okay, let's start by saying that this movie does not fully clarify Andrei Cikatilo's crimes and legal pursuits. The Political Bureau could have been a "formal policy" that the Soviet Union did not have serial killings, actually the legal system seized others, and when it was brought to Fetisov Burakov "Killer X" Hal. In fact, after the end, there were many murders in their hands, the authorities determined the officer's power with them and stopped the killing of a person who was not considered as a normal serial killer parameters. This director and writer recalled that the audience consistently recalled that the story was based solely on "actual events." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Behold, this is a dignified example of Hollywood style with the speed that reflects the basics of what is happening now. It is easy to follow and has enough truth to convince the version of events. Yes, Cicatilo raped and killed both children and men and women. Yes, the fatigued laboratory work was free to continue to kill for years. Yes, innocent people have blame the murders and have "admitted" their murders on police challenges. Yes, despite the murders (with Burakov's help) the gay community was harassed. And yes, Chikatilo was confessed to the psychiatrist's notion of the private prosecutor, but not with the confusion of Gorbunov, but with a psychiatrist's sophistication (though Gorbunov was close to the egoist martin reflected in this film). <br /> <br /> <strong> Despite the events in the Caucasus, all this, dramatizes all the events, along with truth and injustice. <br /> <br /> This film director and writer Chris Gerolmo does not hurt the perfect pressure of a pitch. . Donald Sutherland, the Soviet party's hacks, and the subtle spine that appears to be needed when it comes to the growing emotional presence and tricks of Stephen Rean's killing, the protagonist of anger under Jeffrey DeMunn's fear-inspiring behavior, Max / <br /> <br /> The excitement of a boy, who is part of Von Sydow's criminal investigation, raises all the intersecting dialogues and ways that can not enhance the precise regulation. <br /> <br /> Citizen X is almost pitch perfect. "almost" only congratulates himself at a time that is not in his own discretion. It was recommended in a good way, but not actually presented ... It's good for me, considering Hollywood's sexually assaulted "serial killer" movies.
