I liked this movie very much. Many Korean people will get acquainted with this movie because many of them have teachers when they go to school. Cinematography was moderate. The film would have been better if the angle or camera movement were even more irregular. But the editing was very clean and unusual. <br /> <br /> Acting was also very good. Kim Ha Neul, generally, played an innocent, weak girl with Korean soaps. But this time he plays a very nice tomboy. Kwon Sang Woo also makes his role very convincing. <br /> <br /> The most loved thing about this movie is that the characters' emotions are not exaggerated. There are so many Korean romantic movies in the face of the audience, and I always thought it was too old. <br /> <br /> There is no such violin in this movie. <br /> <br /> Very funny and good work done.
