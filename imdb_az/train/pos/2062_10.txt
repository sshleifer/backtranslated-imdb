First, I think that fear is a bit higher than that. Less than a ton, perhaps less acrobatic fear would make this film less cheese. But in general I think it's one of the best films in the world. Tiffany Shepis is incredibly beautiful to be incredibly beautiful. While all the important nudes in this movie are missing, there are a few films to see. But here he gets all the flaws, especially when he is away from the spark. And Richard Elfman does a great job as a sheriff and a drunken lover. Yes, low budget B-movie. But one of the things I have seen is definitely one of my favorites.
