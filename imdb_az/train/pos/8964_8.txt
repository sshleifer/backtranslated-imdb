As a result of some happy coincidences, Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak also prepared this comedy for creating Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" work. After carrying Hitchcock's film, perhaps two actors should do it. Anyway, this is a great companion to Vertigo. In fact, the film can be viewed as a flip side of Vertigo and ends with a happy ending. Here again, Novak is subjected to a transformation, while Vertigo actually plays two women, where cadence is fatal. Stewart is again spelled out and suffers with a little love for her always. Unlike Vertigo, "Bell Book and Damascus" come together in the perfect antithesis for Hitcock. Still, the dynamics of love and attraction are investigated, but a totally different vessel. Casting is terrible. Lemmon gives a classic performance like a striking aunt like Novak's crazy brother and Elsa Lancaster. Ernie Kovacs is an alcoholic cult writer and of course Hermoine Gingold, who plays Novak's opponent, is all good. Scene comedy with Stewart, who is potentially the best. Everyone who has not seen a memorable light comedy, whether Vertigo has seen it or not.
