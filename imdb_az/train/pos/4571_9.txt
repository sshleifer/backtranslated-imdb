The most important thing about this film is the brilliant performance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor, Christine Brown, a guinea fighter and fighter who eliminates all the probabilities despite his physical condition. As a person working with patients with cerebral palsy, I can tell you with certainty that their performance was shocked. Christy's family, the great support created by the low-income, working-class Dubliners, encouraged him to be unable to do so, and portrayed that he had read this support brilliantly, but the dialogues were cleverly written to capture Christy Brown's foolish arrogance. I invite everyone to this movie, especially to classic movie lovers.
