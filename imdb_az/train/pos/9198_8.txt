B movie? Yes. DIY? Yes. The first movie? Yes. But Aestheically A +. This film is definitely a bad sound / editing / lighting / toy / etc. and so on. But there are many positive things in this film. First, the most animated character dies first! Second, it's a parody / funny B Rated Horror movie. <br /> <br /> Our killer laughs at me and my friends on the ground. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people are trying to make every single independent film and make it a work. What do you do for this, a group of high school kids drew their first film. Why, only, this is really good.
