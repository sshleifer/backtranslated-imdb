I first met friends from "pigeons" who knew the "smart" humor instead of Eddie. I prefer comedies with entertaining thoughts, like George Carlin and Dennis Miller. Eddie's "Clothes for Your Outfits" section also provides the same type of social observation humor that adapts to your thoughts about something that causes you to leave. This stand-up theme has a broad theme and they are just hysterical. <br /> <br /> Englebert will leave you without a piece to decide on the stage name! <br /> Thanks Andrew and Catherine! ... and "Do you have a flag?"
