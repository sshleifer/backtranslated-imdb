This film is related to all the subtleties and everything changing boundaries, race relationships and navigation. Of course, not a movie for everyone. No vehicle tracking, no building blast, no killing. Drama glances, minimal gestures, spatial boundaries, lighting and left-handedness are offered to the tension - sometimes very visible - unsaid. It belongs to identity, memory, society. Different parts of the film work together to increase self and other identity, identity, desire, limitations and loss. It will reward the attentive and sensitive viewers. The Chamber worries those who demand explosive, massive, spicy moves. A beautiful human story. Thats it.
