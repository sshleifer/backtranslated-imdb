This guy is not an incredible thing. Indeed, you feel that you are living with them in these tragic events, and you are finally crying with your family. It was not only for himself but for his sake he was very passionate, but it did not need to go through this unhappy pain to other people who saved him. I watch this video every time I live in a bad or "low" day, and I always have to see the big and bright side of my life, just like Jonny, with its unbearable pain. When I visited England twice during my life, I was somewhat sorry to meet Jonny and could say that I would meet him. Jonny is comfortable to know that he is sitting in his cloud, painless! Rest in peace, dear Jonny. You deserve it!
