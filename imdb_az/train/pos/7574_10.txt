Resident Evil 3: One of the best in the sorting series with Nemesis (or Biohazard: Last Escape), The Game has a very good storyline, playing like Chris Redfield (Claire Redfield in his brother's search) <br /> My rating: ** ** More than ***** (above what you know from Resident Evil) It scares you like other Resident Evil and includes more cutscenes rating based on other videogame)
