Noni Hazlehurst's AFI Award is parallel to his performance at FRAN at least three years after his turn-performance. Colin Friels is also good and for those interested, Alison Garner looks like Noni's child and Michael Caton is a bearded artist who is best known for casting. (In addition, Hazlehurst is now home to Better Homes and Gardens and Caton is a host of property-type apps with Hot Property, HOT AUCA, etc.) This film Noni was born in Australia in the mid-1980s best female player. Rating: 79/100.
