It's hard to write something original and real. He knows better than to know how unimportant it is to ignore and bring it together. The Case of Setton is one of the places where you can recognize your life with all its simplicity and beauty. I'm touching it by the Big Bad Swim, and then I'll take it as far as possible. The only good thing is that it's a shame that I can not have anything to show my friends (you know, like a DVD?). Everyone can not go to festivals to discover this pearl, and this movie is truly worthwhile! I am grateful to the staff of this work and I'm waiting for it to be distributed.
