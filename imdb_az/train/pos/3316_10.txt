Bette Midler can not be described in this concert. He always gives it to him on the stage. In his jokes and antiques, laughing or shattering our eyes from one of his big ballads, Bette Mathers brings the audience to action. If you do not see it (the best way to see Bette), that's a better thing. An interesting thing to look at was that his voice had changed over the years and grew, but he did not lose his strength. The more "noisy" version of the "Stay with Me" loses nothing in the spirit of ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS, as it is always cleaner and heartfelt. I will enjoy this concert for a long time.
