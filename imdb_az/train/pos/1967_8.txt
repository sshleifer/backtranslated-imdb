I do not understand how bad the ratings of this movie are. I found it ill, shiny, bent and psychologically complicated. You will not get deeper into the minds of a Hollywood movie psychopath. There are stones in the stones, the nuances that operate with the stone, and even after the end, there is a structure you can imagine. People are sure Sharon Stone is 48 years old and that Michael Douglas is not in this regard. I guess people will be greatly sensitive to the DVD they see for themselves. Give a shot, you can be happy!
