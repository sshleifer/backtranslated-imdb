When I was in New York, I saw this movie as a Live Artistic Child. Although Horror Hotel was not as good as it was, it was a pretty creepy movie. I just bought this movie on DVD and it differs from what I remember because I've got a DVD on the actors in French and / or Italian, and there are no subtitles available. Then other actors respond to English speakers. It's strange. Also, the names of some actors in the DVD box are written differently than the IMDb. <br /> <br /> Besides, this film takes Elsie's dress and is shot on a nude scene and tries to force Julia Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) into her bed by kissing him while resisting Steele. This scene is available in the TV version but has been greatly modified. Is there any additional image that can be included in a remastered ultra-edition? It is a sad impression that some of these old low-budget classics have been combined into bits and sold in all editions. Where are master tapes and unused footage? <br /> <br /> Allegedly, the rest of the film is pretty good, except for the first time missed 20 minutes before the arrival of Allenin to Qala. There are not many special effects (Herbert's face is good after Julian's clubs). The creepy atmosphere and Barbara Steele's strange, exotic and attractive appearance should be more of a movie. Honestly, if Barbara Steele was not in this movie, it would be a great zero. She is making a movie!
