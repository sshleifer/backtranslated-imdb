D.V.D. about "My Future". and is very clear compared to my VHS version. Audio is just, but it can be difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> I liked the movie so much that I looked for a copy of the book and found it. Explained why some events happened. The best things about the movie are the small things I did not notice at first. John Cabal plays a toy airplane on a Christmass side, as a dive bomber, calling a naval vessel "Sea of ​​Dinosaurs." Airborne ships hides in an attack by an unidentified enemy aircraft. He made a flying wing. Strong rolls for women through the entire film. <br /> <br /> There are so many things to watch for the movie.
