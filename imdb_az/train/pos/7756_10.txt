It has been upgraded by a number of masterpieces or performances and visuals. No matter what, I'm sure she loves her. From the staggering, strange, nostalgic stories, from Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone to the most unpleasant performances, all of which is lively and colorful, this is a high-level trash, and it is very spectacular. You can not talk about subtle and delicate sex subtext that emulates the whole film, always threatening to avoid image from dialogue, but never can. If I say that the movie's nice entertainment did not contribute to my love, I was a liar, but behind the comedy was unusual (or was it?) There were some extraordinary craftsmanship behind, and I really did. I really like this melodrama.
