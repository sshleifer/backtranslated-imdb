If you love war games, this is very good. Some are cheap, but robot battles are worth seeing. For a while, I enjoyed the mech war zone, and this was the only movie I saw, this part of what would be like this one of the great mechs pilots. If you generally like it, you'll need to reserve your games for space warrior three and a fourth, and an Xbox and a $ 350 Steel Battalion. The film is worth seeing at least once. There really need to have some movies on the same subject. Less remakes and more original works. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
