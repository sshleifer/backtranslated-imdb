In 1936, the audience was not surprised by the audience: full-fledged, full-length "Technicolor". I can not say sure, but this can be the first (3-lane). Anyway, 70 years later, the DVD looks great. <br /> <br /> In some of the films, this film shoots, film shootings, and so on. <br /> <br /> I think the story was the same: the first half was perfect, and the second was stagnant. Although many people are not happy with this, they finally gave a nice message. <br /> <br /> Marlene Dietrich has never been so good, I do not believe and I have not played such a soft character (Domini Enfildin). Charles Boyer was a heartache, a man's star, and Domini's love, but some of the smallest characters were most interesting to me. People such as "Batouch" as Joseph Schildkraut, as John Carradine "The Sand Diviner"; It was the most memorable, at least, the "Irene" dancer who played by Tilly Losch. Wow, you have a face and a dance, you will not forget soon! I have not seen anything like this in the thousands of films I have seen. It was just worth the DVD to see it. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Like other well-known British actor C. Aubrey Smith of the day. Chilliwright, meanwhile, will be known by classic film enthusiasts like Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan, a man who plays the arrogant sales secretary at the big hit called The Corner Around The Shop. <br /> <br /> Beautiful direction, photography and color, and the Tilly Dance, I'll remember the best about this movie, it's a good thing, and it's good stuff. Last half an hour would be great - though I was amazed at the end - I would appreciate it even more. Certainly, one movie collector wants to add to their collection.
