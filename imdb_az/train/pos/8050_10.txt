Repeats the most agile fat guy in martial arts. Sammo's film, Bruce Lee, Sammo, who imitates her hero's hero, is an incredible way to act as Lee's actions and battles. Bruce's style, and then the kung fu, which he is more familiar with, shows how to watch and adapt to his art. <br /> <br /> Take this kind of flick and a jigsaw puzzle on this movie - comedy (like some unusual, fake black man), action and incredible fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> A great beer and friends movie, worth half an hour everyone.
