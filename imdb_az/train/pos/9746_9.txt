Okay, come on. This is a god-terrible movie. The area (for example, this) is terrible, worse. But the film was for some reason, and for some reason, like all these terrific Mario Lanza films ... just to hear the sound of the star, in this case Pavarotti. Okay, maybe Lanza films were a pretext to shoot women, but this is Luciano's hearing. It's just worth watching the movie. <br /> <br /> A great opera star who fights herself fears her, along the way finds humble and loving, and hits numerous numbers. <br /> <br /> I am biased at several levels. I am Italian. I'm a great Pavarotti fan (nothing about Pavarotti, including his fan base). When I see this movie for the first time, I go out to see the height and depth of my life and the love of the first time. <br /> <br /> The horrible, beautiful sounds and memories of this film are enough to make me live deep and re-loved. <br /> Yes, it's rooted and terrible. But his voice is immortal and timeless, and that's all the sound. So, I hope that this movie will be listened to and listen to a person who had never heard of Pavarotti and enjoyed a new level of music and love. Try it, like the Italian foods that you have never worked before! You are wonderfully surprised by Luciano's lover or potential Pavarotti.
