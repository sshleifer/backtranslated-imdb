This, of course, is one of Trek's all-time fav episodes. Only a single film continues to be so naked. First, children will shine on a planet's descent. They respond to a freaky mass library type dude (very well played). Then Kirk directed himself to return as it was in the 16th century. McCoy and Spock are trying to follow the frozen version of the alien world over the past 100,000 years, but instead froze it nearly. <br /> <br /> Spokes itself with some amok time with a sexy cavegirl who has been defeated by this frozen, terrible world by some bad guys, and gets charged with witchcraft. and comes to McCoy when he thinks a dock should look for a way out of a royal assestment. In any case, they all escape from hatred, and the poor cave leaves her daughter behind. Spock finally gives a ton of relief before leaves and leaves. At the end of the word you can express sorrow. Only cavegirli in the frozen desert appears to be cruel and really touches. Spock must be far from his mind to abandon his greatest hope for love and humanity. <br /> <br /> In any case, with this episode, you earn a lot of money ... Love story, Salem witch's trials, Spokes like a human being, the inability to stay in the general isolation ... are abandoned, and where the three spots are completely different. It was nice that he could shoot all of them in a one-and-a-half-minute movie. This is a classic, I do not miss it .... I want the fer shure vulcans from the DVDs !!!!!!
