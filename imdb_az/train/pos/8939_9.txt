The strongest alignment of the best-selling book and Broadway show is about the life of Bessie and Sadie Delany, two "colored" sisters who have lived through the age of 100. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll tell Amy Magan, White New York Times correspondent. Flashback and today's scenes do not have much inspirational value, as they are in the book, but really powerful. Nevertheless, some aspects of her sister's life, such as the mothers' race sequence and the reasons for the mighty identity of their ancestors, are not explicitly presented. To understand this, you need to read the book. Still, this is because the book is great! Apart from these imperfections, this is especially prepared and realized by Dee and Carroll and a very strong and educated film.
