Rohmer goes far away from the usual portraits of the French middle class to talk about the challenges of an aristocratic lady in the French Revolution. More attractive about "La Anglaise ..." (apart from the soul itself) is a beautiful aesthetic acquired by Rohmer. The images are digitally decorated and should look like baroque images. In some moments, I can not really say that you watched a movie or a series of photos in the Louvre Mus√©e. Every art is part of an art. <br /> <br /> My rank: 7.5 / 10 <br /> ---------------- <br /> <br /> -------- ------ - <br /> <br /> - -------------- ----
