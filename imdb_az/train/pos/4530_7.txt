D.W. Griffith could have made any movie he wanted after the great financial success of "The Birth of a Nation"; he did not make the most technically ambitious film 'Intolerance' on that date. The film has been hit by such innovations in its installation and form and has resulted in a well-known financial train crash. Buster Keaton does not accept this kind of "Three Centuries", parody of "Intolerance". This is Keaton's first feature film (only performed at The Saphead). In this film, three episodes had three separate split plans. Griffith was also involved in "Intolerance". Keaton did not need it. <br /> <br /> Chaplin has already succeeded in extending comedy, as Keaton is risking it here. <br /> <br /> Chaplin is already in "Carmen" (1915). Keaton likes this movie. The wrestling scene in the epic of Ancient Rome refers to the sword in the wrestling in Chaplin's film. The sequence of both scenes is the same. In addition Chaplin imitated DeMille's brilliant style of Carmen, and Chaplin's film was dedicated to this film. Keaton does not try to radically edit the narrative, the narrow structure, or the monumental nature, but respect the "Intolerance". At least, the stories are Dreyer's "Leaf of the Devil's Leaf" (Blade af Satans bog, 1921) and Fritz Lang's "Destiny" (other post-'intolerance'). <br /> <br /> Keaton takes part in a physical, courageous comedy where he takes risks. This does not lead to jumping between buildings in the modern episode. She said she was willing to change the scene rather than jump again. And not just Keaton, which is at risk; For example, anakronic baseball bar was quite dangerous. So, Keaton took risks with a big movie, like Griffith, though in a different way. And all of them were successful.
