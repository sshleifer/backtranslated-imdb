In 1967, I met the Elsinore lake-port and fled to Yellow Pratt Read Sailing Park. After returning to Germany, the above-mentioned serious television flew and one segment was about high-altitude sailplane visits to California in the early 50's. (Real life pilot Bill Ivans, I did not know who played with him in the series). The sailplane in this movie was the same as flying in Lake Elsinore (same N number). I saw that I was looking at this segment and wondered if it was from somewhere. (this was serious about other parts of the Baker Ejection Seat, a tool to find the avalanche victim, etc.)
