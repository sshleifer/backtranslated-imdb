What a movie! I did not think that Richard Attenburton could have such a film. Gandhi, apart from Ben Kingsley's performance, has always indifferent to me, and I have never considered Attenburg a particularly good filmmaker. But "Cry Freedom" has been interested in me lately as a few films. <br /> <br /> Kline is an exciting, exciting political film with Kevin Kline and young Denzel Washington's great performances. <br /> <br /> Kline is South Africa's newspaper editor Donald Woods, who has been a friend of civil rights activist Steve Bikoya. It starts as a difficult friendship, because Woods sees Biko as a black supremacist hatred against the white. <br /> <br /> Winning over Woods with his good attitude and full transparency with Biko's pleasant words, and presents a reality that apartheid has had nothing to do with Woody. <br /> Biko stands alristically against the system that protects all the prejudices and the people. One night, from an illegal meeting, was arrested and beaten. As Biko became a great personality in South Africa, the authorities are trying to respect the issue. But the truth comes from Woods efforts. <br /> <br /> This film has an interesting structure. <br /> <br /> Sadly, Woods and his family target the secret police. In fact, there are two stories: Biko first tells his life and death. <br /> <br /> The second half is less interesting, and Woods is trying to escape from South Africa to publish a book. About Biko. Woods has been an enemy of the state, a forbidden person who can not be acquainted with people or leave his own country. He is constantly detained by the police. Kevin Kline also performs well in this second half. <br /> <br /> Although the first half is pretty straightforward, the latter, Biko makes exciting things by editing and editing events and events. South Africans. <br /> <br /> Someone can claim to make it even more interesting, but as the second half attracts me, Woods and his family prepare a courageous plan to escape South Africa. <br /> <br /> The last minute was so heartbreaking. George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa's account were of course something. Although I have never been a fan of Fenton (I will not be able to stop Gandhi's account), I think Cry's Freedom is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Freedom of Liberation is a film for watching Denzel Washington. This is a movie to be dear to the whole. Acting, writing, music, editing, cinematography come together in perfect synthesis to create the power of the human soul. This film is worthy of a place next to Pianist, Life and Fine Arts.
