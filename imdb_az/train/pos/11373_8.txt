Here's a strange thing: it's not a modern movie about a serial killer, no battlefield, nobody's dead, no vehicle tracking and no loud noises ... and it's happening in Russia. There are only two short-acting scenes, but these are horrible. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is a detective job, and the poor detective needs to go through a red ribbon to solve bloody crimes. This is a very scary movie, and "defective" describes the hero's personality (Stephen Rea) best. But the story is not painful, and all this is very interesting. <br /> <br /> Rea is as clear as a mixed-looking detective. Jeffrey DeMunn is obviously scared of murder. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is undeniable, but he is the only character who has some heat in this film. <br /> <br /> Once again, the story is put on a liberal agenda, here and there, the attitude towards the gay, the general validity of secular psychology, the police and government officials to flaunt / raw / bigoted, remember, remember and remember . <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a clever and refreshing low-crime movie. This is probably not known, but I liked the people I liked it was a bit unusual. It is more cold because it is based on the real life of the murderer. Do not hold it because there is nothing to do with it.
