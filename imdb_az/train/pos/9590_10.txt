The documentary is a black and bizarre drifting queen "ball" that began in NYC in 1986. Here they want to decorate what they want, stop the things that are in front of the audience, and vote. We know many members and see how they support each other. One man said to another, "There are three strikes against you - you are a queen of black, gay and dragging." These are simply people who are not accepted in society - just the balls. They can be accepted there and everything they want. Then the film is cut three years later (1989) and you see how everything has changed (for some, catastrophic). <br /> <br /> Sounds sad, but not. Most of the people you meet are really laughable and take a lot of humor on their situation. They know their positions in the community well and receive miraculousness - as they are. All of them live in "homes" controlled by different "moms" and all help each other. The film is interested in the public's emotions. <br /> <br /> This film was a controversial and big hit when it went out in 1990. She won the best documentary awards at many festivals, but she did not qualify for the Oscars. In their opinion, "Black and Hispanic deception is not the Academy's material". No interesting? Homophobia and racism all together. <br /> <br /> It's still a big movie and a part of the tour as it's seen today. There is no such thing anymore - they already showed that NY. Balls are still held, but not with the spirit we see here. And the drag is more "received" in the community (for better or worse). I've heard that your home is also going. This is a sad thing. I would like to know where these characters are - I know that two people died of AIDS, but I have no idea about others. And what happened to the 13-year-old and the 15-year-old? <br /> <br /> One such documentary is still interesting, funny and nimble. You need to see all the ways! An accuracy 10. Where's the DVD?
