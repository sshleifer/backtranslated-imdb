I loved BATMAN: DEAD END, I thought he had a sense of theater and could be a lucky movie of Colora. This trailer did not give me the same impression. The story line or the potential story line was pretty good, but after leaving me due to action and special effects, I would have made a good TV movie or television show. <br /> First, Michael O'Hearn is not a good Superman. I really thought her shortcut, made good Clark Kent. I'm sorry, I do not think SuperMan is a buff. He had masked the size of the city suit. Batman may have the body of a bodybuilder, but not Superman. Supes are no doubt, not bulk, toned. Anyway, I did not pay attention to all her violations, and the change from Kent to Superman seemed strange. Superman flew from the sky, and the Superman flew near the ground, with the cables and the visible buildings on it. "Superman flying in. I do not think that there is a complete body shooting, of course, that trailers and fittings that support O'Hearn should be placed on his lower body. <br /> <br /> All this was a good trailer, probably I paid for a movie and paid it on television The story line is a good thing to do with Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, to entice Superman, Superman, and involve Lois to Wayne, Lex, and Twoface to join the forces between Batman and Superman, and I'm sure Kolorla and the company a bigger budget and agreement for the full movie, even O'Hearn can provide a decent film, of course, in recent years, from Hollywood one of the best comics.
