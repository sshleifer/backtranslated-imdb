There is a special reason why Fox and the Child have a special note in my heart. A new fianc√©e - wow ... One day - saying goodbye for an unknown term, I was a little surprised with different emotions and suffered from a brave face to see. / / <br /> I watched several film and television shows, but I was attracted by what I was interested in and what I was seeing. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> </ em> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> "I love you," he says. How did he do it? How did the animals keep their way? <br /> <br /> The morale of life is good and the end is oh so frank and uncertain, though it is a happy / sad thing. Again, he took me a little guard. As a person who normally takes his feelings, it would be difficult for me to finish on a plane full of people over the last 15 hours! <br /> <br /> Some of the issues are very important to me. <br /> <br /> In my opinion And this is life. Of course, there are things you love and feel comfortable around you ... but there is a great mystery in the open air. The next time I see something ordinary when I make it clear; I'm going to investigate, watch and embrace it. What exactly is happening in this movie is what's happening with a darn good film / nature doc. 8/10 <br /> P.S. Two months have passed since the flight. We still do not know when we'll see each other, but we will be.
