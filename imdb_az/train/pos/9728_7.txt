I'm a big fan of Simon Peggy, and so far I watched most of the movies, and none of them stopped laughing at me. <br /> <br /> This film is actually a good person, like a person who is dismissed. However, he has an ethical group that only prevents him from doing anything that might be known to him. But in the end, he ends the culture of life. <br /> <br /> The film is well-toned with humor, romance, good play and a dance. One of the movies you can enjoy when it ends.
