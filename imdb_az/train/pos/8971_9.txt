Generally, I'm not a great admirer of stop-motion films, and I did not even notice the first thing I did. But as I knew that the movie was being shot in the repressive Czechoslovakia during the Soviet era, I watched the film more and more clearly to see how it was destroyed. <br /> <br /> He said that the film actually created the film, and that he had the power to live as a work of art and a political statement. <br /> <br /> The sad little movie is made without any dialogue, but what happens? A sweet little wooden man prepares a clay pot and spends a pleasant time destroying the pot, making it into a handmade rather than a hand-made animated hand. Well, the wooden man tries to get his hand out and repeat his job. But over time, the hand becomes more obedient and eventually becomes a cage. And in the end, man, with his hands and hands, with the sign of true hypocrisy, dead, gives the human fun to the hero's funeral! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is a clear attempt to criticize his prime minister by brave Jiri Trnka. Not surprisingly, the Czechs loved the movie and gave critical praise, but the state (ie hand) forbade this small example. Unfortunately, Trnka did not see his people released after nearly two decades after calling the Velvet Revolution.
