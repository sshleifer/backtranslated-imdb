The Moon Boy was one of the more symbolic films I've ever seen. I liked it very much, immorality / death rate, obstacles and guides in life. The film depicts many vampires Kei with the power of immorality and its advantages. Even though they have supernatural abilities or eternal life, people are desirous of this. The Moon shows the disadvantages of childhood, pain and immortality, because feelings of loss, especially the main characters, affect Sho and Kei. The meaning of the "Moon Child" is clear, as the film is about to end, is a month in which everyone can guide and guide the other people. I personally like a movie like this morality. The weaknesses of the film are some of the actors and special effects after making the movie less original. The scene that resulted in the death of Toshi could have been more powerful and realistic when more realistic emotions were put on the actor. Some scenes with special effects, such as shooting, could have been more original than an action video game. Sparks from the guns were very fake, and I think it could have been eliminated. Nevertheless, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should watch. The symbolic ideas and pictures produced by the film will be readily accepted by everyone and may attract many audiences. A very thoughtful movie and an entertaining movie to watch.
