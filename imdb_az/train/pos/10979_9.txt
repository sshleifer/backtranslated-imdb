This documentary follows the lives of a mother and daughter Big and Little Edie Beale in family homes in East Hampton, New York City, from the mid-50's to the 70s. When the filmmakers find them, the house is divided into 78, and others 56 are a strange room. Older Edie Beale Jackie Kennedy Onassis's aunt and first little cousin. <br /> <br /> Women will, first of all, be evicted from their homes due to an accident, but Jackie has sent money to repair them. <br /> <br /> This film may sometimes seem like an expatriate, as it seems to be the best mental health, but it's hard to get away from the movie at other times. The "small" Edie blames his mother for today's condition and tells him that Edie's never thought that he would never succeed. "Small" Edie is often trapped in the past, paying attention to his choice of decades ago, and he likes to show pictures of young people who are a good debutant. His mother rescued the rest of his life with more fate to live in terrible conditions. Both the women and the glamorous life of a family have a clear picture of a happy family, and a great portrait of older Edien, next to his bed. As you can see from the house, most rooms are empty, the walls reach and break up, and "small" Edie eats food from the attic for ceremonies. And of course there are many cats running around. <br /> <br /> In the heart of this documentary is quite sad. Whatever woman is drowning in places where she lives, in particular, she is completely scared. <br /> <br /> Along with this, as a documentary film, it is a miracle looking at the film. , and highly recommended.
