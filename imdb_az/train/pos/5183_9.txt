<br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites. In the early 90's, I saw in the college and the story, characters and movies were generally the top hooks I could not identify with the film in thirty meters. Leave the people in India with a great story, with a great, solid story that you can admire with Armageddon-like movies and movies that you can appreciate.
