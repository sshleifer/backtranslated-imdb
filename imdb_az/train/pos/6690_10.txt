Mystery Men is one of the funnier movies ever. Symbols have innocent innocence and "delicacy." It has been a part of our family's "culture" and we often quote quoting symbols. This is my favorite movie in the last 2 years. My kids are 13 and 11, and we love these three films. Great game and comedy. We love Galaxy Quest and Monty Python movies. Okay, we do not talk here intellectually, it's just a family bond!
