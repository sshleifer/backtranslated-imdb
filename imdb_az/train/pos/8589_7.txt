I will be honest, finally, to check this movie for the stars - though they were essentially waiting and compelling, especially for three reasons - or the compulsory story of a violation of the President's Secret Service (something, this show was informed through DVD attachments, yet It does not happen, it's true, it's noteworthy!). I managed it, and there was an unrivaled choice by no one except Detective Meldrick Lewis! Okay, okay, Clark Johnson, "Life in Murders" and a journalist (mostly) from the television manager. <br /> <br /> Veteran and Ace Hidden Agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) has to learn this. also blackmails and kills his wife, who is targeting and Air Force who blew a chopper and armed for the Presidency (David Rasht, who remembers the "Sledgehammer"?). His relationship with the first lady (Kim Basinger, one of the second ladies we know, so-called or real), of course does not help her. He also has a real shade in the service and to prevent dog dogs as the old friend and assistant and head (Kiefer Sutherland, almost completely still "24" mode). Some other key service agents (Martin Donovan and Foxy) have a pretty high standard of political tension, which is a bit challenging to get as a shadowy external character and does not set as high goals and desirable levels <br /> < br /> The summary line is the best way to describe how this show was played without spoilers. Although the movie itself was the most fun I was interested in, the DVD attachments seemed to me a lot deeper and more exciting than the movie.
