This is a great documentary. Any fan of car racing should have a copy of this outstanding movie. The director of "Stephen Low" was a great work, as well as the main stars of the film, Father and Son, Mario and Michael Andretti. DVD reviews and incredible sounds. And all the best IMAX! Great home cinema test disk.
