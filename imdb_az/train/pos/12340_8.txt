There is really a lot to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play - Fareel seems to be a good starter, but his line readings are clear coke. This is considered to be the first film that uses the rear projection in the majority of cases. <br /> <br /> There are two great powers in this show: although visual readings are excellent, not dialogue readings. Rose Hobart, like Julie, has little memory today: basically, the Joseph Cornell program is for the ROSE HOBART, which cuts Borne's Orientalism simply to draw it: the original credit is the stylish visual aspect of Melford. His great beauty and simple (though stagy) performance helps to correct some of the damage he has made to the earth's surface. <br /> <br /> But one of the issues of the luggage is the mystical love, and it is the development of heavenly creations that make this great thing possible when the skyscraper train goes from its "Hot Place". H.B. Here Warner's performance is as perfect as ever. <br /> <br /> So, we have a flawed but very interesting version here. Lang's 1934 version is better, because in the version of CAROUSEL in Henry King, the scenic scenes are better in the watering music editorial. But I still love this version, and I think you should give it a chance.
