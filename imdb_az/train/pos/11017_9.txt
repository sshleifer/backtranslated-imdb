Filmmakers, shooting hits and missions should be more careful. the quality of the shooting sequence on the airplane during the early stage of the film. Instead, after the villains stood up, they decided to delete many of the sequence sequences ("A-Team" TV series). mountain tops.This movie was a lot of great time all the time. Stardone moves sequences, better dialogue and much more Rambo / Rocky style emotion / resolutions than Stallone would have been taken to a higher level than this movie. It's not Stallone's fault. The director of the film wanted to reduce the character of Stallone and tried to steal the film, even though it was not for his cinematography. Although it's a good movie ........
