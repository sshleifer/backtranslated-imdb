Good Times was a new comedy about the first nuclear black family living in Chicago projects. Whether you live in indoor cities, ghetto, suburban villages or rural areas, this show is not a show of a poor black family yet, it is the treasure to watch and observe only the family. But they do not stop there. They find humor and strengthen family values ​​and morals. Despite this story behind the scenes, this show was worth it to keep at home, and I would agree with Ester Rolle, who fought my father's father and fought many to keep my family together. But despite all the battles behind the scenes, Good Times was a show about a family. We all loved JJ's dynamite and antique. We watched Janet Jackson's Penny grow a bit. This show was groundbreaking for drug, gangs and alcoholism. Regardless of his escape, Evans has always tried to do the right thing not to go wrong with the ghetto.
