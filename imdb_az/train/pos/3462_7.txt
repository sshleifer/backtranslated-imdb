<br /> <br /> This is the first television episode of the Columbo series (though after the film Death Lift A Hand) and told one of the most successful TV series in history. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy's three-time assassination of murder killer, such as Ken Franklin, his partner Jim Ferris (who played Martin Milner), proudly and self-confidence, br> <br /> <br /> Head of the Caucasian Muslims Office, Columbo killer of the series. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk, Columbo, is characterized in a beautiful way, characterized by the peculiarities and strangers of his character, with an apparent speed and inadequate thinking, in particular the excessive confusion of Cassidy's character: Ken Ferdinand's non-existence of Jim Ferris one of the earliest scenes in the world, which has led to the killing of an expedition, is a good example to recognize the cunning world-wide. Franklin has shown this potential motive to Columbo and has been defeated by Columbo (deliberately or ignorantly), exposing Franklin's treacherous sensitivity, and comparing the books with the detective in an unpleasant way, Mrs. Melville <br /> <24 year old Steven Spilbergin's direct director is also remarkable. Nevertheless, some elemental art of cameras shadow the actors and actresses, touching on a range of stylish and detailed details to support the overall professionalism of the episode. After answering Ferdinand's betrayed wife, Ken Farlinz says that Jim Ferisser's body was in the forefront as he had a bottle in his back. I do not doubt that Spiebergin's efforts for a limited 10-14 day schedule should not be defective. Unfortunately, the second murder case is demanded by a blackmail scheme drawn by a woman Franklin's friend (and dubbed Columbo "Climax" in the form of "cautious") brings the steam out of all. The field's pioneering is endangered and the screenshot between Falk and Cassidy is definitely reduced to help the writer (Stephen Bocho) at this point because he can not develop the story without any further crime. <br /> <br /> The crowd is the most frustrating part of this episode. Falk and Cassidy's initial verbal and verbal exchange are resolutely and effectively carried out, but this simply means that the episode happens more often. The main complications are related to the sealing strip (if this can be a hint): Cassidy's character is so far flawless and arrogantly expelled by a hint that is too little to envisage his guilt; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong, such inventive problems, namely, the protection of high standards and, in particular, a reasonable and reasonable ending.
