ANCHORS AWEIGH sees two talented young sailors, Joe Brady (Gene Kelly) and Clarence Doolittle / Brooklyn (Frank Sinatra), with a special four-day coastal permit. Neither Joe nor Joe who want to go to Lola, especially Brooklyn, Little Navy-Mad Donald (Dean Stockwell) and Aunt Susie (Kathryn Grayson), help novice Brooklyn, Joe'a lady Susie for women and entertainments He made a grace soon to do so. At the same time, Joe falls because he thinks he is the best friend. How will Brooklyn go to this treachery? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < / STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> Since 1949, it has been cooperating. Both times I felt I was a better film than ANCHORS AWEIGH's plot and structure - all dances and songs fit the memories of the field and instead of developing characters and stories. However, I've been coming back twice a week for a better movie at TOWN. Now I've seen both films for the third time, and I'm still taking that decision. In a movie, like a movie and an entertaining game, it is simply light, weird, simply and simply * happy. The numbers are even ugly and less inte- grated and still work better than all dances and read at ANCHORS AWEIGH. I'm not sure why this is happening. The last film of a typical debate is for a long time: about two and a half hours later this is, of course, a valid criticism. Of course, I felt the first two times I saw! In addition, this is a growing movie on you - you see more, feel less and develop more craftsmanship. And yet nothing is just hanging in one place. The scenario was almost as if it had been felt and every single moment that Kelly could dance or convert Sinatra into a song was exactly the same. There was no opportunity to cancel the music number ... and the biggest weakness of this film. Give these 16 pieces (or give a few), and no matter how big your fan you are in Kelly or Sinatra, it really begins to turn into a numb after some time. (For example, contrast with the Ten Points in TOWN.) Each song can not feel full of dance and movie ... and that's right. <strong> </ strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <STRONG> Music, Kelly and Sinatra ("We Hate to Leave" Like the duo "I invited" and "If you know Suzie"), you will be woken up with all the nervous songs, Sinatra ("The Sunset", "The Charm Of You" and Best, 'I Do not Lost Easily') and it's always an invention that always makes Kelly's dance, and it's hard to run away with a caliber cast, Grayson is sweet and looks at every point (his voice is not scary but stunning); Jose Iturbi's role is sincerely written and she does a great job with her, even as Clarence's own Brooklyn, Pamela Britton, is lovely and attractive ... like Garrett himself can get Betty Garrett! Sinatra plays an astonishing and innocent boy with his blue eyes and curls (O , A reprises role in TOWN.) She read it as always, is casual in terms of time and promise, and its solo numbers may seem a little drag, but it's a good reason to slow down the rest of the movie when you hear the sound of a century! Gene In this film, Kelly's sheer genius deserves the title. Billing behind the Third Sinatra and Grayson, ANCHORS AWEIGH is actually Kelly's film. Her Joe Brady is a convincing, realistic character - she is tough, glib, and ready to sleep when she needs to win, but in fact she is the greatest soft inside. Kelly is not a charming, but confused, Joe gives you a true edge on the stage when you look at Brooklyn's face and his breakfast tray with a really boring look. And * dance * - Again, as Sinatra reads, the film breaks the "very good one is affected" syndrome. But once again, if Gene Kelly is suftshoe or a sailor outfit knocked on the screen or dressed as a bandit ... may also make a mistake on the overdoing side! All Kelly's dances are breathtaking, his tap number with Sinatra is pared-down simplicity 'I'm his tongue', his 'Mexican Hat Dance' sweet wide-eyed little girl or his Spanish impressive dance 'La Cumparsita'. Of course, the classic imagery of the spectators' minds for all time will be Kelly in a red, white and blue sailor suit dancing with Jerry Mouse from the "Tom & Jerry" fame. Be sure that in a 1945 film, you can often say that you are influenced by a special effect, given that CGI is saturated in the modern movie market. But Gene and Jerry still look great, Kelly is always looking exactly at his spots and should look. * Gene Kelly said that only the people who could continue with Kelly's (COVER GIRL) and would be a cartoon animation. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, this first bold, inventor Kelly, with Jerry, has devoted a place for ANCHORS AWEIGH and the hearts of classic film enthusiasts in the history of dance. However, the three Kelly / Sinatra films focus on their first collaboration, and although it's a lot of fun, it's still a couple of hours of entertainment. Before you watch, then again and perhaps - grow up before you understand it! 7.5 / 10
