Another reason to watch this beautiful movie is Florence Rice. Who is Florence? My first reaction was to run off the openings on the screen. Soon I saw who Florence Rice was, a real beauty that just returned to a great performance. All of this is just like the spark part of the ensemble. It's a different time since 1939, but there's a lot of charm. He leads you to another world. It starts as a light comedy, but then turns very serious. Florence takes the Rice gamut from the comedian to the hero. She is a strong, weakly developing film at the same time with a girl from a girl. Follow his face phrases at the end. She has filmed more than forty films and I'm going to look for another thirty-nine. Alan Marshall proved to be a perfect match for Flynn / Gable mode and Florence. Buddy Ebsen and Una Merkel give some excellent comic moments, but the real star is Florence Rice. Fans of the film from 30 to 40, do not miss it!
