If John Thaw plays "Morse", "Kavanagh" or "The Sweeney" and other production, "Goodnight Mr. Tom" would be remembered for this amazing unforgettable performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This adaptation of Michelle Magorian's attractive novel is a memorial to her art. <br /> <br /> Famous star (Nick Robinson of the first role) is supported by a great performance and a surprising cast. When I read this story of an elderly grandson of Norfolk, who previously lived in London for a young boy, I found a very precise timeline and the credit should go to the creators of this movie to correct it. <br /> <br /> If you store a CD or a video library, they should be encouraged to improve these perceptions, even to avoid the scenario of the story and to avoid being able to return easily. An absolute must be included for a TV movie.
