First and foremost, there was not a three-hour movie - two hours, ten minutes ... Last time I did not have ads, it's not actually part of a movie! Maybe two parter should be about 3 hours? Yes, he would have gained more, he could explore a little more emotion. In general, it was an interesting view of Lucy and Desi's life. From time to time, I love Lucy and love him, but never read or studied biography, he never knew anything about his life. Because of this movie I am now, but I'm not sure it's a good thing. No one here really needs to know. It should have been a movie. But the reason for this is that Lucy & Desi still have such great stars, and some people in the American society need to associate the rest of society with television and movie stars. <br /> <br /> Anyway, here's what Lucy was doing was pretty good. The two complaints - the actress who performed Viv Vance - is not a big cast. And transition from Madeline Zima to Rachel York .... uhhh, was a plastic surgery like Lucy and suddenly she was a new man! It was not very good. But the story continued and turned to a rocky relationship between Lucy & Desi. No, most of the children were not shown and did not have a negative impact on the film because I said it was mostly just about Lucy & Desi. If it were more time, the story would give more information about Lucy's entire life, but the children were able to be there more. But they did not fulfill the acclaims of Gable & Lombard, Red Skelton and Buster Keaton. Wow, I was amazed at this life: its presence and the effect of Lucy's life. Indeed, it is very bad and it is not too much investigated. He is excellent. The discovered things were done in a good way for most of them. I'm honest, I'm going to watch it again, and I do not think this movie is memorable. I love Lucy for someone who has won but is a great Lucille Ball fan, it should be an interesting hour. For that I value: B
