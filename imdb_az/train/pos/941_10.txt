For the first time I saw this version of A Christmas Carol when it first appeared on television. When I advertise the advert, I'll see the movie and live longer than expectations. Now I bought a DVD and it is planned to watch it every year. Except for "A Wonderful Life", I think it's one of the best Christmas movies produced by A Christmas Carol. George C. Scott is excellent and covers it with a superior cast headed by Roger Rees! Scott once again proves that he is one of the best actors in our time. Scott has the artistic talent and ability to play any role and keep his character alike. How can someone remember how Patton and Scrooge are? Scott corrects. The film is beautiful with beautiful sets, costumes and music that give a special feeling of space and time when it's described. You just love this movie and place it among favorites to watch during the holiday season.
