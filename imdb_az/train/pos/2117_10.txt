Every time I'm watching this movie, I'm worried about all the production. I thought it was the best romantic comedy ever. Anyone connected is perfect; script, operating, orientation, kits and editor. Although James Stewart is always trusted for a good performance, the supporting player is also spectacular. Margaret Sullavan, in fact, is an actress. His tragic personal life gives preference to qualities such as an artist who is not easy to get the skills of comedian players. Lubitsch could get the best and obviously did his best. See the number of breathtaking scenes in one shot.
