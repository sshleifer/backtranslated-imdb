Almost 30 years later, I remember this original PBS movie as an almost unbearable tender. As for the content, I think it's a good idea to get IMDb rights and DVD right away. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Frances Lee McCain, has been here and there in small roles for several years. <br /> <br /> As I remembered, this little movie had never heard before or after that a short PBS series of original scenarios by new and coming and future playwrights. <br /> <br /> I watched 2 or 3 times every time I was shown on PBS. <br /> <br /> Above mentioned: Happy New Year! Women! This beautiful movie is finally available on DVD ladyslipper.org. My idea is that DVDs are burned out of the author's personal copy.
