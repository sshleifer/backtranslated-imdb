This is a strange confusion and quite convincing. Corbin Bernson, under the command of this film, is portrayed by the sting of a strange epiconist practitioner. Linda Hoffman plays his betrayer and is very easy in his eyes - unfortunately for her, a good "good" doctor with a little pool in the pool brings good punishment - it's ashamed of a good laugh! The last half-hour of the film is dedicated to the character lost by Bernson, and is drawn to a young player named Virginya Keehne. A very talented performer, he draws attention from the day the extras were abolished. Beautiful feet!
