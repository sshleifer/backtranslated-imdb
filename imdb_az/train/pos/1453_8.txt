Well, there are many ways of breaking down a political tension. Usually they are derivatives or very ambitious, often they are completely paranoic and incredible assassination.

No character is visible from the ground and Al Pacino is always as bright. His charismatic NYC mayor is superior to his description, and Al Pacino once again reaffirms that American actors are definitely at the top.
