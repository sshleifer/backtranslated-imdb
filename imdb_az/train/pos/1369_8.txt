I liked this movie very much and I am one of the oldest people I do not need to enjoy. No, this movie is not deep - who cares? Such films are never. But there is a strange message. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is very good in this movie. I always had a direct resemblance to Katharine Hepburn. So it's great to see Hepburn and Posey film about mass libraries (Hepburn's The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see the Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie at the age of 8. Cinematic standards are not a great movie, although there are beautiful pictures in it. But it's incredibly attractive and fun.
