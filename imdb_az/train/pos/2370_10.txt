This is a great American martial arts film. Fighting scenes were particularly impressive for the American film in the 90s. Certainly, battlefields are not as good as in Honk Kong movies; in fact, just a few American films are fighting against scenes like in Hong Kong, and even now. When watching American martial arts, you are expecting to see less impressive battle scenes, but sometimes you have a good action that can be surprisingly good or at least I'll talk about these films. I was amazed at this movie. Some battle scenes were really impressive, and the player, direction, and plot were good enough, so if you love American martial arts of the 90s, it really is worth watching.
