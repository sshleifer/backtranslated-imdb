Richard Chamberlain, David Burton, a tax lawyer living in Australia, is a Sydney-based murderer who has been accused of defending five Aboriginal men accused by Peter Weir of plotting to kill a rebel called "The Last Wave" in 1977. When the picnic hangs out of the rock, it deepens to explore the uncertainty of the film and shows the Gulf between the two cultures that live side by side and do not understand each other's culture and traditions. Networks believe that the white community considers the native beliefs as a primitive pretext, and that after living in cities and "marrying," their tribal laws and culture will no longer be applied. <br /> <br /> From the outset, Burton is deeply and deeply drawn to a strange web of visual and symbolic lines where the line between the real time and the "sleep time" is evaporated. The water plays an important symbolic role in the film from the opening sequence, which violates the opening of a peaceful school by discovering that a sudden thunderstorm and a full storm have bursts in Burton's wind and that it takes the steps it has taken. While the fierce and unusual weather continues with black rain and sludge episodes from the sky, the distinction between the easy scientific explanation of the phenomenon and the intuitive understanding of the local population is clear. Burton and his wife, Annie (Olivia Hamnet), learn about books about Aborigines and learn about the role of dreams in tribal traditions. One of the clients is anxious to learn that Chris and his fellow Charlie (Nadjiwarra Amagula) are the subject of research, while secretly invited Aborigine magician suspects while inviting her to dinner at Chris Lee (David Gulpilil). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While Burton's investigation is in progress, clients make it difficult for them to refute the real facts about the killings. <br /> <br /> Chris was sure that Rutuel was killed in the tribe of Burton Aborig after he started drifting, because "I've seen so much", though Chris does not admit it in court. Burton, with a mystery that could not open himself, said to his father's prophet, "Why did not you tell me mysteries?" He says. This is a legitimate question, but, admirably, the Church answers all secrets. Burton knows that he must find the truth for himself and the tribe should enter the underground caves. Although we do not know what the true and the dream is, he faces terrifying fear that it takes into account its meaning in the morning. <br /> XIII Hopi and Mayan prophecies, the "end of history" and the cleansing of the man who brought the fifth world, are still 25 years old, although the last Dalga is still in its estimated time. Aborigines are described as a living culture, they have not been punished entirely by the white man, but I am concerned about what we look but with a charming feeling. Difficulty opens our eyes to the reality beyond what is far-sighted, but it is likely to make life seem frightening as a dark and undefeated force without a mark of spiritual beauty. on both sides of time.
