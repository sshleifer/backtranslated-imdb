Although this is a fantasy movie for kids based on the Boggy Creek Legend, I did not know why they called it. Return to Boggy Creek as a continuation of a movie. This movie has nothing to do with documentary and fantastic kiddie payment. Dawn Wells is the mother of three children who wandered along Boggy Creek along with 2 people and the wolf came to the assistant. Yes, it's a lot of foolishness and darkness, but this kind of movie is ideal for the 8-12 age group. This is a safe G-rated kiddie mouse and at least they do not have to worry about leaving kids alone while they watch. Certainly adults are aged and elderly for children aged 8-12.
