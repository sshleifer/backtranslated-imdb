LOVE this movie! Beautiful comic and absolutely convincing characters. Each scene is richer and more beautiful than the last. Every aspect of this film is filled with wisdom and humor, love and depth. There is also a complicated and angry story. This movie is full of love, humor and intelligence. Totally great!
