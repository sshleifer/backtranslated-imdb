I feel confused in the reactions of this film and a mixture of different tastes. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes here. Even martial arts stereotypes. All good and good, and I'm sure he does not do anything good. However, I feel an important point about this movie ... the cultural significance of the place is ignored. The film is placed in Pensacola, Florida, and does not try to avoid it. Today's bold action in the film world and a rare treat for fans of indy movies. And, really, can not be last. Pensacola, the city of the sea, the aviation city, the city of ceramics, and sometimes even as a source of political controversy. It is rarely seen as a growing movie city. But now everything is changing. More movie companies are coming to shoot. And more and more local Pensacoles discover the power of film for themselves. This film is part of a growing trend in Pensacola-based indy films and is on the way. Pensacola has a great deal of publicity in the global movie community and warns the world more. Watch and listen, the world. Pensacolians are coming. It's like a virus.
