During a vacation with a part of his family, another guy is his first gay experience of specialy, a very close and sharp discription of a 18year-old boy bubbling and dynamic emotional world. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie in its quite clear and surrogated storytelling with all those "snap-" - and wich with quiet moments full of intense mood. <br /> <br />
