I liked this movie. It is rare to get a post-partum view from Vietnam, and this film made it a battlefield of warfare and an exciting bomb and fired. I did not know how much it would affect. An incredible look at how Vetsin feels. It was difficult to watch, it was pretty sincere. We all understand the struggle and the type of Apocalypse Now drama, but it's so different. What happens when they come back and try to live? They can not. This has warned most of America's many men missing. It can not be remembered, can not sleep, can not stay in love, can not deal with "normal society". They feel totally separate. This is a great tragedy and is not a sufficient solution. Yes, we have changed our position on Vietnam Vets, but now we love them, but what? They do not seem to notice any of them. Too late? That was a great movie, but I was very cried. I have no other criticisms.
