On this site I read many comments that Blob criticized for loved ones or campus. The movie has been mistaken for amateur play and weak special effects. Only the experience would be what to expect from a group of people who are Christian Shorts in the local budget building (Valley Forge PA). I'm very critical of the fact that this film is not such a serious thing. This fact should be completed with terrible words played on unfinished thematic music from opening credits. This film is very good because it's meant to be. I've seen some of Blair Witch's recent budgetary initiatives that have no entertainment value or intelligent thinking behind them. BWP was pure purification. On the other hand, Blob was well scripted and well-entertained. The event that met the meteorite of the old man and cleans the masses inside a stick was perfectly executed and a real creepy one. While consuming the old man, Blav and his doctor's office were slowly moving to the bottom of the gurney with a cinematic scary masterpiece. Bottom line, I love this movie. I challenge everybody to earn $ 120,000.00 and shoot a movie in an entertaining or successful place like Blob, inflated to the current dollar value. This is not possible. PERIOD! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
