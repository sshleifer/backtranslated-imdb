I personally liked this movie and some people were excited about the rating. A movie and animation based on a comic book, and if you do not like comic books or animations, you certainly will not love this movie. If you are an admirer of an intriguing, solid heroes and heroic (sexually explicit) women, and an admirer of the world (hell), you will love this movie. I thought the story really hit me and it was a very nice movie. After this new trend in mature animation, many American movies are much more anime-esque or more. Titan is a live action version of Meet Meet Punisher as AE. In the end, this movie comes with a funny buff and super-hero or someone with a smart mind looking for a fun movie.
