Wow, I liked this movie! It is a normal life in a small village. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Adults! Everything about everyone's life. We must make the city passionately. But some people will not appreciate your passion and try to stop you. Those who find out what others think and what their neighbors think are more important than obeying their heart. No one's ideas distract you from fulfilling your desires and desires. I really liked that actors are really normal people, that could be my family. It is not a great beauty, but all the people who fall in love with the movie.
