He understands the Czech Republic and can see it in its original language and understands the Czechs' 'The Professionals', but if not,' Jedna ruka netlaska 'is still a great Czech film. It's funny, dark and very nice. It's the highest compliment I can afford, so you know exactly what will happen next and even feel good about second and third views. <br /> <br /> A magnificent amount of world-class film and literature dedicated to the films of Czech Hrabal, Hasek and Kunderan's Menzel, Sverak and others for a small country. The Czech humor is dark and often unhappy due to nature, but often with a loyal and warm feeling behind it. This film is simply frustrating and dealing with less-loved ones, but all of them have a beautiful story full of good word, good intentions, and optimism. <br /> <br /> Many other projects are involved in Trojan and Machacek. Enjoy, this is why a movie - in any case, as the Czechs have come to write a really happy ending ...
