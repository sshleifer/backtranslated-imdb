Extase, symbolized by dazzling and beautiful cinematography, is much more than the erotic drama we are expecting. This is almost a silent film, what kind of dialogue is in Germany, which is very simplified to Germany. Perhaps the filmmakers intended to bring the film to the highest level of European audiences because everyone with a bit of high school level can easily share German with subtitles. The story is not important, it is not a narrative, reaching cinematic level. The symbols of Fecundity and the power of nature are covered with human heroes - there are scenes covering the face of the possible star Hedy Lamarr - where the spectators of Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl can be recalled. If there is any message about the delivery of the film, I think this is a political issue: the bourgeoisie is not frightening and powerful; the working class is a happy, productive creature; and the woman was created to prevent the child from being born. This mixture of Soviet socialist realism and the National Socialist dogma is a kind of beauty to watch the film in any way - but this is a very different period of art. And oh yes, Hedy brings her set.
