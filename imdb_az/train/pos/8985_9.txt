Even though DiG! respect for how close the music industry was. The director deceived the audience, believing that Brian Jonestown Massacre '98 would be erased from the ground. The competition between Dandy Warhol and Jonestown was healed. <br /> <br /> It is said that this film is actually not exposed to reality. <br /> <br /> Because of the fact that this film has been divided into two groups of talented musicians, he said that this movie is infinitely fascinating and an interesting hour. <br /> <br /> One of the best things to come up with is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Recommended mainly for music and two fantastic composers.
