There is no connection between Fortier and Profiler, but both are a series of police officers on violent crimes. Profiler is crisp, Fortier looks classic. Profiler fields are quite simple. Fortier's plan is more complicated ... If we need to find similarities, Fortier looks at the Chief Suspect more ... The main character is weak and strange, but there is "clairvoyance." People compare, judge and evaluate. How do you enjoy it? Strangely enough, Fortier's people look at America, but on the other hand, they argue with the American series (!!!). Maybe it is a language or spirit, but this series is more English than America. By the way, actors are really good and funny. Management is not the surface ...
