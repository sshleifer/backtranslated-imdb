Xizao is a rare movie. It is simple and unusual, but also rewarded with emotion and joy. The story is simple and the old and new clashing theme is presented in the first scenes beautifully. This theme is a movie, but if it were not for the magnificent characters and the actors who played them, it had been flattened <br /> <br /> The remains of the old patriarch of Usti Liu are the days of pre-expansion. Bathroom works in the old neighborhood. Each stage in the bathhouse stressed that we were unhappy people. <br /> <br /> Master Liu's mentally retarded son, Er Ming, is the second truly strong character in the film and is associated with his modern-day brother. <br /> <br /> The relationship between these three people and the different guests who come to the bathroom are strange and detailed in their hearts. Some scenes take up much of what is happening in this movie. <br /> <br /> A critical message, this film was not just censorship, but also groundlessly small. <br /> <br /> Thus, if you are not able to find such a calibrated film on the Internet (!), you will not doubt it. <br /> <br /> So, the world, buy, rent, copy this beautiful movie and even share it if you have a DVD!
