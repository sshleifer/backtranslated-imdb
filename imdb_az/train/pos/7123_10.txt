Sometimes I'm watching a movie, and am really surprised? and it's not so easy to explain that I still love it. Is it true for mostly unusual films? it is difficult to compare the rest. Goodnight Mister Tom is one of these special films. Is there a lot of emotion in the movie? The actor was very nice when watching the movie, crying and laughing on the story. Young Nick Robinson? A young boy (William) who was evacuated from London due to air raids during World War II. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Since he has stayed. During the rest of his life, Tom discovered that life was terrible for William? his mother-in-law sent a strap and written instructions to his son's luggage. Do not hesitate to use it. Does this belt move from the field? Such a cruel way should not be used. Mr. Tom provides a real home for William and the boy is happy with his new life, goes to school, creates new friends and finds hidden skills. Recalling William's name in London with a letter suddenly, does not it be said good and starts again? only this time gets worse? Do you have many feelings in this movie? love, fear, sorrow, happiness, pain, hope? and more. Goodnight is another piece of English cinema that can be compared with Mr. Tom, Mr. Frankie and Billy Elliot. if comparable. I'm really glad to do it and I highly recommend it. Prior to reviewing this, I would like to mention Thomas Paraac's role as Zac. reminiscent of a friend of my childhood (:
