I remembered it as one of my favorite books, and I wanted to read my 5 year old daughter for some time. We knew that the movie was being implemented very quickly, so we went to the library to get the book and gave us preview for the next day! We ran home and read the book in the afternoon, and we can compare it. No need. The common thing between a book and a movie is the name of the main characters, a bet, and many worms. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, the worm loves many chefs to present masterpieces with French accents. Children know each other, the number of children, how the bet is started, the number of worms that need to be eaten, the worms they need to eat, how they are cooked, friendships, peaks, scenes and so on, nothing is the same. But in a way, he did not destroy the movie for me. All of the characters are pleasant and the movie frustrated me. The word of caution to parents was that she could breathe at an instant when the adults heard them, and when Billy's younger brother looked at her "a dingy dick." This embarrassing part came when my daughter asked us to sit around: "Who knows what the madman knows?" lol This and accidentally "silence" is a mistake as this movie is taken. My daughter worm could have been around 3 and 4 (and nacho container in the empty case), but it was nice by the worm 6. He and I both really enjoyed the movie and had a wonderful time sharing experience.
