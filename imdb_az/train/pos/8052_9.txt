This movie is not a kung fu movie. It's a comedy about kung fu. Sammo Hung is, of course, the same wavelength, even though the great French comedian director Jaques Tati (ie, Jour de fÃªte) did not watch the movies before filming it. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think Tati's films are funny; but they are not all tastes. Someone told me that he was laughing. Why I did not understand, but I think that Tati is usually a character that is not affected by the surrounding events (usually caused), because very subtle comic tricks <br /> <br /> In any case, Tati's basic physician - or at least the best known - to take the pretentious dictatorial bourgeoisie with the sensitivity of the 19th century and to let it to France in the twentieth century is determined by gradual elimination of these sensitivities. He is experiencing serious difficulties with small things, usually with a record player or radio. It is dangerous in a car, but there is no safety in the world when biking. <br /> <br /> It's something more intriguing than the 20th of the 19th century, something that he's gotten from his acquaintance. <br /> <br /> In a similar way, Sammo Hung is also playing. When the son of a country came to the big city of Hong Kong, Bruce Lee, who declared the city interesting, was absolutely convinced that kung fu films were doing. In a small city it can never be seen, but it is unusual in a big city, for example, it looks like urine in the street, because it is a little discomfort. it stands alone, because Hung squeezed the waters of his shirt and was immersed in a dip in the bay by chance. What is interesting about this confusion, because Hung does not understand what the police are astonishing - in the city of a country, as long as no one else is expected, go and go. In other words, Hung is not really in the street - but of course, what is the officer of the problem? Of course, Hung's relationship with Bruce Lee makes him even bigger. The restaurant owner eats a thief who refuses to pay his uncle. Of course, in a Bruce Lee movie, thugs would have been cut and would have learned their lesson. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ p> <p> Such characters must always win (at least comedy) because they are completely innocent and therefore, despite their comic misconceptions and misunderstandings, we really are amazed and They represent the best in humans. We really do not want to be Bruce Lee (who must be exposed to loss of friends before we get the chance to beat the bad guy), and we're really a world where Lee's heroes are really guilty. <br /> <br /> Of course, there's only one movie. <br /> <br /> "Oh, but what happens?" - and Sammo Hung's comic is the best way to find out.
