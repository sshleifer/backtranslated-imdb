People call this comedy, but only when I was watching, I once again laughed. I've seen the problem for the first time when I was 14 years old. <br /> <br /> I was not old enough to understand that I was not serious. . <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> I I suggest you wait for this movie next time you're in love <br /> <br /> Try to take it seriously. I think that despite some foolish flaws, this is one of the coolest love stories you see.
