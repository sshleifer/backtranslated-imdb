I have seen this movie long ago in Sky Cinema. I must admit that this was a really good West with two of the big names ... On the one hand, there is Charlton Heston, a modest and retired lawyer Samuel Bourade. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < But James Coburn, who thinks this movie is really significant ... <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum was seen everywhere in other films .. Hal Brickman played .. I felt his character remained cold, but he was Provode posse you can handle it to get back to the team with Burgade to bring down! <br /> <br /> In general, it was a great movie .. It's good to watch. Night is a big deal from Jerry Goldsmith .. <br /> <br /> A wonderful piece of western man ..! 10 to 8.
