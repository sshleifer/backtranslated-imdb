This film was not just a clear parody of the 1950s youth life, but the first British teen film to tackle the fierce rock and society's truth. To mark the work of the Fenerbah√ße Small Liaison Officer, 92% of the potential assassins under the scheme did not commit a second offense. <br /> <br /> Simply, this is an excuse for such a teenage drama until the epilogue of the film, but we have noticed that we should not be responsible for the solution of this issue or we should not apologize. <br /> <br /> Stanley Baker is a difficult detective who is reluctant to juvenile lieutenant. This hard-boiled character plays a typical role in Baker. At the moment in the footsteps of a famous arsonist known as firefighter and who does not like to go away from the transfer. <br /> <br /> Therefore, as with all the good police dramas, he returns to the full circle of turns in complete danger and returns to the original investigation. <br /> <br /> His first job was to run a small theft, with two small children Mary and Patriot Murphy (real-life brother and sister played double). Here, they get acquainted with Cathie, described by Annie Heywood. <br /> <br /> The curvature of such urban areas is a place where children can be trafficked. <br /> <br /> Murphy's older brother, Johnny, is the leader of the rock-and-rolling hoodlums. McCallum makes Marlon Brandon's lover more lenient, as an American mixed child. First, it reminded Brandon's character 'The Wild One', which controls the skin-clad bouquet of unique bikers, as it directed the 'Johnny' gang. <br /> <br /> It is gratifying that such terrible crime dramas like The Blue Lamp are not so clear. <br /> <br /> The romantic interest between Heywood and Baker is on the forefront. <br /> <br /> In some cases, predictable, gives some memorable scenes. The thoughtful effects of rock and roll music are played on a scene where Johnny's music is broadcast outside, and the police sergeant is a potent pill. The most memorable part of the film, however, is the climate class where Johnny and many terrified schoolchildren, including Mary and Patrick, are entering a hostage with a gun. Obviously, in the light of real life Dumblaine Massacre this scene looks terrible. Obviously, this film is rarely broadcast or presented to a modern audience.
