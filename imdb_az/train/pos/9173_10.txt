I think this is a great version, I've come here first, which I should help to use, and I went to Jane Eyre in 1983 and read a comment from the users and then helped to get this version. I'm not sorry to choose this version, and I will do it. I tried to watch all the other versions, and nobody wanted it. There is nothing like the book, and you want something to match with TRUST ME while reading your book. If you are looking for something real and moving after you read a book, it will be difficult because it wants something to suit. I would say that God brought me to this version. It shows true love for people. I can say that God's love is greater. There is a good thing I want to see. but so far there is nothing like it!
