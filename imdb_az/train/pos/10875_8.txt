Australia's first major slasher movie hit the screen with bang. And a stab. And a slice. And a scream or two. <br /> <br /> In fact, the first part of the environment is much - Dave Warner's first scenario is prepared, even though he has been selected by several others or in talks; director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall's first big movie; is the first film for producer Martin Fabiney. <br /> <br /> Last month, a group of children know their goods primarily to immerse their feet in this genre. Hilary (Kylie Minogue) was not killed due to the murder of an actress playing psychological killer in the film. <br /> <br /> If you are a Hilary's teacher assistant, you will be asked to continue the film if one of them has been put into use at any place, director Raffi (Jessica Napier) and producer Hester (Sarah Kants). By bringing together a group, can the original star Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald) manage to complete the Hot Blooded, really to the original place - to return to Australia? <br /> <br /> Of course, the shootings of this film, many bloodshed are happening? plenty of laughs, a few good fears and a swaying Aussie soundtrack. Cut shows Australia can make a good public market fright film next to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Welcome to the ranks of Michael, Jason and Freddi - Scarman - perfectly-featured perfectly-made effects, an accusation and a killer.
