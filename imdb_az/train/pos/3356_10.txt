Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian principals. Together with my parents we looked at the "C'aravamo tanto amati" summer night: we liked it, but did not like it as we love "Special Day". I believe that Ettore Scola is incredibly stubborn: we often do not remember her, perhaps her latest films were heartwarming. And last night, mom and I sat on the sofa to enjoy this masterpiece. The writing, direction, cinematography, design and production design were sober and accurate, but what I most enjoyed was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. They are also excellent players and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife, married to a fanatic fascist, has six children, but her husband wants another child to get an award for large families. Gabriele is simply an anti-fascist. The special day of 1938 came to Hitler Mussolini and spent a special day when it came to Rome. I do not want to spoil the plot anymore: look for this movie!
