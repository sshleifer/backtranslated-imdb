Another genius of Kurosawa, his first color film, is a dark look at the tragic life of Tokyo's residents. In fact, the vignettes involved in describing a number of groups are a tough and postwar post-war city. Comedies to trim and return to this movie show how people deal with their way of life with their worst forms of life, often returning to themselves and experiencing their own fantasy worlds, emotionally depressed or strangling alcohol. Combine the sink realizm in the kitchen with Kabuki-esque theatricals, Kurosawa toys are experienced with emotions, with an equal deftness of tears and laughter. Beautiful, draining experience.
