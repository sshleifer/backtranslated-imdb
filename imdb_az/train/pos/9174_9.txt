Jane Eyre has many movies and television production, but there are still ten years to suggest that these people will still be discovered and frustrated. It's just a classic (and offers more stories than others). Timothy Dalton is entirely an element like Rochester, rarely loses traces; it does not go far beyond the darkness of its character, in fact it is surprisingly agile and very colorful. Zelah Clarke's Jane is more cerebral compared to others, but makes a perfect foil for Dalton (to whom, accordingly, towers!) The nuances of her performance are better than a second sight (once the Dalton's shock). There are some technical malfunctions and a few moments in which the production value will be better; Nevertheless, this was largely due to the BBC's standards. However, it is the speeches of real pleasure. Do not miss this!
