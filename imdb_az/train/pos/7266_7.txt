When I was first released, I recall a very low attitude towards such a business. James is not "Jim" Belushi, a naked child actress and a forgotten address in the John Hughes formula. You did not see it 15 years ago. On Sunday afternoon, when I go to wasting, I watch him and hit him on several levels. Bright tales (Pretty Woman, partly opposite Pretty Woman), very elegant, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street-different performance Kelly Lynch, escapism. In general, it draws a little too good wires gently. Not to fall into the story, not to trouble Kelly Lynch, get acquainted with James Belshy, to love the harsh bad man, and laugh at the Curley Sue lines. There are all the ups and downs, the happy ending and the type of message you want to hear. Go on, spend time with this movie, it's worth it.
