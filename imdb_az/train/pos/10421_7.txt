This is the most beautiful film. Colorful photography is as beautiful as the Metropolitan Opera House shows in luxurious colors. Different scenes in different areas are equally brilliant. As for the music, Lanza's voice can be said to be something else at its peak, as it sang the most famous and beloved aryas in the world. Beautiful Dorothy Kirsten is a joy of blend of harmonious harmony with soprano voice Lanza. Of course, Hollywood made their freedoms with Caruso's life story. The stories related to real events are less valuable. For example, the facts about his death are completely fabricated and have nothing to do with reality. There are many good websites describing Caruso's true story and drawing several pictures. These websites can be placed on any good search engine. There are several books on life history. But heroic story is not something to shoot this beautiful movie. Lanza, Kirsten, and chorus members are the true stars of this film. Enjoy, sure, I'm sure.
