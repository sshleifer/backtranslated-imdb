I really love this movie, because in Australia, such movies are not shown in real time. It should be said that this is one of the best films reflecting differences between the Hong Kong people and the mainland Chinese. It really shows that there is anxiety among these two, but as HK Mandarin learning can only be better. It also shows how the mainland Chinese indie rock scene is and how the Chinese people know how to get the guitar strum and home funking! Who was not ready for Chinese rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely superb, with his clean and sincere voice, honest functioning and common chick magnets. I recommend this film to clean up the typical Western stereotypes of the Asian people and those who do not know much about people who love Chinese / Asian movies like myself. Check him out!
