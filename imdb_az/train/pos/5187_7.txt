This series looks like what you expect from Chikelberq. This is one of the frightening, funny, child shows you will not really forget. As a foreign limit (another great show), this little series could not do much. It was big and deserved to be longer. While some of them were a little scary when they wanted to, they were a great show, but at the end (like the Twilight Zone) was always morale, you did not want to end it or what you did. I've been watching some of Sci-fi since I was 10 and even now I see them. A really entertaining, creative show. I liked it and I still do.
