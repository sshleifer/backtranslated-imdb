I saw it at the Toronto Film Festival and I hope you want to see it again, because it will be broadcasted widely! It's a character-based movie, and Andrew and David are far behind. Any discussion of the site can be considered a spoiler, so I'll just say that this story is smart, the acting is perfect and the effect is beautiful. Very well drawn and very good pace. One of the best films I've ever seen in my life, and disappointing films this summer. The audience laughed all the time. You can do that. (I particularly liked the Candy Bar! Candy Bar!)
