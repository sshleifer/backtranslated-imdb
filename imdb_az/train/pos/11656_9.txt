I have seen a few films about eating disorders, but this was a man I loved. The problem with others should be that those who are right at the end of their eating disorder should only be able to automatically get better or help them. I thought this film became a more realistic cause, Lexi does not just automatically improve. He gets better and then has a disadvantage. I think that this movie shows more than just what it does not just happen - it's a chore and it takes time, it's a long way to recover. In my opinion, this film shows all this very well. Movies like this should be more.
