I did not know what this movie was like, but when I checked it out of the video store, I liked it. Author Bernard Rosedan (Candyman, Immortal Beloved) has seen very few films. Great story and characters. As an admirer of Glenne Healdy, I was struck by his English accent. The only exception for this movie has come to an end. However, rent is worth it.
