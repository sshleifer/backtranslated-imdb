<br /> <br /> I love this movie, and the trailers released a year ago, put on the internet, put my expectations at a slightly higher level. <br /> <br /> I have a DVD, so do not get me wrong, I tell you not to watch it or even get it! I think only the first scene is good and nothing over the whole movie.
