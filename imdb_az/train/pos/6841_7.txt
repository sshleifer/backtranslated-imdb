This can be one of Brian De Palma's most popular films, but it's not the best. Body Double, The Fury, and Carrie are better, but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is very much affected by Hitchcock and this film is shot at Psycho. After Angie Dikkinson, a psychiatrist who is thinking of having a relationship and playing Michael Caine, Dickinson gets acquainted with a man in an art gallery and is a married woman who is lying in bed with her. You do not know what happens after this point, but there is a crime, and Nancy Allen is a call girl who looks at the killer. Dennis Franz is the detective of Allen, who is not really trustworthy and needs to find his killer. This is a pretty good movie, but not the best of De Palma.
