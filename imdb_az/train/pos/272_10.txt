I liked but still has nightmares over the hotel manager.The film is presented with a selection of actors carrying realistic written reality roles, presenting the movie. Many scenes overflow their imagination by overcoming their imaginations. The development of the situation was cleverly written and I believe that the story was directed to a new constellation that I thought would be only obvious. We must be a very bad advertisement. I told many friends to watch more shows and, of course, I will look again. I love the scenes of the movie and felt that it was added to these areas and intrigue. Husband and wife were so realistic that heated discussions (or I say war?). The first case is not a story but a general one but a good presentation. Thank you for participating in this great fun movie. Thank you very much! Are you watching the next movies --- when? I dont know
