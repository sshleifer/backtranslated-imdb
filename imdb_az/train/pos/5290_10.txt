He went to something far away from the intentional things he usually adhered to, and made this parody of John Waters (happy birthday, John!) Celebrity / Art. Edward Furlong plays the title character in a working class in Baltimore. When a New York agent (Lili Taylor) finds his job, he offers a great break. <br /> <br /> "Pecker" looks after his friends and his normal life after becoming famous. It's something we expect, but there are always a few things to shock at Waters director (you'll recognize them when you see them). I, of course, recommend it. Also, Christina Ricci plays Mink Stole and Patty Hearst.
