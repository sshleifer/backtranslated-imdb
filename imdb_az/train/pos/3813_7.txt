In the beginning, there was something critical about the religion of the secret sun (and here Christianity) and I wondered if it could be anything against blind faith or could it be a manipulation force of a common person? More than you. It was surprising that such a thing did not happen and was largely non-condemned, putting events into reality, and allowing viewers to draw their own judgments and conclusions. <br /> <br /> helps, but she shouts in the role of Song Kang-ho, a man who likes Shin-ae (Jeong Do-yeon), and then begins to church. The reasons for leaving the church, finding inner peace, seeking help, fear of eternal damnation in Hellfire, reaffirm your faith, or chase the things you want to marry in a church (I do not love you). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> every reason for every Sunday to lock each church and join the humility groups is the fact that the main reason for the really dangerous is not satisfying heart motives and frustration or how it was discovered: Shin-ae and her son Jun, is moving to the city of Miryang where he was born. . Whoever wants to start a new life, opens a piano shop and teaches another tragedy to teach, even when it comes to discovering newly discovered freedom and not making a good decision. This is an hour long. The Hidden Sunshine really took the time to come to this point, where things later shouted to listen to religion with Shin-Ae and accept its current state, religious and other believers, to talk about their Lord, believes that he offers and trusts silver bullets to solve mankind's problems, and, at times, it surprises you to see your own myopic appearance. You will begin to think logically that whatever mighty things do for you, that everything is settled well, and that in the Shin-Ae work you forgive those who have committed it. <br /> <br /> The last actor, since most of us can say with most of us, the latter move is probably a very entertaining thing - why and why someone else, because we are angry at our faith, unfortunately, difficult and fast answers Start asking questions without At that time, we either get off the road or continue with rebellious acts. <br /> <br /> If on the one hand this is not to be insulted, it is carefully caught in the Secret Sunshine and what could be an ugly character mouth? <br /> <br /> It is important to remember that you only need to understand Yeong Doo's perfect image, because he has a complete role as a widow, Shin-ae, who is the most unlucky man in the world to deal with many tragedies in a short time and if you look closely , the majority of them do their job. Following his transformation, he deserves the ticket price and although it is Korean Song Song Kang-ho, my favorite personality in the movie, it's just breezed from the right.
