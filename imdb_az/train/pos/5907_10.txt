This is one of the best films I've ever seen. My parents came from the peasants and saw some villagers' lives. The peoples are really poor and have financial and social problems. <br /> <br /> The film is just the opposite. Full credit to the director and actor. They have done a great job. I'm only surprised how the films like Lagaan and Paheli can go for Oscar and Doghi. I do not understand the criteria to be selected for movies. <br /> <br /> Different or some great names in the film creates a monetary difference. <br /> <br /> I hope to see more films like this in the future.
