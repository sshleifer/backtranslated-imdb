Let me know that I'm Cerebral Palsy, and I went to this movie because I was expecting to help with the performance of the presidential performance. I left the experience, but even though I knew that this was not the case, I believed that they were throwing an actor with a Surgical Palsy role. Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Conner (whose name I believe) were generally good at performing with a special nod like young Christy Brown. Christy is talented, sad, arrogant, sometimes vulgar and petulant, namely human. This movie, along with Gaby: A True Story and documentary King Gimp, beautiful images of life with CP. There are no perfect portraits, but excellent examples of people with disabilities. Most Recommended.
