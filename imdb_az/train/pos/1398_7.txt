Another episode from childhood, with an adult different perspective. It was one of my favorite episodes of childhood, really this show is my favorite cement. However, after reviewing this episode after 20 years, this is not the dramatic and good story lines in the previous episode, but rather the first and best season, but it's definitely one of the slightest things to laugh and play. Perhaps this episode is written for very little R & R! As Mr. Spokes said, the story is just illogical, but of course, there are a few fun lines as Mr Spok is - When asked by Captain McCoy, R & R and they respond positively and encourage Mr. Spok to do so "Spectacular ..." he says. An interesting story line, of course, the idea of ​​a fun park is really fun (for example, instead of Disneyland's fraudulent and frequent annoying "amusement"). It's a good idea, but it's not done well. <br /> <br /> The story of the Sturgeon, which came from the Theodore Sturgeon, one of the short stories of the SF that we used in the first season, made the wonder how confusing the scrap was. <br /> <br /> Here's a Little Trivia Here I've learned on this site: In 1987, James Gunn founded Theodore Stairs for the shortest science fiction story. And I'll cite the rest of this site: In 1968, "The Joy Machine", written by Sturgeon, wrote a third scenario that has never been hit for the Star Trek TV series. The main reason for not being used in the series is the expensive special effect sequences that are very expensive for the budget. Sci-Fi writer James Gunn (Star Trek # 80, The Original Series) and a book of the book published in 1996 by Pocket Books. <br /> This episode is still very enjoyable, especially if you do not think much about it. Just laugh and enjoy and in the next episode we can get back to serious materials that protect the universe.
