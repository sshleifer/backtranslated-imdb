Danny Masterson was a very good actor in the film and was great to see him in something else since the 70's. Film is Not My Thoughts, I Think Nudity and Adolescence in My Thoughts Most of the contents. But all I love is that, I thought Dirt Wisecracks was pretty funny. In fact, he deals with a job, a girl who does not find a job, or a money-maker, and is actually a private researcher (more than a reporter). She is framed for the murder of a rock star, and rock stars are a girlfriend. People who need to help her. I give it .... *** 3 Stars.
