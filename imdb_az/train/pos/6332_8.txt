This movie is good for TV. I love it because I'm a family movie, but I'm a big fan of disaster films. Half of the film's half is half. Symbol names have been dropped, but the book does not have a car parked off the tornado unless it is a storm follower. The car is driving a police officer, Dan Leo and his wife, who go to the police station for safety. Dan and his friend are also 12 years old. I can think of all this. Generally this was a good movie, though it was a bit more accurate for this book. Did you know that the book was based on a true story of a number of tornadoes that destroyed a small Nebraska city in 1980?
