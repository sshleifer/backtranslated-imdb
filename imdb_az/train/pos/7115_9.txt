A beautiful and strange war film that focuses on the inner sorrow of the blind sea Al Shi'Ã®d. Although difficult and unpleasant, heroism ends - Schmid's victory over disability and depression. The battlefield was outstanding. But choose a bone. I have not seen at least 50 bullets thrown out of the fire by any of the water or dirt! It hurts the truth, but I live it. Better performance by Eleanor Parker, like a girlfriend again.
