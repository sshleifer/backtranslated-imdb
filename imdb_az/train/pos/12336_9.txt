When a beautiful era melodrama, Fontaine and Olivia DeHavilland play a role, they simply simply play against the type of wallpaper. Fine, because Fontaine is beautiful. Written for Hitchcock in the 30s by Charles Bennett, and then wrote a perfect script for Demon's classic British fright film. The opening scene of Ivy's unforgettable Una O'Connor (a screecher of James Whale glory) is a tour of power, and the film shows interest in many dangerous adventures. I hope to see this movie in a DVD on a single day, but I never give up the hopelessness of the incident. Because this film is an insufficiently dark film. Fortunately, I saw seven or eight years in AMC, but I have not seen them since. Keep it in perspective!
