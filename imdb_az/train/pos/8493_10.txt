<br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time. I recently saw this movie and it is still in line with this reminder. While we were younger, many of the films we were looking at did not stay alive in the future. The film is, in fact, a great example of the films that were made at that time. Keaton is the best, and all actors have done a really good job, and Ron Howard was good at stimulating the film to replace the story. The speed of the movie, with a few slow blots, is that the cars of the 80s are very funny. From the 80s I liked to see the ugly jacket again. The movie is a great movie for fans of any comedy and 80's.
