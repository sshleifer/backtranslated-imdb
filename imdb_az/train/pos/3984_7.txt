The release of Casino Royale was featured in the new Bond by Roger Michell (Notting Hill). Because I'm a bit boring, I'm going to reduce it, but I'm getting caught up in it. Basically, May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) and has never seen anyone and has never been a boyfriend. Her daughter may want to marry Darren (of course, Daniel Craig), the new lover. After only knowing each other for a few days, May and Darren have a secret relationship. And his age, 30-something and the new Bond? In any case, they want to keep a secret, but Helen is full of wonder and surprise. He suffers less than Darren. In fact, Helen asked for permission to shoot him. Peter Vaughan, Toots, Daniru Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harri, Rosie like Rosie Michelle, and Bruce like Johnny's English Oliver Ford Davies. Very Good!
