Will Eisner's image compliant with the OFFICIAL TV screen was followed by comic strip pages or many other suggestions made of comic books. (Remember, both are exactly the same tool). This is actually one of Eisner's smart alec, wise cracking, linguist-cheek super hero (in this article). <br /> <br /> The story was about discussions of copyright in the mid-40s, when it was interested in drawing a movie version of the Republic, but they could never close the contract. The Left Curtain game was The MASKED MARVEL series, one of the best in the Republic. <br /> <br /> Since 1987, this comedy, comedy strips, pulp mags, are quite obvious to be a failed pilot for a proposed television series.

Well, we see what we are talking about. Just hold your fingers! WILL BE CONTINUED .................. WORLD II: New film, Author-director Frank Miller's presentation of SPIRIT a few days ago.
