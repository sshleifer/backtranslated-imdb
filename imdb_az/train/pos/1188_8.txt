At first I doubted this subject (simply related to the topic) but richly drawn characters, spectacular scenes of buffalo hunt and dramatic results give him the opportunity to watch. At first, I had difficulty making a distinction between two buffalo hunters, but the film itself was increasingly different. I'm still on the stage with the final scene.
