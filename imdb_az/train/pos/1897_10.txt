Nevertheless, at least for me, it does not seem to be illogical for me, "Artur" deserves only 10 to 6.4 possible. Steve Gordon's one-time masterpiece is completely "impossible" if all the different elements are completely "impossible" to be combined. It's not a tragic thing, it's not a good thing to do, but it's a friendly friendship. Because Dudley gave her the best role for Moore, the optimistic effect, including any other movie item here, seems patented and illogical. I challenge everyone to sit in this movie and not laugh out loud. But it seems that about one-third of the audience was able to do so. Yes, according to one, Gordon's efforts were both funny and lovely and would be the source of the flaming symbols of Geraldine Fitzgerald's big boat and the boats he had killed by Steven Elliot. Even the black driver was able to escape patronization and the late sniffy Sir John Gielgood had the right to accept his right, but his role was wrong. "Already" is not more effective for "Altztand", it does not make any effort for the "alcoholism" crisis (iFit is not disobedient but other drugs, including meth, and addictions are not just symptoms, not target) simply waiting in their quitsical way.
