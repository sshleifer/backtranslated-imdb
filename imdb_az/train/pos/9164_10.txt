Recently, I've seen this product on the DVD. It was the first time I saw it since its first release in 1983 and it was as good as I remembered. First of all, it seems like an old fashioned, and perhaps I think that bbC series is a bit dated and very simple. (I've always missed these beautiful costumes that always seemed like Sunday afternoon). I'm a little "Jane Eyre" because this is my favorite book and I have never seen a loyal product like a book. I have recently read my book and some of the dialogues have just come together. When I read the scene answering Roche's questions about what was happening in Rochester, Rochester realized that Dalton and Clark were completely reflected in the screen and made their words perfect. <br /> <br /> In some cases, not all of the other production is done, and some leave the Rivers family and their relationship with Jane. I think it's the only production to do the "Gypsy" scene properly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Casting is perfectly described, Zelah Clarke Jane is described in the "small flat and dark" book, and I do not agree with it too old. Timothy Dalton may be a bit nicer, but just like Rochester, he describes every aspect of his character and closes his socks! I agree with other interpretations of night-time fear that, like in the wake, slowly turns around in the church, as if it were a fantastic fright. But then happiness on another loved scene Jane is glad to see that she has fallen in love with each other and fled in the morning to her jewelry and weapons. Lovely illustrated and absolutely beloved love. You need to be loved by such a person! There were a few strange missing scenes, but when Jane was sleeping with her immortal Helen, and when Rochester bought Jane for her wedding things (I thought it was inside someone, but playing tricks in my memory) <br /> Finally, if another If you do not see a Jane Eyre product, you just see many, it's just perfect!
