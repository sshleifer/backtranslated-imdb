The leading comments on this film are "Clueless and terrible ridiculous". I think it's a very funny movie and a great fun. One should refuse to believe that a homosexual person and a lesbian woman may fall in love, have a child and then live happily. But it's always nice to see someone playing in a movie and warming one's heart. It is impossible? There are more inconvenient events described in other films. Acting is fun, funny. The only negative comment is that the story may be a good end when the family leaves the original home instead of lying to explore whether any of the family's surviving homosexuality is maintained.
