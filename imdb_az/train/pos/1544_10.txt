It is a very good, but challenging task to unleash a charm in the Italian style of the 60s during the World War II. Promotional credits are psychedelic graphics and Ennio Morricone is a film that should not be missed by the German cavalry, with no human ground fighting scenes and full gas-proof 'storm trooper' gear with a lover's love area and greatly-prepared apocalyptic poison gas with Capucine. It is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the cruelty of players in and out of the battlefield. In addition to the scenes of war, some of the production and special effects are primitive, perhaps because most of the budget for this movie is fired for battle scenes, but not for nearly 60 movie lovers. I first saw this movie on TV on television and gave it to the VHS. I'm still a tape and I enjoy watching it from time to time.
