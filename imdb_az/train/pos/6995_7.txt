Bela Lugosi is a crazy scientist (yes, a helper as a Renfield and his mother, a dwarf and yes, a very bad piece of work that covers the scientist's wife (Greenaway's movie is really lol). The spouse may seem fine when the brides come up with a very clever trick in the future with a lot of orcs, and the bride breaks down on the altar, and HAPPENS decides to be around the lid and snoop on a story, taking all sorts of tips about Orchid and Lugosi. Hell knows where the police is, and soon goes to Bela's nest, it may be strange or unusual physician. All of this is combined in a totally outline to create a fake wedding to catch a scholar, but the scientist has the ability to see the dreams, what will it be? I really liked this fi Lugosi is great here, his hangers are already strange, the story is really bad, and some are the most beautiful. A fun little view.
