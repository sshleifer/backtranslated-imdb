No Rows Extra Features Carlos Mencia makes us a laugh and thoughtful companion. Not only is he engaged in racial issues (claiming many enemies), he also talked about the best way of getting immigrant immigrants from the country ... what does he mean when women say they want to treat the same ... why Americans are more horrible than Arab terrorists ... why why he does not need to pray for the Pope - and he hopes he does in heaven ... How the traditions of Easter (Jesus' Day) tradition began ... Christ's passion - watching the movie - and with a woman hanging from his influence on Jesus the consistent argument ... how society should be involved in physical disabilities ... and if there is a right to talk about jokes at the same time, it also reminds us that each of us is a voice. So, we must use the truth to talk, to express our thoughts, and not to be afraid of others. <br /> <br /> Carlos bomb.
