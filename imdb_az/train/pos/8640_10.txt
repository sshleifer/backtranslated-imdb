This movie is great! Brad Pitt will never be able to perform his performance in this movie. Duchovny was top notch like Forbes and Lewis. The four main characters began in the 1960s on a stage road trip to historic criminal sites, one of the most powerful cars developed by the Lincoln Continental model. Early Grace is a taste simpleton for dry toothbrush and slaughter. She loves to curse or smoke women and wear PWT dresses. Duchovny and Forbes, several artists of the city, Early and Lewis Trailer parkers on the edge of the village. Although most of the film is dark, there are many comic scenes. Writing, guidance and mobility are brilliant. If you like road movies, murder, humor and story, watch this movie. Everyone handles and loans may take more time. It's one of my all time. "Hey ... the dog teaches him to hunt!"
