Luchino Visconti's first film is a masterpiece of James Cain's "The Postman Always Rings Twice", shot by a captive warrior in Italy around Ferrara. The original was negatively thought, but Visconti kept a post and, fortunately, we can see early neo-realist work today. His wife, Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (recently discovered his chests at La Cena delle Beffe) (1941), was the star of true and guilty lovers who wanted to kill his wife. does not pay in an irrelevant offense, excellent direction, script, actor, and cinematography. The French is not as good as the "Le Dernier tournant" (1939), but rather the American version (1946) featuring Lana Turner and John Garfield. Highly recommended.
