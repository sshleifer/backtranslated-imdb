I'm not convinced that the author decided to draw a novel by Visconti director James Cae's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" ("Viscounti"), but ultimately the film is interesting. This is not the best version of Cain's story (I love the best version of 1981), but it's important for fans of Noir, thanks to the excellent direction of Visconti and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (very sensitive pair). Visconti mixes neorealism with confusion sensitivity. Film is not perfect though. My main complaint is that the film is too small for its good; The story is moving at a very slow pace (I do not think it's good to fix Visconti movies). I think the movie works in a short time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors interested in the audience. In any case, as I loved this movie and the rewards, nobody would have made a definitive version of Cain's highly respected book.
