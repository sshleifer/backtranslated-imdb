What is not clear? First, hate this movie. It can not be the biggest film of all time, but there are 11 ocars for one reason, for some reason it reached eight billion dollars. This is a damn good movie. It does not bring any further explanation. When I saw in cinemas, I had no idea of ​​this movie since I had such an impression. I took it back on television and video and it did not have any effect when I saw it on the big screen (twice, maybe three times). But that might be. It's a movie, yes, there's a boasting, an epic, a spectacle in the queue of the Wind or Ben Hur. Now I'm Gone with Ben Hur and Wind, looks kinda hockey for me, hammy action and extreme melodrama. The Titanic has nothing to do with it. Well, the player was really good. <br /> <br /> The work of the "Titanic" is such an emotional walk. I usually enjoy movies that inspire me, or give me an entertaining excitement. This movie is not a mute, but cerebral. The visual excitement is simply an end to the audience's emotions. When Bambi's mother died, I did not cry, I did not respond to the caller. However, if it had been a regular one, Buzz Aldrin was a tens of millions strong emotional rollercoaster that would cried like a little girl. And I'm sure if you see the video and you decide that you hate it and have cynicism ready, then you will not love this movie altogether. But let's stop this blasphemy, if you use this epic melodrama as a doubt, you will absolutely love it. And watch the top ten grossing movies of all time. Is one of them bad? One of them ranged from 10 to 1? No, even Phantom Menace. And this movie was $ 1.8 billion worldwide. This can not be bad. It is not possible. 10/10. <br /> <br /> How can we estimate it by comparing it with a spider? Spiderman was an entertaining movie, but overall it was 9/11 kneejerk, which was just as common as that. it was not all that special. Nobody will remember it in 50 years. but I am pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.
