If you love adult comedy cartoons such as South Park, this is about a similar format to the little adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina gave poppy sweeties and acted like bitches, and I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also little stories along with school teachers. Sexual Director, Mr. Bip, Nervous Madhim, and others. The cast is also fantastic, Lenny Henry's Gina Yashere, EastEnders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan, Dead Ringers' Mark Perry and Blunder's Nina Conti. I did not know it came from Canada, but it was very good. Very Good!
