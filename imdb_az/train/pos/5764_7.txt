I first looked at this movie in Amazon about 6 or 7 years ago and exploded it. I believe that I call it "unhappy" and "Turkish". Well, well, by many standards, is still a turkey. There is almost no production value, the smaller space is almost no sense, and the player is in the third level of play. Yes, it really grew like a camp class for me over the years. Actually, all films by Todd Sheets have shown this effect. They say it's Ed Wood: Review them again and choose the dragline lines, sustainability errors (same zombie, two different locations!) And other defects. <br /> <br /> I say: sheets are a very nice person, and one of the first production is not so great, it's better. And I have to add that only a really decent actor / actress, Casey Rousche, can be biased as I attended school with him.
