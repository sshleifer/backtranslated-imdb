The "dangerous criminal" is a story of an anti-social girl, and it's how it happened. Based on a true story, I have to admit that I am imitating the art of life, if I am annoyed with a single imagined image, with a characteristic character, a characteristic character and the sacrifice of his advocate. <br /> <br /> For me, the film succeeds because of the behavior of the hood character it's a little bit soft until it's almost done <br /> <br /> A real action movie will bring you once to your throat, from time to time, it's damaging <br /> <br /> In some cases, despite the fact that it is difficult to watch, sometimes due to body functions and suicide attempts, this is another product. We are proud of calling Canadians.
