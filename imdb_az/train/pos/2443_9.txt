This film will not leave the Catholic Church in the best light but tells a story based on real events. Unfortunately, everything in life in the religion is not welcome. Sometimes people and groups do things that seem to be the right things at the time, but do not look as great as they once did. Explains the story of a "divided split" family, yes, it covers the religion, but really is a story about a family and the ability to stay together regardless of what the family has thrown. This film is based on real events that do not want to be said to be scene scenes, but if you look at the information from this era, you will see what churches are dealing with. In both churches, for example, the Catholic Church must first force the family to make such an arrangement and to obey the violence and the Protestant Church only to her husband and her priest, and do not go to war. In this case, both of these families should be reduced. I believe that the film works well in both the church and the family to show this struggle. It does not leave the Catholic Church with any form and shape, but rather shows how an event can change the thoughts of this religion and how a person can have more influence on it.
