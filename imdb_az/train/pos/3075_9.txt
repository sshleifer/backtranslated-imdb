A brilliant movie about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is such a great player. Seeing part of a neurotic sexual object, but at the level of the script that worked with him, it was a noble sober on the same scene with Campbell, who did not have a shaver to work with him. But it's a good actor playing scenes. Tracey Ullman's writing as an indifferent wife is very high. Who knew? Sutherland is also very good. He ensures that his character looks long (even younger in some scenes). <br /> <br /> The only definition that Macy's character can not be careful is the complete craft.
