Above all, Riget is beautiful. At the same time good comedy and mystery thriller. A nice combination of strange 'dogma' style to describe the story along with good music and great actors. But, unfortunately, there is no "end". As for me, this is unacceptable. How would you continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have an idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a bit different. I'm sure, without Helmer, the third part would not be the same. That is, I have a suggestion. Maybe is a bit stupid, maybe not. I know that Lars loves the experience. Why not make a small experience with Riget3? The only solution here is to create a puppet-controlled animation (such as "Team America" ​​by Trey Parker) or even a 3d animation on your computer. I know that this is not the same as the real actors, but in principle, I believe it will work ... only in this way it is possible to resurrect the actors. For Riget fans it should not be a big deal - if the animation is done in a good way, the watcher will consider it normal after the first few shots of the film. The most important thing is now the story. Riget 3 can not be created with today's actors. Why not play with animation? And ... look for the opportunities that you have! Even a marketing! After 10 years, the great director ends his trilogy using a puppet animation. Just dreams? <br /> <br /> I hope to see Riqeti 3 one day ... just to see the script. <br /> <br /> <strong> Slide <br /> <br /> <strong> "I do not speak about Selcuk "By Stephen King ;-) hospital
