As one of the previous commentators put it, this laid the foundation for a great film, but something went wrong with the delivery. Such a waste, because Collette's performance was scary and Williams was convincing. I was expecting to be better. In my opinion, this was not a need for a bad edit or a filmmaker, but only a movie. The first few seasons of the X-Files came across as a Canadian movie. Not cheap, just hockey. In addition, a little more stress was needed. Something that leaps from your seat. The film reached the mother, then left on the left; it's like a wrong summit. I can see that the story is not dependent on the "reality", but when I was searching for a Jabriel boy, I thought I was in the hospital. This film requires a Director who is trying to solve these problems.
