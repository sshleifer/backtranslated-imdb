This show consists of three little girls. (D.J., Stefanie and Michelle) Their mother is killed by a drunken driver, when her father, Danny's brother (Jesse) and her ex-boyfriend (Joey) are invited. So the whole show is a lively life. Girls go through life's difficulties and get life lessons. They develop crumbs, boyfriends and more. The whole show will go mainly through the stream. You just do not have to retain the necessity of leaving it. I think this show is really good and fun. I watched this show and still look at it today. I love this show on television. I'm watching almost every day. I rate it at 10/10.
