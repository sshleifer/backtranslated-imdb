What can you say about this spectacular show? "Sopranos" has completely redefined the television as we know it. He violated all rules and set new standards for television supremacy. Everything is flawless, writing, guiding, and for me, most importantly, it moves. By following this show you will realize that these characters are not real. The true Tony Soprano or any character acting on the part of the parties. This show is versatile. Some people show that they are not violent, but very deeply involved in everything you see as a business, a family, and a fan. When people approach the show, I do not like it when explaining a show about the Mafia. A show about this family for me. Generations are different from each other. In general, this is a show work. Television should be this. Here. What can you do if you get complex characters that are strikingly striking, splendid story lines, and mix together with these ingredients? A show that sets the perfectness and dare to be different.
