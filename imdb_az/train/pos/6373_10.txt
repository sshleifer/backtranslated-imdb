Atlantis was better than expected. In some cases, there was a better event than any of the older films. Although this movie sometimes requires attention. It was a great movie for all ages. I saw some young audience waiting for comedy, but I got an adventure. I think everyone is tired of the endless parade of extreme parody. Many of these children have seen nothing but parody. Shortly afterwards, everyone looked at Atlantis very tightly.
