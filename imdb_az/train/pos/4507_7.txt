A movie that is more than 60 years really surprised me. It takes about two hours, there is no star, there are subtitles, but it's interesting and interesting to watch. It was the realism of the movie I was very impressed. You can feel the cold of ice, because you see that the storm is real. CGI-like relief in the world today. I was wondering how much Van Dyke was doing. I spent 17 months reading it in one place. Who wants to talk about "Titanic"? It's a great movie with a great message, and I recommend future directors to see just how real and realistic the films are, instead of visual effects.
