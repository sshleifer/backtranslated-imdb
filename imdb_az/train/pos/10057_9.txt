Last night I went to sleep with my gf and brushed her teeth, but I dropped the channels until I came across this Chinese movie called Masks King. From the very beginning I thought it would be a Kung Fu movie, I started to look at it, then I was captured immediately and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The little girl in the movie certainly adorble. It was such a great actor for you to be so little. Perhaps because of being in China, I was dubbed into English, it was hard to talk to me ... but it really looked great in character. She felt bad when I tried to ask her daughter "patron", but everything was just rotten. lol When he brings another granddaughter, he can even go to art ... the kid goes out of the way, so is arrested and lives for 5 days. <br /> <br /> Finally, she sees how much she loves and teaches her mask art ... <br /> <br /> Indeed, it's a stone and completely original. <br /> <br />
