this move was friggin hilarious! The funniest I've seen for a while, akshay and john kick ass are always as warm as their chicks. The story is awesome, great jokes are a lot of people who look after me before. because he was not on the Indian background, as he did not understand humorous moron. do not rate movies. what did you watch, the subtitle version of most of the jokes lost in translation? I think what a joke is. <br /> <br /> Akshay gamble is the best actor and once again proves that he can do not only action, but also comedy. John also proved himself to be his first comedy role and he was also good.
