The majority of people outside of Canada, Canada's only things, are snow, hilly and hockey players. This film is the second best Canadian movie I've ever seen in the past few weeks (the first "Red Violin"), which is better than the best Hollywood efforts. <br /> <br /> Gustad Noble is nothing else. this is; In the 1970s, Bombay's middle-aged Parsi bank worker. This film is sensitive to the various things that happen against family, friends, and work and its effects. At the same time, it is interesting and so far I will describe India's middle-aged, urban life accurately. <br /> <br /> But for some reason, I read a few years ago in Rohinton's Mistry book. As expected, it can not handle all the difficulties of the film, but if you really want to read a good book and see a really good movie, read it and see "Such a Long Way".
