<br /> <br /> As I said in my first part, these two films are better than most science fan fans. <br /> <br /> The scenario of the second film is that we do not need to see the movement's destruction. However, when Battlestar Pegasus appears, he is amazed, he returns to Cylon Planets, but then there are thousands of refugees fleeing in small space boxes, which are protected by only one powerful spaceship. . Okay, Mad Max has a bit of it because they are fueling for their spaceship to find a remote Earth to fight, but it works for me. <br /> <br /> I love continuation with Starbuck and Apollo. "Science fiction shows good actors and good effects" (although the board has a second result, with no namespace that proves that it has been used previously) <br /> <br /> So, , In the 1980s, has been preparing for two films since 1978.
