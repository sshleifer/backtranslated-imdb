Charles Boyer is planning to become a Spanish and comes to London to buy coal from Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix in the 1945 film "Hidden Agent." Boyer Luis Denard and everyone else is not to stop it from Bacall. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ font> It has high ratings for atmosphere and inactivity and very entertaining. <br /> <br /> The grocery is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou means, Lorre is ineffective, Hendrix is ​​desperate, and Seymour is offensive. . Uh, no. Boyer is even dominated by his own accent, but Bacall is not 100% of the English class. There is no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is a little corrupt. His functioning is not a mere nudity; better than other films. <br /> <br /> <strong> It's the top part of Paxinou and hates it. Dan Seymour takes the entire movie as a guest of a hotel exploring human nature. It's a great role and its performance is perfect, some of the other actors are not good at all. This was definitely a small part, only small actor. Seymour was not a small player. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing with flaws.
