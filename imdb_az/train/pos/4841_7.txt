In the colonies we're not all of us familiar with Arthur Askey, so I have been thoroughly annoying this movie recently because of the negative comments about the appearance of "Ghost Train". Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to laugh at myself. What would you do if it was a baby of Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen when it came to Asker's comedy's physical aspects and lines? Bud Abbott or any of the other hilarious comic reliefs in the genre of this genre. In addition, he may feel the subject connecting Askey to the British comedy for over 30 years; At least one American view is more common with the Monty Python troupe than any of its partners. As for the rest of the film - though you think that the more movies you see will end, it is still very entertaining, the atmosphere and the next look is worth it.
