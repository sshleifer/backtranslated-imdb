First of all, this movie was not released into theaters (TESTED POORLY THEY SAY), saying that they were sent for the deaths of crooks, politicians, and devoted newspaper people, saying that they only sent DVD and cable television, and money and running. <br /> <br /> I usually love this movie, especially with this movie. <br /> <br /> <strong > <br /> <br /> Justin Timberlake is good as a young reporter specifically for a newspaper that has been duplicated by Morgan Freeman, but others are either hooked cops, or politicians or just a bit of decent children, 2 ladies LL COOL J & JUSTIN Timberlake 's friends are girls and they do what they need, not children, many murders and so on. <br /> <br /> Prices *** (from 4) 86 points (over 100) IMDb 8 (outside) 10)
