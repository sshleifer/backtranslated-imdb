ITALYAN is a surprisingly time-consuming movie. Unfortunately, the light effects are really spectacular - an early gem that clearly shows REGINALD BARKER to become a leading director in the same position as D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. It's hard to know how Thomas Thompson controls production, but this movie is still unusual. A simple story of an Italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in New York is very moving. The issue of social injustice, revenge, and forgiveness is full today. The use of nearby is superior and GEORGE BEBAN's steering wheel is powered by electricity. Now it's a really good pressure to move to DVDs we need, so we can appreciate this first movie masterpiece.
