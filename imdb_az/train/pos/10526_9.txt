The Romans are in the air and women who are still in love are attractive and elegant, and in this dark-hearted story, set in a time of grief, the gentlemen are in the flourishing of England during the Victorian era. Emma, ​​directed by Jane Austen and written for the screen and directed by Douglas McGrath, is starring in the lead role of Gwyneth Paltrow. Emma Kubid is pleased with the romantic notion she plays and tries to adapt to each other she feels. After adapting to the successful marriage, she looks at her friend Harriet (Toni Collette) to find her husband, but the result of her first attempt is less than a consensus. In addition, her heart issues are often tempered by Emma, ​​and it is tempered by a beautiful genre, Knightley (Jeremy Northam), who appears to be a balanced debt to the process. And Emma is interested in something that's right for others, but the most important thing is that he neglects his heart. Going to the world and loving, but Emma wants to miss the ship. Fortunately for her, she is just one of her wings. Now he can stop for a long time to understand. But everyone who knows the true love knows that heart problems can suddenly go wrong or wrong depending on the smallest thing; <br /> <br /> McGrath must have known before and for the moment before Emma for romance. <br /> <br /> McGrath is a pleasant, often turbulent world like a beautiful breath we prepare. It may be an enchantment, but in spite of this, this story is perhaps the most important thing - in all honesty - love for everyone - Love. And with McGrath's impeccable pace and timing, it's all fun and enjoyable here. A beautiful, effective film, with a beautiful castle, carries the viewer successfully to another time and somewhere. This is a lightweight, but absorbing; <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Two years after this film, "Shakespeare Love" it looks comfortable and right at home in the genre. He describes everything in English and this is a kind of performance that is easily or completely missed by nature and device. It's just how good it is and makes it easy. He has a charismatic display reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn, and in a cheerful way. But Paltrow is unique. As an actor, he has a wide range and style, and he shows movies like Hard Eight, Hush, and "Perfect Crime" - he can play any part effectively and play any role he plays. But like Emma, ​​it's like a symbol. He is so expressive and open, and his personality is so attractive that he is just a joy to associate and follow, regardless of the part he plays. And for Emma she's perfect. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam also feels very well in Knightley's role and looks eloquent for the genre, such as Paltrow; the performance of the 'Golden Cup', which he called more than the 'Italian Princess of the Girls', was less satisfied. However, he is perfect; she is beautiful and in such a way that Knightley is convincing and very realistic. Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy, like 'Pride and Prejudice' in his miniatures, 'Northam has created a memorable character with Mr. Knightley himself. <br /> <br /> Also, Toni Collette's wife, Harriet Smith, who is well-respected and well-respected; and Alan Cumming, Reverend Elton. Sincerely, Collette and Cumming create characters that are very real people and become a vital asset for the overall success of this film. <br /> <br /> This support film is supported by Greta Scacchi (Ms. Weston), Denys Hawthorne (Mr Woodhouse), Sophie Thompson (Miss Bates), Kathleen Byron (Ms. Goddard), Phyllida Law (Ms. Bates), Polly Walker (Jane Fairfax) and Ewan McGregor (Frank Churchill). "Emma" is an enthusiastic, elegant film reminder of civilizational behavior and makes the value of many softness and grace in the world so unpleasant. It's nice to be able to escape to such a world, even if it is only in the magic of the silver screen, because it is only a few hours since it carries the spirit of man's renewal. And the magic of movies. I appreciate it 9/10. <br /> <br />
