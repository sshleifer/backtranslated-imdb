<br /> <br /> In the 19th century, the American poet and humanist Walt Whitman made an important contribution to how a premature man behaved with psychological problems in western medicine. began to communicate with people with psychological problems, psychiatric workers and patients. After seeing the psychological methods of time (inhumane and ignorant tyranny), Walt rejected these methods and encouraged patients to treat them with compassion and dignity and encourage others to do the same. Waltin's interaction with psychiatric workers, patients and urban populations is full of drama, good humor and wisdom. :)
