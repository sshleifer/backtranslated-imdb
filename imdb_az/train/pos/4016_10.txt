This beautiful little movie has all the elements that make the Spaghetti West interesting and entertaining: ALL music (not just one, female composer for work in genre, Nora Orlandi) (and very bad for the day!) And beautiful scenery and sets (of course Almeria, Spain , of course). She also has a very good story that has a disadvantage of romance. Actors Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (Spaghetti play a crucial role for a woman in the West) and perform well with Carnegie's performances by Leone's Once Upon A Time in the West. Without letting me spoils, let me just say this movie has one of the best endings of any movie I've ever seen!
