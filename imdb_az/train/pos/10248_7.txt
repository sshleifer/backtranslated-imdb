After buying the 1976 Snuff movie, I first heard this movie. They told me that the Devil's experience was even better, so I went naturally and ordered a Guinea pig set. <br /> <br /> The devil's experience is a short film without any story, character development. . Only one woman has been tortured for nearly 45 minutes. He beat her and forced her to drink alcohol after repeatedly putting her into a 24 hour noisy noise, her hands burned, burned, and left the intestines. it was necessary to say that it was fake like scenes to beat most of them. But then, some of them did the best they did in a really good way. The scenes surrounding the woman around me make me angry when looking at me. Or painful to think about the scene that is forced to listen to acute noise during 24 hours. The worst scene scene. When I watch it, I did not have a curtain, just "I think it looks very good for such a low-budget movie". I did not enjoy the flick, but I do not know what most of the horror genre has to offer, I really do not know if it can recommend it. 7/10
