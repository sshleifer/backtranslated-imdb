I did not see this movie in front view and I was surprised by it. This is not a typical romantic comedy. I remember the hardest smile in the film and I'm still moving in with it. Here laughs are not gags - they are observations, laughs of recognition, little shocks "Oh, my God, I thought it was the only one who felt this way!" I'm not going to do more than just say, "Guy's fall in love with her sister's girlfriend." The whole family is involved in relationships here. Probably the best mix of laughter and heat when you "sleep". <br /> <br /> Steve Carell goes deeper than ever before, and for the first time I liked it very much. The player is amazed, but in the other roles is a list of my favorite veteran theater players, but a confusing family. Dianne Witest's beautiful as her mother, Juliette Binoche gives a warm, quiet, tactile performance, bright and cheerful (she knew it was funny) and even the terrible Dane Cook. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a perfect addition and the second one I'll take on the CD. <br /> <br /> Do not miss them.
