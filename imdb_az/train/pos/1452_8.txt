Being a New Yorker transponder, I can be more critical than watching the City Hall. But I have to say that the story was created by myself before the filmmaking and the policy environment of New York city, Harold Becker. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a reference to the Woerner restaurant, where Brooklyn's political director, Frank Anselmo, loves eating. </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> It was written by Pileggi. He knows the atmosphere very well and knows exactly how the two worlds are, as in this film. <br /> <br /> A detective who played Nestor Serrano, the head of the mob, Anthony Franciosa and his father, were killed and three others, including an innocent 6-year-old boy who went to school. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino Mayor John Pappas and Deputy Mayor of John Cusack, a deported Louisianan, is a state with self-corruption tradition. <br /> <br /> Danny Aiello is based on your character, not Brooklyn's political director, Frank Anselmo and New York. About Donald Manes, governor of Manse, Borchali, which was closed after his stay. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Ariello's statement says that the lowest and low cost talent on the screen. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino's best moment is when he is killed in a young child's funeral, he falls into the process and becomes a political victory for himself. It's a complicated part of it, he's a fairly decent man, but he's taking the correction needed to rise to a place like New York. <br /> <br /> City Hall is highly recommended for those who want to know about political life in Great Science.
