Of course, Special Lessons II is the biggest movie I've ever seen. A Japanese import (bad) translation into English, joy to watch. Most of them are illogical, but this is not important. <br /> <br /> This movie is rare and is unavailable in the video, but late at night, I took it several times on the payload cable. <br /> <br /> Joanna Pacula plays our tutor / lover for our hero Ken. <br /> <br /> My copy of the assignment has been tracked dozens of times slowly, personally. (Of course, she was working for her checking.) Ken is a Japanese pop band SMAP, played by Goro Inagaki and gives it all and has beautiful hair from the movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: true"; <br /> <br /> You can use elements such as the amount of anatomical vase wearing patterned corn shirts at Ken's home (at least 50) or at the Ken's film's final review. <br /> <br /> The film is predictable but highly enriched. My friends and I reenact all the scenes. Yes, we sing like the accusers, and we ... but we have enjoyed what we saw in "Special Lesson II." Become one of ten people in the world who is watching this movie. Thank you for that.
