Shakespeare said we were putting a great deal of actors on it. But this stage, when we are of Israel, is a lot of work to which we are commenting and all the actions we do are heavy. Dan Katzir tries to make a spectacular portrait of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but besides, Katzir can enter the hearts of the people of Israel, and these people move away from simple prominent people and speak from us. Katzir's film allows Israel to escape from the dark-running escapes of Israel, and this beautiful country creates a beautiful bird as a result of its ashes. It's too big for me, because the Europeans are only looking for informative diaries or newspapers, and the reality of the Israeli state seems to be almost human reality, looking for its place and trying to feel part of the state as a whole. Katzir builds a beautiful documentary, and he demonstrates that a passionate film of a man strongly predicts the deepest emotions and that these feelings pass through our hearts. Thank you for opening our eyes and giving it to one of the most beautiful portraits in the world's beautiful countries.
