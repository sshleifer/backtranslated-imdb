Some films are directed exclusively to live with originality - "Wonderland" is one of those films. The scenario tries to throw everything into a nearby firefighter, but it does not match each other. The speed of these trillers is not chosen to cover a weak scenario, but rather reflects on the drug-based reality. <br /> As director, James Cox is a very special way to work with his actors. The majority of cartoons are always strangers and often incredibly ugly personalities. Val Kilmer described John Holmus as a hipster, manipulation, and control. There is no blame on Kilmer, but Holmes's version can only control those who are weak. Nevertheless, this is a surprising performance. As Kilmer is compared to more "Hollywood" roles like "The Saint," he proves that he is at home in strange indie flips. <br /> <br /> Actors are the main forces that keep them all together. Especially women have a variety of smaller demonstrations that are particularly distinguished. All of Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow have limited screen times beside their colleagues, but all of them are fantastic. <br /> <br /> Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott also give a strange, surprising power in their role. <br /> <br /> I first of all, in the sense of "Wonderland". Yes, this story happens around John Holmes, but it has nothing to do with his professional career. IRFS: It ranges from 7 to 10
