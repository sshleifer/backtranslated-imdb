Above all, I do not understand that some people can find this movie as anti-American. Of course, the United States, Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach, and the Mira Nair segment, to some extent, have direct indictments in the United States. However, they are not na√Øve words; <br /> <br /> Along with this, they confirm all the documents that CIA has issued about Chile based on real and documented facts. <br /> <br /> But when we return to the movie, we have a different mood. Children are educated to respect the dying people; we find a happy couple that will be replaced by the tragedy of that day; we find common people who relate their feelings to the shadow of the events of September 11 and react differently, with dignity or frustration; <br /> <br /> All of these visions and others - more or less powerful - can lead to the fall of one of the towers in the film to make consistent confusion and help. there is an idea that the viewer reacted to the events of September 11, when the audience spread to different countries around the world. Thus, what we see is a more complex picture than the whites and the swallows, which can frustrate some people; <br /> <br /> As long as the world we live in and there is no place for humanistic ideologies, no matter what presidents or priests can tell us. <br /> Finally, a release date for this movie in the United States. The majority of the American people are asking why this disaster is happening, and this movie can give them some clues, because it's no shame. Unlike the thoughts of some people in this forum - this is what we do today, and it will affect our future today.
