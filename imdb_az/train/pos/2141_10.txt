Masayuki Suo plays this wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> After a good "Fancy Dance" and classic (anyway in Japan) college-sumo comedy "Shiko Funjatta", Suo followed her great tracks with a great success. We also often laugh (Naoto Takenaka, as in Suo's previous two films), and really root for the characters. But a great bonus for me is that the film gives the audience a real life in Japan - a real life in Japan. Suo is forced to act in real life with fun gifts. <br /> <br /> Also look for eight main actors of Shiko Fındıkta. , as all of them appear in various roles, typing characters (Takenaka) to short bars (most).
