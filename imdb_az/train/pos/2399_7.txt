It was a hit at the South-West (SXSW) Film Festival in Austin last year and features John Glover, a beautiful castle and d√©cor decorated by ERL's Gloria Reuben. Despite being drawn to a small budget in NYC, the movie sounds incredible and incredible, and casts us on the scene called "The Scottish Play", referring to the word "Macbeth". thinking of bringing to the ancient curse of the game. The gaming company demonstrates the self, lust, jealousy, anger, suspicion and little fun of the game. The games begin when a major role is taken in the television soap operated by a well-known "pretty face" in the opera field. The green-haired monster takes it from here and drama opens in a beautiful way. Nice noise and good spots around. DVD director's description and some deleted scenes.
