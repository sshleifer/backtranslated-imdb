Without this project, Kirsten Miller was not completed. But I would definitely recommend this with Miss Miller's inspirational beauty and talent. It seemed that other actors played only with their strong performance. Wagner's disrespect for this film was a bit disappointing, but his few appearances did not prevent him from having fun. Many of my criticisms have been made by writing and plotting, and the accumulated talent group has done heroism to get rid of what has to be a disaster. Charismatic Miller's delivery and timing were flawless and convincing. He plays a nice line between the ambitious and bossy, but in fact he claims that the structural engineer ever attacked. I wish I had seen it on the big screen, but unfortunately I leased it before losing it.
