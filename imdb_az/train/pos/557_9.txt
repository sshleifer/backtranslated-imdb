A few years ago, I went to Skagway, Alaska, Dawson City, Yukon, and I was amazed at the scenery and could not help but did not want this movie to be in a real place, though it had beautiful color and scenery images. Jasper in Canadian Rockies is a magnificent place, but is still not a true place where the film is. When the story moved to Dawson, Anthony Mann, who used the open space very well, could make the most of it if he filmed the actual place when I felt. By the way, James Stewart is a man who fights inside. One does not want to involve and helps people who are on the path to earning money, while the other side can not move away from the murdered. Ruth Roman, an ambitious woman, Corinne Calvet's beautiful girl, who did not care who did her steps. Mann shoots are excellent, but the high point of the film is good in outdoor areas. He uses the outdoors as far as possible and helps with the winter appearance of the advantageous network, just like the green with The Naked Spur and The Man From Laramie. Like all Mann-Stewarts, this is traditional western and differs from Stewart's characterization.
