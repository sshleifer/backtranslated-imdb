In this Peckinpah / Leone tradition, this challenging, often fierce western, directed by Andrew V. McLaglen, the former western (mainly John Wayne) actors were mostly John Ford mode. <br /> <br /> Heston is a former captain of the Arizona Land Police, a year-old pensioner. turned law enforcement agencies to reformist champions (Michael Parks) and found ways to apply laws adopted by autos, telegrams, telephones and railways in the early years of the 20th century. But soon he faces a threat from the past - a half-sex smuggler (Coburn), for fourteen years, has put four traffickers on a train robbery. Later, Coburn's wife was killed in the fighting; and thus Coburn came out of the most hateful revenge. This involves the kidnapping and the aggression of Heston's daughter (Hershey) and her gang. The last HARD MEN, based on Brian Garfield's novel "Gun Down," is in many places, including Heston and Coburn and Hershey's aggression scenes and two members of the Coburn gang (Quade, Paull), possibly STRAW DOGS and DELIVERANCE is as suspicious as every other scenery. But the film's psychological approach does not cause much damage to the western genre. McLaglen is able to handle the bloody story with great distress, and Hester's performance as an old lawyer was perhaps the best he did not ever do in the 1970s. Coburn is particularly cold-blooded, and both Parks and Chris Mitchum (as Hershey's intended husband) are in good turn. Here, the music has changed to 100 RIFLES from Jerry Goldsmith's and 1966 to STAGECOACH, but still works here. <br /> <br /> Last HARD MEN should soon be released by Fox by VHS and / or DVD, using Wise and Old Tucson sets in Arizona's southeastern state. It is a West that is worthless.
