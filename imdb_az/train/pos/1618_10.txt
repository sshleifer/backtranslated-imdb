This film is all brilliant. She touches on the intricacies of her affection, but she never writes a lecture. The scenario is never humorous to any character, even irrelevant Johnny. It also benefits from spot-on, production design, casting and output. Cherine is so great for the film and it's a miracle for me, as it is more than a "Cher". I've been watching Moonstruck at least once a year, and with my 16-year-old twin daughters, I looked at this Christmas home and liked it. There is something for everyone who has a heart, and in the end it is full of joy.
