Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata is the Disney version of Guildenstern and Rosencrantz is Dead. As a full-featured Tom Stoppard film, we look at two small characters from the original: Timon, with a madman and Pumbaa, to deal with a song in a lane, looks like one with thirst. Instead of Simba's, watch their story - see how all the animals presented by Pride Rock like Simba bend. Timon and Pumba learn that Simba has decided to pull back to Pride Rock to shoot Scar. And we learn how to deal with hyena one at a time and for all. Nathan Lane, Timon receives most of the best jokes, but is supported by Ernie Sabella like Pumbaa. It is good to hear that Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldbergh have their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give different voices to two new heroes: Timo's mother and uncle. The only downside is always a stable stop-start-back-fast-forward device that does not help develop the story. At the beginning of the film there is a bright moment. With more laughter than any other third-party for-a-Disney series, Hakuna Matata is still a little predictable, but still looking for a hot, windy scene.
