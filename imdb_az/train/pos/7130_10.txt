Well, before I see this movie, I'm not really sure if it was my cup of tea ... how wrong I was! I thought it was one of the best films I have ever watched for a long time, a real family classic. The story of a young evacuo and his new 'father' father, this movie closes all the boxes. I did not read the book (maybe it's a good thing and I like the movie more), but I do not really think of any bad points about the story, I think 10 to 10 (and I think very little nothing guarantees the top level !). William declares, "BEN BIKE, DAD!" I cried my heart (everyone who sees it, I am sure). Really hearty and definitely recommended.
