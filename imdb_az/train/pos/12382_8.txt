Here's a rare horror of the 70s on a gate of NYC. There are a lot of Hell gates nearby, but of course, this unwitting model decides that she needs a lover / fianc√© and she is just to choose the one that is hidden as a nice and affordable apartment. She answers a few strange neighbors and even joins a birthday party for a cat. Moreover, when he heard the strange noises at night, he and the old priest were claimed to be the only tenants. Wow! Who are all these? His lover starts to envy around a lover (Chris Sarandon, a simple lawyer), and not like a long shot, as they are. There are some decent creepy scenes, and the views of the old folks who are interested in being "sometimes" their neighbors are quite interesting. A little decent look and a paradigm towards the end of a less-ordinary nation, this is a decent watch, and the continuous DVD version of course, while watching on TV many times this time, is certainly very good. A bad little bit of horror, perhaps a good companion piece for the "Burned Ads". 10 to 8.
