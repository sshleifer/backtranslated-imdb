When I participated in film festivals, I saw such little films that the theater will never share, and they will end with WalMart's $ 3 boxes. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie very much, I would like to see it in cinema. everything. I would like to have the New York Films translated directly. It is good for Americans to linger somewhat. The name of the film is better if it helps the US audience to investigate random chaos. Cinema reflects life and visas. <br /> <br /> Also, I thought the applause had put dollars in dollars. Come on! It is not difficult to understand the euro, gringo audience to do math. When watching a film, especially in a Paris movie, it does not need to be affected by reminding the viewer: I am American who is watching movies and making dollar dollars for me. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more and more of these actors from the writer and director.
