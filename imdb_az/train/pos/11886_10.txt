I liked this movie. First, because it's a family movie. Second, it offers a refreshing offer to deal with HIV in a family because there are fewer hysteria than movies. The brothers are very close, but not convicted. His desire to protect his youngest brother is noble, but in the end it is not necessary. I understand that the choice of dealing with Leo can not be one of the most popular, but I believe it's the right choice. I can not believe it's a French television program. There were great production values. I gave this movie ten times, and I think you've seen it once.
