I think this movie is brilliant. But there are many reasons to do so, but some of them 1) Good play by Tom and Tyler 2) A brilliant machine gun scene with a brilliant piece 3) I think that the end is good Twist because all the credits at the end of Sam Mendes.as all these credits are good well expected. I became a student at a college and we explained this movie in detail and was one of the best films I have seen in many years. I just want to thank all the people who took part in the filming. Finally, the best scene in the film is the machine gun shot by John Rooney. John Rooney says "I'm glad you" is a good shine to make a scene with silence. <br /> <br /> Last year, according to a statement by Russian Kirk, I think the viewer has created his own voice and that the sound is totally different to every spectator . <br /> <br />
