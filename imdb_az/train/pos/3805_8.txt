After watching the trailer, she was surprised that she never went to the theater, so I ordered BluRay. I had a great time watching it, and I have to say that this movie is better than some basic animation films. Of course, there are some defects, but I can still do that. The animation is good, very entertaining and unique, and the story has kept me tracked all the way to the end. Some of the backgrounds are just dead, and you can see the French talent behind it. I think Forest Whitaker's performance is a bit lifeless, but it's characteristic of Lian-Chu. So it generally raised me on the head and I enjoyed it and I hope that it will be quite successful for all the studios that continue to shoot such big films. It is recommended to give a chance and surprise how great a movie can be with a small budget. Hector is just worth watching the movie because some of the memories are just as hilarious as Stitch.
