I waited until July 4 to write this. Because. . . good . . <br /> <br /> In 1924, D.W. Griffith has been demanded from the First Class since 1921, after a hit need. Since then, she has worked hard, but her films were smaller, and she did not succeed in chord with the audience. He prepared a movie about Patrick Henry when he contacted members of the American Revolutionary Guard (DAR), asking him if he could expand his views to cover much of the American Revolution. This movie gives a result. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . The mixed issues are that Nancy's father hates Nathan. . . Not only Nathan, he hates all the rebels. <br /> <br /> Someone was shot in the streets of Lexington, causing Nathan to surrender his gun and accidentally wound Nancy's father. <br /> <br /> To parallelize the wisdom of love (mostly correct but partly decorated British soldier Capt Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore), with thousands of Hindus, creating six nations on their own, crushing colonialists and hopes to become a monarch of his own empire. <br /> <br /> Compared to the birth of a nation (1915), Nathan Stoneman may be part of the family, while the Montague family can be Cameron, the previous film. with the army and the scene of a nation in a very similar way to the scene, Redcoats are attacking a house full of Patriots, Henry Walthall accuses the flag of loading a ball in the land of any human being.Surely, the battle scenes in America, it's powerless and can not attract the audience Graphics, not G.W. Billy's Butitzer's camera work is very good, maybe what's missing. . . I say that. . . Sincerity? <br /> <br /> Capt's brutality Butler and his men are highlighted, though most of them are in long shoots or on the screen. Do not wait for any leader to collapse, as we have seen in the Inner-state (1916). At one scene, Butler's second team, Captain Hare (Louis Wolhiem), sees the captives colonizer. We only see the beginning of the job, because the rest of the camera focuses on Hare's face because it's a good time. Lionel began working with Griffith from 1912. A story has come to Griffith for work, and D. W. knows the reputation of the well-known family, "I do not hire actors." Lionel replied: "I am not that kind of thing, sir!" He is a very good and very convincing liar. Louis Wolhiem Lionel's brother John triumphed three times; SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JEKYLL and MR. HYDE (both 1920) and TEMPEST (1927). <br /> <br /> Nathl Hamilton was the first time Athlete was in the first place and Athletic I was afraid of death. "She hates her hate very well, and we can imagine that she's pretty sure she is in horse riding after the shooting ends, with Mr. Griffith Carol Dempster loved and wanted to get married at some point. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He makes a horse for the front of a family, "Weapons! <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> <br /> <br /> YES! Do not wait for July 4, and you like it at any time.
