I'm honest, I find this film a lot of relief for its good. Extremely difficult to finish. Except for the disgusting character played by Fredrick Forrest, there is no way to judge any character that does not love me. <br /> <br /> Even when people say that they can break a word or because of ice and start to heal, people behave in this way by putting walls around themselves. <br /> <br /> A terrible tragedy hit Montana family. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Believe that they have lost a child but they are lost . 2. But first, if they communicate and face, they will not lose their second son forever. <br /> <But they can not do it alone. A family's family does not want to share their sadness. Some families enter into silence and hatred, while some point to the finger of the sin (and then continue to deceive a poor pregnant wife by deceiving the dear girl of the deceased ... Andy is really one!) A family that does not threaten Arnold in a way is his father (Wilford Brimley). Dad looks like a judge and even talking to the boy without gloves. He knows what the child thinks, though Arnold does not talk much about these days. This is a truth that can be applied to a poor child. No one realizes that Arnold's shock, denial, or sadness can not be the same style or the same speed as expected. <br /> <br /> The Government is very calm and natural because it is very easy to judge, get angry, and feel that someone is "made of stone." <br /> <br /> The story is very calm and natural. You will not go for some spoiled nutrition ruminations or Hollywood's not feeling well. I was very worried that this child was full of guilt, and felt that Andy's wife needed to apologize to Andy's wife because he did not blame himself. Arnold could have accidentally killed his brother, but no one was responsible for the end of the marriage. But it was probably too bad, except for the two men who were married. <br /> <br /> Robert Duvall and Glenn Close are baseless as parents who can not find themselves in contact with their son. To learn what Arnold has gone through. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Just except EXPLORERS, a childhood lover and creepy ghost story LADY IN WHITE, did not do anywhere else, did an amazing job, like Arnold , a great performance of a child player. /> Sometimes it is sometimes slow, STONE BOY is an excellent and very depressing movie.
