This is an entertaining view of the Gospel, by Johnny Cash (naturally, black-and-white), which reads and talks a bit. If it were like Johnny Cash, this movie is very nice. Also note the blond description of Jesus in this case ... just try to think of five Jewish men with blond hair ...? Anyway, the entertaining presentation of his greatest and most important story.
