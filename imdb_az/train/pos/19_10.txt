I only read TomReynolds2004's comments and feel that I'm jumping here. I understand that the film will not work, but its reasons are not clear. My feelings about this film are not afraid of a dark road trip, failure, disappointment and sorrow. Each of these two people has many reasons to be bitter and angry, but each of them has sensitivity and comfort. Only large players can do this job without emotional quagmire, sentimental and sappy. I was really interested in these people because of the great humanity they have given them with such powerful speeches. In Vietnam, I have every reason to dislike Jane Fonda, but apart from personal feelings, she is also a great figure. Robert DeNiro is as beautiful as a man who started exploring himself in a world where intelligence and goodness are not indifferent to his abilities. For the first time I've seen DeNiro use more sensitivity than selling a character, and I love it. It was a great surprise when I first looked at this movie, and I hope to see it again.
