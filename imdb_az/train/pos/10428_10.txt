Unfortunately, a strange film that we won, but, unfortunately, slim and delicate, did not hesitate to find me for a long time. Instead of relying on clich√©s and very dramatic moments, a series of moments are emerging in sequence. Lead Heroes are not perfect and are therefore as easy as people you know. The film is not a laughing matter or an ideal thing to the audience, but only shows us the true love in every situation. <br /> <br /> I stood in my husband's eyes. With Tiffany's Casablanca and Breakfast, there is a moving, thoughtful, entertaining, funny look of love that I thought would be definitely a romantic classic. Even the toughest heart will soften.
