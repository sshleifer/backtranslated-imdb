I hired this movie for two reasons for Netflix - as I thought it would be the science fiction of the 50s and inspired by the fact that it was the first long-time Superman movie. Of course, about 15 minutes later, I also took care of myself and found a great surprise. <br /> <br /> An experienced oil well has gone about six miles to the ground and is closed by the sponsor. Lois and Clark have shown to get the bucket, but it's not disappointing that no deep well will work anymore. One day, the strange events in the rabbit make a better story for Superman than Clark Kent. As you can see, radioactive Mole Men occupied a six-mile home from the Earth. <br /> <br /> Supermen and Mole Men are part of a sympathetic but well-prepared social reality. At the beginning of a major role-playing actor in the Second World War in 1951, the moral aspect of the story seems to have succeeded Americans to become fascists. Reeves automatically lets the group "Mole Men" to become "Nazis" at one point, to carry this point typically home to the Supermen method. <br /> Even in the 1950s there is no scientific underlying this film. The six-kilometer digging on the continental ground did not even penetrate the upper mantle, but only "the center of the space." It will be explained - this film will be filmed based on the golden age comic book. <br /> <br /> The film goes straight to unevenness. Despite the fact that Molemans are interesting, in a somewhat creepy and beautiful way, there are many Corman-esquire scenes that often repeat the same behavior as us. The script is smart and economical. According to today's standards, the costume is unfair, but for the time the film's special effects and suits were pretty good. Cinematography is generally very good and the player is better than expected. I was especially impressed with Reeves, Jeff Corey and Walter Reed.
