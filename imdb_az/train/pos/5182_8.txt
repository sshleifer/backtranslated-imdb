A cool, sweet and noble nostalgic film for young people to meet with old friends and all around you, how to deal with today's problems and their hearts. A movie that feels good about you. All items are here: old confusion, competition, friendship and loyalty. Disaster, night frostbite raids, and other entertainment from our summer camps. All characters have a one-week opportunity to re-live as the old camp leader retired and wants to meet with children from the golden year of the camp. All of them are now in the mid-thirty and in the middle of their career.
