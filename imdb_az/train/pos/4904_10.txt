This movie is perfect when you are in mood to feel attractive, good on every side. If you love jazz music you should see it. If you like to smile a loving character, it can make your eyes tear, and tomorrow this movie may be just like you are. My only complaint is that Darren Aronofsky (one word - djjohn lighting, if you know a good time, if you know a good thing) is a very shortened film. I think I only have to watch a couple of times to get my refill.
