Every country with a functioning film industry has some (and possibly some crazy) artist who creates movies that you only have to understand when you're part of this country. Hundstage is such a movie. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level of Austrian society, dirty, uncomfortable, strange and hateful. However, they still have enough money, because they allow adjustable cars and large homes. They do a lot of strange things that maybe 'normal' for them because they do it all their lives. From the normal human point of view, you can now easily watch the movie and have fun or admired and watch a beautiful piece of Austrian art films. <br /> <br /> But if you live here and you know people, Hundstage is a society's swelling. A society that creates its own rules, which goes far more and more insane every day, is a cave within the social system. And you see people. While sitting in the opposite street corner, they sat in the park sitting in the same line. Maybe you can meet in the bar or at a discos you've visited. Maybe you work with them or live near your home. You start to hate them without knowing it. You will try to get away - but you can not. Maybe you will look like them. <br /> <br /> Life is not so brilliant, although Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. There are beautiful people ... but some are also dirty. <br /> <br /> Many hardworking people are trying to do their best ... But the people of Austria are destroying what they have built up to date. <br /> <br /> A very touching movie.
