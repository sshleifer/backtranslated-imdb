I'm participating in a filmmaker's symposium, and this movie has not seen a better movie and was shown after joining a 40-minute discussion. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was cheerful in all the right fields of the film and I thought I loved strange characters too. In the film, they are really growing up on you.
