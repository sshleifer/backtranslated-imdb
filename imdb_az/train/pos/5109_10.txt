I grew up in Houston, and when it came out, it was nine. As a result, I do not remember anything about the movie. <br /> <br /> But Gilley and I remember the feelings of a mechanical bull from Johnny Lee's song "Love for Love". <br /> <br /> For the past few years, however, I've seen this movie as an adult for the first time, and it's almost blown up. Several films hit me harder. This movie is as real and real as you can get. Bob's brother's house, Texas chemical plant, Gilley's dance hall, Bud and Sissy. And perhaps for this reason, there is no wider appeal. However, despite the feelings of your country (despite my Houston roots), Urban Cowboy is a unique piece of American pepper. So I love it!
