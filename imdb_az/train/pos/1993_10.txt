This is the adaptation of Dicken to Oliver Twist. Most of the film (for example, he had a rest and half brother) spent the original story on the stream. The biggest difference and story in the film is that Fagin is hanging at the end of the book - a very different thing than this music. <br /> <br /> This style and scope really did not match before or before. Only songs are often read and not memorable, but it's an overview to see the movie's choreography. However, in most music, several people or even a small group dance with dance, where numbers are often hundreds or more. It's really a sight-seeing scene and I've been to the theater for the first time and I'm lucky when it's one of my childhood memories. When I see it just a few minutes ago, I have to say that the film was only good at the time. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, I was amazed at how loud and feminine it was for me when I saw this movie again this night. It was for Mark Lester's film he read. Well, according to IMDb, her singing is named by a girl and this is definitely her vote.
