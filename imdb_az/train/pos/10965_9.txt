Little Edie and Big Edie are able to feel compassion for everyone. Even though their homes are bad, it is understood by their mental illness. He wrote a poster on the post board that "Little Edie has eight-year-old skills." In this dramatized version of 2009, Big Edie tells Little Edie: "If you get caught, only with yourself!" These women had everything; beauty, talent, intelligence, ideas and actions. If Edie had not done the first time for himself, his hair, his work, and his love of life, he would have created him. This is due to what I believe is a mental illness: when it is difficult, she does not have the ability to choose and sees that good times are ahead. <br /> <br /> However, women who do not have this apparent danger are able to manage themselves, but she must come to her home, Edie! bright, cheerful and lovely, even in their very bad house. These women were extraordinary, and their interaction with each other brings humor and sadness. Edie wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl, she has a busy call to talk about what she's experiencing or to hug herself and "everything is good!" <br /> <br /> Great documentary! <br /> <br /> 9/10
