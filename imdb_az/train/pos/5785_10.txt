When I read the comments for this show I could not help, but most viewers did not really follow their episode or any of their episodes. Something about Kerching! This is a children's show, FOR CHILDREN so your old cat will appear to be forced and seemed foolish. I even found a man who said that the bands were foolish, but I remember wondering why eight-year-old Taji's wallpapers were on the wall of Taji and wondered if my parents had done anything to me. Yes, it can be boring, the player may be better, and some characters really do something strange with their hair, but I appreciate this 10/10 as a child show. Although they are comparable to the weather today, I wish them to be re-released. DVD release, everyone?
