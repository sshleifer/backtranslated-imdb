Clint Eastwood returns as Dirty Harry Calahan in the 4th Dirty Harry series. Clint is old, but still there, Harry ordered a strike after some of the troubles that took place due to a robbery (here came a memorable fragment against the "My Day"!) But a woman wound up in the town where the strike returned to vigilante after an aggression rape attack and punks begin to get one at a time. Sandra Locke's latest movie to see in a Clint Eastwood movie! An improvement after Enforcer, a little more comedy and less serious. Clint Eastwood's sunglasses were Gargoyles, the best for sunglasses worn by Arnold Shwartzeneger in Terminator. Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry's films or action killings are worth the hour as a thrill.
