You will be forgiven to consider that Helsinki's Finnish director will be good at managing an American fear film (especially in the US Prison) - you will find it wrong to prove yourself! It was produced in the late 80s and the movie was brought to a more affordable budget for a modern DIY company (everyone thinks everyday practically everybody is accustomed to $ 100 million, and, unfortunately, in the industry!), Mr. Harlin's first big and at least it will be considered as a perfect period in our day. Still, most of the Nordic contribution, which is part of the film industry, is more of a look at Stellan Stargaard's screenshots (better than overrated by Mr. Bergman's leadership efforts) - at least for all female viewers - but this whistle actually has the ability to film outside the US and Hollywood to watch us filming a movie. If you're not a scary bubble in this movie, even try and watch, IMO is definitely worth it!
