As an old rocker, this movie reminds my 2 favorite bands - Heep and Quo - but with an amazing cast (everyone) - and with a fantastic storyline - I just love this piece of creative genius. Mick Jones did not add so many things (along with the greatest rock singer, Foreign Hero and Keyword Writer - Lou Gramm) - I watched this great job more than 10 times - Bill Nighy - What a Jimmy Nail - a talent comes from every eye - then Astrid .... and Karen ..... may ask a rocker to get older! <br /> 10/10 - bloody bright. <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, Western Oz, Originally Windsor, England.
