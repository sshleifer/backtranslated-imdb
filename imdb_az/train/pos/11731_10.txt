I think that this movie is very entertaining and horrible. I love Elvira and love this movie. Unfortunately, the second part of this beautiful movie did not succeed, as it is very funny as the first part. I'm sorry I did not see Cassandra Peterson in another movie except for this movie. I think he's a great actress with great potential. Hopefully, in the third part of Elvira's adventures, I will see him in the future. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy players. Cassandra, if you read that, you know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can trust me. What else can I add? This is a cool and classic movie!
