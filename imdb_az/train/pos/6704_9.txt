In the first three seasons, Sabrina was a gem that was hidden in TGIF (and later, during school days in the afternoon). There was a maniac, a zany energy and fast pacing that exceeded an unusual joke of every episode. Melissa Joan Hart has revealed a strange talent for physical comedy, especially in facial expressions. His two brothers could play straight, like "straight men" or two witches, with great funny time and general chemistry with Hart. Salem was like a chattering cats, free to be freed of any scheme of interest, and laughing and doing something for everyone because he was a cat who was talking. Sabrina's comrades, along with their social experience at school, are typically settled into "bad dignity" and "totalitarian principle." Perhaps the most exciting and unique feature of the show is the combination of pop culture (eg compositions of the era, Jerry Springer), archetypal human condition / morality (such as the importance of friendship, the Christmas spirit), the typical expression of similar metaphors in the magical world. Unfortunately, like television shows throughout the age of the show, the show coincided with Sabrina, who has been attending high school for the first three years. Starting from the fourth season of the season, the overall passage of the college shows, especially when selecting writers to present Joshni Harvey as a rival, and the delicate excuses for Aunts Hilda and Zelda remain on the screen, as the main player. Sabrina's last season in a pop culture magazine was unexpectedly disappointing. Still, in the end, Sabrina remains a unique introduction as a hybrid situational comedy with magic elements that raise the tidy payout of this genre every year.
