If you love Deep Cover, you can also enjoy this movie. Many poetry writers read in the deepest context of Fishburne, the screen compatibility of a game written by Fishburne, a lyric poem, "Once in Life." If you like Larry as much as I love, all of Larry, you love this movie, and you've all left it. Of course, weaponry and illegal use of weapons, therefore, this is a gangster movie, but the scenario is beautiful and the story is touched, even on the chicken bone side. <br /> <br /> AMAZING movie ... is dark, scary, sexy, and interesting. If you have been leaked at night or hung up in a club building, you will get the right effects of narrow gangs (trapped metaphorically in life). Completely clever foreshadowing and complex relationships, this movie is not intense ... the set of dressing and camera shots are mirrored every single part. GOOD JOB!
