The story makes me very happy and really connected to my parents. It is easy to forget that the failure of a body is a repetitive and passionate person. And then they have mistakes and they have to live. I like the performance of Ellen Burstyn and who is Christine Horne? It's fantastic! Finding the True. Perhaps the most erotic scene I've ever seen in a movie, nothing has been shown - it's just a nice job. Generally, the film's appearance and feeling were confusing, a real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good in this way, humanizing a man downward spiraling. The filmmaker was approaching the life of this woman, never anxious, never enough - it was enough to burn me, but it was not enough to drown.
