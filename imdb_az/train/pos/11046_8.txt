Maléfique is a very interesting film. It is a blurred blend of triumphs and failures. The concept of the center is great, three prisoners with strange personalities unite in the fourth (auditorium) and try to escape from their cells by a magic book they find on the walls of the cell. Atmospheric touches well, which reminds me of reading Château d'd'Edmond Dantes's stay in prison (before Monte Cristo's counting). The director reveals the character of the characters associated with the cell, in particular the character that we are looking for (Carrère - a black-and-white offender, but the wrong proposal may be fraud). Once Carrére dithers have cell implantation and cell closure to shut it down; Never leave the cell, claustrophobia is indestructible. There are no prisons outside the prison, and the stands in the stands are a sunny sun over a common prison wall. Although the film is very modern, it is a very old world prison. <br /> <br /> Heroes are interested. Marcus has a fierce pre-op transsexual, Pâquerette (French for Daisy) plays a harsh mother who is a weak young man. Pâquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful and, unfortunately, it has included her baby sister and, hence, her existing problem (I love these very elementary, very elementary comments). <br /> <br /> Lasalle's wife was brutally murdered and taken away from the old man. <br /> <br /> The central message of the film will destroy your desires, and there is a ritual with it. It's the most disturbing thing I've ever done to destroy people in a ritualistic way. It has a real alarm. Quite a simple soundtrack supports this well, with each step deep into quicksand is accompanied by a gong dull call. <br /> <br /> Every time I've done something really devastating, I've heard gong now. <br /> <br /> I think one of the assassination problems is that the end of the characters really does not strengthen the message. Carrère, the concept of the book, appears to be not a point of view across the film. <br /> <br /> I also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish, with more projects, the popular "Vagina Eye" and "Lasalle." In the film, which he recently perceived as a director, he was in a hurry to enter into some things do not look logical, for example, we began to believe in various things about Carrère's child. This is a rare bird, which is here, not a "clean" horror film, but the truth does not change. There is no comedic dross or genre segueing like Cube (1997 / Natali), there is a common film for comparing it, where you have a common immersion experience where you feel like you are in the cell with characters. <br /> <br /> In my personal note, my best part of the film, Lasalle's past, speaks as a librarian. He very clearly describes the scene where he was sitting in the center of a room where one day all the books were going to work and in a circle around him. The books are thankful that they will never retain their knowledge. It wanted to be crazy about Lasalle. This is really a discreet problem with understanding and knowledge. <br /> <br /> The names of two articles in the first edition mixed the names of the characters. To convince yourself that Lasalle is an old librarian character, print the page of Philippe Laudenbach and see him born in 1936.
