I present it and BABYLON 5 as the best TV-fantasy series. Both are noticeable because, unlike the early STAR TREK series, there is a consecutive evolution of fields and symbols. The original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: If you look at TNG, they were beautiful shows, but there was no general theme or field that united all episodes. In many cases, you will not be able to bring trouble without understanding what is usually happening. DEEP SPACE 9 (with giant battles to the end of the final season) and the other TREK show that it was less than a great story that united them. This consistency has been developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and has made it even wider with SG-1. The bottom line was like watching a family in many cases or slowly forming a long novel. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there were a few "shooters" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but they were too small and far and usually very funny. <br /> And when I was funny, I liked that I had kept my mood in SG-1 from time to time and were not so serious. In this way, I liked BABYLON more than 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his excitement and Homer Simpson's love - it's really bad that he slowly disappeared from the series in subsequent seasons. <br /> <br /> To truly appreciate SG-1, you need to see it from the beginning and see how your tactics work. This compatibility shows that the exceptionally lasting force. And if you do not like SG-1, it's probably not a genre for science fiction when given a fair chance.
