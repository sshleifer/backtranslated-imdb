Rarely, a film has the power to expand the mind, to warm his heart, and to be very touched. The film "LOU" is such a movie. I got a "LO" from my friend who was a filmmaker. He followed me for the second time. We both were surprised. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < This is a ruthless entertainment. Bret Carr's acting as a director and shift does not allow him to appear on the screen. He prepares a character that extinguishes an indignant bird like a stuttering innocence, but with a very sincere, sincere attitude that you forget about watching a movie. When I hit the epiphana during the perfume peak, I saw my spouse the second time in tears. <br /> <br /> As a Life Coach, we will facilitate individual growth and transformation, and for this movie, you will need to "see" life coaches and everyone who wants their own development and transformation. It is a brilliant, creative work with the power to change lives!
