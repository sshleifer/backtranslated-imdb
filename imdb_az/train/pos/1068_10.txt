I think the Dark Angel is very good! The first season was excellent and came out in a good field. Max (Jessica Alba) escaped X-5, the creation of logic, tries to adapt to a normal life, but still "to save the world." <br /> <br /> The second season has suddenly become somewhat strange compared to the first one. It has now disappeared and the series has lost some of its charm because it seems to be all the weird "creatures". The second season is good not to get me wrong, but to some extent of the "logic". <br /> <br /> Therefore, they were able to return to the new promising area in the last episodes of the season. There were many hopes to see more. Episodes. And behind James Cameron can not go wrong. I would like to conclude that it was a great team, but I still hope for the third season!
