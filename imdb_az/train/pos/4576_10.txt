I thought this was a completely charming movie around the lives of Mary and Kate and Ashley's characters Sam and Emma Stanton! Both work to make themselves and their parents happy; Unfortunately, it's actually not easy for them! I thought this was a really cool and sweet movie, and if you are a true admirer of these beautiful young women, I'm sure you will agree with me here! If you've never seen this movie, I'm really losing it; it's a great time and you have to do it! This movie is a real winner! Sincerely, Rick Morris
