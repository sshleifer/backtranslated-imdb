Here are some of the negative feedback I received here. But these miniseries are powerful and convincing, because the talented cast is really the dark truth of the Hitler world. <br /> <br /> Peter Stormare is ideal as a brutal Brownshirt leader, Ernst Rohm. Every scene with Hitler is explosive! Hitler is so bad that he is the ruler of all, but he is a terrible, primitive Rohm - and he gives Rohm a clarity. The relationship between Stormare and Carlisle relates to the cruelty of Hitler's Rohm, but then rescued him for political reasons. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone is a heartbreaking work, like Heli's convicted brother and Geli Raubal, who is his wordless victim. disorders. Jena Malone reveals all the horrors of the gradual exhaustion of the young girl without revealing any sexual dirt. He uses his eyes and voice to show all the horrors that millions of people will visit in the years to come. And he is brilliant! Zoe Telford is very close to Jena Malone, described by Eva Brown. Eva is obviously ill, cruel and unkind - but it also depends on Adolph's twisted sensitivity. <br /> <br /> Liev Schrieber pointed to the fact that Hitler hated her great self-pity. <br /> <br /> Liev Schrieber gives the impression that Putzi Hanfstaengel as a surprise. Hittites are the city where the riches and power of the ocean have survived. Like Rohm, he likes the idea of ​​dismantling his skulls in his rough boots, and Schrieber's character is one of many Germans who benefit from the Nazi severity, but can not resist the money and power quickly and easily. His weak will for Hitler loses his respect for his wife in a short time and is played with style and sensitivity by striking and spectacular Julianna Margulies. <br /> <br /> These speeches provide a true portrait of marriage and betrayal. There is an exception. Unfortunately, Matthew Modine's acting chips are not just barefoot. His noble good-natured journalist can not force everyone to look at the face of the Hollywood golden boy, the poorly dressed low-cost low-cost renowned Rohnin brown shirts. But the story is still working. <br /> <br /> Now, with regard to the actual inaccuracy of the script, Hitler's distortion and cruelty are demonstrated in a vibrant, dramatic drama. But Corporal Hitler's battle record is badly damaged. The writers regard Hitler as a fear of fear of Demir Khaichi, as the audience feared that the viewer could not control the idea of ​​evil and courage. It's as though you can get a medal from anyone in the Kaiser army! The film looks like Hitler is a fearless soldier in paradise. He also said that his comrades believed he would not support him, and that they were amazed by the officers and respected men. <br /> <br /> Hitler is known as Hitler, Hitler and Hitler. PURIFICATION is the success of the rise marked by strong speeches.
