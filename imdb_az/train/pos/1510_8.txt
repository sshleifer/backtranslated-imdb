Yes, this is a horror anthology movie and it was very fun! Because the movie was clearly horrified, some stories had a light spirit, and sometimes even a few laughs. Sometimes terrifying films are so full and very serious that this is not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The essay that connects each story is the home itself. Four different stories cover those who hire home rentals and those who want to investigate what happened to them. <br /> <br /> The first segment, Denholm Elliottu, was a scary writer with a writer bloc. So renting this house for scenery change. Almost immediately Elliott's block is erased, and a story about a number of killer is constantly working. It is strange that soon after the bloc's withdrawal, it begins to see its decisive character! Again, a psychotic killer appears and then disappears - it seems to be losing his mind. <br /> <strong> Peter Cushing plays a bachelor, playing for a girlfriend who died a while ago, <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> (though his appearance is strangely modern). When he gets into the horrible candle museum in the city, he creates a wax reminiscent of his lost lady, and he is also surprised and scared. He then visits a comrade (Joss Ackland) and he sees this figure and goes by it. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee leads a conclusion that he later wrote to a miserable girl like a pitiful, harsh and sad father. In most of this segment, Lee was called, but in the end you could understand his behavior. <br /> <br /> The fourth segment was silliest and meant the parody of the genre. Jon Pertwee (the third "Doctor" from the DR., WHO television series) is a very temperamental actor known for Dracula's drawings. However, there is nothing appropriate for the movie, and it does not have a peak, this vampire pushes the set to find the best props for the movie. Dracula or other vampires seem to be natural to Christopher Lee, who plays a basillion times, and this role is really quite interesting (give or just a few). Basically, Lee and Dracula's other impressions were compared to Bela Lugosi, and I enjoyed Pertwee's line! Perhaps that is why Lee did not take this part! <br /> <br /> Taking into account the start and end of the film, there was a perfect player and writing, it was very difficult, despite very difficult moments, it was very entertaining and entertaining. To avoid this movie.
