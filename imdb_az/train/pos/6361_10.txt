I was looking forward to the opening of this movie for a few months. With a great Jim Carrey being so eager to see Seuss' Grinch how he could get himself and how he would do it himself. I'm not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This film is pure magic. He is a master at Carrey's trade and nobody could have played this role perfectly. It was great to have fun both for adults and for children, and this film was sure to be a timeless classic for everyone in the years to come. <br /> <br /> Already my young daughter has a vision of watching this arrangement in the video for a year, and I will certainly follow her and laugh as I see it first. <br /> Undoubtedly, Jim Carrey has been written on the film and I do not believe he will come together without it. However, the supporting player was cute and entertaining, especially by the lovely Taylor Momsen, the perfect foil for Carrey antics. Set designs, musical balls and suits give their hands a magical, incredible product, and all of them can be proud of. <br /> <br /> It's not an easy task to turn the 22-minute cartoon class into a full-length live action movie, but howard has succeeded in flying colors. For your critics, who are certainly not satisfied, it's likely your 2 small-sized hearts.
