Basically, the film can be one of the most admired names by either of the two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Carefully corrected that the film deserves nudity as one of the most stylish actresses / tricks ever prepared. <br /> <br /> When it comes to unhappy tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts are really a great duet. And this is a good thrill as Deja Vu is expecting. Washington really was very comfortable in cameras and every scene. One would easily relate to the feelings of his character and, therefore, enjoyed all the murder on the road. It was a great success that they created many dark Mexican cities. One will easily agree with the degree of corruption described in Ates' Fire. <br /> <br /> You can write an article related to the article author. This is the best of the Death Wish genre, but it also suffers from many forms of violence. Realizing a film and playing Denzel Washington's role as a "lost sheep" tragic hero, he is rightly a little refreshing. Finally, there was even a guy who was shot in his pool as a documentary. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > <BR> <div> I hope this movie is not real. <br /> 8/10 art direction / editing / cinematography / Denzel for Washington.
