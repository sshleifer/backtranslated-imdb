Unlike some explanations, mine is positive. This movie is decorated with a group of friends around the dining table, some love you, and some are not. Several people - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not happy to anyone, everything, or lifestyle - like a real life. Some story lines only occur, but it does happen. Like real families and good friends, they stay together. Parents who buy your baby are such gaps! Thank you for the end. Poor Delmar has stuck between himself and his mother, a rock and rock that protects his son, and strives to keep all of their lives together. It can not go through the sun gate, or everything in 'homes' live in a dream world, but it is a very realistic picture of people living from day one to month. In general, this is a good story and a great movie!
