Here is an unusual Laurel & Hardy comedy with something split personality: Sometimes it feels like two films made in different styles that join each other. Fortunately, every piece is funny, and as guys see it's easy to carry on clowning day and makes a fun synthesis of fun different elements of the movie. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Like my favorite Laurel & Hardy comedy DIRTY I have never heard of a WORK fan. <br /> <br /> Our story is one of the key elements of the storyline at Professor Noodle's House: The parody of the "Mad Scientist" scenario. This is a rarity in a fantastic area for L & H; Abbott & Costello and The Three Stooges walked with Stan and Jones often with crazy doctors. In any case, the professor is restrained by creating a rejuvenating serum that can create young people, with his sarcastic style, Jessup, the eyes of the audience with eyes and occasionally dry quills. Meanwhile, Stan & Ollie, the chimney sweeps emerging at the professor's home, are the day when they improve their solutions. The "part" of the film consists of a characteristic (but first class) slapstick covering chimneys, ceilings, shovels and a number of unsuccessful failures. If you do not enjoy watching these kids, you will strengthen a job, you probably will not be like DIRTY WORK, but this is a feast for a team-mate. When we hit the bush inside the fireplace filled the ground inside the chimney, and then rimmed with a rhythmic rhythmic sensitivity. I want my shooting to fall into a fire; The process of the process is such a thing that suspicion that something inside was a joke, the way W.C. Field films will show the world's worst back projection screens. Slapstick is a very funny thing, but it's an unusual magician scientist motif and two supporting actors, Hat: a prolific character actress Lucien Littlefield, like a professor, a genius that creates dull lines with a floral heart, Sam Adams is a jumble of Jessup but less expensive in the butler. As well as Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, their supporting films in Hal Roach Studio gave a great boost to their films. So typically, Le Roy Shield records background music, but DIRTY WORK records a rare event that does not accompany any music accompaniment after a Roach comedy opening credits from this era. Mood may have enhanced musical procedures, but no matter what; This is a very enjoyable comedy and an example of the very popular in Laurel & Hardy days.
