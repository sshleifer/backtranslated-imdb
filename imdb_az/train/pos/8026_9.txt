Throughout this film, this movie can only be considered for children. Yes, mostly directed to them, but the audience is in good enough with the jokes in adults. Meanwhile, the Muppet network tried to go to Broadway, so they kept them in a difficult situation and led them to break. But Kermit can not stop, and his decision protects the actions that are hit by the car after the contract is received and sent by the amnesia! <br /> <br /> This is the origin of old music, including old music, from the early 40's, but there are beautiful moments of adornment and jerk (Lou Zeland's boomerang fish, Gonzo water stunt screen, whispering campaign, among others), as well as many hearts. Muppet writers are not ashamed of the conventions, but on the contrary, they are looking at a place where they can provide 'demonstration' such as 'strangely enough to think that they think they're going to dreams'. <br /> <br /> Although not as original as Muppet movie, there are so many loving and memorable songs, great places in Manhattan, and even invite the inter-species unity (and marry)! Cameos includes Liza Minneli ("a frog"), Elliot Gould (like the police), Brooke Shields (proposed by a rat), Edward I Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So be ready to read, or just have a great laugh and romantic (yes romantic) times with just one of the best Muppet films.
