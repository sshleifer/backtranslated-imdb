Such films and C.R.A.Z.Y. are very sorry about gay movies for American films. Except for Parting Glances and Brokeback Mountain, this movie has some other popular American movies with depth and sincerity as The Bubble. This film is about two men, Noam and Ashwar, a Israle and the Palestinians. Tensions between Jews and Arabs in Israel make their relationship difficult. Couples will fight with whom they will say who will be with whom they will say, "I love you" in the early stages of their relationship. Noah and Ashwa's early love compounded with suicide attacks, armed security checkpoints and racism. <br /> <br /> It is clear that the majority of citizens of Tel Aviv are not likely to accept the representation as friendly Arabian Ashwar. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive moments and many in this movie. Joining the production of Noam and Ashwar Bent. We, as filmmakers, see what they are watching, and their effects are deeply entrenched in their eyes. <br /> <br /> Sagittarius Knoller and Youseff are a prominent figure like Joe Sweid, Noam and Ashwar. Author Eyan Fox, Shakespeare is brilliant in creating a solid and intriguing design of classic Romeo and Juliet. And today, although many movies (almost like sport) are sexually related, this is back to the old and true version of sex with love and passion. This is fresh. And the two gay men see that they look like animated films, not like human beings. There are cartoon characters in this movie. There will not be only two gay children for a change. On this site I think I read a comparison between this movie and "Friends". Yes, not really. Yes, it looks like the first steps toward young people, minors, and relationships. <br /> <br /> This is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> Friends are. There is a heart and heart failure. And earn you win as well as all the good love stories. But not in full flourishing glory. There is still a very enjoyable movie to watch.
