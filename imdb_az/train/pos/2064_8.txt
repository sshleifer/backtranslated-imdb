ScareCrow was the most funny Killers I've seen on the move! Moreover, it is often bouncy when it jumps in the excitement! There was a perfect sound, which was perfect for him. Story lines were very good. I love the kids' spirit how cool it is to ScareCrow! Moreover, when he said what they were doing, there was a reason to kill ..... I would be very angry! ScareCrows view was really good! his appearance gives that person "OMG". Respond to it when you see it! The fairy tale he came was very nice, funny! These people were fools, so long they waited! They had to see and run away to their lives ... though they would not!
