I watched this movie on Friday 7th of April. I did not see the last scene (because I talked to my husband at the same time). <br /> <br /> I heard that one of his spouse heard his voice, spoke in the bedroom, and then opened the door, it was already dead. <br /> What happened to him? Did he kill himself? She can organize things like phone calls, but she is at home when she talks to this strange admirer of her husband? Everyone can explain to me. I'm very excited! (I read at the end that the Crash Violation complained of Personality). <br /> <br /> He was angered earlier.
