Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in their films ... <br /> <br /> 'Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata' is a novel that does not accept a classic story. Which classic tale, please? <br /> <br /> Certainly, "Lion King" is, of course, <br /> <br /> Yep, if you see that Disney is never a short thing, that is narcissism. <br /> <br /> But this is not a good movie. This is mainly the story of "Lion King" from Timon and Pumba's perspective. <br /> <br /> Therefore, you have to know what the story of The Lion King has to do. <br /> Anyway, I was watching and thinking on a level. "Oh, my God is so naked ..." and at another level I have a ball. As the majority of the humor is foreseen, we know that Pumbaa has two beds, one big for Timon, and one for Timon, one of Timon's greatest nanoseconds. But it does not bother to be cheerful, while IMO means "Hakuna Matata". <br /> And a warning note: there are some fart jokes. Seriously, did you expect something else in a movie that Pumbaa was at the center stage? However, the jokes of the fart are increasingly good, and even provide the most intelligent. <br /> <br /> The return sound is great. I'm surprised that some actors are ready to go back, with only a few or three lines (if lucky). Hope Goldberg is particularly nice. <br /> <br /> Music is also great. Initially, all the 'Warning Rhapsody' from me 'Digg Tunnah' (a song cut off from The Lion King) and an adaptation that obviously improved in this embodiment leave me to the music <br /> <br /> As a result, Timon and Pumbaa are awesome characters, and Hakuna Matata can claim to be just an excuse to see in a variety of entertaining and diverse situations. so be it. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <strong> "King Arslan 1 1/2" If you've seen 'The Lion King' too many times. Especially if you are thinking now, "Do not be fooled, there is nothing like the Lion King's many times to see!"
