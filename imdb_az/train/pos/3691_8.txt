Not all of them are close to the sum of the shares. No problem. This film is made up of the most diverse creators of our time and some really famous names. The sections are prepared around the same theme, "Love in Paris", but the similarity ends there. In fact, given the fact that the approach to the theme of all these different filmmakers is in many forms, we can still feel that we are watching the same film. No major effort has been made to make a comprehensive whole. This buffet has a great deal of ingredients, and I'm happy that nobody tried to put them all in a bowl.
