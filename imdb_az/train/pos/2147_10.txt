I lived in Tokyo for 7 months. Knowing the true nature of long train commutes, and really enjoying this bike, of course, is a bike ride from the train station, soup stands and other similar scenes. The film, which is painted in vivid colors, has aspects of Japanese life, but there is no need to speak Japanese to use it. The director Suo's tricks were subtle; By pointing Tamako Tamura with a soft filter, I pointed to her tilt as a small twist, but most of the directors' designs were so sophisticated that I danced and danced with her characters. Or he cried. Or he laughed loudly. Beautiful. A +.
