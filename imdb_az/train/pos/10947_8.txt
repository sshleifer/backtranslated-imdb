The Sarah Silverman program is very similar to Sarah's own stand; It may be that you can not get your heart. In fact, though most people will "win," it does not mean that they will evaluate all of them. This is a very polar and one-dimensional show, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you can refuse it. <br /> <br /> If you like this after 10 minutes, do not overdo it since every episode is as good as last. <br /> <br /> Like all shows, it's not perfect. Personally I love the program, but there are many big mistakes. Racist songs are funny, but unlike Silverman, I also had a problem with "Jesus Christ". Silver seems to give a quota for the song to the episode he needs. <br /> <br /> In short, this show will appeal to some of its fans. Monty Python, Dick Citizens Brigade, and so on, this is nothing. I can watch Monty Python all day, but as I like this show, I can not watch for more than half an hour at a time. Very fast straight. <br /> <br /> The recurring value for this show is also small - the second time around the episode is pretty laughable, and the third time, in my opinion, is not boring. <br /> Very funny. Give a shot.
