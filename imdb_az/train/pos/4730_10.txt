The story deals with Jet Li, who has to fight against his old friends. But there is a problem, friends superfighters. The film is packed with blood, super motion and eternal best stunts. And Lau Ching-Wan is a great actor. Of course the movie is typical HK-Fun.But I love it! "Black Mask" is not cut off in Germany.
