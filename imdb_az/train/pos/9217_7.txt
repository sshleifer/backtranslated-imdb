It's really a funny movie in Hollywood, just a gentle middle-aged woman and a touch of love, a symbol of funny love. Capomezza and Malacci are those who compete in an Italian neighborhood in New York. On the contrary, they end up extreme in taste scale. Their children remain the leading roles of church production in Romeo and Juliet. Of course, they are in love. On the stage! <br /> <br /> For this reason, the confusion and confusion that the parents encounter with each other and their children is played against the summit of Capomezza's magnificent tasteless house and their spectacular unhealthy weddings. <br /> <br /> Four out of four parent and charming young ladies, symbols, an unusual clever prophet, a simple speaking grandmother, a wave of waves and a "Lucky Roscoe" car rear seat and two pigeons motel <br /> <br /> The family names of the two families are part of this fun. "Capomezza" can be interpreted as "low eyebrows" and "Malaci" may mean "jammed snobs." <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive to Italian stereotypes, you will not love this movie. If Bette Midler embarrasses you, do not love her, because all the women in this movie see Bette Midler as Martha Stewart. The rest should love it!
