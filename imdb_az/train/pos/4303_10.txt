It's a perfect movie, a perfect cast and some great acting. I have not watched him. Particularly I love the character of Danny Glover and the scene of Kevin Clay's character, Simon and Mackin. Kevin Kline is so natural and his behavior is weak and often a manifestation. That is his very 'real' movie. <br /> <br /> One of the strongest scenes in the film is at the top of Simon's Mackin movie scene. The film also has a powerful message and, unlike the stereotypical message that the film is filming, there is a man who promotes a man's work in the audience. Instead, actors' emotions and situations give the impression that they are best communicated without words. And lastly, Mary McDonell is always as bright.
