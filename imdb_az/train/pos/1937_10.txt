I'm glad that last week at the New London Film Festival in 2006, "The Big Bad Swim". The festival highlights some of the best and non-core movies since last year. Big Bad Swim was selected for this simple reason, which was shot in and around East Connecticut. However, after starting a loan, I could only imagine how good the movie was The Big Bad Swim compared to those released during the festival. "Big Bad Swim" is a glamorous, attractive, accurate, and frequent classroom student with a few junior high-school students and the depth they do not see in the screen for a long time still look humorous to troubled instructors. As with juvenile swimming lessons, the absurd, interacting with character development and plot lines, works with the subtle and lovely ways I find. The field does not beat your head in one direction; more precisely, grows dry and at an instant as organically. I never enjoyed it. I have never cried. <br /> <br /> The hero of the film is facing "Old School" as "Napoleon Dynamite". Nisibe believed in a group of unknown actors and their dialogues were never unusual or attractive. Undoubtedly, if millions were not produced, the layout of the camera was not as sensitive and clear, but adequate and good. The highlight of the striptease club and the shooting technique were a more realistic approach to a similar theme scene in Closer. <br /> <br /> The shots that were lowered underwater pictures could have been a shot from shoulders. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that in an independent film industry, but I have to say it: I would imagine that until Big Bad Swim was distributed in one assortment. "Great Bad Swim" should be visible. If you have the chance to see this movie, SE! Frustration is not possible!
