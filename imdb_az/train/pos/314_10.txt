This show is a great history story. There is everything from cure, their treatment methods, religion, ways to hide the Jews, inspiration, the belief in African gods, the treatment of women, and the daughter. Even homosexual. Characters are nervous and Violante is concerned about this character. He is so desperate for his love that he destroys everyone around him. I am glad that they decided to re-instill. again. Although I would like to see an unreleased version. Xika became my hero. I have to use his power to help everyone who is looking for him. I love all the characters and have seen many people in this century. Every night I'm waiting for my Hickey. It would be a good idea to speak English in order for Americans to love him very much.
