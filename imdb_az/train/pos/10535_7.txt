the only word that summarizes this film is interesting. is a light hearted person with an understanding of being. bouncy (more in a way) and a little nutty. I will not call it a great and unforgettable movie, and the director's first movie is remembered as a "cube", but it is a good flower tree to watch on Sunday morning. Sometimes it is extremely frustrating, but I believe how it should be written. maybe a big movie might be a big movie or a very good case. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 6.8, "head" and "human nature" meet as "matrix"
