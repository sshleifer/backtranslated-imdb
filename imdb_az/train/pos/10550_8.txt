In fact, this movie is not Hollywood movie - it's original, creative, interesting, and humorous. Apparently, no one today really wants to see this kind of movie, with the most simple words, does not fit most of the younger audiences in the film. <br /> <br /> We wrote a review for IMDb for the Elderly Age, but even if there was a 30-minute break between classes, I had to give a special promise to this movie! In fact, nothing is about it, because the two main characters are nothing in the world of hatred. Here is the glow, the director will only be interested in how much of the work with most of the two characters and only mise-en-scene half a home and wide network, empty space. <br /> <br /> It plays a major role, plays a major role, but also plays a major role. <br /> <br /> I would like to write a little but spend a lot of time. But I encourage everyone and everyone to try this movie. <strong> <strong> <strong> </ strong> </ em> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> A very unique concept is a good demonstration, a powerful script, beautiful sound design and (quite) /> It's just a shame, few people know nothing about it.
