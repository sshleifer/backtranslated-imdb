This is one of the most favorite films of all time. I read and liked the book, but this movie broadens everything popular. The actor, especially John Voight, plays Mr Siri, who is a very mysterious character. This movie identifies a story path that ends up joining you until you've been together for a great end to everything. I love the way of the day, back and forth between the stories of modern day and Stanley ancestors. The story was written by Louis Sachar, but this story was prepared for the movie and Andrew Davis is doing a great job of managing it. Everyone who loves good movies is definitely coming.
