It's one of the best movies out there and tells you so much for television. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt gave such raw material performance. He played with a whistle-blowing police officer. It was fine when she left her because she killed another child. He is alone, so it happens. Talking about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber was very shocked as a serial killer! He really brought him to the dark world. Oscar was worthy. Talking about killing children, be scared! You really understand who he is! <br /> <br /> <strong> It was a real tension without fear.
