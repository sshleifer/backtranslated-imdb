The location of the corner in the corner can be found somewhere, even though it's exactly what has been said at the start of the Balta Street in Budapest. A small number reflects the average European design, but it can be a store around any corner. The film is not about Budapest or retail leather goods, but about the ups and downs of love reflected in most of the main characters. <br /> Alfred King and Klara Novak scatter their partners in their workplace, but their anonymous letters to each other are filled with hope and desires and romance, and the story is happy to bring these two aspects together. The owner of the shop, Hugo Matuschek, has trouble with his wife, only one voice at the end of the phone. Ferencz Vadas has a secret relationship. Ilona Novodny has a gentleman friend who takes her fur clothes. Mr. Pirovic's life was centered around his wife and children. Pepi Katona plays Santa Claus with a girl in Christmas. <br /> <br /> The scenario is a work of comedy and drama. <br /> <br /> Last night, the scene moves without staggering on stage. It is one of those silent films, which is simple but profoundly repeated. Dialogue reflects the notion of speech that has not been spread over these days. <br /> <br /> Everything is spectacular. The waitress in the caf√© and the police in the street are so small. James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play each other perfectly. She really gets into her step as an actor and gives a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sullavan was a great actor these days. Some of his other films are valued. Mr. Matuschek is as beautiful as Frank Morgan. The truth is moving momentarily. <br /> <br /> In some cases, gold and silver are bound to each other. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this is true in this case. Director Lubitsch presented a classic film, not from gratitude, but from spirit, charm and warm humanity.
