This is one of the best comedies! The writing of this soap parody is brilliant and you look at casting, pressure, and you will understand why it is so great. If you are a fan of Kevin Kline, he always performs fantastic performance and Robert Downey Jr is perfect. When you see this movie you are laughing, there is no sense of humor.
