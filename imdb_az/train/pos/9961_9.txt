Since it's really great, you have to give it a perfect rating. In a previous review, I did not know how this movie found itself on the bottom 100 lists of IMDB! This is absolutely funny! Other films - especially those who share the dance theme - can not hold these candles in terms of combination of high-level, convincing players and incredible dance routines. <br /> <br /> It's very easy and surprisingly realistic to finish the main story (not just about winning a competition). None of these key characters are in 2 dimensions in any way and it's very easy to feel emotionally depicted by the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> I love this movie for dancers and even more, those who can appreciate a strange and well-run story. Of course, that action is not perfect (what is the movie?), But it is cut off from films that use quite a few faces to hide the half-burned plot and / or non-substance. Actors and settings of this movie create a very realistic ride that is equally amusing thanks to the amazing talent of dancers!
