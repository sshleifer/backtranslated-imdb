I watched the subtitles as in Russian, but I'm really glad. The main character Sasha was cursed, with a deadly weapon, extending his body. He was unhappy because he was different, and his anger made him deadly. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally fell in love with a young woman named Katya, everyone tried to finish her in a deadly battle. <br /> <br /> <strong> It's not enough for lovers of the past Hollywood movie, but for those who like independent films. Kinda has an Asian fantasy movie.
