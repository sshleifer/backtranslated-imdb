Many of my comments and commentaries about this film are many films and performance by Clara Bow. Despite the fact that the storyline is typical of Clara's last silent, I still think a little confused and pretty entertaining. Clara is playing a happy Hawaiian girlfriend who can not stop anything to win the person he loves ... do not think this guy is not married! It is shocking that Clara is not surprised at daylight, but I believe that she lends a movie to the sweetness and the fun of the movie. Undoubtedly, this is not a bright storyline (quite typical, in fact), this movie is a great showcase of Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
