It's so cool to watch a quiet class once! Director Vidor is simply a delightful and even long time (at least until 1928) as a community. The story is about success and change in life. Marion Davies plays a girl who left her comrades in a small comedy studio as part of a larger "drama" studio. He becomes a great star, and the results are really moving away from the real world. For a moment he denieth the past. Revenues are simply stunning, of course, the scene seen by Marion Davies ... Marion Davies is the result of the studios and is not the result of it ... The first movie should have been here, to see the camera and materials coming back to the movies and real freaks here awesome If you ask me, you must!
