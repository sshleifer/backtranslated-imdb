Hunky Geordie Robson Green, Owen Springer, is a young doctor who goes home to be with his father. On the way, a 20-year-old woman falls to Anna and becomes her new wife, Richard Crane's wife. Despite warnings from her new colleagues, Owen continues to get herself to Anna to cheat Anna and Richard's marriage tomorrow. It is a romantic drama, a very humorous sixth and quick mind. The actors are perfect: the shadows of the "Prince of the Student" and "The Shattered Devil" are shadows, such as sly, but warm-hearted Owen; "Dune" glory is Annis and Green is a good match; The kitchen from the "King to play", like Richard, is a true threat to the hateful building, masterpiece for funny mistakes and snobbery Owen. This is a perfect triangle of love, and you are well-versed in knowing and watching, despite the weaknesses and disasters of our three characters.
