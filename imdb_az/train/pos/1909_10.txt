At first, I watched the Disney Channel in the English array in 8 simple ways and sat down completely. If we did not show them more, we \ 've been worried more, but the 2nd sold series showing abc. When I read John Ritter's death, I did not think it would start another series, but the 2nd series did not go back to the excellent standard returned. I hope every show can watch a thousand times, but they continue to show more demonstrations soon. Kaley Coco is my favorite character like Bridget, and it's also beautiful in Charmed. Rory is also good, he shares my name and Grampani. I will continue to wait for me to continue, so I hope,
