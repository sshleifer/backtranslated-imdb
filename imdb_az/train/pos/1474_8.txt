I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. As is sounded, this is a three-part documentary (each episode is about 50 minutes). Slovenian superstar philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zizek takes us through many classic films that explore the theories of sexuality, fantasy, morality, and mortality. Sophie Fiennes, directed by the very talented Fiennes clan (he is the actor for Ralph and Joseph). <br /> <br /> I think the DVD will be even more enjoyable. Because there are such thoughts to digest. Freud and Lacanne's analysis can be quite severe, and the whole series appears to be a little frustrating at the end of two and a half hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> obviously filled with Freydian themes. Hitchcock and David Lynch spend a bit of time in the movies, not exactly the ingenious masters. <br /> <strong> Zizek </ b> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Zizek liked it. comic and humor watching some of the films he had discussed with him when he was actually involved in a lecture while entering the actual scenes. So, for example, we see it in a motor boat sitting in the basement of the Bodega Bay (Hitchcock's The Birds) or the Bates Motel (Psycho). We can not say that his theories are not provocative. Even though I did not agree with myself, I was forced to think a bit deeper about the movies. What kind of work is he trying to accomplish?
