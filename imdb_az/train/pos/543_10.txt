This movie is the best horror film, bar - no one. I love how Stanley just emptied women into the lake. Judd Nelson's admiration for the long years of work, and he took me away. It's not a comedy, horror, drama and a romantic blend. Her filthy, yet charming appearance left me and then there. I will never forget his eyes. There is something about him, I can not describe it.
