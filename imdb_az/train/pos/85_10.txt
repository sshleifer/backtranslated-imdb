When explaining this movie with the red balloon in Birmingham Southern College in 1975, Both films are similar in imagination. Most of the film, its new owner, a small boy, is a happy swimming fishing boat while lying in school. A cat enters the room where the little and the bowl is, and as if "it starts to stop its prey." The boy goes home from school and tells his story that his follower will come to the rescue of his fisherman. The fish mixes with the cat and finally breaks through! The cat moves faster with the fish, slowly pulls its paws and returns it. <br /> <br /> The latter is remarkable both in Irania and in technical difficulties. <br /> <br /> It's hard to imagine how the 1959 filmmaker's technical skills were - it's a trick for 2003. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, look - be upset! And if * you find it, let me know that I can get a copy!
