"Some people on the door". OHHH, no matter how bad I miss this show .. but now we are lucky to have "Invasion". Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, there were all. If I had to choose something that I liked best about the show, I should have her "not predictable plot lines". His favorite actor was Lucas Black .. I love the emphasis on the south. I bought a DVD and my kids are also very fond of. There are some hot steam scenes. There are some devils. So if kiddos watch, I want to edit (fast / skip). At the Joss Wheedon level, there is humor with a lack of many shows. Mature males and adults are treated with hazelnuts. There are some additions to the DVD, but there is more. If you are excited and want to enjoy a great show, watch the "American Gothic" movie!
