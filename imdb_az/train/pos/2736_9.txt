The unique film is the best of all time. Actor, Script, Quincy Jones' account, cinematography, editing, etc. - Just fantastic. Most of the audience know that this movie is based on Truman Capote's famous book, The Family of the Kansas, (Clutters), a few young men who were mistreated by robbery. I have never seen a movie that has transformed a true story into a riveting movie. Actors have a solid side on our sofa, but the focus is on Dick and Perry and the law enforcement team. Beautiful Scott Wilson, like Dick Hickock. Hairy, twitchy and deprived of compassion, it's so seductive, fatty and intricate. Robert Blake, as Perry Smith, is also unusual, individually, sincere and cold. Who can put these features as an individual and get it from us? He is and is brilliant! The main points of the book are that these two very different sociologists have a connection to creating a critical mass for this kind of foolish and mischievous crime, and these two actors are working perfectly. Both had their moments in their next career, but these performances were high water marks, and this is the period of activity. <br /> <br /> The cops are very nice. Researcher John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are also great. Unlike contemporary movies that reflect the feelings of producers, strangers or weaknesses, it's a true flatfeet that's just strangeness and skill. They look realistic. I did not see the police really strong on the screen; I've seen the majority of the crime classics going out. This is really a kind of point of view. <br /> <br /> PARTIAL SPOILER WILL COME (this is unique because you know what the movie is, but I'm warning you for the note). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes from the best crime scenes and movies are polls - intellectual fencing games between the police and mano and Mano Mano. This movie puts you in the hands of the best quiz scenes you'll see in the movie. Explain that Dick and Peru are waiting and slowly fall, there are goods on the police. The police prepare the suspects to break their alibi and admit their confessions. This is the best you can see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without Showboating. <br /> <br /> In order to help translate the sad and horrifying angles of this real story, the ICB was shot in a true Clutter House and I heard the Libraries sang to make the actual feelings of the movie pupils. It works. They seem to be worthy, simple people. It creates a feeling of guilt and sadness. <br /> <br /> I will stop here. This is not a good movie, but it is one of the best films and is a spectacular display for every movie.
