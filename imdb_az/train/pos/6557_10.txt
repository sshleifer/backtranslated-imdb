I am a 53-year-old college professor. I went with my wife and my 12 year old daughter. We all filmed. The film is original, witty, fast paced and totally appealing. Assassination is a fairly easy way for a 10-year-old woman to follow, but she is interested in adults. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job, and the rest of the goal was good. My only criticism is that Los Angeles teams are not very interesting. They were functional, but nothing was noticed. On the other hand, makeup, suit, lighting, cinematography, editing and guidance were excellent. Overall, I thought it was a great experience. I was attacked by professional critics (almost all adult men). As you can see, there is something against movies that feature strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings give more information about this beautiful family movie about sex than anything else. I am a strong adviser to every child and every parent.
