This song sings. There's a drama. There's a comedy. There is a story. One of the biggest films in this period. If you can not enjoy this movie, you must either sleep or be in a kind of mental disorder. James Cagney sang and dance at the Academy Awards at Yankee Doodle Dandy; but better in this movie! James Cagney is at its best at BEST! Fasting with a linen! He is fasting with his feet! This is a continuous action. And the song and dance sketches are classics, especially the "Shanghai Lil". And the supporting castle is great; and the whole film is enthusiastic, fast moving and reassuring. Although this movie has been prepared 70 years ago, it can still be seen today. Of course, this film is Miss Ruby Keeler (married to Al Jolson). She is the perfect partner for James Cagney ... and Dick Pauel too! If you like, this is a movie to watch, well-timed, fast-running, full of dance and dance.
