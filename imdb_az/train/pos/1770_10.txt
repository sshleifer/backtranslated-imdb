In the preview, the "40-year-old Virgin" has a picture of another immature sexual image of 40-year-old Lonely Guy. The past bad experience moaned the enthusiasm for the point where women were completely prevented. And then it becomes unexpected: it becomes in love. In addition, there is a film about it and it's called "40-year-old Virgin". <br /> <br /> Another sibling collects grape moving figures that are featured in an electronics store with Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) 40, who are all exhibited to see all along the beautiful bachelor pad. She has a beautiful home cinema system and looks at two types of old-time neighbors, Survivor. <br/> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> </ font> is a cute, adorable fashion. This is a film that can be easily distinguished in the hands of a more transparent film. It may include infinite sex gags and jokes, but thankfully, this picture never stoops it down. Of course, there are sex jokes here and there, and even a few produs are directed to the gay community (in no way they do not want to be accepted as gay-bashing) because both of the characters are changing the video game ("Mortal Kombat: Deception" not the best fight for testosterone for children). <br /> <br /> As one of the fastest 20, McFarlane Toys collects action figures, and this movie is fun and touched in a way that I can never get a similar theme. In the theater, I could have been more interested in character than Andy Stitzer, because I was the only teenager in this show; All 40's were similar to that. A little arrogant, I know, but you ("you" italicized) is still in the afternoon "40 years old" <br /> Of course, Andy has never been sexually assaulted and has a "morning light" (any question stops) wakes up in the afternoon, and he is exposed to the pressure of his friends, the opposite sex. For the first time, when Andy was 40 years old, three friends and friends at the electronics store David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) for the first time, they all thought he was gay because he never had a woman, it could have been nothing but truth. <br /> <br /> Women in the Caucasus, a mission to drive Andy, help them all. But you know that such run-offs will only end in disaster, with Nicky (Leslie Mann), as it has been proven at one time, putting Andy at the worst drunken driving experience and thinking that everyone does not want to go and has a very creepy encounter <br /> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> Beth (Elizabeth Banks) works in a cute girl book store it turned out to be a sexual fiend. <br /> <br /> Trish (Catherine Keener) is a woman working in a store along the streets selling items on eBay for women. Hmmm. And with these beautiful-looking action figures, a huge financial payment may eventually go to that figure, which means he can do the job. <br /> <br /> Finally, this is a sex work we expect. Lonely Guys, who is dealing with a very real issue, is probably not something wrong to be a virgin, but look at the big picture: Want to become an endless single boy in many "Lonely Guys"? What we have learned in this picture is the essence of Lonely Guy. I do not think Andy should not go through a similar body (this is partly true for the website and other news, and blood was given after Carell's uniform). <br /> <br /> "40-year-old Virgin" was run by Judd Apatow and co-wrote with Carell, Carell, and Carell. Carell is sweet and human because it is not some layabout approaching this thing by closing his eyes. This is probably one of the cleverest I've ever seen and does not attack his characters with dignity and respect (many). <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin is really laughable, as Carell's friends are at the core level, who run away from bad advice to insult their relationships. <br /> <br /> Last, but I will leave you to watch the audience. Undoubtedly, if everyone can pass Andy and still have the power to attract a woman like Catherine Keener, then it's not right: <br /> <br /> 10/10
