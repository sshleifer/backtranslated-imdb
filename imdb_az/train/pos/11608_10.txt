This is a great movie. As I read other reviews, I am not alone with a tear. Tamilyn Tomita spoke with such skill and love, and he ended up sincere and memorable. In the hands of a small actress, his last scene seemed tall and dark. I'll guess that a movie will be done in a limited, limited budget. Cinematography is perfect and there are a number of well-known actors. The scenario is so beautiful, I can see why you want to be in all this. Finally, if you watch a list of long and long lists, you'll notice that half of Hawaii is about to take part in this movie and for a good reason. Soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely wonderful and gives you mood throughout the movie. I do not want to say the end of the movie "my complaint".
