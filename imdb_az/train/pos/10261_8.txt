First, it looks like it's a very bright and thought-provoking charming movie, like many other reviewers. At first glance it says that in the line of everyone who loves, something does not know anything about horror movies, otherwise something around it. If he went back after a movie, he did not mean that he was not really convincing, it was a low budget ipecac. But indeed, it was intended to frustrate the audience with all the shocking value (and all the imperfections were less noticeable in the original VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I've been given a high score because of this goal and it's a terrible (non-shocking) feeling, but I'm a bit sick and paranoid / pessimistic (I did not) For about a week I trust everyone because sorry and did not want to wake up torture)
