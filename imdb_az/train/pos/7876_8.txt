I did not like the same director Chandni Bar. <br /> <br /> I have not watched his other films. <br /> <br /> But Page-3 is beautiful. It looks realistic. Like Satya from RGV. <br /> <br /> The mentality of the above-mentioned society is a summary of the film. In the midst of all the illness, Konkana Shea, her protagonist, is difficult to maintain a normal life. Serious film is not to wait with children or wait for their wives. The 3rd page of the newspapers is a common place to inform the rich and elite side of the events. This page is shown in the movie, in which the business perspective is-3. <br /> <br /> Western culture has entered into a very high society in the Mumabis society. . <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> <br /> <strong>
