Nicolas Roegin's projects are variable to say at least, but not less interesting. "Intimacy", first of all, adapted staging: clear and quite 'room-connected'. However, he pays for the film more than once: the main themes are not explicitly presented, and more, it takes some time to approach the four heroes and change their role: Einstein, McCarthy, Munro and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein faces innocence over Hiroshima, but betrays the simplicity of sex with Munro; Munro is a patient who will be regarded as a bimbo and has an intellectual confidence; Senator McCartney is at the height of the witch-hunting forces, but a powerful sleazebah; The Princess of DiMaggio is not self-assured and vulnerable to violence. Each has its own destruction. Each character has an uneasy, abusive past, and a suspicious future. Gradually, obsession itself is a central subject. America's commitment to post-war cultural symbols and mores; <br /> <br /> In contrast to the theory of competition, the theory of the proposed unit theory, and, indeed, the rogue hero, all dreams and interactions seem to be unimportant. But these aspects of the physical universe (all quantum, trust me) influence us when it is applied to the means of destroying us. Monroe notes the principle behind a neutron bomb (not without it), not anachronism, but can be understood by a modern audience. Indeed, all the references in the script are delivered to a knowledgeable viewer: what happens to the events of the 50s and personalities, and how it affects us in the 21st century? <br /> <br /> This film and its scenario are either very clever or extremely transparent and ambitious. However, ultimately, it is unimportant. <br /> <br /> Long live and develop <br /> <br />
