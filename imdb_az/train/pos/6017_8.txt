There's no way to deal with 'Zabriskie Point' in a rational way, or do not try to describe it using the words and conventions you use for other movies. Because it's not a movie. It is a thought and feeling that cinematographers are transformed into a secular object like a movie. Instead of the plot we see, it is not the sequence of events we do not see in the movies every day, but when we hear a tragic story in the news, we imagine ourselves as providing. comrades We can see that people who have abstractions for us are the ones we know, but surely we've heard them in a book or on television or in one place. What will we see? Events. We see people quarreling, driving, and inevitably fleeing. Running alone is an intangible thing - it's a massive situation and the mass of a civilization that lets its inhabitants live lazily or in spite of human nature. Our players set up in Los Angeles in the late 1960s are acting in opposition to the modern existence and the actions they face. These creatures are empty hollow shades that can show any character that we can imagine if we wish. The actions taken may be criminal and irresponsible, even though the characters themselves are not criminals. They are people who want to return to a non-familiar, non-productive being beyond the norm. They are not happy or sad, but they achieve some sort of self-actualization when they are out of the suicide of modern life. They get real life in the natural world, though this is the next victim of modern existence. In the end, 'Zabriski Point' is the unification of humanity into the natural world. The most corrupt parts of the earth fit our understanding of progress, and we lose souls in the death of the human soul.
