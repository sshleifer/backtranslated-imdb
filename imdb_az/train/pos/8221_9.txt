Ani Impact is the fourth film of Dirty Harry's films, and one of the best features of these films is, in fact, a lack of quality after a movie. Thus Sudden Impact Dirty Harry Callahan provides an excitement throughout his lifetime. This time Harry tries to solve a number of offenses while striking. Harry always looks like this. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his people, slowly, deliberately and without fear. As the first film of Dirty Harry films to be shot in the 80s, Sudden Impact is part of the first three films that featured the first 70 films. This does not mean that quality is less. Bottom Line: Mix with weakness and action, Instant Impact is another decent addition to the Dirty Harry series.
