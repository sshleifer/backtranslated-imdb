After enjoying several very good ratings to the SUPERB point, I was extremely pleased with the movie. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to seeing some special effects at the outset and blowing me up like a lover, film, darkness, movement, anger, pain, sin, and very convincing. gentle and straightforward. Brian, I still bang up with your story and the effects of your special effects. You will go a long way, man. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari was awarded the Best Actor Award. Jr. Lopez looks like a kid in comparison with Kasadia. :) <br /> <br /> In general, the actor, story line, high-quality shooting and detailed effects, it was fantastic. I just want to be longer. I'm looking forward to extremely high expectations of hopelessness.
