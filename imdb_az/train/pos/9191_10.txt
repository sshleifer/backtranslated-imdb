Okay, I did not get the job of Aliens I watched for the first time this episode. It seemed as though I could not put my finger on it. At this time, the fires on the Costa Mesa television set my focus and I only helped write a post on the Inferno! However, let's see what has not yet been discussed ... <br /> <br /> TWOP's theory said that Tony had 7 back flights to get off the sinking elevator. Yes, 7 reasons, especially religious reasons, are a very important figure, but here again. I applied to Wikipedia with a bunch, and Dante was divided into seven levels? Purgatorio. Except for Ante-Purgatory and Paradise. (Things under the ladder ... Tony will not be able to get it.) <br /> <br /> Allegedly, the "casual" monk-slap field. As seen by the clergy, Tony is perfectly suited to the place that wants to get out of the Fire. When it comes to Christian trade (death, illness, and sin), you can say that she is disturbed and more hopeless because she is looking for a Christian paradise for her. Because he met the priests, "maybe these guys can help me?" He thinks. it is heard that other religions (such as Buddhism) are thought and another way can be "saved". Tony does not necessarily think of being a Buddhist, but Finnerty tried it (and got worse). The slap in the face says, basically, that Tony is not indifferent - at any rate, suddenly you can not cover Buddhism and you can not get out of here. <br /> <br /> Tony was worried about going to heaven first. However, at the "conference entrance," he understands that it will not be so easy. I've seen the driver's license problem because of what happens with people who have dual lifestyles and killers like Tony and how to hide from many people while lying around. He is "Kevin Finnerty" and can contact Quasi Melfi. He can figure out figures that can deceive some people with KF's cards like hotel receptionists, but the substitute can not get out of it. These helicopters - helicopters of paradise - watch him and everything he does. <br /> <br /> Although the KF seems to be a reminder of the infinity of identity, all theories "inFinnerty" could take different ways in Tony's life. Hopefully, along with the car jokes that attract Infiniti, there is no point in me. At this point, my brain fizzles out.
