I was very pleased with this movie, I watched it twice, and this is about something about a documentary. Music score, cinematography and sound are astonishing as you expect from an Imax production. Although it's shot for great Imah theaters, my home system looks beautiful and sounds. In fact, this would make your system a perfect DVD for demo. <br /> <br /> The topic is also very interesting. About Mario Andretti and his son Michael. Since he was the only person to win the championship, the F1 Championship, the Daytona 500, and the Indianapolis 500, he was an admirer of Mario, because he was the best race car in history. Scenario follows the path of two cars father and son. The first car was found in a chicken suit and Mario appears as a first-time passer-by and we continue to rebuild for the brilliance of perfection. The other car is Michael's new racing car and we watch the race after the race. Imax only gives the right spell to make car production fun and attractive. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, Michael Amoretti's team-mate at the time of the film's release, presents the film. <br /> <br /> After many years, the laughs and charms that he owns as his driver and his driver lend to the production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the scene of the race. Close the volume here! There is something about the music player that totally pops you up to 200 mph for a sliding and memorable experience. Wow! <br /> <br /> The last magic element is the humanity of Andretti's family. Mario Andretti, the god of the racing world, loves the father who proudly watches his son's career. Each father and son must see that they work together well. You can say that they have a close family. If so, we all have this experience.
