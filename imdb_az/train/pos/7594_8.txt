<br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk, Kung Fu Dunk, values ​​his values, played for laughter, but this is a great mix of Kung Fu and basketball. <br /> <br /> If everyone seems to be so entertaining, their production values ​​are very good, and here's where the modern China looks brighter than Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> The area of ​​abandoned orphanage grown in a kung fu school will be thrown out and then it's better to discover a superstard like a basketball game (and love and so on) - it's fresh, entertaining and entertaining. <br /> <br /> With great action and good dialogue, it's just something to enjoy - for all ages - and our money was one of the best family movies we've seen for a long time <br /> <br /> Please ignore negative reviews and give Duncan a chance - we were pretty happy - a good sports comedy movie.
