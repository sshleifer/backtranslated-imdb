A parent (Diane Keaton) finds a few minimum wages. When he begins to work, he is unable to support his sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), the next asthma. Then he goes to his friend and starts selling drugs. Soon, he is dependent on drugs he sells. Life, especially children, their eldest son, falls when he is threatened to learn the truth and abandon it. He struggles to save himself with the help of his children, but can he protect his family from drug lords who work on his family? <br /> <br /> Wow! This lifetime movie has one of the best players I've ever seen! Diane Keaton won a lot and his character went crazy, but it was extremely convincing. She is better suited to comedy drama than before. The best performance in the film comes from the Michael Seater, who plays his eldest son. It is still a young but perfectly responsible son in the family who wants to become adults. Her actor was particularly impressed with her mother's encounter with herpes. Colin Roberts, a younger boy playing a big job. <br /> <br /> It is worth watching a movie, especially Michael Seater and Diane Keaton!
