It is one of several animated films with Bugs Bunny and Marvin Martian, and includes a K-9 space dog. The Looney Tunes episode is very funny, pretty good cartoon animation (Marvin is very good in animation) and the plot is well-implemented. The last thing strange is that it is a bit boring. <br /> <br /> In this episode, Marvin was sent to Marsia to bring a living on the earth and bring it to Mars. With her reliable dog K-9, Marvin finds and soon finds another rabbit traces, but Bugs Bunny! She welcomed them with cure, treating suits and treating them with cure. I do not realize that this rabbit is preparing to carry Mars ... <br /> <br /> I offer this episode to anyone loving bugs Bunny, Marvin Martian and Looney Tunes. As you're beginning and ending with the episode, you're glad to see it. Enjoy the "Hare Hare"! :-)
