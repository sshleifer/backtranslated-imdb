I saw this movie in the sixth class around Christmas time and really excited to see it and when I hear that George C. Scott is inside, I'm really excited because I really love George C. Scotty! When I was watching this movie and film, I really started this work and when I finished, I really was amazed, I thought it was fantastic! This is the best version of Charles Dickens's classic novel I've ever seen! George C. Scott's performance like Scrooge is something else, I would think he was a perfect choice, he was Scrooge, he is definitely Scrooge! I've seen two different versions of a Christmas Carol, the other one with Patrick Stewart, but that's better! <br /> <br /> Actually, it's a great actor on this subject, and I thought the actors were incredible, everyone, souls, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, made everyone who could not find the best! The best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was absolutely fine! He does not necessarily think that Ebenezer Scrooge can identify someone better! I do not think everyone in the movie could have found the best! <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the exact match of the classic movie by Charles Dickens, and I think you really will agree that this movie is incredible! I probably have to get this movie on the DVD because I thought it was completely fantastic! I absolutely recommend you see this witness! This is a Christmas Carol, the best version of the tour. <br /> <br /> 10/10
