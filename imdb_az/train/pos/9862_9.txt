Finally, I have not seen the "ice age". Perhaps, as I have hoped to see a brilliant theater, not as funny as dead, it is not a bad word I can not say. Of course, this is not as spectacular as the production of Disney (plus Fox's first full-length film, CG), but I found myself on the edge of the tears as a great heart and in some cases (as seen from Manfred's past). But when I combined the baby with her father, I could not keep them. It is a seamless movie that goes through artificial and clich√©'s delicate lines and is able to bring even more of the best; the last result was one of the most influential animated works I've ever seen. Especially funny scenes from Scrat, many funny-looking characters that are growing up (and bigger in your voice) give you enough reason to go to the movie. With more Dodo scene, in 2002, it's my personal favorite comic scene. <br /> <br /> I'm honest, but for some reason, CG animation will go upstairs in the future. But if that means it's just going to be a movie like this (and may forget Pixar's creativity), at least I'm not really thinking now. 9/10
