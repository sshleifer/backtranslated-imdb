After seeing many Greek movies, I feel very suspicious of most of them. But after watching it, I was surprised. The film is great without a great attempt. You can not claim that the script is too big or that the photo is perfect or that it's a technical thing. This is a real story and occurs in places where there are places where God has forgotten in the countryside. The film looks like a fist in the stomach, and it does not really happen. Obviously, the Greek people's ignorance (ignorance) is a different thing. The problem with this man is not that he is not convicted. The point is that he is not one of these people. He is different and they do not want to (so all good things are transformed into a boomerang). Also, the people are talking about apathy, because there are some people who are opposed to the King's hunt, but they do not dare to express their views. Finally, you see that society is a religious hypocrisy and that it is trying to act as God, but at the same time you treat the King unfairly. It shows how complicated his feelings or beliefs can be for a system created by humans. Finally, you can get a good lesson from this very bad story, so you want to be part of this community and just want to be one of them. If you want to be different and even alone, I think it's tragic that the story (and not the truth) is real and that there is a call for everyone. There is no comment for the main actor because he is already given an award and I think his game is great. A little commentary to Hatzisavvas (played by the police), he played a number of roles, as a dinosaur, and I'm sure that this role was very easy for him, but he plays a great role that great bravo. Anyone who wants to see this movie in a good Greek movie is definitely coming.
