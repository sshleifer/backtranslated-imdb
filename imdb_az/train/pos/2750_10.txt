This is a US film. Foreign films therefore give foreign films. It's a great story of a man to find a cause in an empty way if he is late. Everyone can learn from Georges. He also shows how he suffered in the mind-boggling people's life and in a very realistic way. Like a classic film on overseas movies, this movie ends with a bittersweet, but it's just a better movie.
