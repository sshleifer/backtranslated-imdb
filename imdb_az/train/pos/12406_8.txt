A long prison prison for more than 20 years is reopened and ethane Sharpe (late, great actress Lane Smith) is once again placed as a guard. Prisoners are instructed to enter the old executive room because they are trying to fix places. It reveals a gruesome, aggressive spirit against the guards and the prisoners; <br /> <br /> "I know that it's no disappointment to praise this issue." Burke (Viggo Mortensen, the true fact of the true role) pushes the role of a hero. the film for the atmosphere (Rawlins was shot down in a prisons in Wyoming, but it raises the film to a higher level). There is a great foreboding sense from the beginning. Director Renny Harlin made his fourth directorial effort here; <br /> <br /> She directed her concert "The Nightmare of Elm Street 4" and started an impressive career in influential career films, artworks and horror films. <br /> <br /> There may be erotic symbols, but there is a skillful cast, like Chelsea Field, a young woman who has been reformed in prison, as Lincoln Kilpatrick as Cresus, a tired hardworking prisoner, Tom Everett as boring Rabbitt, Ivan Kane as the lasagna, gently speaking giant Tiny Tommy "Tiny" Lister, and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton. <br /> <br /> It's worth mentioning that Kane Hodder (like a charming soul) is an early-running loan that helps Jason Voorhees play in the "Friday 13th" series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Good special effects, Bad, horrible and entertaining for a terrific fan. <br /> <br /> 8/10
