I recently had the opportunity to see The Waterdance movie and I loved it. I really do not understand why he was named, because there is no dance there, maybe in addition to the dance clubs in the late striptease club. In the film we present to the heroes, to the disabled in the hospital. The story shows a love affair between a physically dependent boy and a healthy woman, this is a very sweet event. Unfortunately, you do not see the movies today. I'm not sure that everything is better than the agenda in the early 80's and early 90's, but I think we're getting worse in the film industry and can learn from old movies - old movies, something I've seen from 1920-1998.
