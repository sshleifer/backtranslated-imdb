"Good Place" is a great movie you have not heard about a lot. There are many great disasters and incidents, but this is a passionate love story. All this happens in less than two hours, which corresponds to today's standards. Special effects and suits are often good. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see Luiza Rainer accepting the Oscars for such a limited role. <br /> <br /> The performances of Asian and American-American actors are horrible. <br /> <br />
