There is an episode of The Simpsons, a joke news report, referring to an army training base, such as Killbot Factory. The comment here is just part of the jokes of a jerk, but the documentary by Patricia Foulkrod shows that she is not far from the truth. After the Second World War, the US military decided to solve the problems they faced during the war; many soldiers entered the battle and were unable to kill another person unless they were "mine or theirs". Since then, the US military training process has been to overcome all moral scenarios and turn warriors into killing machines that do not think like human beings. <br /> <br /> "Persistent killing" to develop their most extraordinary state. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this is not an antiwar movie. Although the war is in a very bad light, Foulkrod focuses on an environment, such as a discussion of the legitimacy of the war or of physical success or failure; there is a person who influences the transformation of a man into a soldier. The paradox of teaching one soldier to protect society is completely useless for them to live as part of society and most of the examples and interviews are the existing Middle East conflict. Foulkrod's past conflicts, especially Vietnam, are painfully cleansed. <br /> <br /> This is not a war, but is usually the cause of the war. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the film is divided into three parts; how he was involved in the army and his teachings, how to deal with the war, and what happened after leaving the army. After reaching this point, the main objective of this film is, of course, armed forced politics, to turn soldiers into an effective battlefield, but to implement all of humanity's policies. The interviewees describe how the camera recruitment process looks clean and straightforward, acts like words like "democracy" and "freedom", but when training begins, they are "enemies" and "killing" and "destroying". Soldiers do not think they should do what they order once. Because they are one step closer to going home, no matter what they order. <br /> <br /> But the main purpose of the real truth was that the US Army, the US military, returned to their homes and fought for their country. There is no real rehab that they return to the soldiers, and many have to go somewhere that they can not afford to do and see in their homes, and most of the policies appear to make sure that no legitimate responsibility for the military's psychological impacts. soldiers take away. <br /> <br /> If there is a defect in the film, Foulkrod does not try to show another side for this argument. You will have the impression that every soldier going to war will return with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Would it be interesting to see something? less liberal upbringing, and how the army has taken on training and policies. <br /> <br /> The Caucasus is often referred to in the course of the war the warring side.
