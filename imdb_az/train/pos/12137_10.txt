How beautiful is this movie! I have seen him for years and has always been written with him. The cause of the film's revision is, of course, the arrest of young Bette Davis. She does not only steal every single scene in the home, but she's been made in the house studio, at Warner Brothers (which is part of this movie), made in beautiful and better pictures than any of the movies made by RKO Radio Pictures. She has very embarrassing makeup and very attractive hairstyles and oh, it enjoys a lovely big eye (especially in London's Soho scene restaurant scenes). His body was very crooked when he was young. Get a load of cheap negligee that Leslie Howard wears for a big explosive conflict scene. And oh boy, he is definitely a center of power on the stage. Howard is a little worried, but he's sensitive to the hero. Frances Dee really thinks of sweet, cute young Sally who loves her. Max Steiner's account is both charming and surprising. You'll have to see the version of this classic novel with beautiful demonstrations and thirty-one delight.
