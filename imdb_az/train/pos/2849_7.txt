I can not say that this film is a disappointment because I read some research before watching it and did not think it did not do so. According to Qafqazinfo.az, if you live in a city like me, you will know certain places and that the city should be more than just one place, not one of the main symbols. you will understand.

Of course, there are plenty of skits in the category of "good", but there are many, in fact, what brings down the film. Despite the diversity of the city of New York, despite the fact that the city has been talked about in many remote pots, it has never really been and has not been analyzed until the city's justice has been fulfilled.

This review is not forbidden to watch this film because everyone's opinions about art are different. I'm just a very uncertain guide to what you expect.
