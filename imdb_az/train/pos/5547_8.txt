<br /> <br /> A man killed in prison is certainly one of the best films he has ever seen. <br /> <br /> A man hanged in the assassination, revenge on those who accuse him. He uses a rod to strangle his victims, and after a few deaths, the old man who steals the wreckage also disappears. <br /> <br /> The old man's grandson takes on a ferry and falls in love with one of the local men and decides to marry. <br /> <br /> This film has a very foggy atmosphere, and it is very creepy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> > <br /> <strong> Perfect. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.
