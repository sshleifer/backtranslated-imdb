Paul (Jason Lee) is just a helper who can deal with a kind of princess named Karen (Selma Blair). He chooses clothes and daily plans. At his bachelor stage, Paul is a little drunk, and some of them are pretty dancers for Becky (Julia Stiles) who return to the excavations. As they say, "nothing happened," but prayers wake up in the same bed. Suddenly Karen phones. He is on the road to Paul's apartment. Of course, Paul pulls Becky out of the ground, though his underwear is left behind. But there is more fun ahead. In the family meal at Karen's parents' home, Paul goes to Becky again, learning that Karen's uncle's son is. Someone talk about explaining it! But, instead, Paul chooses to create a stomach problem and hide in the bathroom. Karen will not learn whether Becky spent the night in Paul's place? And what will be the results? I'm sorry for critics who criticize such films. They need to be lightened, because this movie is fresh and fun. Of course, this does not mean that Lee is a real comic person, Stiles is a charming beauty, or Blair is a beautiful, but naturalistic fianc√©e. The rest of the castle, including Jury Brolin and Julie Haggery, is also beautiful. The appearance of the movie is as beautiful as the suits and Californian settings. Best of all, comedy is creative and inspiring, creating great laughter for the audience. In short, if you want to tickle the funny sounds, take this movie tonight. This Academy Award can not be a material, but it definitely provides a good day to turn it into a good situation.
