Smallville's special episode is the best episode ever since it's been merged. This is a great many reasons. For example, it returns the series to some roots. Lionel meets Luthorcorp plaza office in Metropolis, not for a long time. This room has not come for a long time and it brings back many memories from a small past. <br /> <br /> In short, Lex talks with Lex are always commendable. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasant return, this is Bart Allen (aka Impulse), AC (aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone (aka Cyborg). Only when Steven Deknight comes together with former justice lawyers, he mixes them with a small form, and feels like the length of a movie. <br /> <br /> From here, the main story is the Green Arrow League, attempts to shoot at 33.1, Bart's capture, Clark saved him and delivered to the kingdom's realm. With a good blend of all good and elegant, secretive, movement, speed and motion. Oh, and there are a number of new upgrades to the Cyborg justice league character :). <br /> <br /> Music makes the episode's work very good. If you remember correctly, the first episode was Steven Deknight, from the 4th season of the director, to Agless. It was a mediocre episode, but something felt from the ground. Perhaps, music, or player, or clark say, "you did not find us, you found us", people who are prepared have lost their faith in the formula. <br /> <br /> Steve Dekkoy just saved himself in this episode of justice. <br /> <br /> There were few issues about the justice that said it was less than 10. First of all, the Ridge Facility exposion from the very unpleasant speech of the Justice League. If you say Green Arrow and Cyborg get into the Oliver bike, it would be so cold. Clark and Impulse have evidently escaped and swam in another route of irrigation. Secondly, the first is not as bad as the first, but Green Arrow, saying "let's get rid of the world," was an incredible cheese, leaving just 2 points out of 10. . It made me crazy. Talking about performance, music, direction and production values, these processes will aggravate the deficiencies, and this is one of the best episodes in history and maybe one of the best episodes of the season. <Br / <br /> From 7 to 10 ...
