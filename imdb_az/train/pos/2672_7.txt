The "Hope Travel" explains the odyssey of a poor Turkish family and hopes that they can despair when looking for prosperity in Israel. Although this Oscar-winning movie is well-designed, it's not incomplete and has many non-objectivity. More than 1.7 hours of the movie's over 1.7 hours of work goes out of the bus, goes out of the bus, goes into the boat, leaves the boat, goes into the van, exits the van and so on. better spent or completely abandoned. The story has a predictable outcome for those who have knowledge of the common offenses of trafficking in persons, especially those of illegal immigrants. A precious and reasonably entertaining watch but much appreciated.
