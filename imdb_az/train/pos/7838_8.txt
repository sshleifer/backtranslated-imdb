If you are a fan of a T-Rex / Marc Bolan, I recommend that you check it out. She shows Marc Bola, also a whimsical side of Ringo Starr, which allows her to spend some good time to take some of the scenes that are not part of the concert. when only a talented musician is shown to people and at the concert, both the carefree and the professional cliffs and the screaming daughters surprise. While watching him at a concert, you know that a rock star is a work, but some great songs, such as Elton John and Ringo Starr, appear in some live music. True, I've seen that there are a few missing songs, but can not have everything like an album. I bought it in 2006, but if I knew, when I went out in 1972, I would buy it a couple of years ago. Sad and strangely, a man with lots of songs about his love for cars will not learn to drive any car and will die in a car accident!
