This is a family movie for some people to turn off automatically. As you can see, a large number of people do not want to see films that do not lose their arms and legs, do violence, and are not exploited enough to fill the New York phonebook. This movie is not one of them. It's a clich√©, a formula, but it's fun. It does not want you to think about it, it does not require you to accept the movie. It's just a good thing to do, that is to stop the two-hour swearing and use the adventure. Casting is not good, it's not great. Another commentator, John Williams, stressed that the ballot paper was simply excellent. And it was even more convincing that many films were filmed in Huntsville at the real space camp. <br /> <br /> The original version of the movie was postponed for a few months due to the Disability Charter Service disaster, but played at the end of the film, helping many young people dream back into space and lying in it. So sit with your children and prepare for pleasure.
