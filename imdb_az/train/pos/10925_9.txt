I love this movie. I can watch it on a regular basis and can not repeat it. I guess it's one of my criteria for the big movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. It provides us with 6 characters; each one has a very unique and very deadly unique kung fu style. Each of these characters is prepared by the same master, but their identities are kept secret from each other. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How will the last student find other poisons? How will they know what is bad? What is the answer to these questions? <br /> <br /> We went to fight each other in the poison. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Kung Fu movies do not want, this is a good movie. There is nothing better than this.
