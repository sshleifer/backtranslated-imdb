Cheerful movie. I saw this movie in 2002 at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival and laughed from beginning to end. The player was gentle, but very funny. I'm not completely sure about the "Real World" reputation, we do not come here, but the film keeps it without the idea of ​​this show. Heather B plays in every stage, especially when she moves with her rarely speaking red co-star. Be advised. I would like to see a future video / DVD in the future.
