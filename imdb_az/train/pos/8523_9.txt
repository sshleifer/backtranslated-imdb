Since the third grade, I've been an admirer of the book, of course, watching the movie, reading it later, and watching the television show. It was a good show, and now I am enjoying the show as one of the elder ones. The only problem with that was the lack of a book. For the first time I saw it, I was so upset that I closed it. But this book comes from a girl who is a first. But after a while, I decided to give you another exam and I did not see the book (related to Harry Potter movies). The series is beautiful! Cleaned up and something everyone could use was just the right amount of comedy to go on with everyone. Very nice! Clean and beautiful!
