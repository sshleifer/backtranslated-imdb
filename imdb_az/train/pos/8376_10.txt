It's one of the best movies out there. Perhaps cinematography was not the biggest, but an excellent plot and concept. It is great for time and bright and creative ideas. Something different than normal movies and entertainment. One of my favorites and recommended for anyone who loves creative and creative films. The actors who fought in the aftermath of the World War II and in giant robots showed a great performance and appreciated all that. These sets are amazing, simple, and work for the overall look of the movie. It's hard to find this DVD on the DVD, but also on the VHS. Check out why I love it since I left. No basic flick and it's not like I've ever seen. Take a look and think like a kid. A great look and a very entertaining thing.
