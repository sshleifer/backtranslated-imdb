Okay, I'll admit it - I love a goof-ball and sometimes a really foolish comedy. I have seen more than any other place in the world by Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut, but still does not want to be complicated, but I have a mild place for just a funny dopey comedy. Several instantly filming films start with MONTY PYTHON and HOLY GRAIL, UHF, REVOLUTION ME, STRANGE BREW and Bill and Ted. <br /> <br /> BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is not as beautiful as the original Bill and Ted movie, but still great fun. Also, unlike the original one, it's really a reconsideration. I remember not to love the film for the first time - it is likely that the other film put such a high standard of laughter. But every time I see him again, I'm surprised at all the big things - especially those who are dealing with Grim Reaper. Incidentally, this multiplier differs from Bergman's SEVENTH SEAL! In addition to many laughs, there are some great music in this movie - a movie is better than the first movie. At the end, Kiss's commitment is great, but the rest of the rest of the rock tunnel is not an old murder like De Nomolos. Great view for both children and adults.
