Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen and Robson Green! Wow, what a trio ... Okay, this is not Anna Karenina, but a good story of love, very well written and moves well by everyone. <br /> <br /> The story was also added to unusual guitar music. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> I'm from Lillie's (since the 70's) and Mr Kitchen's 'The Buccaneers' and 'Enchanted April' When I'm an admirer, Green ("Me and Ms. Jones", "Touching a lie" etc.), asking me questions - why did not I "see" do not look up to the last time? Of course, more than a person's chicken whisk 'is ideal for the lazy look of a rainy day.
