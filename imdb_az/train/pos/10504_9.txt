Or at least one of the best. This is a very entertaining and very nice game for the N64. Bowser needs his ordinary shenanigans (yes this is mute word but only one I can think of) and Mario should stop him again. This game is very entertaining and it contains a lot of nostalgia. The only bad thing about this is graphics that are terrific to today's standards, but everything else is fine (especially small mini-games that you can unlock) This is the second best N64 game (Best Conker Bad Fur Day) for any Mario fan or platform games I advise any supporters. <br /> <br /> 9/10 or: A
