Bug's Life is a very good animation feature. This movie is for small children, but it's also a great movie for people of my age. The story is about the ant named Flik. When he broke the meal for the superior locust, he opened fire on his colony. After throwing it out, you need to find some bigger mistakes to correct this mix. This movie is classic because it's a good movie, and it's Pixar. The animation is brilliant especially for the 90s. The story is good, but it's a little more detailed. The sound that sounds like the best animated movies is good. Listening to music is good. Nothing special, he was nominated for one of the music categories. Generally, this movie hit me like a thrill. A good movie for all families. I appreciate the 10/10 movie.
