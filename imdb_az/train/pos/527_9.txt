Writer / director Michael Powell is not surprised that since 1946, Emeric Pressburger's spellbinding fantasy is regarded as "Life and Death". <br /> <br /> This colorful romantic adventure after World War II would be only tonic to traumatize a nation that needs a good rise. <br /> <br /> Other patriotic war movies, The Archers' made it one of the most quirkiest, skittish and very patriotic. In English, baroque compositions, technical ingenuity, and many other strange things in multinationals, English can be seen in support of English heritage (Shakespeare, beer, fair play, moral behavior). <br /> <br /> Another 1946 classic, "This is a wonderful life," AMOLAD, opens with a huge boat, the earth and the heavens, and one of the natural noisy propaganda of this great, beautiful world. <br /> <br /> Later, he died in a British cockpit, diminished, flames and died with the pilot. <br /> <br /> Rapid fire exchange between the English pilot Peter (David Niven) and the American radio link is about breathtaking at about 5 minutes per hour (Kim Hunter). Peter, who was afraid to die, nevertheless dispersed abundant power, charm, and confession, and the warmest merger with June was linked to the exchange of 'I love'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter, Later on, the bike rides in June and matches the body immediately. However, understanding their mistakes, the high court wants Peter to be sent back and sends the French conductor (Maurice Goring) to take it. <br /> <br /> But Peter is obliged to live by the mistake of June and the Concierge and deliberately keeps the corner. <br /> <br /> The fate of Peter is ultimately the paradise court and American prosecutor Raymond Massey, and the jury consists of several dead. war heroes and luxury UK representatives. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < The Abstraction uses the framework of "The Staircase to the Garden" (the American Title of the Movie) twice: for the first time on the b / w, when Peter and his mysterious French guard upward, Peter's potential advocates between Abraham Lincoln and Plato. For the second time, a light-colored staircase ensures an iconic look in the movie class - frozen in Peter and June, their amazement eyes are stamped in the frame, their fate sealed. <br /> <br /> Proud compassion between Peter and June is never mild or curved; this is met with the nobility and the claim that couples are adequately married and simply have to persuade people to love, so they can keep them together. <br /> <br /> The French Conductor, who is able to keep track of his time and human organs, read Peter's 'Top 100 Game Tricks' book and lectures on Peter across his coffee, his history and his ugly advice. <br /> <br /> This is the first time they combine colors with b / w because they are visually inspired by other Powell / Pressburger collaborations? When used for paradise scenes, they have a happy quality and are both equally attractive. <br /> <br /> Outstanding scripts, in contrast to creative imagination design, are instantly spoken by the dialogue that has been written or failed to display. <br /> <br /> In 1946, "Life and Death" is one of the anti-life films. fresh and inventive, will enhance CGI's artificial effects during this period, even shaking their emotional wonders. <br /> <br /> Other shocks will reduce the need for mid-seconds and reduce the focus of dialogue to reduce the focus of attention to many audiences that are inevitable. Powell prepares a magic subconsciously-creating magic from the first frame and testes images without treating the implausible development of Peter's troubles.
