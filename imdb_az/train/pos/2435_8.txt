I did not think that an old cartoon would not bring tears to my eyes! When I bought Casper & Friends for the first time spooking on Africa, I wanted to see the very first Casper cartoon "The Friendly Ghost" (1945), but when I saw the next cartoon, "Good Boos To-Night" (1948) broke me! After seeing Casper's fox killed, I could not believe how sad and tragic it was! I have not seen anything like this in other Casper cartoons! This is the most fortunate! Unfortunately, he could not keep track of it. Like seeing Lassi die at the end of a movie. I know it's a classic thing, but I've been like old cartoon fans! If I wanted to watch something old and classic, I was watching a happy and funny thing! But when I think about this Casper cartoon, I think about my cats!
