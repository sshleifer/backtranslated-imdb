This movie was released in 70 years in my year of birth and in 2007. I have not seen the night before, I have not seen it since middle school. The 30th part was full and the player was a little stereotype, yet it was superior. Pearl S. Buck's story, Luise Rainer and Paul Muni revived the magic of chemistry. Mrs. Buck brings the novel, the Nobel Prize for literary literature, under the band of Sydney Franklin, along with a perfect scrip, the homeland of a peasant farmer, Wang Lung, a native of a local bride who got her father. In the story of Buck, Wang's success depends on his wife's willingness to listen to the love of the land often and to the land. In the end, he is the source of wealth, happiness, and immortality as his wife. Buckin's stories always had strong women who had a critical place to influence the outcome of the events in the world of feminist disaster. German-born Luise Rainer brings an indefinable but somewhat rural Chinese woman to life in the description of the Person. Muni is also a faithful, glorious Wang, who eventually gets rich and retained between the two worlds of the peasant. Among other classic characters, Charlie Grapewin can be defined as Dorothy Gale's Kansan Uncle Henry, Oz Wizard, Walter Connelly, as the First Son, Kanie Luke, not as Charlie Chan, as Kane Luke , you can watch your time again and never repeat. If this is really the case, this movie is classic, no doubt.
