No, not really, but it's really a very good movie and, unfortunately, a forgotten shot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> is well directed and the acting is great. Richard Widmark was good as a good man, but Jack Palance (better than ever) as police captain of Paul Douglas and shadowy Zero Mostel's baddies. Unfortunately, Palance continued to play similar characters in the second degree gangster or war movies.
