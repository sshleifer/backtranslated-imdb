Thomas Capano was not the director of Anne Marie Tom Carper, the governor. The Feds called it Clinton and asked the Fed to take part in this. I lived outside Philadelphia, so every day news was news. I read Ann Rule's book and saw the "City Hidden" section in A & E. Tom Capano was Megalomanic (Sp.), Uber-Controller and Monster. She claimed she loved her, but there was someone she could control. He killed him with the ultimate control, unless he allowed it to do so now. I think he is still losing money.
