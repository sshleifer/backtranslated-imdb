Very funny characters in many funny situations filled with spirit, absurd and Serbian mentality. The film is a great comedy, enjoyable, exciting, unexpected. The best point in the film: characters, then humor itself, stories and dialogues. Humor is rare in Serbian films, with "Serbian development". Thus, it is characterized by the result, good motivation, spontaneous and geographical. It is also sharp, intelligent and clear. Most of the films, unfortunately, had prepared humor (preparing a joke and putting it in the mouth of a character) or ordinary comedy, burlesque, farce. Part of the "art of immortality" is involved in this art. The little masterpiece is delivered to a difficult place.
