My husband and I liked this movie very much. The trainee moves from modern life to old Japan and at the same time is exposed to many actual issues. These symbols are realistic and detailed; this unexpected end came and his story was very refreshing. The story consists of mini-plot in the lives of several Caesarean residents living in a poor city. <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to everyone who is interested in real romance or life in old Japan. <br /> <br />
