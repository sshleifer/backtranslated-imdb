I can understand how Roman Polanski fans like this movie, and I can understand how some might hate it (Ebert was one of the few who could not understand why people did not escape from the theater). At first glance, I do not believe I can fall into both categories, but just as someone who is not able to get enough of the dark comedies of Kafka and Paranoia, the renter is quite effective for the time it takes. Or maybe not - if it were an episode of Twenty-Half Twilight Zone, it would be like Trankovski's coda (or who can be in the bandage bed, like repulsion in the treatment of the destroyed hero, but there is more uncertainty that the surreal character and <br /> <br /> It is interesting that the Tenant refuses to speak to other people: Polanski is a Polish embassy to Paris a housing bought by Simone Choule, soon jumped near his window and died shortly, but other tenants were the most conservative in terms of noise, and after several nights with Terkovsky's friends there were many noises, Polanski was a good-natured, but a little nerve renters, but it's a cab There is no such peace in the meat or armchair movement, the complaints are recorded against another tenant, but from it? Can you file complaints? This is not a very wrong identity, but a lack of peace with itself and those around it. Continues to spiral downward, like a dream in the middle of a terrible Terkovskiyə Polanski showing - (Polanski cycles, one of the most powerful scenes) and the wall to find the teeth of tension (and to me, they say, black comedy laughs) <br /> <br /> But anyway, In fact, nothing is a thing that never goes beyond the film. Terkovskiy's tenants do not do much of their extravagant design as a seemingly new mind-f *** machine: Paranoid is more self-fulfilling. At least one or two times I thought for myself, "Why did Polansky take the lead role for himself?" He is not a bad actor and has appeared in many films and games that are not in his direction. Ancaq kilsədə olduğu kimi və ya özünü öldürmək üçün həqiqətən çıxdıqlarını düşündükləri zaman anlayışında olduğu kimi, tərəddüd və gərgin görünən bir kənara baxmayaraq, onun çevrilmələri dil-in-cheek , özünü sınağa çəkə biləcəyini sınayır, tamamilə bunu etməz. In Polanski's case, I have seen at least a few other actors who, though resembling soft and frazzli Terkovskiy, have the ability to overcome the less sophisticated and influential personalities. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> At one time, a person drags him, especially when he eventually doubles the summit (this, of course, a small surprise)> and yet the movie-buff and Polanski fan supporting cast to try and more uncertain characters to earn the pleasure (Winters and Douglas limited through the characters rape as well) Polanski and Adjani as a Bruce Lee movie hot and intoxicated moments, or it's really drunken, or at a casual scene where a child falls near a fountain is very bright and self-contained. It's a very good movie, and it's something that can draw attention in the coffee after midnight. But the main movie? Not accurate.
