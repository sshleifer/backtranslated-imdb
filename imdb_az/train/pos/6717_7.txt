This documentary was very complicated and crowded, but at the same time entertaining, I thought it was very effective. I felt that I was doing a very good job, from the origins of the sport to the present day, but I still have a reason to ignore this movie ... <br /> <br /> I've been talking about the "correct nouns" of sports during the lifetime , so to speak: a lot in surfaces and especially in individual surfers to surf. The nature of the documentary film, the ideology of sports and so on. I felt a lot more interested in it. (Of course, it was covered, although it had a lot of time in the cafe)). <br /> <br /> For many people who are not completely nuts for breakfast, sometimes they listen to them and may even be drilled in certain places and special surfers. Though it is respectful for video clips and deep research, it would be better for those who do not have a neat surfer. <br /> <br /> Moreover, my biggest dream was very pleasant for me. they are still talking about a phenomenal and miraculous phenomenon in the history of innocent events, and that all the times when you look forward to seeing this beautiful, breath-taking event on the silver screen are men's life-changing moments, and in the end, but not the actual images. To hear these stories was too tantalizing to me, and then you can not see them. I understand the difficulty of doing everything, but I ask you not to lose as much as one event and then do not show it. <br /> <br /> Generally, I love watching a very interesting documentary; is a document that is not the best documentary for the above mentioned reasons, but a very striking and extremely exciting look and advice to everyone who has a good soundtrack.
