One of the best comedy series in the UK. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are great actors and performers at home with drama like comedy. Supported by writers Jeremy Dyson, Ably has captured a series of the most memorable characters of recent years. The smaller Britain diminishes its views as a poor imitation. Consistent original and groundbreaking, I am sure that many people hate to love these serials, but I do not believe anyone can have any idea about LOG. I have not seen a long-term movie, but I've heard good things and bad things, so I'll decide. The original radio series, LOG, was as innovative as the television series. I do not know if the TV series is sent to the US, but I am amazed to see how American audiences find strange English humor
