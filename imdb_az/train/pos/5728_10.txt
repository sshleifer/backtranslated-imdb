I was expecting a very scary movie for this movie. I was scared when I was scared. This is a fright film. This is like a horror film, just like a dull house, just like the spirits and the like. This film does not even show the majority of deaths that symbolize the fear of characters. I think it's one of the best things about the concept, not the house that refuses to go home. They respect, regardless of where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms, etc. When I read some parts of the overview, I was really amazed that critics did not like this movie. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 stars, because it was a movie of horror. He was afraid to oppose me.
