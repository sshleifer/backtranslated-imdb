I do not agree with anyone like this movie. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie a bit and I loved it when I still loved it. Sweet, funny and warm. And that is proof that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> Even though there were not many stories, it was still good. I gave him 10 and two fingers. <br /> <br /> Yes, your deepest desires and desires can come true. (Tear, tear) <br /> <br /> I love this movie very much. Because it was a nice little movie, and at least I was glad that just some people are happy about it.
