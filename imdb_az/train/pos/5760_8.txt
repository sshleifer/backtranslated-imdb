My wife recently ordered this website and finally came around to watch it. This is a general aspect. This is cheezy. It's incredibly invariable ... but that's a lot of fun. I would like to say that this movie was the most fun we have ever seen since the "Dead City's Dead". It was just like the old Drive-In Theater! You can tell that the man who shoots this movie loves all the horrible dubbing zombie films. The films that have become a movie have all the clich√©s and tricks, and this can happen because this is true. Cheetah factors are very high, runs and laughs! Impacts are rattling half a mile, and the goodness of a boy is in the hands of his chest, as well as perfect! It is good to imagine. There are not too many spiders, many or many. This film is embroidered by zombie films from Spain and Spain, as well as Italy. Because they go on stage like this movie forever. If you want Troms movies, poor B-grade products, then do not watch this one. A nice way to spend a Friday night!
