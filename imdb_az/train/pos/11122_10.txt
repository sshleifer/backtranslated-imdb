When I began watching this series of cables, I had no idea how dependent it would be. Even if you hate a character, let's leave behind what they've done so well, so why not react to disappointment, fears, greed, or deception. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why Adriana Christopher's misunderstanding, physically and emotionally understand, but simply read how many women can prohibit such behavior in the newspaper. Carmela has a dream house, endless supply of expensive things, but I am sure that it can give her a loving and loyal husband - or maybe not. So I look. <br /> <br /> It does not matter how many times an episode looks, you can find something you missed the first five times. Let's even watch episodes (late in the night with ads, but all language, censorship of A and E, back to the movie network) - when they are there, we'll be there. <br /> <br /> I also love Malaprop. "An albacore around my neck" Johnny Boy is my favorite. When these stones are included in our family words, it is a sign of my life. When the series finished, I packed all my DVDs and wanted a place to collect.
