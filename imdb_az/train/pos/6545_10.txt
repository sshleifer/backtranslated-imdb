I really enjoyed this movie. The majority of the cases are bad, but most critics think that a movie will be like an idea drama. There is a little drama in this movie, but the rest is just entertaining and entertaining. Do not forget that Julia Roberts is Pretty Woman, Emma Roberts, a beautiful young lady, and more. Emma was very entertaining to watch the role of Nancy Drew. It's good to see a new face. <br /> <br /> Nancy Drew is not based on books, but the story is still good. There is also a good mix of actors and supporters like Pat Carol, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook, and Chris Kattan. I was surprised that Disney did not release this movie. Some people do not like this movie, because it's not sex, violence and cursing. It's a good family movie and it's rare today. So take your family, watch this movie, and see how well you judge yourself. I do not expect results.
