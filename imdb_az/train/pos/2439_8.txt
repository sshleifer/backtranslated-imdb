My dear. "Oireland" and another example of religion. Certainly, we will sometimes see a little nonsense with some of the IRA's "hunky and ma√ßo freedom fighters". Well, after my loans started my first reaction, but I was shocked for more than an hour and a half. What a wonderful movie <br /> <br /> The story begins in the 1950s, the wedding day between Sean Cloney and Sheila Kelly. There is a small problem for them to marry in the Catholic Church, and Shia is a Protestant, but Sheila is old enough to give birth to a child, giving her a commitment to Catholic education and Catholic school attendance. The story that was set up in the 1950s - then Cloney's daughters went on for years to go to school, but Shela decided that the local Protestant school would go to the hate of many local priest Behor Stafford. Things are climbing there <br /> <br /> Let's put my cards on the table and, despite the Irish Catholic and Scottish Protestant heritage, have grown up to me agnostic and have been an atheist in my adult life. In fact, when religion comes, I consider myself a Marxist, and religion is a cynical weapon used to manipulate humans. A LOVE DIVIDED indicates what happens when self-assigning spiritual guards take on themselves to tell others what to think and believe. If Carl Marx sees this movie, he loves it and calls it a masterpiece? <br /> <br /> I would like to congratulate the film's worst adventure, thanks to the reaction of several rebels who claimed this film. They claim to know the precise details of what happened in Wexford County, and there is nothing to describe the flocks of Stafford and Catholic sheep as bad men, but she is not guilty of it. A woman in an Irish village in the 1950s thought that she would take hostages to bring her children as Catholics and then change her mind, and would not be the result? This is a warning against taking hostages and keeping them. Not only is it something else, but other people will disappear to ruin their frustrated lives. Andy Bailey, the oldest IRA man, is the only one who has not missed anyone and has every kind of moral sense. It is a change, not because it is a member of the former IRI. <br /> <br /> LOVE DIVIDED is a very nice movie that has a lot to do for itself. I agree with them. If there were any criticism, I feel like a TVM rather than a movie theater, but I believe that I live by it and look at everyone who thinks of the religious community's opium
