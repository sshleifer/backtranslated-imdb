Sammi, a metal goddess, Curr, tried to stop him, tried to ban him, tried to censor his music! Sammy Cure was supposed to play Halloween in his old high school for dancing. Now Eddie Weinbauer knew how his # 1 fan and sammi was and what he felt (or what?) Nuke, dj at the local radio station (Gene Simmons), Sammi's latest record was Eddie's only copy and ... Eddie's record back she is talking about the dead with Sammi and telling her what to do! Go back to the accusations of her school and hate her music ... Everything is working until Sammy kills! A great movie and a great sound track by Fastway need to see for fans of heavy metal hair band and just do not know what to play or if Fastway knows and they do not like it, they sounded a bit somewhat, and more known as Cinderella or Ratt There is also a style for the movie .. Is a movie a real horror movie? Well, a horror film depends on what's said, a real horror movie is not a killing or just a scary slasher. This is not a death movie, but it's a name-action, comedy, drama, tension, tension, so I guess should be a horror .. So, Rock N 'Roll, Rockin' s night in the middle of the night at your heart! " Sammi Curr and Trick or Treat is for you .. I mean, "What am I afraid of? It's just Rock 'N' Roll !!!"
