Ghost Story (New Home) is a terrifying story of fear. From the cowardly circle and the early seventies series of Ghost Story series. Sebastian Cabot narrates the beginning and end of each story. Remember it in the 1960s family trunk before the Family Solution? This special story is like the main characters of Barbara Parkins and David Birney as well as the main characters of the story. I recently saw it and was very scared! If you are alone, I will not be able to watch it. This story is not terrible, strange, or damn, but terrible. Barbara Parkins played a young bride. David Birney played his wife. Parts of artistic actors were very good. If you love the excitement stories that are not frightened, entertaining and terrifying, then you will love this little ship. I gave it a high rating. I appreciate this story.
