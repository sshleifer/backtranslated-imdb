This was really my favorite Scooby Doo series when I was young. Each episode was more of an outsider and the villains put them creative ideas (and even very intimidating and believed). Some of the best episodes have been "Canceling My Neck in San Francisco", "Twenty Little Lights Under Sea", "Hero, Bat and Ugly" and "When You Want a Star Maker." If you have not seen these episodes, please. This series was a mixed bag, though "Rocky Mountain YIIII!" There were other episodes that seemed to be the same kind of approach. and "Scooby's Ransom". Like the previous series, it is a very good place, an exciting story and a bright look. Everyone says it would be better without Scrappy Doo. The character is tedious and explained the story.
