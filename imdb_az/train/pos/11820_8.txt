Story, if I compare you to Dark Knight, do you compare me with a 19-year-old comic-fiction movie with 5.9? Just to get your attention. Everyday, I meet only the latest bloggers who are complaining about the good movies that I know. Looking and exploring old movies, especially those with good artistic values, is not a bad thing. Dick Tracy is one of the easiest to use technology. <br /> <br /> Negative assessments mostly complain about the DT's messed up story. But it seems to me that the line of story is quite clear, and then I had no problem. I did not see comic books, but I'm not a great comic fan of the US, but I appreciate the top-level movie shootings and speeches. Maybe most of the expectations mean that the story was too high. But if you had a movie with Madonna and Warren Beatty, what would you expect? There were some scratches on my head and could not help but wonder, did we see the same movie? The main role, though not as mature as it was, was to attract her and attract the audience's enthusiasm. Madonna's "breathless" role in her charming role was more expressive, but added a lot of entertainment to the story. Al Pacino was very funny and very strange. Apparently, he was brave enough to shake the successful roles earlier. Scarface, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro, can see a hybrid hitting our stomachs to make us laugh. <br /> <br /> For me this is not bad at all. The surreal feeling really took me.
