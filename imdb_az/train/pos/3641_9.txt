There are many things in this movie. This is a story "I feel good". Symbols and actors present similar, realistic and subtle performances. Most importantly, I believe that Dennis Quaid knows how to capture and throw a baseball. Robert Redford had a good look at "The Natural" and "The Natural" for the "Love of Love" and "Bull Durham." "Big League" Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen <br /> <br /> Many previous baseball movies, even stories, have revealed such a deficiency. In Stratton Story and Strategic Air Command, Jimmy Stewart believed that he was a professional baseball player because of the overweight, non-athletic, other family and physically strong stars (such as Gary Cooper, Lou Gehrig, Robald Reagan and Grover Cleveland Alexander Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean), also demonstrated a baseball capability that will put on a "picks-up" Sunday game on a picnic (coed and even if his uncle's presence). <br /> <br /> Qaid's high-level team squad, both attending its attempts with Devil Rice and with two small leagues and players in the American League, is all right. The parties are convincing and capable. Additionally, she is an exciting actor who always provides a talent and a proper character (except for some of his "top-of-the-scenes" and Jerry Lee Lewis's description, his enhanced accent). But here it is definitely targeted, and this movie, like "Naturally," is as good or better as any of the genres "9".
