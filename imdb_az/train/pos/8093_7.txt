My friend Peter Jackson thought of watching the cartoon after seeing the King's return. I finally bought it from e-mail, and I immediately thought it was necessary to start from the beginning. In fact, it was not as bad as I thought I would be. <br /> <br /> This animation was good for the time, they used a unique method to mix animation with animation to create some interesting imaginations, and the person calling for Frodo sounded like Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> The most adaptation of a book, but trust me, I saw a lot worse. Both Fellowships and Two Towers jump out of a two-hour film and many things go. Definatley, the price of a watch, can love children, but there is still no comparison with the absoutley Peter Jackson trilogy.
