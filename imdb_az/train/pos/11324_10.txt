<br /> <br /> I was watching a long time ago, but when I recall the story when I heard some music from this animation, it was a wonderful thing. animation, characters and the feeling I bought while watching and forced me to cry (such a happy, sad feeling). <br /> <br /> I have many ideas about the love of my husband. <br /> <br /> My wife, I had to conduct several studies in the end (after a few expeditions) and find all my answers and more. I love how the historical ensembles fit into this animated film, it was nice and just wanted to explore me much more. (I have always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime) <br /> <br /> I think this should be a long series, but if it is busy with it, then it's a nice way. <br /> <br /> It is recommended to anyone who loves emotional anime with a good story, well-built characters (some mysterious) and a little fantasy action. <br /> <br /> Also, it's based on this H-game but there's nothing inside that, and I really do. (I have no problem with my age anime, in most cases I prefer it)
