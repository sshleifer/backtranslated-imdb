Cinderella .... <br /> <br /> When I saw this movie, I did not look in the last five years. It remains magic. There is something that contains this story book, the songs are entertaining, and I want all the secondary characters. The slaughter of my sisters is perfect and evil. Then, all Disney's most magical, dresses make dresses and you know well. All four of Disney's princess films are great, but this is a charming magical experience, look and enjoy. Oh, and, of course, Cinderella is the main character in the film. <br /> <br /> If you think, Disney films can really lose their charm. Elene Wood and others have such a sense of the movie, they just can not help but smile. <br /> <br /> They say that the moral dreams of this story have come true. Certainly, in the real world some believers, others are hoper. In this movie there is another magic when his rainbow comes smiling. <br /> <br /> Of course, those who are ... Cinderella
