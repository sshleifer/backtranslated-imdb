I watch many movies well, badly and indifferently; <br /> <br /> Let's also note that in the US for several years I enjoyed a movie I have never seen before. Graham Greene, of course, has translated the film into a "Thin Man" and even fewer cars in such masterpieces. The "Hidden Agent" is one of these small tools, but despite this, Bacall and Boyer's drawings (English and Spanish) and English and Spanish, and two causes of any chemistry, despite the irreparable direction. In some cases, this final "problem" actually works in favor of the film, because the reality of fascism and capitalism in the killing of one person's tragedy can be exaggerated? The most attractive part of the film comes directly from the psychology of the guilty spirit of direct Greene's complex and film. Someone know that deliberate pacing is boring here and I understand it. But I did not find that plodding is detracted from being a claustrophobic world. Despite being immoral, I had to look at it (although Boyer is in a normal position, though he controls the world with weakness, tragedy, hope, and gorgeous voice and eye-catching glimpse) the subtle hopes of a person against the world of oppression and money compress What is the thief? What is love before death? What is the end of profit and the commencement of exploitation? The film does not rise to the art level and thus can not hope to answer such questions, but it is more than just fun, killing and crimes are very strange. The fact that Glitz does not talk about "bubble," this film's "leap" helps to make this film very valuable. <br /> <br /> Well, there is no happy end to the end of history.
