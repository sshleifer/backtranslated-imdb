If you love animal films, this movie will ask. My husband loves animals and animal films, especially in this movie he loves parrots. It was directed against children, but laughed most of the humor. The French fashion character made me laugh and added a scratch balance. This Disney movie, happily, happily surpasses your family, but I'm making the theater positive.
