When I was a kid, I really liked this movie. I cried every time I watched it. It was not strange for me. I've been completely familiar with the characters. I would still like to see it (and hopefully). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was really in the fantasy world. And I was film loooong. Did I see the sequence and mix it up? The move I thought was strong. I like Jack Wilde. It was the first time I saw a 10-year-old movie (when I first saw the movie in 1970). We can reminisce these symbols alive. The flute was absolutely convincing and I still feel bad trees. "Witchy Poo" I would not want to go his way.
