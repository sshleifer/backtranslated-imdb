I liked the movie, but as everyone said, there were some bits that were not well developed. I personally thought that girls had been vapid before they went to prison; Of course, they should be innocent American girls, but still ... I did not say they should have the best friends. <br /> <br /> Therefore, those who have vision in the assembly were very worried about how they captured each other. <br /> <br /> Then some parts are very uncertain. The nature of the Danes can be quite understandable, but we can see how that can happen. And why did Manat, who had a very negative expression after putting the camera bags in the cabin? <br /> <br /> In a word, I thought you were offering something, but nothing happened. <br /> Besides, the movie was great. I cried when Claire Danes was guilty; <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
