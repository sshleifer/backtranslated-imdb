Carol Richman's assistant, Scott Henderson, is an engineer who works as his assistant when he speaks "Kansas". This shows us that Carol, played by Ella Raines, is about to be a baby in the woods, as in Manhattan in the 40's. Outside the city, only one woman would have taken a shady bartender to a subway alone. Even such a loyal girl could have come up with such an adventure. <br /> <br /> Robert Siodmak has directed this film very well. It is a shocking one for those days, which shows an opportunity that brings the story to a very genuine sex. How can Scott take another drunken path in a musician's orchestra with a mysterious woman with another unusual hat? The drum, played by Elisha Cook Jr, played tremendously, and did not conceal his desires for none of the women sitting in front of the music scene. This was, indeed, an open invitation, primarily the story's "dream woman" Fay Helm; <br /> <br /> This is a movie that resembles every single audience. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that starts with this start. There are some things that can not be disclosed here, but it keeps the interests of everyone. The murderer does not appear until the end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines was an actress predicted by her expressive eyes. He fights against more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, who works on Hollywood's New York City scene, has never found the reputation she deserves in the media. The suspect acts as the best friend of a person. On the other hand, Alan Curtis has come across as a man, when he draws on, accepts his fate and only survives the endurance of a woman who loves her secretly. Thomas Gomez, as inspector Burgess, is active as a detective who doubts that the person who committed the crime was captured. <br /> <br /> This movie is not disappointing.
