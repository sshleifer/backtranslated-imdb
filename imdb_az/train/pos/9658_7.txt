"Bride" creates a lot of ideas among contributors. Certainly, this is a film that waits for the expectations and, in a way, promises to take a gay life, as if it were away from the word introspective in the spirit of a young man. There is a way to stay with us even when the movie ends. It is a characteristic investigation that a young person communicates with a very different person in comparison that Mathieu will abandon mixed, harmful, and depression, as long as he does not hope for the relationship <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the movie, maybe stop reading you would. <br /> <br /> The film's director, Sebastian Lifshitz, has a look at Mathieu's story. Most of the viewers in the film seem to be different, but there are some unclear instructions that can be seen retrospectively. The story is also described in flashbacks that some people can watch as they watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Cedric is an affair of Mathieu's love for Cedric and the end of his life, until he succeeds a charming young native Mathieu. She loves her. Mathieu also feels attracted to Cedric. Saying to Cedric Mathieu's family about what he is doing for the school, we realize how different the young people are. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to be an architect, Cedric finds beauty in the abandoned area he has taken. <br /> <br /> Mathieu talks about the importance of keeping her career wisely, when she goes to her mother. Mathieu reads Cedric's reading of the book. He will explain in the future that both of them will be together, and this is true. Mathieu seems to have learned his lesson. Cedric continues an indefinite life and tries to take his own life. <br /> <br /> When you go to work at the Mathieu bar, there's a part of the movie, but there's a moment in the movie. We look at Pierre, the young man who slips out of the glasses and spreading the bar often. So if Mathieu Pierre is looking for his house, it's hard to imagine. However, Mathieu clearly saw the way he was interested in Pierre. Pierre and Mathieu, the last scene on the coast seen on the sand, have a hopeful sign that they will be better off watching a child, but knows that he is near his father. Jeremie Elkaim is one of the most complex characters in Mathieu's latest films. This is a young person who is difficult to understand at a simple level. Mathieu first suffered from parental separation, and then suffered from depression and Cedrici's loss. <br /> <br /> Stephan Rideau, also seen in other important French films, is equally as Sion Jeyrik. <br /> <br /> Selling Sebastien Lifshitz tells the story of the complexity of the movie "Bride Undone".
