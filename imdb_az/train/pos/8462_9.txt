I recently just watched three episodes of this episode, and then I was amazed at the still-flawed animation and slow, but thought-provoking movements of the story. <br /> <br /> To this day, the Gundam epic was very cool and what was the previous series was a stylish satirical way to talk about the mistakes. war, and necessity to have power and power over everything (familiar?), I must say that it is a little spectacular-dramatic to continue explaining the basic characters and their enduring needs, including abdominal pain and OZ group what they should do to stop their success (especially Wufei's character) in their plans ... That is, they do not want more than an American character in a soap opera. <br /> <br /> Generally, a lot of extravagant drama (I think that comes from the dubbing of English voice actors), this series is still very interesting and will still bring me back. Probably always bad. It might be like the final payment, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about mellow-dramatic .... I'll talk about it later.
