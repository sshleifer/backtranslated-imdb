This film did not actually look at one school, but actually. But it only enhances the power of this film. People are dealing with it and how they deal with tragedy. I know that Columbus has been shown to students who survived the fire and that they have a sense of closure for many. Acting is superior. All three main actors (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their role ... I recommend this movie to anyone. One of the films about this subject after seeing him. It causes discussion of human emotions and reactions to all tragedies, not the school shots. It's a trance, but it's worth it, and once again I'll be watching time and time
