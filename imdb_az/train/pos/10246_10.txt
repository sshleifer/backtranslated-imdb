This movie should be my favorite of all time. He does not need a structure, because his producers believed that this was a real movie (Charlie Sheen, I think). It was a visual exercise effect and was not cut off when it acted as any other movie. These days, the movies are related to sound effects, the images that are made by computers cause CGI to be easier to bleed with blood. There are still filmmakers who can not get fake blood to look at something real. There is no rape case because there is no shooting point in the film. Did you see the mountains 2 eyes? Instead of the scene of aggression, it was shocking. I'm convinced that some GONZO porn movie makers have tried to get married with porn. But, probably, they will not be able to shoot them because of the film they shoot. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch? because actresses are actually porn stars, and the movie is a source of encouragement to everyone. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that a movie can not be done without thinking, all aspects of money, especially when talking about AO or NC-17 rating. I'm convinced that Eli Roth has the ability to make his Hostel a better movie series, but he's pushing it down to get R rating ... or at least that his films are silent over these restrictions. <br /> <br /> If you do not want any cheat-true imagery (accidents and crime scenes / footage), look no further than Death Scars or Whipped Pumpkins. Remember, this film was shot in 1985. This film still stands in opposition to most of the films that have been made in recent days, telling a lot about this movie. The PS3 resembles one of the 8bit Super Mario Brothers who has a better graphic.
