It should be noted that the rarity of rarity, film about ideas. Many movies present a vision of the future, but a few attempts to show us how our future will be. The first part of the film is short but powerful when it comes to Wartown in every country. (Demonstrators in the film almost laugh at the news that enemy planes attacked England - the above-mentioned explanation was at its height). Wells's prognosis has been made very soon.) The following is the installation of the endless war, the Par model work is most effective. Explaining names definitely remind the German Expressionist graphic design. The feature film director was William Cameron Menzies, and the ruins of each city were one of his best works. Margaret Scott Scott's wife is very attractive. Equally striking in every city of the 21st century. A story that operates in the 21st century does not work - perhaps it was an attempt to counteract the technocratic efficiency of this time with the 1970 barbarism. Unfortunately, the model that represents the angry gang members drifting to the rising marching paths is ridiculous and it could have done better with the technology of the 30s. The curtains of the gigantic aircraft are very convincing because it is particularly accelerating. This was withdrawn from his spectacular speech, which Raymond Massey could close in the film - rarely turned into the ideal of scientific progress. The last question of Massey is now heavily dependent on a manned space flight that is now seriously restricted. Unfortunately, VHS versions of this movie are completely terrible and have serious technical problems. Many versions have created a pretty interesting fit of futuristic workers and machines that took us from 1970 to 2038. I hope the whole movie has a good DVD.
