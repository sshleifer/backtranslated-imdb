I absolutely loved this movie! It was very good! This film is explained by Paulie's parrot. Paulie's little girl is given as a gift to Marie. Paulie Marie learns to speak and becomes the best friend. Pauli tells Marie to fly, she falls and birds are sent. That's when the adventure begins. Paulie Marie is going to find the way. This movie is very sweet, funny, touching, sad and much more. When I watched this movie for the first time, she cried. The courage of the birds and the encouragement to find Marian at that time were very much upset. I say that the end is sweet and sad, but you have to watch out for it. Finally, the janitor tries to help her after hearing her story. Will he find his long lost Mari? Find out when watching this sweet, heart warming movie. It will touch your heart. Rating: 10
