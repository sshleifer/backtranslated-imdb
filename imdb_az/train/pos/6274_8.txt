One night I went to see this movie with a group of friends. I really did not hear a lot. So I did not expect anything. But after seeing it, I really liked it. The rest of Nicolas Cage and the rest were very good. But I have to say that the performance of Giovanni Ribisi needs a little decline. However, such a minor defect can be eliminated. <br /> <br /> In 60 seconds, his brother must ride 60 rare and exotic cars overnight to save his life. The film is in no way unexpected. So, the finish should be a surprise. Imagine a car driver film at another speed? Well you are partly right. There is more. Everyone should look at this movie.
