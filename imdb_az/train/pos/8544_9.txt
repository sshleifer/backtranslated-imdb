This film never drew the attention he deserves, though it is one of the best game ensembles and one of the most realistic stories I've ever seen on the screen. Obviously, the real V.A. on a small budget. The hospital, the story center Joel, played very well by Eric Stoltz. Joel paralyzed a motorcycle accident and came to the hospital with other men suffering from spinal injuries. <br /> <br /> Although Joel-Anna's main focus is on Joel-Anna's main focus, she has a lover with Anna, who has played by Helen Hunt. very well-developed characters in the ward. Wesley Snipes is doing a great job like angry Raymond. The more effective William Forsythe, the bitter and racist Bloss. Forsythe's two best scenes are when he is embarrassed for a young Korean who is angry at the square dancers and is then taken to a liquor store. My favorite scene with Snipes is a roundtable discussion of sexual options after the scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Amongst Stoltz and Hunt, chemistry is very strong, and there are two very sexy, but unequal, sex scenes. Orgasm in the ward is both sexy and entertaining. There is another memorable scene that brings Joel and Bloss and Korean children to a specially crafted van strip strip. <br /> <br /> The author of the article, Neal Jimenez, is preparing to see his "Friends". <br /> <br /> The story is even more complicated. in real life is in a paralyzed state. This is basically his story. This movie is not real, bright or sensitive. Having a talent in such a small budget is incredible. I recommend this movie to anyone I see, because it's one of the best-looking movies in a second look. Such a big piece of work will not be visible, but it is a shame to pay attention to those who are so rich in the video.
