Second, a young woman living in London is helpless to accept a living position with an elderly woman and her son. The thrillers of people who have been opposed to their will always feel a little worried about me - I feel like a prisoner - but this very worthy B-movie is neither inaccurate nor claustrophobic. It is not very difficult and difficult, but not indifferent, and our heroine (Nina Foch) feet quickly. The loss of 1986 (such as the "Dead of Winter") did not show wisdom if the evidence elements were not up-to-date. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (very short in 65 minutes!), But it keeps this course alive until the very accelerated peak feeling a little friction. From ****
