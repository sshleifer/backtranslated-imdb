<br /> <br /> Sunshine Boys is a terrific comedy about two old veudevillians who are unrelated to a rebellious television, though they look down on one another. <br /> <br /> Here's the funny genius of two master masters George Berns and Walter Matthau! Some of the best scenes, while fighting on double, at least the least important things! <br /> <br /> NATIONAL SPOILER ALERT: The film's end effects have a bit of complicated moments towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> Everyone loves a couple if you love this movie. Beautiful movie!
