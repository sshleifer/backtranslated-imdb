Make a pinch of GOODFELLAS, mix it with GODFATHER, add some Roman mythology and very little comedy, and have a SOPRANOS on a bunch of clans operating in North New Jersey. Pro was not as entertaining as wrestling. I'm not the biggest admirer of this show, but Mr. James Gandolfini's very sophisticated Tony Soprano is amazed at a psychopath, occasionally a brilliant conscience. I have also come to admire the nation like the deadly, but deadly Junior Junior, dirty-dwelling Dom Chianese, silver-haired Tony Sirico, and always with a stunning Paulie and a very beautiful Edie Falco, as well as the slim-strings, Carmela Soprano. Violence is sudden and graphic, and the corpse remains constant every season, but it's the smallest moments that are most important. Paulie and Toni's nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli and LAW & ORDER night), as they were losing their dead and abandoned in a pitiable cold night in Pine Barrens.
