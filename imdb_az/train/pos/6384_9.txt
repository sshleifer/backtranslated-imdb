Disney animations are written on a stone that should be simply musical. Right? Where? Show me. Because I did not like this initiative for hockey for the five-year-old standard Disney musician. <br /> <br /> Although the story was not as entertaining as it could be, it was still very good, enjoyable, adventurous. I hoped for a while, yes, while looking at the topic, but this movie is not a bitter disappointment or an untold failure. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is quite compelling, as the animation quality is average, but the storyline, plot, sub-plan, and incredible creativity I find in this production. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the best Disney - if you're an admirer of this fantasy, as seen in this movie, > <br /> <br /> <strong>
