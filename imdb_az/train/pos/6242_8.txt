I agree with the previous comment, calling the content of the film "daily madness", but I would like to state how women (one person) is being treated in "Dog Days". The episodes we've seen here show some changes in the daily discrimination of women classified by age group. There is a companion who shows his new partner to his brother and acts as a puppet who moves past his dress. There is a middle-aged couple whose relationship is rough, and he is a violent master. Later, though, we find some young people who are friendly to their opponent (friends), even though they are not really friendly with our friend / spouse and are sensitive about his work. A young adult discloses to his comrade - a girl who is in a very difficult situation for him - should have jewelry on her side and adhere to his concerns. Finally, in a nightclub that calculates its advantage, a man brings an angry client to a woman who is a simple-minded self-portrait - naturally hitting her because they are guilty of breaking her car. To complete the examples, the "master-slave" - ​​a group of people - after collective self-condemnation - to get rid of his partner for self-destructing and humiliating "self" and a new master. All of this is where immovable neighborhoods, during which the movement takes place under the burning summer sun, are completely immaculate (sic!). Unfortunately, I have not seen the final moments of this shocking and original description of the archaic structures dominated by women and men, but what I have seen has reassured the discrimination repertoire. Probably less sensitive to the audience is wrong - even a good way to teach good visuals.
