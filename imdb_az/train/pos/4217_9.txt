An investigation is always satisfied when completing a job and bringing the book to crime. In this case, the peaks give me more pleasure. <br /> <br /> Taking into account the admiration of Rufat Gordon, the performance of "testimony of death" to see the dismantling of Abigail Mitchell as a victim, indeed, really irritates my character. He is selfish and demanding. He takes his own path by putting an embarrassing "little girl" action in a woman with her age. <br /> <br /> A spouse of high-ranking women speaks to an audience. <br /> <br /> It perfectly transforms tables with a very warm and fair promise of the reality of police work. <br /> <br /> Columbo can not diverge anything from justice. Last appeal to Abby's good nature was denied because he had too much respect for his job. Here is a situation where Mitchell does not shout!
