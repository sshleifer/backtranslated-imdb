In Japan, the only exchange student, Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), is sent to help a semi-catatonic woman named Emma (Grace Zabriskie) after the former guard Yoko (Yoko Maki). it disappears. Karen quickly learns that there is nothing at Emma's house, and she tries to see the "depth of the rabbit hole." <br /> <br /> Maybe this is a delayed effect on the success of M. Night Shyamalan, but slow paced, simplified horror movies are the latest trend. In some cases, such as Hide and Seek (2005), the approach works pretty well and in others, like White Noise (2005), pacing tries to kill the movie. <BR> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In addition to this, Another recent example of this tendency. First, this is a raid based on the Japanese movie series Ju-On (2000) (particularly close to the first half of Ju-On: The Grudge, aka Ju-On 3, 2003). Like two, many Japanese fear movies, here's a lot of realistic drama field like slow pacing realrealism. <br /> <br /> As with most of the European horrors, Grudge should be viewed as a nightmare. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The director, Takashi Shimizu, Instead, it presents a scene sequence that is appropriate to sleep, with a sense of thought, an atmosphere, creativity, an unusual and awe-inspiring logic for many viewers. Making a great movie to see how well the movie works for you will depend on how this different approach suits you and how much you use it. (Of course, some of the visible gaps are YU- the series). Traditionally, the American audience considers the deficiencies that leave the "rules" for the "monster" and leave the leaves off the ground. A more poetic, metaphorical, surreal approach to the film will not yet be accepted by the main actor in the United States. But even though you do not use it, normal preconceptions are about filming and give a shot to Grudge. Good cinematography, good cinematography, good cinematography, good cinematography, good cinematography, better episodic, brick <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The average fear film of the past, pacing often increases eeriness and horror There are no strange incidents to keep entertainers entertained. It absorbed the supernatural structure of the film and forced me to pay more attention to Japanese beliefs and folklore, based on interviews with Shimizu on the DVD. The most interesting subtexts are probably older adults who seem to be scary guys and scary guys, even if they are closely acquainted with Japanese culture, in many Japanese fear films? <br /> <br /> I went to a point where the movie was really good, so it could be a bit of a clich√© with the film's "really happening" film, and in another case it's 10 to 10. If I say everything I mentioned above, finish with mini-rant: I'm not anti-remake, but we think that US distributors and studios need them to react to foreign movies. suitable for consumption. The original versions of these films should only be widely disseminated in US classes. You do not need to rarely have the same movie, but you need to replace white American actors for non-white or foreign actors. Yes, The Grudge is a wonderful movie, but eventually I would like to see something original, using this talent, and the latest foreign-looking movies - not just Japanese, Indian, Spanish, Chinese, in my multiplex. I hope some people in the studio have read this, that it would be better to do it because (1) we can completely avoid production costs, and just get a profit from the local sales share, and (2) get foreign movie DVDs from overseas or even bootleg versions You can earn money like a supporter.
