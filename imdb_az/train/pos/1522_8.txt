The cancer films were popular in the seventies. I love myself, but this is a great slice of the British horror movie. <br /> <br /> According to some countries, there are four stories around a home in this country, and a estate agent is informed by the Scottish Yard officer. <br /> <br /> This movie is known for the three stars of the Terrible Cinema; Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt, as well as one of Lee's co-stars in horror, will recognize the greatest English fears film of all time; The Wicker Man. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film tells the story of the author of a horror story called "Method for Murder"; A shotgun, called "Dominic," revives itself with its own impression. This story builds a very good thing; her lover believes that what he or she sees through the audience is an image of imagination. This story, of course, is not very original, but it creates the originality with the created atmosphere, and this is the final twist; The second story, Waxworks, is Peter Cushing's star and the least favorite of the four. This story follows the story of Phillip Grayson (Cushing), a man who discovered a wax candle museum and knows a woman who was acquainted with her and then found a murderer. Relationships between Phillip and Phillip are not really explained at all, but the fairy tale relies heavily on the mystery of the decline of the space. Cushing then happens to be the friend of Neville Rogers (played by Joss Ackland) and this tale really begins to get. Establishing a museum of murderers for a scary movie is not a new idea; The same setting had a great impact on the 1966 film "Room of Horrors." Although not as dramatic as the one described here, it uses the power of perception to apply a less terrible effect, most of which are obtained by claustrophobia, and this is a limited area of ​​the museum. Peter Cushing is always interested in watching and is afraid of escaping an insane stomach, a cure for fear. <br /> <br /> This film continues with "Candy for Sweet" and this is undoubtedly the best one. This story considers legendary Christopher Lee to be a seemingly dominant father. The beauty of this story comes as it is played. Estimates spectators; we know that either the father or the girl is wrong, but we do not know who or what is. Christopher Lee, as usual, describes his character with great devotion; the viewer stems from her daughter's actions about giving a puppet, and she is not allowed to go to school or to have a toy. That is precisely the fact that she was afraid of her daughter, actually in the vicinity of her chest, until the end of the line. <br /> <br /> This section has ended, which, in my opinion, is one of the best outcomes of any horrific story ever reported and will last for a long time after the last loans. <br /> <br /> Generally, the four most comedy "Staircase". This story is about a horrific horror movie star that comes out of the technician side of the movie, comes out and takes on a dress itself. Of course, this dress is a true vampire dress. Unlike the other three stories, it seems to be mostly played for laughter. It's not a bad thing, but most humor is funny and makes a nice difference to the rest of the movie. The story ends with a very good film, ending up with a very bad but humorous movie. See also a small jacket on Christopher Lee in Dracula. <br /> <br /> Generally, if you want a horror, you can not really go wrong with The House, which has been shedding blood. Only the third fairy tale is worth your time, and this is really a very strange horror movie.
