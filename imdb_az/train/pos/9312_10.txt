I like to watch this movie with all the scary scenes about predators. I love raptors because they are scared. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is the place where the raptor looks at the pillar, because it reminds a scene from the 13th film with a girl who wants to eat banana on Friday. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, though the computer graphics seem a bit fake, but it is good because you can not figure out what's happening because you've been into the movie once, and though I think it is well understood I thought about the first pair of images over and over again , is an important part. <br /> <br /> This is the best film. <br /> <br /> This is the best film.
