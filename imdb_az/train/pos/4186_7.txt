Yesterday I watched this flick and I saw that at least $ 36,000 (Steckler) was the best scare movie ever. The movie is a zombie admirer. This movie is transformed into a spirit and atmosphere. Some of the zombie shootings are best dedicated to the film. Extremely creepy, dusty white bodies are slowly smashed into the victims' screams. Brrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Sexual saggy Canadian women have sexually habits before HORROR started eating her swollen body. This movie has been fun from start to finish. He could not ask for more. My only complaint was too short.
