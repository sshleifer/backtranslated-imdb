De Grot is a very good movie. The great plan is written by Tim Krabb√©, who adapted this story to the screen. Not only Van Huet, but also some of the high-level facts that Marcel Hensema, especially television actor, had before Axel van de Graaf's speech. The film looks like a tension and builds a great mood. Then we begin to learn about Egon Wagter and Axel van de Graaf, and the story ends up in a spectacular flash-back structure that adds a drama based on the more romantic aspect and character of the film. As a result, all this has an exciting conclusion that will keep the audience in their throats. When you see this movie, make sure you know as little as possible about the field. In particular, you should see 'Spoorloos' (The Vanishing's original screen compatibility) favorite.
