This and "Hidden Fortress" are the most loved Kurosawa for me. I do not give 10 to candy, but that's definitely deserving. Even though it's too long (like all Kurosawa), it has solved the problem that has ruined me with the majority of movies; The storyline often contains very empty and slowly developing scenes, containing stories, or stories stored for a very long time, without any real purpose of storyline or character descriptions. Dodecock has conveyed the same experience to me, for example, "The Secret Fortress"; <br /> <br /> This is also a very unusual Kurosawa movie, there is no story, but there are many independent stories that are more substantial. Unlike any Kurosawa movie I have ever seen, the story is characteristic of the character. He also encourages much of the story in his brilliantly used talk (especially with his father and his son's "new home"). However, what creates this masterpiece is how he understands the subject so tragic that at any point it should be described as humane and sympathetic to anyone without pointing his finger. From the beginning, all emotional scales provide a perfect balance from laughter to tears.
