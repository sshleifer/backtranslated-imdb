The operation is worse than the cheapest movies, but it's more fun, zombie makeup is cool and effective, especially in terms of budget, as well as a zombie version of the movie Tales, both great and common, After getting two stories about zombie encounters in the woods, entertaining, and especially the first tale you can imagine. If you watch Zombie Chronicles, low budget b-films, or a zombie flash, you're better off than some low-budget zombie movies.
