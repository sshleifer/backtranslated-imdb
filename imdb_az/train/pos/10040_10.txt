For me, this film is the fourth best in all time. No exceptions. James Cameron himself once again proved that he was a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, Abyss and Terminators, it is clear that he is a bright and dignified director of action and science-fiction. She sees a story and adds a strange quality to the movie. But the Titanic is very different to its other glitter. The film moves in an exception, and a story that everyone knows can be surprises, field development, and exciting developments. The story of a famous voyager that sank into a boat trip is a legend, so Cameron is calling for a true, interesting and fun movie. Leonardo DiCaprio, played by Leon and Jack and Kate Winslet, has been turned into superstars on the night of the release of the movie, and I'm annoyed in this movie when most of the movies do not support the characters, but this is more purposeful in the film because Gloria Stuart explains his story that does not just give the story of Gul and Jack to anyone else. She is totally emotionally emotional and can not leave any dry eyes at a theater or home. The music became symbolic and legendary. Composer James Horner is talking about the best soundtrack and film and audience. This song has become annoying after a long time, but I still appreciate this phenomenon and this movie. Only one problem, the problem of ordinary James Cameron, is a bad dialogue on the one hand, just as in a memorable, but bad point. James Cameron delivered a romantic epic work that swept you on a lifetime journey. My heart is inevitable.
