In August 1980, the baby Azaria Chamberlain and his parents disappeared as a result of Lindy and Michael's allegations of child abduction, and then turned into a very angry nation. The media and the public have already broken and condemned the accused and did not shed blood. <br /> <br /> Michael and Lindy Cumberland, a central tenant girl in the center of Australia, set up a camp near Ayers Rock, eating a barbecue area, claiming that a dingo's ten-week-old daughter came out of her tent. Nobody believed them. Lindy was accused of killing her baby and being Michael's real after an accessory. The whole country was full of ritual killing. <br /> <br /> Lindy has never proved her innocence, so she is guilty of that. There was not enough evidence to condemn him, but the jury faced public and press pressure. How can we judge as a nation? How can we think about where we are? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fred Schepisi's film, John Bryson, unambiguously and fully supports the argument of the novel, claiming Chamberlains is completely innocent. accusations against them. <br /> <br /> Schepisi has taken the mood of a thirsty nation to protect the suffering of hell that lightens the "truth". She is showing off with the fuzzy light of Australia as a totally obsessed folk who pays Chamberlains! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mariam Strep, with Robert Caswell, strongly condemns her feelings and finds sad and angry viewers in the travesty of justice. <br /> <br /> The prominent Meryl Streep accused women of the most terrible events. He brings the most persuasive, stubborn Australian, who is ready to stop the claims and make it to the world. Even his accents are almost, but not many. He is a very good effort by the master of trade. Sam Neill, first of all, is as good as Streep, but then betrayed Mike, who did not understand why world life would not fall, and began to question his Christianity. It is an indicator of the great emotional power that will move deep, as in the case of Streep. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "text-align: justify; "> Rock). Editor Jill Bilcock Bruce Smeaton keeps the whole film tense and very emotional while presenting an explanation account. <br /> <br /> For all Aussies, if you look shocked at the mirror, we want justice to be a country for a family who wants justice. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Schepisi and Robert Caswell have transferred the novel of John Brayson to the screen, just a terrible story of a vacation, Michael and Lindy Cumberlain, quite wrongly, with her newborn daughter, Azaria, with a dingo and family tent it was founded. <br /> In media speculation and cynical public rumors, Lindy was charged with killing her baby and Michael was eventually charged with accessory. As a result, the test was diminished by the press and when the Australians determined that he had been abducted, Lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment with heavy labor, although he could not present any reason and only one proof. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is at the highest level as a suspicious woman who has shot her head in Australia to prove her innocence. It is really striking, and its failure is only the true Blue Arrows, though it is the best ocker sounds. It was not the role of a top Australian actor, but star energy is probably the answer. An impressive Sam Neill, along with Meryl, is a prominent figure of her husband who has been in the world since her eyes. <br /> <br /> In most cases, Jill Bilcock's editing, Ian Baker's cinematic and other solid locations are sophisticated and Bruce Smeato's music is partly perfect. <br /> <br /> Sunday, June 15, 1996 - Video
