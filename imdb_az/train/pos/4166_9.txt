Before Cujo, Satan's lion was lucky. In 1978, the film "Devil Dog, The Life of Hell" was released on Halloween night. The story of a family getting a new shark (only a farmer in a neighborhood selling fruits and vegetables) because their dog Skipper was killed. Everyone loves a new dog, but there is something strange about it. <br /> <br /> His father, Mike Barry (Richard Crenna, First Blood), did not last long until he began to warn. His wife is different from Betty (Yvette Mimieux, The Boys Are Where, Jackson County Jail, Snowbeast) and her children Charlie and Bonnie (Ike Eisenman, Witch Mountain and Fantastic Vourage and Kim Richards, Witch Mountain, Nanny and Professor, Salam Larry, Tuff -Turf) also changed. Is your dog related to it? <br /> <br /> This movie is great, because Ike and Kim are playing a darker part of what we see in this magic mountain movie. One of the more than 70 films made for television is a scary movie for fear movies. <br /> <br /> The film also features Ken Kercheval (Dallas Cliff Barnes) and R.G. playing together. Armstrong (those who can not keep away from the devil's films) "<br /> <br /> It is worth watching.
