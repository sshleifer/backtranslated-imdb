Zorro, Indiana Jones or a fan of a motion picture is a must-see. William Witney and John, this series, directed by Don Diego / Zorro, who plays the British ace team and Reed Hadley! I will not try to prove you (more talk, more fighting); What's really important here is Hadley's Characters / s and the interpretation of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt's traction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can see the effect of this movie in Lucas and Spilberger - Transfer to an Raiders At-head trainer at another temple, and even runs through a tunnel, the baddies beat Indy in the Temple of Doom exactly as the beat of a huge water tank and the tunnel flood breaks behind it. In addition, Zorro threatens his safe hedgehog and so on. The sword is fair to the naked, except for the first chapter with a terrible sword dance in a canteen choreographed by Ralph Faulkner, the legend of the sword / stunt, a rare display of evil like Rodriguez. This once I saw that Bijou was the first series I saw in Matin√©e and was a kid and I was hooked on them today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
