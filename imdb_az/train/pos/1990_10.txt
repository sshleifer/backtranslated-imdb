Great cinematographic music was made from 1950 to 1970. This twenty-year spell can be called a "genre period." Earlier there were musicals, and since then there are musicals ... but true classics always appear to have been prepared at that time. Oklahoma, the South Pacific, the King and me, and many others, are at a high level as the most loved products of the year. Singin in the rain, America in Paris, Bandwagon, Seven Brides Seven Brothers, Oklahoma. Perhaps the latest music of the "Golden Age" is Carol Reed's "Oliver" in 1968. This live music, freely adapted from the novel Dickens, is a movie version of successful stage production. <br /> <br /> This is a gorgeous film that owns six Oscars, including the Best Picture Award. <br /> <br /> The orphan Oliver Tvist (Mark Lester) is a troubled creature in a workplace where her mom's mom killed her after birth. During a meal after the incident, he was dismissed from work and ended up in a funeral room. But Oliver does not particularly solve the new job and runs after a few difficult days. She is making a long trip to London, hoping to find her fate. Oliver is brought to the wing of a child collector named Revival Dodger (Jack Wild) working for Fagin (Ron Moody), an elderly brother responsible for a group of thieves. Despite the fact that the case is illegal, Oliver finds a good friend among his new "family." He is also the most scary and most terrible thief, Nancy (Shani Wallis), who gets acquainted with dangerous Bill Sikes (Oliver Reed). After many exhibitions, Oliver finds out that his real ancestors are looking for and is indeed rich and well-funded. <br /> <br /> Bill Sikes threatens Oliver's chances of uniting with her special family when exploiting abuse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oliver, Moody, with his energetic performance, like Fagin, stole the scene from a youthful film, with a great excitement. Leicester and the Wild are doing well as a young pants, and Wallis is nervous in his role of Nancy and creates true respect like Reed Sikes. Musical numbers are staged with an incredibly sensitive and spectacular sense of humor - Onna White's Oscar-winning choreography helps keep track of song and dance, but vibrant singers and Carol Reed's talent have their role. Among the unforgettable sounds are "Food Glorious Food", "Think Yourself", "Choose a Pocket or Two", "I'll Do Anything" and "Oom-Pah-Pah" - all very attractive songs, We brought together a very good sequence. The film is a great entertaining experience, and in fact, it does not really accelerate all 153 minutes. Sit back and enjoy!
