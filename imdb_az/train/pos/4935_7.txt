In New Orleans, a smoker immigrant feels ill and leaves a poker game while earning a small criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). Blackie and her men are persecuted by Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie, and her body is thrown into the sea. During the autopsy, the US Disciplinary Department's Family Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) finds that the deceased is a pneumonia plague caused by rats and is able to communicate with a person in forty. It is eight hours to prevent an epidemic. City Mayor, Dr. Skeptical captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) sets out to help Klein find the slaughtered plague and kill the slaughter. <br /> <br /> "Panic in the streets" but still effective and with a great villain. The area attracted was not dated to fifty-seven years later. Jack Palance holds a reputable badge on his debut, and while still trying to escape with Zero Mostel, the camera job is still very impressive. <br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?> <span style = "font-size:
