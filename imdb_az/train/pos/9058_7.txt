I read a book in the fifth grade and now I've seen the movie a few years later. <br /> <br /> Billy eats 15 worms in 15 days and 10 worms a day at 10:00. <br /> <br /> 2.Billy assumes that she will get $ 30 after eating all worms. Billy should go to school with worms on Joe pants in the movie that eats all worms. 3. Joe is thinking of faking some of the wolves, but there is nothing in the film. <br /> <br /> Even if it's a change, this movie is still something children love.
