This is a sweet and sad story of cultural differences. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman running to California to escape the failure in Japan. Ken plays a rock-roller, but a Japanese maneuver worker with few concrete desires to present a potential partner. Kyoko "marries" to stay in the United States, even though Kyoko will live together until the "green card" comes out. Soon parties will not be the same wavelength - or perhaps the same "time zone", that is, the film's name. As an Immigration Attorney, I took such "arrangements" into my own life, and I agree to see how the film's creativity develops the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
