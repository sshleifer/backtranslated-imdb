What is the comment here with all Europe (especially England)? All I said was when I was 13 when I first saw this movie. Of course, it's stupid. This point. You have to see Dr Strangelove and Black Men to get all the jokes behind this movie, but just go ahead and stand in front of people. I can think of many films that are worse than me, and they were expensive with the actual actors of Hollwood films. What's valuable is that those in the White are a mockery of a movie. With all the stupid things England has done in the last half-century, I've been shocked by all the negative comments. Stupid Americans are like stupid humor. P.S., Look at the 'Team America: World Police' for really a lot of laughter that Europeans especially love.
