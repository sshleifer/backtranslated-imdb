<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hollywood's remakes and sustainability are ours At a time when the throats appear wrapped to lower the throats, "Stardust" remembers the first thing to go to the movie - to escape reality for a few hours and explore other life, at other times or on other planets. Stardust remembers us all the children: Stardust is full of all the symbols we remember: princesses, witches, bandits, ghosts and scoundrels. <br /> <br /> Stardust is an issue of difficulty, heroism, darkness, obstacles, magicians, antidotes, temptations, and even the speed of light. <br /> <br /> A man from Wall, located next to a wall to separate the city from a magical kingdom. The only way through the wall is a diligent trick by a solid old codger (played by David Kelly). One day, a young man named Ben Barnes maneuvered the old guard and escaped the creature. She is a magic kingdom called Stormhold, where she meets Una, a chained (and very sexy) lady. He is captured by a witch and mixed with an unbreakable chain. As hell departed, he deceived me and sent her away. I return to the wall without incident and continue to live. But nineteen months later, the old guard was summoned to the wall of the wall where you were expecting a baby boy. <br /> <br /> A guy called Tristan grows up to be a very modest young man (Charlie Cox), as his daughter is hit by a girl and engages in another. Nevertheless, a young woman (called Victoria and Sienna Miller) once came out with Tristain and confessed her love. After seeing a falling star, he returns the star and can bring it back if he brings it back. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in the kingdom of Stormhold, the former king (dubbed perfectly by Peter O'Toole) is dying. . He calls on his remaining sons to tell who his throne is. His sons are Primus, Secondus, Sextus, and Septimus. <br /> <br /> Well, it is something that illuminates the ruby ​​charm for heaven and Voila, bringing the star to earth. <br /> <br /> Star Yvaine (Clare Danes) collapsed in the form of a beautiful woman and, of course, dressed in charm. <br /> <br /> Tristain, the Prince and an elderly magician named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer), who wants to break his heart to restore her youth, now knows her. <br /> <br /> Acne? Yes. Tristain is the first person to find Yvaine, but does not recognize the growing relationship between Kor and Yvaine because of his commitment to Victoria. His initial interest only returns Yvaine to Victoria as proof of his love. But first let the princes and Lamia be past. The princes are always trying to kill each other, as there is no such thing as the Pirates of Karabakh, that is not the death. <br /> <br /> But Tristain is also confronted by her mother-in-law (although she does not know her mother) and a group of flying pirates led by Robert DeNiro. <br /> <br /> The most important character in the film and DeNiro plays a tee. The film is stolen by its sluggishness and soon we learn secret secret that will leave the audience on the ground with laughter. Although his role is long, DeNiro is unusual! <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is as beautiful as Lamia - a sexually explicit witch. Claire Danes fits like the most mixed and troublesome Yvaine. She was a perfect girl. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In addition, Jason Flemish, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett, and Mark Strong, like the war princes who add the perfect dose speed, pick up ghosts like "Blithe Spirit" and "High Spirits" <br /> <br /> "Stardust" can be too complicated for young children but everyone who is over 13 years old, Layer Cake wants to see this movie several times. This is a good. What are "Stardust" movies? Perfectly written, perfect cast, perfectly directed and perfectly acted. In other words ... perfect.
