Director Paul Verhoevé's American tool has different qualities, but most of his films in his native country are undoubtedly complicated. This is a story of an alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writer who moves with a beautiful and very strange woman. But the woman does not know that she wants to meet her lover. In the meantime, the writer is full of strange visions - first of all they resemble hallucinations that cause alcohol abuse, but soon he begins to realize that he is living some kind of premonitory. Exciting Hitchcockian Thriller, which is very original and provocative. I love movies that you think you are thinking of, but then I realize that it's a completely different thing. It's one of those films; the first half is a tension, and in the second half semi-religious sütrealist saga. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not every Sunday, for children or people going to church. Great cinematography by future director Jan de Bont. Very surprised!
