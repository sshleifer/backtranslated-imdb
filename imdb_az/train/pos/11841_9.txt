It was a great movie with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5 and 4) loved this whole movie, including myself. The music was fantastic. No, horses do not talk, but the Spirit is called by the Spirit. <br /> <br /> I think the title says all this "soul". This movie really gives you a sense of family, home, and friends. I would like to say that my 4 year old boy and a five year old girl really touched this movie, so they deceived, laughed, and finally rejoiced in the spirit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the "Spirit" with your family and raise your soul with this heartwarming story. Your children will love it. I think you will be.
