Steven Spielberg (24 years old) has already starred in two top episodes of the 1971 series "Psychiatrist", starring Roun Thinnes. An episode was related to a 12-year-old child who was emotionally disturbed and others were about a lifeless, lifeless young culprit (Clu Qulager's best performance). Both episodes should look different on television and are emotionally complicated and surprisingly adults. The creator of the "Psychiatrist" Richard Levinson and William Collin created "Columbo" and prepared the first season. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk, an experienced television filmmaker of the first class, is "Columbo", such as Bernard Kovalski and Jack Smight. <br /> <br /> Spielberg's Steven Bochko's "Book Crimes" "The Book of Crime") likes the script. <br /> <br /> The episode of Columbo is so far away that it has tried to make the look of production as a $ 1 million feature, more stylish, and the array is always Spielberg has been using the best sound and background music from almost any other "Columbo" episode, although he uses other heads, but Spielberg is trying to keep the great Falky and Cassidy out of their hands, but both players are still entertaining. , Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby, all speeches are fresh and fresh about them. <br /> <br /> I also have two episodes of the "Psychiatrist" "The episode of Dawn's Early Light" by Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart) and Columbo suggests that this episode has evolved much more like the Spielberg technical director. He was great since the beginning. In a "fight!" Albert Salmi's 1962 Episode DVD guest commentator, Robert Altman, says the episode is as good as the director. Perhaps the same thing is true for Spielberg.
