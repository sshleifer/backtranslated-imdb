It does not mean very much for Americans who know very little about other football (soccer) to "bend like Beckham", but for British sports fans, "push like Bond" or "like Dunk of Jordan". Any young player wishes to wrap a soccer ball around a player and miss out on the net for a win, like the very young Indian girl Jess (Parminder Nagra), like many star player David Beckham, Bend It Like Beckham. Jess likes to play football games forbidden by his traditional mother. One day, a fellow named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her playing and invites all the girls to join the soccer team. After agreeing with coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), it is something he knows he will not confirm his mother. The film is not a disobedience of parents, but rather a girl she wants to do, even if she is opposed to her parents, not just her parents. Especially when Jules thinks his mother is a lesbian, she has a humor thrown across the film. Since a great football game is the same day as Jess's sister's wedding, the movie comes with a click, but not just a cheese but very fun and bright. The football action looks good, so sports fans will be delighted with it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world will bring together the audience of the football world. Bending like Beckham is not just football, but rather trying to find himself and at the same time asking his parents is a difficult thing.
