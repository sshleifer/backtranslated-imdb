The Yellow and the Blue, which was available in two versions at the beginning of a film in the closest seal of the Seuss, was one of those great art houses, a great sensation in Sweden. A major scandal in the United States was caused by a raid by customs, set out on the road. Today, the potential of the photo is far too limited to sex or nudity - the director / "actor" Vilgot Sjoman is the intellectual expression of the abundance of the body and sex in the film, but sometimes repeatedly - a lot of wishes, but at the same time with the situation in Sweden it is the courage to attempt a purely "metaphysm" with a true statement of affiliation. In general, who knew such things in peace (for example, foreign affairs and neutral wars)? At least Sjoma's goal is here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Describes how Dusan Makavajev, as a filmmaker, or a Bertolucci-like worker like WR, is to embody a character of a film around politics and sex (mostly politics and social layers) like Bertolucci. Lena and Borje, Lena and Borje have a hot-tempered relationship in the movie's story, where Lena can be very curious about her lover's lover, a "curious" socialist-wannabe at the same time demonstrating violence and "cabs" in a wooden cabin. Sjoman, enough for a movie, occasionally incorporates himself and his crew into the film (even as it does in a big concert here), the title cards fills in a break at which the crew is thrown, but there is another speaker like Sjoman's real performance <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> First of all, I will not be able to get this structure and I'm curious (Yellow) it's only a movie, where we see the class of Lena, socialism, Spain and Franco, Lena's father, or Bjore, but Sjoman makes an interesting thing: the structure is so slippery, because the audience needs to stand up, not to be afraid of taking photos it is striking that dramatic story, documentary, movie, and even Lena Quasi a serious interview with Martin Luther King, who works for quasi-guru as a whole, which can not always be a politically relevant analysis, but it does not deceive or even feel a satirical agenda as a form of God; Satire Sjoman then has a Godard but all other wavelengths. <br /> <br /> If I was interesting (Yellow) as an intellectual venture and a full-blown journey for exploration, its anarchy is fun, but full of semantic or tricks. sexually demonstrated how attractive it is and how comfortable it is for actors, not entirely successful, and I'm an emotional experience. Bergman, with deconstruction trends, has fallen somewhere by throwing a totally emotional film, Sjoman is better off communicating with specific ideas, even when it's time to make great or subtle scenes with actors. Sometimes, for actors, Lena Nyman only works for Borja Ahlstedt (a great real counterpoint for volatile Lena), but only about 40 years after Lena and Borja Sjoman fills it with clich√©s (Borja has a girlfriend and child, will leave her, how will Lena) <br /> <br /> Sarkozy, Sarkozy, Sarkozy, Sarkozy and Sarkozy, Yellow) stands as an artistic test to test what can be done in Swedish cinema or to test things that are not bent or tested for provocative and comedy use. I would even like to go to say that he was influential and probably was more or more duplicated in his time than a cult phenomenon (a special technique used, a rewinding to the end, echoed in poor use in comic games) and avant- garde or anyone who wants to access the meta movie. W.R. or if it is not as outstanding as the artistic leap like the Last Tango, it's behind.
