David Lynch's (1999) film, John Roach / Mary Sweeney's story, was shortly before Iowa's release and Viscox. <br /> <br /> We live in Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth). <br /> <br /> This is a more remarkable and gratifying fact, what he decides. <br /> <br /> Alvin is a humble person with great experience in her life this time. (Alvin reverberates with her name movements at every point in this film). Daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) is struggling with speech impediments, making a great effort on behalf of the audience. <br /> <br /> This movie is a story of a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a story of a journey. But all trips are a geographical and human journey. At the early stage of the film, we began to realize that this Alvin age was an ambitious journey that did not have to carry out an old gentleman. <br /> <br /> But along the way, we learn that Alvin has so many features that he will supply it to reach a difficult goal. Its purpose is very simple and simple. His brother is sick and will die and wants to meet with him. <br /> <br /> He had fallen with him many years ago and did not speak for a long time. <br /> <br /> On the way, Alvin meets many people. Their behavior against them and the benefits they have acquired are the essence of this film. We know Alvin Straight from Alvin Straight. At the end of the movie, we know who we are.
