What can you say when you see a good French movie trying to capture a suspenseful story according to the heroes' social background? The most important point is that we believe in these characters and want them to stay together when they meet each other. Simple and really efficient. The story behind the story is less important. Why does the scenario go semi-developed on a tension side? This will help prevent most people from attending public demonstrations for those who want to film the most French movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The rear window is as easy as it is (a clear reference and definitely not a noir movie), but with a less attractive context. To see the character of the tested officer in my place where I am surprised. It brings very little to the story; When we see it alone, we think we do not miss a portion of it before. Jacques Audiard is still something new. Strangely and strangely.
