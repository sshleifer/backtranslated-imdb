As an old white housewife, I still appreciate Laurence Fishburne as one of our best players. Everyone who appreciates his work as Deep Cover can watch the incredible performance of this actor. This is more than just a direct debut. All the players are pretty good. If you can not get the real Manhattan junky worlds or the reality of a criminal life (not a performance action), this is not a movie that you will enjoy. Mr. Fishburn is an ordinary contribution to incredible fine relationships. Larry and Anthony Hopkins would like to go one day in one movie.
