Alan Rudolph's "Champions Breakfast" encourages me to think that Keith Gordon's "Moment of the Night" came out in 1996 by entering the striking few theaters. It is surprising that Kurt Vonnegut's "inconvenient" in all debates is that he has received two superior cinematic treatment (the other is the "Killing House"). "Mother's Night", of course, is one of the lowest-rate films in decades, and I do not understand why. It's brilliant! Vonnegut's book is almost entirely loyal (stylted or excessive) and adds a kinematic poem. How many movies adaptation of any author can answer this claim? Vonnegut himself puts a community view towards the end of the film, and can you ask for a better confirmation? Not just a beautiful movie, but a beautifully animated, written and controlled movie, and one of my favorites for the five or more American films of the 1990s. This is a cheerful, inspired, irreal king who does not despise. I will encourage everyone to see "Mother's Night" sincerely - even failing to fully appreciate Vonnegut's work (sometimes as "Cutting Five"). It's a powerful, effective movie piece.
