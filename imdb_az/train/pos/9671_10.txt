<br /> <br /> Tony Shalub is doing a flawless job as a PhD student in the United States who can not find a decent job in America. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> According to one of Qafqaz University researchers, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paulie Marie repeats her life and how she has lost one another. Studies have begun to merge with Marie and Paulie, only over 20 years have passed. <br /> <br /> The film is about to end, and some of them predict that Michael and Paulie will merge with Marie. <br /> <br /> Great family movie!
