First, this is the funniest movie I've ever seen. Includes a perfect time slapstick, a sexual humor and a well-thought stand-up. But it goes deeper. Souler is a genuine love story (something we often did not see) that there is love, two loving men can solve their problems; and that such a comedy life (I believe in something) can be accepted by people who are really important. Chris Meloni gives such a convincing performance that Barry Singer has gained. The film is brilliantly written and I hope that we will see more films from everyone involved in the future.
