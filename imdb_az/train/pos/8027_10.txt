When I first saw it, I really regretted it. At the end of the lead, he made such a mysterious atmosphere. All story viewers may expect Richard to really kill Thomas or do it first. But the main point is not conflict, but ... FILENING! An elderly and adult man is the life that he himself prays to save all his youth. Every time I watch him, of course, as every action movie is pretty severe, but it is acceptable. Thank you very much thanks to Louis Liosa and Tom Berenger! Incredible movie! I advise everyone to see this. I believe that people will not regret and really have a good time.
