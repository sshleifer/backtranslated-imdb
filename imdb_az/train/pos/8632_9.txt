<br /> <br /> This is a moral comedy, so sometimes a bitter touches occur, but at one instant it will stop all your heart and lightness will soften all the irritation and irony flow until it changes everything. Marvelously written and directed, perfectly illuminated, a beautifully operated gem. Jean-Louis Trintignant is as subtle as ever and Romy Schneider is gentle, gorgeous and glamorous, should not be missed. A really nice movie!
