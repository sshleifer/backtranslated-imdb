<br /> <br /> Freeman is a good actor, but sometimes he's involved in bad projects; <br /> <br /> This is a small story that has been used for more than an hour and fifteen years as long as the movies are longer and longer and that it is not necessarily good. the director uses his power for a short time because the characters from the very beginning (Freeman and Vega great images) are well defined, from which the background information becomes real, Morgan has not even mentioned his name, for a few years, satirized and was filmed for preparing a scandal to follow a script, and he was making a quest for a character in an indie film playing in a movie. shop / supermarket manager. The story begins with the collapse of a supermarket in a rough neighborhood where 10 items or less (Vega) faced the cashier and has to go out on his own due. In many ways, Morgan is surprised by his unpleasant smile on his smiles and over all his superiority, and shows a successful actor who can imagine anyone who sees it. She is a character she can play and by the way, how beautiful a woman is better than Penelope Cruz), brings a weakness to a 25-year-old woman who works more than anyone else without getting a dead credit <br /> <br /> This is a discussion, there are many dialogues, but light and entertaining, balance between sad and grief stands well, the characters are just as sweet to you. The strangeness of begging for more than 20 minutes of screen time is in the nature of the story, and that's why it was a good call for the director not to give up.
