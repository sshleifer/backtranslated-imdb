Unfortunately, this film is not available for a long time (as we have noted in other posters), but it is one of the major drama of the Great Depression, a lyrical and touching drama of love created in the joyous city. Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young have their speeches about only the best of their careers, and this is a great example of Frank T. Borzage, who is able to create almost fairy tales around poverty, crime, and environmental elements. it is just a terrible social injustice that proves just how romantic and moral abilities are. This film shows how survived the stinging and desperate need, and this is entirely a confirmation of life. It is a true work of this era and is a film that deserves to be widespread.
