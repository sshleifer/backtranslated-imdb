Canadian director Vincenzo Natali took the art house tour through a storm with a stunning and striking clever Cube, a personal favorite movie of the 1990s. It was trapped in a maze shaped like a gigantic cube, totally drawn into a set and turning it into interesting destinations. <br /> <br /> I was looking forward to Natalie's persecution, and despite having signed another project for five years, it was worth the wait. Cypher is to explore the place of a human being in the world and is in a state of uncontrolled control over a chain of unreasonable events. <br /> <br /> I do not want to give much information about it. Because, one of the joys of Cypher is a different aspect. It is very strange to see a SF movie with many ideas that are happening today and at the age of. Cypher is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the world's most beautiful guys, is hired by DigiCorp. They send him to different parts of America to write different workshops. Their emotions are incredibly boring. <br /> <br /> While waiting for Morgan to attend a workshop, she defines the ice girl as Rita Foster (perfectly bearing Lucy Liu). He gives him a brush, but there is something for him, he finds irresistible. <br /> <br /> When Rita returns to Morgan's workshop, she tells her not to see her life. I do not say much about the plot. In order to do so, we will reduce the impact of the rest of the film, as well as the insidious road that is so fun to watch. <br /> <br /> As with Kube, Natalie removed the usual people from the place where they were familiar with, and actually saw what happens when they get into the unknown. And Cypher corresponds to similar examples. But this is not a carbon copy of Cuba. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a film that is more about the thrill of conspiracy and paranoia. One of the biggest things about Cypher is getting into the story, if you know it. <br /> <br /> Morgan is a much larger piece of puzzle when he realizes his fake identity, and it's a shock for us. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is how much the polished one distinguishing the Siper from the Cub. When the Cube is limited to a minimalist space and an unlimited budget, Cypher is also on a low budget, but Natali allows Morgan to launch an incredible journey, enabling her to expand her horizons <br /> <br /> the direction is exceptionally strong, ie the strong hand on reminiscent. The magnificence of the DigiCorp building has some nice camera angles as well as a large, robust office block with a small stick outside Morgan. <br /> <br /> The majority of figures went out of the picture, which sounds like a film that perfectly reflects the color of the film. Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic figure to ask for her identity from her unmarried marriage. Its performance is good because it's so modular. It looks like it's actually going to come out of our eyes. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett gives you a nice look that has such an impact on the Cube. He lives in a hidden silo that looks like borrowed from black men. His scene is one of the best, because it is a tactical exercise and a paranoia. He is a highly probable expert in identifying dual agents, and is a fantastic writing that shines globally by Hewlett. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . However, Cypher is eventually given a matching character like a glove. Rita is a femme fatale that protects Liu's taste. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He unequivocally marked the work of Cuban. Morgan deserves a happy ending. After such a call, I was glad for her on the final stage. <br /> <br /> Kipar succeeds in all counts. As part of the day, it comes as a sunlight. Confused, shocking, always entertaining, everything you want to be Total Recall but not everything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Natali's beautiful crowd is a great antidote to the great and unexplicable Matrix. Now I am a human being. Superb things!
