I followed it in the 'Danger After Dark' box and just watched interest in Hyde and Gackt's performance. I was awaiting a terrific movie full of great confusion and very bad dialogue. What would happen if it was done in America. Instead, I discovered that I was interested in the good development of characters, and Sho (Gackt) saw it as a human being through the film. <br /> <br /> Bearing in mind that both of the star's abilities are not professional actors, the director has done a great job of making flying cars and holographic billboards in the future. <br /> <br /> On the one hand Taro Yamamotoun's performance was very striking. Another movie I see is Battle Royale, where Shogo Kawada plays, and in this film she appears on the opposite side of Shogun. Toshi is brilliant, attractive and hyperling that serves as a funny relaxation with antiques. Shogo was a tough man who was killed without thinking about the island. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasian> Caucasian> Caucasian> Because this is not really a vampire movie. There's only one movie with a vampire. Hyde's character is a vampire, really in the foreground and you will love the final scene. At some points there is a really moving picture, the picture is really good. When you're at Blockbuster, it's definitely something to choose next time.
