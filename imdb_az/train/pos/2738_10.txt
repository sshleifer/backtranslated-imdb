<br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie for more than 20 years, but I still remember it. <br /> <br /> This movie could not be colored. What did strangely grays do and what was really simple in the 1950s? Perry Smith, who is most different in my memory, goes to the trees. Breathing under the head cover before tracking the demand. I do not think I can ever look again ..... once more. It's like an unknown person at the top of Papillon, guilotine-driven terror. <br /> <br /> <strong> I'm going to follow one of my friends. In the years 1794-95, my feelings of death penetrated heavily to the celestial body.
