All my time, my favorite group of police turns into a television movie. Does it work? Yes. Gee works for the mayor and is shot. The crime scene is a "hall of fame". Pembleton and almost all the cops played in this series. Many flashbacks have never seen a TV series, but they love fans. In the past five minutes, he has solved another crime, and two of the dead were caught. And my favorite merchant Juliana Cox is a short look. This is a good movie.
