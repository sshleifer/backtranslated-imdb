The Society is one of the most funny, most striking, darkest and most memorable comedies of our time. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it has led to more comedy paths, most of which have been copied from style, but have never succeeded. <br /> <br /> Unlike any other sketch show, The Gentlemen are all directly linked. At first they all live in the fictitious city of Royston Vasey, on the edge of northern England. <br /> <br /> The first signs that greet newcomers are Tubbs and Edwards. Perhaps the pork-bearers of a supposed local store probably are unaware of the presence of most residents. Among other strangers: Denton's family, plunged in hygiene, betrayal and toads; Hillary Briss sells a special, but gratifying meat brand; Pauline, a sharp tongue and a sharp pens again; Mr. Chinnery, a good veterinarian and four-legged thing is in danger; Geoff Tipps, a plastic seller with a mild regret, often has guns, electrical pipes and combinations. . . . . . . PLUMS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Despite being a comedy in the heart, the Gentleman League often goes beyond genres, but it never seems to be spoiling or spoiling the material of other people. There are some horror references such as a march, a pair of silent twins, an obsessive circus owner, and sudden bloody nose. A more striking sequence is when the tone of more silence and the above-mentioned symbols like Pauline and Geoff are shown in a more sympathetic, sensitive light. The adaptation of the movie is best shown, but some fans can decide for themselves. <br /> <br /> Also, the sixth third series also takes a different route at the same level, instead of sketches, each episode focuses on an individual character. a plastic bag and a smuggled theater company has led to a conclusion with the van said. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Although many fans can not use the film for the first two or three in the arena, of course, how the Gentlemen League was created and they were not afraid to investigate new areas. <br /> <br /> In short, the Gentlemen League looks like a stunning look: DO NOT PROPERTY!
