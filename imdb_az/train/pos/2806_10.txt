Okay, I hate to comment on this issue first, but I had to stand up for this movie. <br /> <br /> Therefore, many people look like this and feel like people who do not want to get second opinion. <br /> <br /> Firstly, bending like Beckham is not the best film century. What you're looking for somewhere to go. Just because it's an independent film, it does not mean it should be a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it's still not good at Halle Berry in Monster's Ball. The film does not need to move in such a way, so do not look for it. This is a family movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, this is really a pretty story. I think it is well thought out and fun to watch. But for most of these cultures, it is very true for life, because you want to watch a movie that you feel good when you sit down and finish. <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "Lindsay"
