Othello is the story of classic Shakespeare's love, betrayal, lies and tragedy. I remember reading this story in a high school, and I saw that Othellou could be my favorite Shakespeare story, and that Shakespeare was a perfect companion of friendship, love and racism. That is, when you really explore this story, you can enter into many philosophies that Othello breathes with jealousy. But then I followed this version of Othello for my report, and I want to say that it was absolutely brilliant. Lawerance and Kenneth just realized that the story was a good thing to do. <br /> <br /> He is a great soldier in Othello, everyone, including the king. But when King Othello saw that he was shouting to Desenhana his daughter, the king was exasperated, but he excluded her. Othello is beautiful in the city, and instead of Iago, next to Othello, Cassio, his best friend, is his side man. It's in revenge because of horrific jealousy. As Othello's best friend, he still thinks that Othello is deceiving Desdemona with Cassio, and that only Othello is that. Othello is concerned about people and does not have the pleasure of Desdemona or Cassio. <br /> <br /> Othello is an incredible story. It's an incredible story that keeps you thinking after reading it. The Othello movie is also great, and I recommend it once again, perfectly capturing the story and feeling a great regret, or how much shouting from Othello and Desdemona would betray love. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, great toy, good sets and good direction. This story belongs to Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> 10/10
