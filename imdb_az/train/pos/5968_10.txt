When you see the ship of such a film, you know why the 80s lived in the decade. Rock music dominated, and there were films ... especially horror films. Filmmakers could make us entertain and "Crafty or Therapeutic" appears to be obvious. The most probable rocker written after W.A.S. Sammi Curr singer Blackie Lawless dies in a hotel fire, her # 1 admirer Eddie is confused. A friendly and native DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives a copy of Sammi's latest note; this is the only available copy. The live Halloween night was given to the radio station to be played. When Eddie plays, Sammi brings back somehow. Eddie helps with bullies at school, but then goes out of control. This is definitely a great movie. The bad thing is the release of this movie. Finally, I paid $ 25.00 to quit eBay. You also need lots of ... $$ well spent!
