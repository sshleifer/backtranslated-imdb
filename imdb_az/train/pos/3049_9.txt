When I look at Hollywood videos, I talked about leaving the movies, and there were five buckaroos plus fifty percent for DEMONICUS! I just saw it once and this could not do a great thing! The second look was better. The box is very cool and the music is very good. If you still do not see the demo, I suggest it or if you hire or hate the Demonic, you can change your mind to give another chance. <br /> <br /> Demonikus is a very different, but fun movie. BEWARE or as an interactive video game watching game playing! I'm sure the budget is very low and nobody gets acquainted with the actors. We started a video game with a man and a woman in Italy, and there is a cave that looks like a railroad / train road tunnel, and says he does not go there and what he does Normal things! EVERY RELIGIOUS! He goes there and finds many gladiator artifacts and armor, and he finds Tyrannous's legendary gladiator's almost perfectly protected body! The chair saw the location of Tyrannous from where he was sitting, and how good his body was and what earned Pottery Each cave was completed with a Caultron Pot? She wears a armor, a helmet, and has a weapon or two weapons. The worst thing a human can do is put on a helmet and taken by the spirit. <br /> <br /> Now I'm talking like a video game like him. It is very difficult to explain, but it just feels. Music even sounds like video games. The player is really terrible. The actors say why they did something, oh, I'm going home because it's nuts and pestilence! In addition, the movie has some great mistakes, and a boy tries to find his girlfriend during the night and is still working day by day. <br /> <br /> There are some mistakes in this movie, but this is not the case. Even though it's classic like Werewolf, you really enjoy the low-budget movies, and you'll see Demonicus better!
