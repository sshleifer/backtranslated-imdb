One of the three Best Stooges shorts. A dark house filled with bad guys and the "Goon" Alert Detective Agency's best men. Shemp is the most popular form-dark scene. Emil has excellent support in the role of Mr. Goodrich as the target of Sitka's murder. The "safe little shovel" has a great impact before the end of the challenge. This 16-minute stone moves like every Stooge's short and folds the wallop twice. Be advised.
