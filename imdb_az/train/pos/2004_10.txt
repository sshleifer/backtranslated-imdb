I acknowledge that I am a vampire addict: I have seen a lot of vampire films and this is the first in the first place. The original John Carpenter was very impressed by the Vampires and descovered when it was the next time he went straight out and bought it. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This movie does not follow the same rules and is so dark but it is close enough and I felt that it was beautifully built on the original. John Bon Jovi is as good as Derek Bliss: his performance was inaccessible and difficult enough for the viewer to believe he could be able to live in the world he lived in. One of my favorite feelings was to check whether Zoey and her gay boy had been in her bathroom before she was seen. <br /> <br /> Other shooting members were well-chosen and beautifully touched to make a fun and original movie. This is not just a rehash of the first movie, and has grown like the road that grows from the Fright Night II night of fear. <br /> If you love vampire movies, I recommend this topic. If your movies were less bloody, choose something else.
