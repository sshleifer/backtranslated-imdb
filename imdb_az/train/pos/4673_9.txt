One of the things that interests me about this film is the rapid development of heroes and their related history. I suppose that the writers wanted us to be interested in symbols without having to feed their characters. The main purpose of the furniture design and the use of art and craftsmanship was a unique theme and / or similarity for the survival of family and brothers. He served as a dual father who was a twin, and even a husband had a great tension to make this movie emotional. Also, although the story can directly associate the masses (ie, Jews / twins / family businesses), blackheads within each family are quite universal. It has attracted too much.
