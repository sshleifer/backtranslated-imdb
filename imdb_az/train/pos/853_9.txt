"Matador" stars like Pierce Brosnan burned. He went to tissue James Bond with a lot of textured, bare clothes, golden chains and an ugly haircut. The assassin, Julian Noble, who struggles to fight, is trying to recover his nerves. It is a bad thing to stay in the same hotel, its successful businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) tries to restore his equality. Danny hopes to close a deal and return to Denver (Hope Davis) with a good news with his wife. <br /> <br /> Noble and Wright are unexpectedly friends. Wright asserts Noble to put forward some of the techniques she has shown in a nightmare show. The noble end is targeted at employers and shows in Denver. <br /> <br /> Writer and director Richard Chapared Q & A after this amazing movie inside the Austin Film Festival. Sheffer also succeeded. After the disappearance of the agency and the recent scripts, he decided to write a story that nobody wanted to get and did not want to create. Then he called Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan restores balance in this movie. (There's life after Bond!) It can be a nice addition to the self-destructive comedy. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Stay tuned to read what the film makers say about bullion for past credits. We look forward to Richard Shepard's projects.
