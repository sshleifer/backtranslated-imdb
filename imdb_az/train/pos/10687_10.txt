I must admit that I'm totally shocked at this movie. First, I went to see something awful, but it was the most shocking thing in a populist American cinema. The English comedy is the best - never in the dark, quirky and funny American movies. At the same time, I should heartily recommend to everyone; Some people, some Englishmen, some European and some Americans, met some of us (first of all, the first two groups), others hated and were worthless. If you think that you are such a thing, go. If not, do not. 10/10.
