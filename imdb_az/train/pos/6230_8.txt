1936 was the most productive year for Astaire and Rogers. This year's second film for RKO is the third film in this collection? Mark Sandrichin's "Watch the Filo". This time Astaire, like Brian Baker, is just as sad as a sailor who wants to enter the toxic seafront caf√© where Sherry Martin (Rogers) is hit by romantic sweet nothings in everyone's ears. Yep, you guessed it? each other gets fired again. Only this time, Sherry's spinster sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard) Bake is a beautiful seafaring friend, all the wonderful romantic dangers falling for Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); use some sort and shoot them, so Sherry is forced to reconsider the views of all sailors. Irving Berlin classically gives you an unmilled class for high-grade, 'Let's go', 'Put all eggs in a basket' and 'Music and dance faces' standards. The second is a divinely-inspired sketch of suicide, which has become a well-known and thoroughly magnificent rust for Fred and Zinger. <br /> <br /> The transfer of the 'follow filo' is even weaker. The size of the sky remains beautifully balanced, but is now somewhat thicker than the previous one, though it is nearly a ton of change. Grain still exists. Age-related works are as follows. After placing a little tight and sometimes even gentle image quality, the overall impression is unacceptable for this grape film. Sound Mono, but very well balanced. Extras include a featurette, theater trailer and short theme, but oddly? there is no silent comment. Given the importance of this movie on Astaire / Rogers' common canon, this is an uncharacteristic control from Warner Home Video.
