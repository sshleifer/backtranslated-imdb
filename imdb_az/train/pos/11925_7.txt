I took the film to catch cables at noon. I have to admit that I am a great baseball fan, but sometimes I can enter into a movie about a good sport. I found it more interesting, it was a description of a foster family system. As a therapist who sees the community as good and bad as a mental health and illiteracy system, it has been freshened to see a film showing both of these systems fall and fall: family biological parents are always active and not likely transitions, but heart transmitting and heart- may be melting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the pillars of this film, and they bring very convincing speeches. Maybe it was just my emotional state, but at the end of the film I was shattered by a tear.
