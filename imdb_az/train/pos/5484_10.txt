Hugo Chavez's staff brought the Venezuelan people one by one to overthrow the three-day military junta and rebuild Venezuela's democratically-established government. <br /> <br /> It is clear from the shooting that George W Bush helped Venezuela's state coup. <br /> <br /> He said it was not surprising that US Secretary of State George Bush was backed up and under pressure. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how many people are in this movie and how many people have understood the overall mass of American media outlets. <br /> <br /> Ronald Reagan took only 20 years to eliminate the doctrine of justice in 1986. <br /> <br /> Mayki Hugo Chavez is a true American vision of the truth and beauty of American patriotic Americans.
