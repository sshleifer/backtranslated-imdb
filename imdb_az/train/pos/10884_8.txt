For a slasher flick, this movie is much better than genre. This predictable nuts work, killing someone, or even yada.however this movie has some good positive, I really liked the mask walnut cooking business. (although I have never watched a slasher movie), the origin of a bad cause is something I have ever seen before, and finally the end of it is a new concept, as far as I know. For most jinn, Mr. the patient really liked the weapon. Crimes themselves are not the most graphic. watching the movie, watching the movie, is a very charming thing, does not take it seriously, while watching the movie, "Friday" There are some concerns about several scenes of this movie. Suddenly the killer is just like one of our horror symphonies. However, I also talk about his actions and the reactions he has made and the way he draws. In spite of the worst disturbance, Mr. Craig has more to do with the craze. Another famous horror titan. Now, when compared to a striking analogy (not really a complete disassembly) on the last scene, we look at it once again as the first horror symbol we have mentioned. rip-off another character in the slasher genre. these scenes were weak and uncertain (obviously) .By the way, the film is set up in Australia, so if you are a chick (like me) with an Aussie accent, you will be in heaven. it's better just to touch many nice things about this movie: beautiful Kylie Minogoue (not just related to it), Molly Ringwald.overallas has a non-aussian accent without the control, there are more reasons to watch the note.i liked it and some fun .so, I need to give some people "Cut" 8/10, which may seem too loud.
