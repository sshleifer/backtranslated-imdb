As a person who has been cerebral palsy for forty years, I think this movie is inspirational. There is no reason why I can not fulfill my desires if there is a person who is in a serious condition like Christie Brown. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker both perform well. <br /> <br />
