This show goes fine. When I go out for the first time, though, there is much more than a light hearted family comedy, with just a few good liners. However, many families have been very well represented by different parenting and child's perceptions, but I said that I never thought more, and I did not expect a good hour in the evening. But during the disastrous death of a fantastic funny John Ritter, my idea was thrown out of another window. The program remained on the ground and really symbolized the life of the characters in a very sensitive way and touched the heart of all the fascinating Brothers John Ritter, a talented actor. When Ritters was shown after passing, I really wanted to just give my father a hug and let me know how much he did. I thought that the sparkle had thrown the moving talents of the three children, especially that it was uncomfortable with Bridget's character, his last words. He reminded me how terrible things are for my father, I do not want to say that, and it is very important to know that. Great show
