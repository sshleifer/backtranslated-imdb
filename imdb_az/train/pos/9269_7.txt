When I saw the secret ballot (2001), I knew that I knew Iran. <br /> <br /> A batch of British comedies has worked on a group of girls (one girl) to participate in a decisive soccer match for their country in the World Cup. Women are not allowed to participate in football matches, so the nation's armed forces have been mobilized to rescue women who want to join them. Some (teenage) girls are trying to frighten the party by wearing a boy, but they are captured. The film, basically, in this caption, claims that the girls are being held by the soldiers, and they expect an unspecified penalty (although they claim to be a sign of murder of a girl dressed as a soldier!) <Br / Film investigates the absurdity of the situation. The thoughts that women have on soccer matches are 100 years ago an unknown philosophy in the West. If a girl needs to go to the bathroom, it's a ridiculous thing, so one soldier, hearing the glaring demands and covering the graffiti. This conflict is not related to the fighting of the sexes: at one point there is friction between the peasants and the girls in the city. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this film is not culturally esoteric. The comedy lost on this neighbor and the great Satan's cultural brother. You need to be in the mood, but no one should be afraid of this movie because they think they will not take it.
