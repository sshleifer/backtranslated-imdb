The show is the two sisters living together. On the other hand, Holly's younger sister is Valin's job, boy-friendly, and most of the women in the planet have marriage problems. Sometimes they try to support each other, but they are unhappy and continue. And the show also speaks about friendship. Priorities in life. I liked this show very much. It's funny and the actors are very good. I am glad that the show is over. I'm still watching again :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth may be new to comedy, but he plays really well. She's one of the actresses she's watching. Vince and Holly's relationship is quite natural. Gary is a natural talent and every time you make it laugh. We found true friends with Tina Holly and I really love to hang them. Lauren's character is so funny and he's a natural talent. I would like to see him more. This show really takes you and laughs. I did not want the show to end.
