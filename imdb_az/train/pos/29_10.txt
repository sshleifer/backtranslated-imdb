There are some films that each Horror fan owes to itself (or himself) and Emilio Miraglyn's "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte" aka. "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is one of them. With Gialli and Gothic Tales on Horror, I was looking forward to anticipating this two-story sub-genre for a while, and although my expectations were high, this work surpassed my greatest hopes. Miraglia's previous Giallo, "Night Evelyn's Tomb Gate" (1971), was a creepy and loud atmosphere film that successfully interrupted Giallo with Gothic Horror, but could not be compared with that instant personal favorite. "The Seven Kills of the Red Queen" has become one of the most unique and popular Italian Horror Films, and no lover of this genre could lose. With an incredibly magnificent Giallo with Gothic elements, the "Red Genius" provides everything you can hope in sub-genre: An incredible, incredibly compelling field, a heart-cold tension, an immaculate compassionate vigilance and a real creepy atmosphere, /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The film begins with incredible gambling in Germany. Like little girls, Kitty Wildenbr√ºck and her sister Evelyn fought when explaining the story behind her father's rather unusual work: The legend shows that the heart of the red lady is about to return every hundred years and kill seven. Fourteen years later Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) became a successful fashion photographer. Suddenly, people are starting to kill ... Director Miraglia has already proven his unbelievable talent for style, atmosphere, and colorfulness, with Evelyn's Night Out of the Graveyard, and uses these elements more efficiently on this boat. "The Red Queen kills seven times" is really a celebration for the eyes and is one of the most intense and cunning Italian Horror films. Only attractive paintings in Dada's father's castle can give the audience a nut boom. The Red Lion (or the Red Queen, as it is called in English), is the most decisive figure in a Giallo, a heart-laughter accompanied by murders, even frightened. <br /> <br /> Hot female casting is always appreciated, especially with a Giallo, and the best example for that. Famous Barbara Bouchet (one of my favorite actresses) should be one of the most beautiful women on the screen, and she's a very good actress. Fritio Di Leone's "Milano Calibro 9", Lucio Fulci's Giallo-emphasis "Don", "Fernando Di Leo", among others, in 1972, played in three of the biggest French-style cinemas of the 70th cinema, T shooting torture " and this unforgettable stone, besides the beautiful Miss Bouchet, includes the beautiful female female sexy young woman Sybil Danning, Marina Malfatti ("Evelyn Evelyn's Tomb Gate") and other beauties that are not afraid for the camera. <br /> <br /> The murders are stylish and extremely elegant, but it is frightening and surprising, and some are strange - Bruno Nicolay's admirable account is remembered as a memorable and even more intensely captivating the film's vibrant atmosphere.The field was created and filled with red bread, The "Red Hero ..." begins to creepy and is disappointed in the last second. "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times", the best among the best Gialli, and is a top priority for every fan of Horror and / or Italian cinema. 10/10
