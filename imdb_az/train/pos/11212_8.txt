This picture appeared in 1975 and became the second in three parts of Sheriff Buford Pusser's life. Bo Svenson takes on the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser and plays the role of Luke Askew Mobster Pinky Dobson. After putting Sheriff Pusser in a bedside bed after his wife and his wife, the Prophet (who rescues his wife after the death of his wife, Pusser, can Pusser complete his revenge before succeeding? The only thing that disturbs me about this picture It's a real truth story, how can you leave such a crime in a city, and you can not do anything about it yet because it's an actress who does not have a real name in this picture, I can not give 10 stars without a star, but I can give 8
