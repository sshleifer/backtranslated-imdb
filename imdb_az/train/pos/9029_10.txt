A few days ago I saw this movie. This movie is so great that I feel that if you want something really bad, you always dream about it - you can do it. This is a great desire, really progress is a sign of happiness and sadness, hopelessness and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart is really something you love, you can make everything different and happy.
