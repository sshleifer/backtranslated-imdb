I've seen this movie featured in the movie I directed in the list of movies for the Santa Barbara Film Festival I went to where I was in Hollywood. Basically there is a choice of the new chairman of the Hong Kong Triads Wo Sing Society, so you can imagine the intensity that will take place during this time. Fighting "Candidates" is under the control of Lam Lok (Simon Yam) and Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai), the oldest and most powerful Triad of society. Like Lou Koo Jimmy Lee, Nick Cheung Jet, Mr. So Soon as Cheung Siu Fai, Lam Suet's Big Head and Lam Ka Tung's Role as the Day. After being attracted by police, there are probably some very good real-life cases and moments, but since they are persecuted, this is a pretty dramatic criminal drama tension. Very Good!
