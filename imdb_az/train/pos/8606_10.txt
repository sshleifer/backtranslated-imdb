Apparently, there is no middle level in this movie! Many of them are asleep and, like most dreams, are often foolish and illogical. <br /> <br /> Some great songs, especially our angels, are a beautiful production with some beautiful songs and beautiful performances. <br /> <br /> Jeanette's betrayal and other different lines of dishonesty are treacherous and Binnie Barnes is a surprise and a delight. At one point, he reads a piece from Carmen, then the last three of Faust (lapdog for a strange reason), and then on the Aloha Oe coast! <br /> <br /> This is a real comedy.
