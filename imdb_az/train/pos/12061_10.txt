Once in the wonderful world of horror, diamonds are made and one feels completely scared. This is not less than a diamond! This is a similar movie, an unexpected and dark atmosphere, and I can say one of the most loved horror films of all time! And, of course, it is likely to have a single, straightforward, frightening number in all fears! Whenever I watch the movie and get to the point where you know it will happen inevitably, I'll be fully aware of my fears, but it will never happen; I will never accept it and it has turned into terror as I have seen it for the first time! Now, it's not a good thing to be scared of such a pitiful, fear-inspiring fanfare. Unlike the Americans, the British know their subtleties, are proud of the art of playing, no special effect is needed to convey to the atmosphere, they rely on the power of a powerful story, your suggestion and your expectation. Every element is flawless, from certain tracks, players, stories, to a dangerous atmosphere. Pauline Moran undoubtedly can do the shout of Satan, I'm sure! Lastly, if you do not like this ignorance for a weak reason, you know what horror is and you do not clearly know it. Thank you very much!
