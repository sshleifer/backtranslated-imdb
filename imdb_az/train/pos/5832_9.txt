I have never watched it ever since I watched this movie 30 years ago as a child. From the opening scenes in the horn factory to the car running from the rear seat of the car, the telephone was accidentally slammed by Stan to the phone, perhaps possibly the last of them. After that, they moved to the Fox of the 20th century, and they were not afraid of these films, and they did not lose the funny time of this film. Jimmy Finnlayson, their long-lasting foil, the latest appearance with the boy, showing the doctor as super! QUESTION: "I said goat's pillar," he responded to Stan, "how did a ghost get him milk?" Show Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin! I say in one of all my favorite L & H comedy.
