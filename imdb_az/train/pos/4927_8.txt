Just a comment on the New Orleans accents ... <br /> <br /> A former theorist mentioned: "This film could have been shot in New York or another North Greater city, more like broklynese, perhaps South part of it can be heard in this part of the country. "<br /> <br /> Many people in New Orleans actually say" brocclynese ". Why I never knew it. (Referred to in "Dunes Confederation" by John Kennedy Toole). I always appreciate these tables about the films in New Orleans. Very often this is the only Hollywood version of the standard South accent.
