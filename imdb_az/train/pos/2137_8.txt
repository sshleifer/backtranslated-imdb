This is more than a seductive story of a middle-aged man who discovered the taste of small dances (though that's it). It's a story of a person who learns to love life again by transferring all the pressures and money to learn more about joy. This film is an interesting idea about slow-changing relationships of modern Japan towards everything from bonus ball dances to physical contact. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a great introduction to a modern Japanese movie for a few days, for those who can be impressed with all the Japanese movies being "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
