This is one of the best-selling films ever produced by feature films. The concept was really cool and distinct, humor was unique, and I just felt that there were misspelled opportunities for this movie. So many lines and gags have long been hanging out, it did not end exactly, and it really made me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman were good. Wanda Sykes was less used in this film and needed more opportunities to spend more time and spend more time. For me, 10 to 7, more DVD rentals. In addition, during the recent loans, this kind of romantic comedy was something of a kind of trademark, something about Mary, something that has managed to get to know the parents, it's a bit more music and punchier punch lines can be a better movie felt less deceived. As if it were transferred to theaters.
