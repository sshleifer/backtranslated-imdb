It was a great way to spend time to watch a very hot summer weekend, sitting in the air-conditioned theater and watching a light hearted comedy. The site is simple, but the dialogue is witty and I like the characters (even a good serial killer in a good bakery). In some cases, it can be frustrating when they are understood: Article 2: Risk Addiction, I thought Woody Allen was still in control of the style we love. <br /> <br /> It was the most laughing thing in one of Vudin's comedies (I say ten years)? I have never been surprised by Scarlet Johanson, so he succeeded in reducing his "sexy" look and becoming a healed young girl. <br /> <br /> This was a great comedy for his career, but more intimate than the "Devil Wears Prada" and to meet friends who are more interested in Superman.
