While Sherrie and Cage are the main points of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good partners for them - Loretta and Ronny are in love for 50 years - still in love. All the casting works from Aiello to John Mahoney - it shows the real life span. Despite being seen a long time ago, Cage was finally assigned to Hollywood for his skills. From music to opera areas to kitchen table arguments - this is a very funny movie.
