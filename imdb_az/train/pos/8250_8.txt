This film takes place in the 1950s. That is why (dead zombies) were created to eat living things. However, when a company was carrying zombies, it prepared a collar for its elegant and perfect service. The Robinsons mother, Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), father Bill (Dylan Baker) and his son Timmy (K'Sun Ray) work for a zombie, because everyone in their block is already one. Tim Froid calls the zombie (Billy Connolly) and becomes his friend. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that there is a lot in Fossa and Lassie series. Get up for Lassie. Timmy is named for one reason! Each of the famous Lassie episodes has fun here. What I'm fond of, Timmy, when the zombies close Fido to get help before eating! Also, the Douglas Circus movies of the 1950s have a satirical of everything bright and colorful - but dark secrets separate people. The symbols are very brilliant in the 1950s (Moss is always wearing a cloth) - furniture, options and cars are especially brilliant in the 1950s. Even if the scenario is repeated, there is always something to look at. The scenario is good - but there are so many things that Lassie students can do. Melodramas are somehow foolish, but the cast leads them. Everyone here is perfect and rightly justified. Even Connolly is a good job, even as an empathetic zombie. <br /> <br /> Moss is the best - he plays for all the values ​​of each line, but he will never enter the boat. <br /> This is not for everyone (of course). This satire can be missing in most people and is therefore a great thing. Performed in a remarkable way and plays with happy music, it is difficult to accept seriously. So, for some people, this will really work. I'll give it 8.
