Caine and Reeves (really magical romances and I'm Dyan Cannon - normally do not care about me - as an actress) I'm not going to worry about making this arrangement in the first 5th list of the "Sting of the Death Trap" <br /> <br /> I am not sure that Deaththrap can be compared to Sleuth - adapting to a brilliant stage with Michael Caine - is valid, even fair. Well, two stories but the Sleuth class is like a battlefield of war ideas, and the house in Sleuth is characterized by a character as at least two actors - there is no equivalent in the Deaththrap of the house, and how Deaththrap is " (and they are not as clever as they have never thought), and not a good idea I'll just say that the two films are beautiful examples of the genre and they value your time and money. After all this is America. You do not have to choose! <br /> <br /> My wife has just begun. I watched the DVD for eight or nine times over the course of a few years, and when it was all "pear-shaped", chemistry and timing enjoyed average, terrible moments. <br /> <br /> Everyone who likes Hitchcock's mixed comedy and tension in filmmaking will probably enjoy the great Deaththrap.
