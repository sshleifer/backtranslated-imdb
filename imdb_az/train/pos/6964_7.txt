It looked like a great concept on paper: The average man in Rebound is a compact curator of the intense book enviromental museum, a really hot Superhero, who regularly rescues the world. But film director Ivan Reitman and writer Don Payne (from Simpson) are considered to be falsely mistaken by the hero G-Girl (stunning Uma Thurman), both as Superhero and Jennifer Johnson, a common nonsense. . The film follows such a conversation after the G-Girl's Statue of Liberty between Jenny and Matt Saunders (Luke Wilson). Jenny asks what G-Girl from Matt asks. Matt answers, "Is he strange?" In my opinion, Jenny (Thurman) is the only woman in her life who is isolated by her great physical strength. Thurman can do his best, but it's a terrifying mood that Jenny Prozaci needs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "My Super Ex-Girlfriend" Superhero plays straight, so talk. The movie "My Super Ex-Girlfriend" was funny and entertaining, with all its strange and inappropriate content. That would be better, because it's a Ivan Reitman movie. Reitman begins with a great foundation and really wastes it. First, we love the protagonist. Here's what Jenny or G-Girl really looks like. It is striking for Uma Thurman, who has a charismatic and strong presence in normal times. Initially his Jenny / G-Girl is simply strange. Shock. If you are a woman playing a Superhero, she is Thurman. She looks nice. It is more sympathetic to her end than just her Jenny cartoon. "My Super Ex" is not a straightforward Superhero story, but rather a romantic comedy, but it does not require any superhero mythology. Here is Professor Bedlam aka Barry (Eddie Izzard), who is really a bad lite. Not Lex Luthor. There is no plan for global domination. Bedlam does not have much Barry G-Girl's intentions and is expected to have an affair with their past. Whom did you want to spend time with Bedlam or G-Girl? Luke Wilson's Matt is just a "psychic super hero" who happens to be "some dude". One of the things that is in confusion is that he is confident that Rainn Wilson, with his horrible missing friend, Vaughn. Wilson sometimes plays a little too tightly, and this reduces his good impression. However, she works on a comic sex scene with Jenny. When talking to Jenny / G-Girl, Matt understands that he is in love with his colleague Hannah (perky Anna Faris). So how does Matt break up with G-Girl? <br /> <br /> Dramatic Superhero movies work. Romantic comedy with chemical work. Superhero will be spectacular, with satirists hidden as romantic comedies. Everyone loves the hero. But the hero's nut work? Maybe not. Not all of Uma Thurman's talent can accomplish this. And Reitman and Payne did not get enough support. Thurman and Wilson have enough charm and availability to survive their described mistakes. "My Super Ex-Girlfriend" is fun and funny. Despite all this, the film might have been super.
