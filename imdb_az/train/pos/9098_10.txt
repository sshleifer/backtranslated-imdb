The Domestic Import was a great movie. He laughed all the time. It was funny at levels quite up to the hilarious situations in crazy outfits. The player was very nice. Alla Korot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hesseman and many others have done a great job. Since it is an independent film for the first time, there are no more clicks than other comedies that have such a relief. It was unique and interesting and you fell in love with characters and heart warming. Did I hear you have a real story? If so, then it's funny (and beautiful!). I love this movie.
