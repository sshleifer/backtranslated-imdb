Although I do not usually remakes remakes believing in the loss of time in general; this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> Because of life and writing, I did not know anything so far until you read the previous comments. No question: Capote. <br /> <br /> The performance of Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is very beautiful. I've seen a movie with them, each one in one or another. I was convinced that there were good actors, and in Eric's case, I always asked her sister that she was No. 1 and that she was not her brother. This time, this decision was raised to the truth, no question. <br /> <br /> I'm coming to see this movie in the top 50 films and keep it on your DVD shelves.
