This is a really classic film in the story, actor and film presentation. Spectacular actors, throughout the entire film, are full of Miss Sullivan and Jimmy Stewart's best characters. In real life he was very admired and liked Jimmy and really played for him first and helped him to more calm his appearance on the crowds. The "chemistry" between the two was always clear and warm and happy. She was such a beautiful, young woman, and sweet in her personality pictures. It's a charming and pure magic fun to watch the story of two young people and eventually the things they come together in. Heart warming presentations are provided by other supporting actors in this wonderful story / movie. I'm giving Miss Sallivan the perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classroom, which has a special appeal for all these generations. A must have for everyone!
