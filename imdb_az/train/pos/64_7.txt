Paul F. Ryan's first and only full length feature. He has not done anything since that day. But she could get an amazing ensemble to describe her story characters. I did not know when or why Ryan's head appeared, but Ryan then wrote a scenario that turned him into a "Home Room". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Busy Philipps film Alicia on her shoulders, an uncomfortable girl; we always see in the television series. With black hair and black dresses; a pack of cigarettes in his pocket, strange appearance and eyes that are uncomfortable (of course with makeup). An incident happened in the school; a shot. Some of the students died and I saw everything. Detective Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber) investigates the case and is suspected in Alicia as expected. But the shooting is just genesis; <br /> <br /> Dean Cartwright (Erika Christensen) lying in bed in a bedroom. One of the survivors of the hospital. The script comes from the school principal (James Pickens Jr). He helps all students survive the accident, but Alicia does not care about it. He was isolated. So the author punishes him; Deanna needs to visit every day up to five days. Then the movie starts. <br /> <br /> I can not describe how beautifully the movie was written. I know heroes and their situations; I love the truth. This can happen to everyone. And what they say is completely understood. They grow up and try to deal with what they are experiencing; they do their best. Without knowing it, Alicia (when Deanna visits for the first time) and Deanna (when she sees Alicia's face) begins a journey that identifies her identity and ideas for the next step in her life; after high school. <br /> <br /> The director directs Christensen and Philipps well in their role. Look different from them. Deanna seems naive and straightforward; There is no complexity in the mind. When Alicia saw tons of flower when entering her room, she said, "Who brought them?" She asks. "Many people," Deanna answers; A few days later, we learn that we are from the parents each week. Parents are well represented in figures, but not as important as their son's symbols. Deanna is alone. Alicia looks mature and severe; smoke and rarely speak. Only two days later, he sees himself coming to the hospital every day; She sleeps all night in Deanna's room. When both have a fight then Deanna says: "Why are you going back?" Alicia is also the only one. <br /> <br /> The end of the film will cause a bit of desperation without destroying it; this is not what I expected. Eliminates some of the power of the movie. Revelation is completely unnecessary; it could destroy the logic of the film. Anyway, this was an excellent post; and in the excellent direction. <br /> <br /> As to Erika Christensen, she had a role to fly higher. The role of "Traffic" was very striking, but that was a big step; key role. Perhaps most of them had the chance to see it in this movie and, unfortunately. Since then, I did not take a wrong step. It has come out with good performances in terrible movies. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Busy Philipps, who proved to be very promising in this film (what transformation), did not create many opportunities for another role. <br /> <br /> I'm expecting the same Paul F. Ryan (guilty, curse) and I'm now sitting down on his computer to finish the new script; I'm waiting for her next movie. I hope for the best of them all.
