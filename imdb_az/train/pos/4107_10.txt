I loved this movie! It's really strange, it's funny, sick, smart ... It's a little trifling to talk about the content of the movie, because in the end, I would like to give it a try! You should see this without knowing it! Everything is closed and its reason and reason. Until you can imagine the worst crisis you can imagine, it starts so subtle and then things start faster and faster! Watching the movie for the second time is even more fun, once you know all the "tips". The actors are perfect, especially the last scenes of Ivan Troyen! I love this movie, it's one of the most original I've ever seen!
