Elizabeth Taylor starring in this classic as a young girl from London, who is in love with the British Ceylon tea-grower (now Sri Lanka). Arrives immediately to the Arctic, and is forced to adapt to new culture, and knows that the angry elephant is permanent. William Dieterle, who directed Emile Zola's life and Jennifer Portrait, is a masterpiece to bring a little bit of darkness, and it is almost as pleasant as the romantic enjoyment and the setting is one of the most beautiful white-themed lodges and beautiful island scenery I've ever seen.
