I like this presentation - I read Bleak House and know how hard it is to present all the book, and I must admit that even people like Dorrit - a very good show with scenic Nicholas Nickelby. I love Diana Rigga and saw the pain of Lady Dedlock despite the aristocracy's anticipated haughtiness. I'm sorry, I think it's the best Lady Dedlock ... I'm not sure who can do a better Jarndy, but I'm good with Mr Elliot. It's not easy to introduce long Dickens books - Oliver Twist would be easier - it's long, and if you do not pay attention to all legal situations, it can be intimidating or boring. I think that this presentation is fun enough not to be missed. I just loved Mr Smallweed - it can be fun. There is always a child - Jo will break your heart here ... I think we should have the chance to dominate myself ... <br /> I have to say that I love my show. Perhaps, when I read my book again, it may be more critical after seeing the movie. Meanwhile, I think it's a good presentation.
