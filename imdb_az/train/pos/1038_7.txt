I like the movie. I also liked the majority of these players. But for me, Mr. Davis's very bad attempts at an accent and his hard-working player really takes a hard time watching. <br /> <br /> Any other modern actor laughing sidely on the screen when playing in the same way as the real singer. <br /> <br /> I really think that's what I called. <br /> If my wife was Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman, I'd be happier. <br /> <br /> I think I'm not going to Davis. <br /> <strong> "Now Voyager" may be the exception. <br /> <br /> I am sure that other reviewers will be very cautious. (and I hope that civilians) I'm absolutely wrong about that. But I will continue watching movies because I love / write / support stories, but think of different actresses who might have done a better job.
