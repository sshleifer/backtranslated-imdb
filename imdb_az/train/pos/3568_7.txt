This film propagates the story of Cinderella until the early 1950s, and uses it as a backdrop of Indonesia. The ugly sisters were amazed at the glamorous high-level English girls and, like Kathleen Turner, was a mother-in-law who shot suits at different times. The story changes slightly from the traditional version: Early this strangely united with King Lear, and in the later stages Cinderella is more ambitious than usual. It looks fine and works pretty well all the time, but it does not have to top up.
