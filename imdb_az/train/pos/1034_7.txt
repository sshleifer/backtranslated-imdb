I think this movie was stronger when it first appeared in 1943, though it is still a lot of propaganda and static today to convey it to greatness. The film was produced in 1940 - before the US entered the war. Paul Lukas plays his family's brave and decent head. He is the Almighty who fights against the Nazis for seven years, and is preventing the capture. Bette Davis is a very compassionate and patient wife who has the ability to train and raise children without herself from time to time. <br /> <br /> After the film's launch, Mexico has crossed the border to the United States and is going to rest and stop for the first time for years. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem was my family was perfect and very worthy - to accept them as a positive propaganda instead of a real family for real problems. Although it has a very rich purpose, it looks just fake today. In particular, the rather strange and extremely scripted dialogue used by children was not just a real one. It sounded like more anti-fascist speeches than real children's voices. They came to a very boring conclusion - at least one man, sometimes as a brat. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis and her expanded American family and the Romanian rumen living with them (though she was not an unwritten accent) were about real ones. <br /> <br /> I hope the famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialogue because it simply shows that life is not right. This story was prepared by her lover, Lillian Hellman. And the main idea is good idea and structure ... but dialogue is sometimes bad. Generally, a movie with an interesting curio and some excellent moments ... but that's really all.
