Anyone who sees this movie and looks badly, sends them Roger Ebert's review for this movie. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> <strong> It can not be perfect or great, but I liked it. A Chorus Line is not so much a story because Broadway is a story group about the lives of philanthropists. People have read investigations that say that Zach and Cassie spend too much time on romance. This is an incorrect look. Another story along with other stories that Broadway nominees have been described. People did not realize that the ballet dancers for Broadway shows pass the same thing as common people. And therefore, I think, is the true meaning of all demonstrations. It's not just to show the talent of these dancers, but to give us some stunning things to think about life. This is a study of life as a Broadway star. Everyone who wants to be a Broadway star has gone through this movie, just as the symbols are going through, because it sees a great deal of communication. <br /> <br /> This is great music. It has its slowest points, and sometimes it is a little bit confused with the pacing of a particular storyline, but I absolutely love it. Take a closer look at the movie, and then you will understand what I'm talking about.
