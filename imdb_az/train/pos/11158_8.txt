<br /> <br /> <p> <p> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Incubus is the secret of a terrible crime , which also causes hunger and warm climate clutter. Crime scenes are tense and unguarded, so this is not a movie for murder! John Hough's direction is combined with a strange music account to create a dark atmosphere that flies away from the film. It also carries some kind of Gothic vibe. Great John Cassavetes, as a new doctor in the city, <br /> <br /> Incubus is also a good-looking, fear-inspiring film around the Incubus, a local correspondent for Kerry Kane, Helen Hughes historian and Duncan McIntosh. <br /> <br /> *** ***
