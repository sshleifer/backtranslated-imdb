I was amazed at the beautiful photography in this film shot in Alaska. Although technically melodrama, Eskimos is hunting, dancing, creating igloes, and so on. We deal with some activities. And their traditions, as well as presenting their spouses to guests, are in the story. Some of the animal species were sometimes of animal origin because they knew some of the animals' rear projection scenes, but they were also interesting. For the salmon, sprinkling, maryoz, caribou, and even a polar bears and whale fishing sometimes appeared as a documentary. There is no castle list that strengthens your documentary taste. The filmmakers encouraged it to be very original, and the local people were only speaking in Eskimo or translated into one on the screen or intertitles. In the presentation, there were no actors in the film, except for the white traders and the Royal Marine Police Organization, but that's not really true. The two leading characters played by Mala and Lotus Long were Eskimos from birth but were professional actors with credits for previous films and sometimes they made makeup. But they were perfect in their role and continued their Hollywood career. All of this is definitely worth the look of the film.
