This series has bought me because of Deighton's writing and it's young, and I love the story of this story. I will not agree with the above statement. What I have read in the past is not the Holm's performance, which led Deighton to refuse to release the series, but the mosquitoes they receive in the transformation of all three books. A great example of this is the re-writing of the border crossing that ends with Samsun's field career. The scene was not in the book, but in the mines, it was not in any book, and the transition from Sinker to East Germany was not to West Germany, to the Polish border. All this piece of piece of story. Changes in the set impact the story's integrity. I believe that my prospect for Holm's performance is that she is describing Samsun's disability during her husband's flaws, and she is trying to show the old agent's agent in a delightful way. Samson also pays off his father's idealism and suffers from his influence on his life. As Clevemoree had said, he had been educated himself, possibly leading the department. I think the true performance loss is far more than the physical appearance. Holm has dropped his book compared to Samson - a physically challenging man, able to use his size.
