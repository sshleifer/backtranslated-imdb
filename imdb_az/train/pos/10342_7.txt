Melvyn Douglas gives a more polished performance, this time he lives in a role of a detective who can not show his love for the task and adventure, and talented Joan Blondell wrote a novel about his early life) as strangely as his beloved lover. Almost a screenplay comedy, almost a Thin Man film, is almost a series of sequels. It does not reach the classic status, but it has 85-minute episodic but sensitive scripts, a beautiful character and all the ingredients in the way that keeps all the movements, so if Williams (Douglas) finds no clarity, it's not Columbo. I would like to have more films like this.
