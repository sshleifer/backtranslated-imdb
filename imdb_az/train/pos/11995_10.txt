"Spin it!" <br /> <br /> The TaleSpin, a television cartoon series of the 90's, the "Jungle Book," was opened with a cute Disney favorite. Connect to Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker, because they have never seen the sea ducks: from Cape Suzette, Louie's, mountains, water, water, volcanoes, adventure, looking for treasure, looking for fun, all in an action-packed cartoon adventure !!!!! <br /> <br /> This was something I and my family loved. This Disney fled in the afternoon, until the original cartoons in the first half of the 90s fled to the Old Disney Channel in 1995 and I was on vacation in 1996 before wiring in March 1997. <br /> <br /> And good news: DVDs are here today !!!!! <br /> <br /> 10/10
