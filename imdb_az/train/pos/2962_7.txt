Parker and Stone have miraculously overthrowed their charming heroes from a masterpiece of animation to a feature-length live action movie. Most of the film runs Amok with Trey and Matt's new toy box. The simplicity of the field is: two middle-aged children are inventing a new sport, and basketball basketball is combined with a baseball score that has become a national wrestling. They encounter numerous sports films on the way and send them along with any other popular culture that goes their way. <br /> <br /> If this movie had a weakness, it gave us the combination of the team consisting of the "Aircraft" and "Naked Gun" series. This effect is commonly seen by the use of bare sight sticks and the presence of brilliant and incredibly two-dimensional Yasmine Bleeth given to Priscilla Presley. Robert Vaughn plays Boutitt and Ernest Borgnine better than just a corporate game that has been his party piece that should overwhelm his overactive, but has to admit that he is perfect for the role of his comic team owner. /> <br /> For those who have not yet seen, Parker and Stone, the rock star looks more like a novel. This prefers noise in everything they do. As always, the good ultra-non-computer tool here is a good choice, including compulsory tracking by DVDA. <br /> <br /> Dian Bachar needs a special note, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> "Stan" formula. Parker and Stone can do something really brilliant (or totally horrible) if they give full control over the future film. America, lock these guys or put them in charge.
