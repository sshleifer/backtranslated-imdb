Action. Comedy. Thirst. This movie is all there. <br /> <br /> Our goal is to show that 4 professional thieves will be invited to attend a heist in a small town in Montana. Every kind of crime movie archetype is here. Frank, the main mind. Carlos is a weapon expert. Max, an explosive expert. Nick, safe cracker and Ray, car man. Unfortunately for Frank, he was captured by 2 bumbling detectives who followed him by writing New Jersey after sending the other 4 letters (well described by Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck). <br /> <br /> Our 4 symbols are met at the train station, and none of them is similar to each other or do not trust each other. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> In addition, Frank Franko is gone and they are not sure if they have come together. <br /> <br /> Frank is now being returned to New Jersey by a detective but soon runs and runs <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Overall a good movie for everyone looking for a laugh or something a bit different
