The mass pushes down a lot of waist! People who do not like me were surprised there! I saw it at 10 am and I am still scared! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers / horror movies! When I cry with a high voice, I'm 22! I want to say that OK, sound effect is not particularly good b-film-work. But the true view of terror, sound effects, flow! Shooting with pre-repeated, rebellious, ruthless, hesitating scenes! Thus, many clich√©s do not hesitate to scare anyone! Come, you know, come, come, BOO! and still skipped from the cafe. Hold a pillow and blankets, seek out your closest friend and do not watch the night! Hats to the Japanese!
