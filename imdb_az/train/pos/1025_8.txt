My price applies to the first 4 seasons of Stargate SG-1, which is fresh, creative and addicting. When you cross the casting gate, you never know what lies on the other side! From the 5th of the season, the show drew a different point - still good, but different. <br /> <br /> The sequence follows the adventures of a group of (and alien) groups that regularly visit a vehicle on a planet. "Stargate". Behind the array is based on the characters and events of the film Stargate, which was discovered during the archeological excavations of Egypt. <br /> <br /> Episodes are lightweight (innocent and easy to follow) and are very creative. Most of the innovative stories have easily become fantastic fantasy films. <br /> <br /> Shielding is also well-understood and brilliant. Their voice is serious, but dialogue is flourishing with incredible wisdom and humor. <br /> <br /> Starting somewhere around the 5th season, he began to turn into a stormy story against a single enemy (Goa'uld, then Ori). Areas become more complicated (more politically / strategically oriented) and are interconnected. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> They simply do not miss. <br /> <br /> If you are a fantastic fan, watch a few episodes of the first 4 Seasons and you will probably be hooked. If you like story lines developing between two opposing sides, you have 10 seasons to wait.
