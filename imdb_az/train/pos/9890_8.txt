Unfortunately, this movie never came to DVD. I saw it when I first went to theaters in 1983 and saw it again in 1992 when the VHS was released. Recently, when I saw a VHS copy on a bit market, I immediately got it. I'm not disappointed. First, obviously: Claudia Ohana is a nice and pleasing thing. But then, the film takes you to the unreal world that you need to think about your values ​​and decide what is really important to you. The movie is about a lot of things. That is how the World Bank and large companies use capitalist schemes and how they use their countries to force debtors to pay their debts. Our economic system is forcing us to exploit credit cards, mortgages and car loans. This really tries to get rid of innocence that has never been and can not really be saved. It's good and bad, and some are difficult to talk about. It raises many questions but does not answer. Sometimes it is good that I think. For this reason, this is a film that is dreaming and vision.
