At first, I did not want to watch this movie when it came to my book, but when I looked at IMDb, I thought it would try to hold a film like Elephant. <br /> <br /> When I thought I did not like the Alicia character I played well by Busy Phillips, I realized that this film was doing a good job of establishing relations between Alicia and Deanna. Alicia says that Deanna's film, played by Erika Christensen, is almost for the whole movie, but eventually they are involved in the fighting and there is something for polar interaction. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed seeing how much this movie liked and about all the positive comments about it. I could not get it in Ivory, because it exploited Columbus's tragedy. On the other hand, this movie was attractive and realistic. COVER SUBJECT TO BUSY FILLIPS ACTIVITIES! This is a good thing, and I would like to see his progress again in mature roles.
