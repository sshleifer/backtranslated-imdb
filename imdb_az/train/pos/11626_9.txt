It's a 85-minute supernatural breakdown by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Science Street) and it's a terrific thing - an excellent, fast-paced tension that offers something bad to people. Jackson's Rickner has a better character than Freddy Kruger and has a wonderful, friendly, even charismatic killer who has Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins). Presentations by Murphy and Rachel McAdams (Claire from The Wedding Crashers) are brilliant. Most of the film is at a very sincere level, with two people holding their eyes on their faces. It is not a large scale of moderation, it is a small scale of action, and less restrictive for these limitations. Cinematography is not something special, of course, with a camera inside a boundary of a passenger jet, but the dialogue is great, the story is striking. There is no devastation, shadows mix the battle between the main characters in their hearts. Wes Craven, with its focus and destructive behavior, can turn into a very minimal area and an exciting, rapidly moving motion tension.
