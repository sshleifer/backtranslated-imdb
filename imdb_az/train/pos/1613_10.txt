This movie is still the best of all time. Only one ambitious, humorless moron would not enjoy this amazing movie. This movie feels like a hot apple pie cut in French vanilla ice cream! I think this is the most beautiful work of Sher and its most reliable performance. Cher has always been blessed with charisma, good looks and delicate subtle figures. Do you like his performance, do not you want it - to whom else does it sound like Cher? Cher has definitely put his engagement in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others come and go. He is one of the rarest artists there. It's ridiculous, for whom would Shery think like a natural talented actress? It's up on the "stars" of today's film. Cher is a real actor at the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett, and others, because he never looks like a "act of action", and is really characteristic. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> I'm tired of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> How delicious food is served from a remote distance while watching the scene at the dining table at the same time each time sitting alone. I've seen spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but can not they do the ravioli, ziti meal? What is the main course? It looks nice and it nuts me! <br /> <br /> This family was a hardworking individual and respected and cared for each other. Dada was not abandoned and disobedient, she was an important part of the family and was respected and respected by her age and wisdom. Loretta's mother was not a "housewife" but a sticky one that kept her family alive and was an example of her husband's example. , wish to become a home and home manager. She was proud of her lifestyle, but she did not allow her to identify who she was. High-energy businessmen are not as comfortable as the skin of Rose Casserini. "I did not have a child after I was 37 years old," he continued calmly. You have noticed that you are a type of young woman who does not like to tell her about her and likes her. She was attractive, sensitive and very clever. What a great host! <br /> <br /> I really did not like Loretta because she was not really adventurous and seemed to be part of something like self-control as she wanted others to think. . He could have told others about himself and the places he went wrong, but he did not really put up with his own life. She was going to marry a middle-aged mama because she was a spouse and wanted the purpose and purpose of her life. It was more eastern than his mother. He was wearing and wearing a mattress like a prisoner in prison, and he looked depraved and bored, but because he felt down to you, he was sensitive and lonely, and he had many love for the right person. <br /> <br /> Leyla and Raoney have a high class, laughing happy kids and a wonderful home with Rose and Cosmo in the future.
