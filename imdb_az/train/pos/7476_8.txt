Indeed, I felt the real sense of the movie, when the clever games from the dream come true with Tom Cruise, into the superficial aspect of the future. I do not care much about Tom Cruise, but I do not have to say that the film has an impression on every point ... it's not just an interesting story, but also a beginning character. .. then talk together and become beautiful. However, it should be said that this film will not come under "coincidence of the weekend" that you accidentally chose and cherish; It has strong emotions and symbols, so wash beer and popcorn. Of course, there is more of that.
