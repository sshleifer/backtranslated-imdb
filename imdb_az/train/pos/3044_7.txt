This is the best example for anyone who does not know what an actor is. This area is ridiculous and does not really mean anything. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan can do something incredible and this movie is no exception. Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil are all worthy of a job ... But Megastar, who shattered everyone with his strong presence. With it, this movie would be non-starter ... The story is good for divorce / wrong identity / misunderstanding / love / hate / loyalty / bad - everything is really! Amitabh's brilliant performance on all the counts of another clever film! And did you notice that I was ridiculous funny?
