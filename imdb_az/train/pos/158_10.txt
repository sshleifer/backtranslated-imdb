I have seen this movie more than once and always complains about one of the "plot structures". But then - this is part of the Petzold game: he plays along with the rules of the genre. <br /> <br /> How amazing is an incredible story about how the two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) encountered. an even more incredible story that would prepare for a cast of gold. This film is a journey between truth and science, and more about potential, things that can happen in the past or what's going to happen in the future is much more than actual debate. It's kind of surprising, and there are so many motives that Freud could be interested in dream analysis, like all the "doppelganger" conventions. In addition, Gespenster may be interested to be seen as though it is actually compared to the current Asian cinema: Petzold's everyday city architecture is a strange, strange way to experience. This movie is not obvious. The story of Gespenster does not talk much about the nature of Gespenster, as a story of an orphan who does not have an acquaintance and ultimately describes the story of two daughters with friends and lover, or an orphan who is looking for Europe for her lost girl.
