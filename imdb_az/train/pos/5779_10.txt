For the beginner, I did not give any information about this show since the internet for one year. Once in my country, I did not see it on TV before, and many people are usually not informed about this show. Unfortunately, this is the most original and intelligent animation that I can easily witness for many years. <br /> <br /> I do not give 10 points, but it's really 10 points. Although this may seem like a typical cartoon, although this is not a child-show, first of all. When you come up with a complete story, you know that it's a deep story with a moral message. This spiritual part of the story is largely based on spiritual animals, believing that an old Hindu has been kept for many years. <br /> <br /> This gives you an original twist that will not be found on the show directly in animated shows. <br /> <br /> The overall design is also very different. Sometimes, Spawn looks a little strange in terms of design, and at other times takes more cartoony approach. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <strong> It shows that reality, suicide, morality, and life are involved, and this is something to be avoided. After you begin watching, you will likely see the end. A small fact may be that the show takes you less than funny, but that's not annoying. The only question remains, where is the DVD?
