<br /> <br /> After a long period of time, I was totally amazed at this series - it was all bad guy, it was addictive. <br /> <br /> The story has closed you, what happens after - Joey ended up in a 5-year prison and ended up thinking of her lost child, crossing the road again with her ... She was a violent bad guy though you still want it <br /> <br /> Two really attractive parter - please take it to the video!
