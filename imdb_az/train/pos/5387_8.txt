In the 21st century, such children are dangerous, and women have minority and premature birth. Seventy-five years ago, it was unusual for women to die during childbirth. This is the subject of "life begins": look at the "difficult situations" section of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young is head of a young woman brought from here (what is her crime for her birth?); we are faced with the fact that we will have to give up the child after birth. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young is in a department with many other women, unlike others. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young is another, though outstanding performance, usually by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s and has shown some to support the role and has sometimes gained leadership in the "B" films (played by Torchy Blaney in Farrell's "Torchy" B-movie series). Farrell plays the waiting mother, who does not want her children, because they are going to leave alone. He does his best to enter the path of the nurses, including smuggling to the closed door (of course, in the Forbidden days) and fish - of course, fetal alcohol has not heard alcohol syndrome in the 30s. Interestingly, unlike most films of the early 1930s, women are unable to be indifferent to heroes in the heroic way of men - this is a situation where the expectant ancestors are jelly. (Look for the veteran character Frank McHugh as one of the forebears.) "Life Begins", although it is an early talk, looks at the subject with melodrama with a fair doll, but it's a charming little movie. Turner Classic shows it very rarely; I just saw the show in honor of Loretta Young for a few days. But when it appears it is highly recommended.
