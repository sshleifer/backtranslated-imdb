The first two sequences of this film have created two conflicts: thematic-conflict between soldier Todd and his suppressed humanity, physics-conflict between Todd and his bio-engineers. Both sequences were captured quite differently. <br /> <br /> The scenario of the people is slightly reduced by solving half of the film's half, meaning that the second half is smaller than a straight one. <br /> <br /> Respect manufacturers to create a genre of action for Kurt Russell, who, despite this, has a heart and even a little spirit and especially little information. <br /> <br /> Great movie, but worth a visit.
