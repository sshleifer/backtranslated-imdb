This movie is such a moving, beautiful piece of work. When I was in the theater I saw it, but at the age of 13, I really did not "go" ... I saw it again when I was 20 (of course, the video and now I have it). Steven Spielberg created a beautiful film that wrapped you from beginning to end. I also read a book, but there is something about the movie that really brings it to life. casting, movement, music, suit, decoration, everything is just fine. you make you laugh, cry, rejoice ... it brings out every feeling that excites you. one of his most beautiful works and should not be missed!
