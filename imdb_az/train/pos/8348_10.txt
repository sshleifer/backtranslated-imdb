In 1986, I saw this movie one night on television. I was 6 years old. This is like my last look at accident in my 1987 look. I went to Venice the following year on vacation, and I was hoping for God, who knew I could follow my mother! <br /> <br /> If my parents knew I was watching Les Valsees when I was a kid, would I? Probably, with my dad I will not let the subject go from this day, and my mother probably does not agree with her in the next life. Anyway, I do not know what they want to see. I'm never sure whether this movie is an unusual piece that ignores the sex revolution to slide with low glazed saturated eyes on mountain roads from stalking and trapping a woman on the first stage, or if you're sexually explicit, you can even insult yourself you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is definitely severe. There is no strong confession of love in sex. Even a young baby turns into suicidal sexual abuse. But the scenario is very erotic and exciting (my God is so in my English)! Have they given their hearts to them? This is a conversation. <br /> <br /> Why am I going to wood? <br /> <br /> People look for an older old woman and find an old-fashioned man? I dont know. It really ends in a terrible suicide. I explained it to my friend JB Nelson of Cannibal Holocaust-Bold and he went eeuurrgghh! There is no mother's milk in this film, but vice versa. Robbery where your boys started. Why do they hit her daughter? Why return to them? <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < p> Such a tough world. Deception / Madonna does not calculate what is a pile of evidence, and it never happens that such a woman turns into a slave of a man who is punished for the woman and maybe madonna is incredaged to the ritchie of anyone who respects everyone and can not use punctuation! Why is Noodles doing this once in America / Leone God? It destroys the joy we pursue in his whole life. He came to find love with Deborah. Now they are also destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> <br /> There is no rape on Les Valseus, many sexes and nudity are more. Very honest, no shit. No disappointment, no perfect Hollywood smoothness. Jokes, yes. But there is too much darkness, jealousy and trickery to call here a comedy. <br /> <br /> Do not forget that a naked rhinoceros in the foot will be returned to Cos and you will close it with your old lover son of a knight. <br /> <br /> Two things I can not stand up for is harassment films and arrest films. Les Valseuses is a rape movie! Nobody wants to watch now! This is a brilliant movie!
