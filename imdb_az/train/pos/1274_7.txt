Let us note that everyone who does not like or dislikes this film is different from this book or book. <br /> <br /> I do not understand such criticisms. Books and movies are different media. Although there are hours and hours for books to develop characters and storylines, the movies are about 120 minutes away. But the film has the power to stimulate a few emotions: visual, audio, and imagination. Is there any kind of book that looks good on a movie or is it actually built on it? Whose mouth? <br /> <br /> This TV movie was attractive. An old-fashioned, often-out-of-story story could easily have been embarrassing. But Riffen and Reeves take him out. A reviewer found Riffen far away. When I was preparing this movie, I never knew it was 40 years old. He's a 23-year-old 24-year-old player who is a staggering actress. And I think about Reeves's best thing. The story could have been more powerful and I agree that the screen game might be using "compression". Nevertheless, you have to watch. Obviously not a strong love story, on the contrary, a romantic romanticism will leave you, love is a strong emotion, and it's good to meet the evil. <br /> <br /> Finally, music account is very good. <br /> <br /> Finally, music is good.
