It was incredible, so it was hard to believe that the "forgotten tribe" would make this surprising migration twice a year, and the film industry did not stage scenes and scenes of Cooper and Schoedsack. But what shots! The most extreme cinematography is brilliant and the Iranian music added to the video clip adds extra value to this memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> I did not see it and the same weekend as "Kon Tiki" was exciting, and of course, how hard and tough and brave to be for me to live primarily or to need adventure or science .
