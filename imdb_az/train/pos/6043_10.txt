I've seen a freebird movie and I think it's great! When the English movie industry came up with something entertaining it laid back its fun! How good is the person familiar with the service station, we look at the news agencies in a pleasant way. The actor was convincing (I'm a biker) they reminded me of some good times in the bike scene. It was a good idea to get the movie directed by the director and to do a good job! In the end, a new product is recorded, based in Ireland for this second film? Hopefully let them come. Great movie, well-written, realistic characters!
