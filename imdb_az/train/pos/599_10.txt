I was very glad because the actor had a genuine sincerity. The writing was top notch. James Arness was a great player and showed up here. Brian Keith was too old to become Davy Crockett and would anyone really play Davy, Fess Parker? <br /> <br /> Another great actor in this movement was Raul Julia, giving depth to Santa Anna, <br /> <br /> Although some films were slowly thought, the battle was just beginning, and a few hours of terrible terror and then he suffered many hardships. <br /> <br /> What makes me very surprised about this movie is that I think you are ready to die for a reason and some people believe it. Today and at the age of no one is stopping because I've found it upgrade, how you feel about time politics, there is a time when people died for freedom.
