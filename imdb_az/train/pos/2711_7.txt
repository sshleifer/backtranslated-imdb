When I think of "Women in Prison," my ideas often go to the production of directors like Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei in Italy / Spain; And although these films are very sleazy, they are also very sameyy and once saw; you may have seen all of them. I must admit that these types of films are not my favorite; but in fact, women were held several times very well outside Italy and Spain behind the bars; and Roger Corman's New World Pictures are responsible for the best of them. Caged Heat is a director debut of Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme, and this is a good little bit of fun with lots of fun! Naturally, the film is related to a girl who is accused of committing a crime and sent to a women's prison, where she presents to many fierce prisoners. This prison is administered by the Supervisory Board Superson McQueen; and a crime committed by a girl; <br /> <br /> This film is more simple than I used to wear a naked woman in prison. but this is far greater than compensated by some great action scenes and dialogue and provides them with entertainment throughout Caged Heat. It follows a structure similar to other women in the prison films that have been mentioned before and especially to say that this area is not particularly original or ambitious; but this is not a big problem. The film will never be boring and bewildered with stunning scenes; including an attempt to run while working in an area and during a bank robbery. The film helps the masterpiece with the guidance of the man who guides his masterpiece into the "Lamb's Quietness" and a large pile of many standouts; The best legendary Barbara Steele is the chief prison prisoner. Generally, Caged Heat audiences can not leave too much to think about until the end; but a funny little grindhouse flick, and everyone who loves this kind of movie wants to watch it absolutely.
