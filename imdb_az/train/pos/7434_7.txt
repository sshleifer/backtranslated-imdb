After 30 years of its release, the third version of "A Star was born" should finally ask DVDs to Barbra Streisand's most dedicated admirers. In addition to the 1976 film, I saw the feminine anthem of the "Monthly Woman" at the concert. The movie's career polarization story shows that Strişend's presence in other films, including "Funny Girl," is different. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> This time to the contemporary music field is reset, while timeworn land , when he meets with a big bankrupt singer, singer Esther Hoffman, continues to break into rock-star John Norman Howard's deep diving career. <br /> <br /> John Norman (both names) responds to the concerns of dogs who talk about the beginning, accidentally frustrating and bloody DJs by accidentally exposed to violence (he obviously escapes persecution). For John Norman, Esther represents a happy ending, and in turn, she is drawn into a decent, creative musician under the façade. In the most important scene on the film, Esther gives a great break and a career. Of course, he can not manage his failure in the light of his meteoric success, and if you meet any version of this story, you know the rest. It was directed by Frank Pierson (though Streisand's heroic directing capabilities were explicitly demonstrated), although the film is still composed and manipulative, it tries to attract me. <br /> <br /> Although it is an ideal choice to play a rising star in Striisend, his screen identity is simply too powerful, and Esther's ability to play safe. The same is true for the scenario because the soft, mature Contemporary-oriented material is thought to be accepted in another frenzied world in the arena. It can not help from the beginning of the oreo's head, but appears to be a certain star. I can only forgive him because he's a naive vocal talent, but it's a little forgiving when he's heavily drawn to Norman's heart, making Esther even more strange. This creates a strangely unstable dynamic in the last part of the film when it causes something similar to Esther's reaction. <br /> <br /> If Kristofferson, on the other hand, performs perfectly, he is, unfortunately, a great thing to follow John Norman's style. controls the level of honesty that is the basis of the film and feels love, pride and hatred against Esther. In this context, vodka runs intoxicants. Otherwise, something that is always strange about this version is that the characters that support do not interact with the two principals are destroyed in the background. Only registered Paul Mazursky as Paul Norman's Normandy-level senior manager Brian and his cynical band manager Bobby as Gary Busey. Veteran cameraman Robert Surtees, despite the fact that one piece of fruit is continuing, provides a nice burning for cinematography. Some of the songs are still pretty good ("Everything", "Month of Women", "Approach Watch"), some kitsch "Queen Bee", Kenny Loggins' "one of the greatest vendors of the day, the soundtrack of the 1970s, a hodgepodge of different styles - I love you believe in me ") and, of course, inevitable" Evergreen ". <br /> <br /> 2006 DVD printing is clean, remastering. The presence of Streisand is the beginning of a long overdue supplement. The film creates profound information about casting, casting, and troublesome production. John Peters, producer of the film, disagrees with Pierson as director, rejoices his hairdresser's megalomania as well as the director. I would only like to have more scenic explanations directly related to those on the screen. He also tries to repeat the same anecdotes as he casts his mood, for example, is the third person to be heard by the person who plays the driver as Peterson's friend. <br /> <br /> I think the first commentator could have prepared other nuggets. <br /> <br /> Some 1970s have a wardrobe tester specially showing Christofferson's mixed-cloth poncho and orange polyester shirts. There are 12 deleted scenes in Streisand's optional description. One is a comic baking scene that reminds me of how much I love Strikend in extreme comedies. Another night in front of Christofferson, who was falling asleep, is a wide-ranging scene playing "Evergreen" on the guitar. An alternative step in the final music final, with the fastest breaks I have ever agreed with Streimand. The theater trailers are also included in the three versions of "Star A Star", respectively.
