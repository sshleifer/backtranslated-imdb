I'm a great admirer of the movie and by Otto Preminger this movie is one of the best I've ever seen! Preminger, "Laura" - Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews re-combine two stars for a totally different crime film. Laura was around love and this movie is based on hatred; a police detective Mark Dickson, a copper investigator for the heavy handling tactics in his hands, accidentally killing a suspect and attempting to commit a murderer to a known criminal; A man named Tommy Scalisi. The plot is brilliantly designed and the Preminger perfectly balances several field points; but returns to the fundamental moral pressure that covers all our main character. The fact that the film is in underground underground is a perfect base for work, and the director Otto Preminger's heroic characters, their heroism, and many more, have been shot in the top-class society before Laura "Helps to get rid of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The role of Mark Dickson, Here we have a difficult character as it is so cold. But its intentions are something that we can understand, that it is easy to sympathize and enables the viewer to maintain his position. Character development is good and we watch this character and motivation in the film; Everything has come to an end. His co-star, Gen Tierney, who did not give much as much as Laura in this film; A movie that tie up Tierney. He is neither good nor good, the chemistry teacher of the leading prayers is perfect, and Tierney helps him complete every scene. I say this is a better movie than Laura; This is a tough thing to watch, but this movie is better suited to the movie noir formula than Prettyer's previous movie. The film is also a good comparison piece for Laura; Although everything in this film is contrary to the 1944 film, it's strangely familiar. We recommend to all!
