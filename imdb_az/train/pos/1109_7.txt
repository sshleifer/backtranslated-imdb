Just seeing the previous two pictures, I came to agree with Altman. First of all, I have always written the "dull" style of the movie style. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> HealtH, In fact, I do not think this is up to VHS. Why is this? Are all of these bad movies behind for good reason after DVDs are released daily? Honestly, I had no problem with this movie. It was basically fun and funny. Almost all scenes are mysteriously interested in any reason, maybe a good dialogue or delicate speeches. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Not perfect, but better than most sludge from DVDs. Hell, I'm happy with the beautiful VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> Even if it's on the Fox Film Channel, look it up.
