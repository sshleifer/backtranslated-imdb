If the movie did not start in the classroom, the main actress was seen in the Orked Chinese classroom. He later asked in the film that he was sent to study Mandarin (by Muhsin). His answer was simple for a child; <br /> <br /> The Caucasus is typical of Malaysia. The film is mostly thought of as a boy's game in a 10-year-old Orkede game dating to 12-year-old Muhsin. Muhsin (who was new in the village), who fled from the players, forced Orked to play, and he also showed her side by side. Orked, as you can see in the film, is not an ordinary girl who describes her behavior, but defends Mukhsin with a very fierce encounter with school arguments, throwing the bull's bag out of the school bus, blowing it into his brother's brother, here with Muhsin and later. <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> I think Muslims will follow each other. </ Strong> <br /> The film now describes the first love between Orked and Muhsin, they started out as friends, but they slowly develop closer ties and then develop towards BGR. Yasmin showed the movie when he spent the change with the love of the main actress and actress. The character is characterized by intolerance and soft humor. Scenes were casual, but for a long time you've been stuck on the screen, so many realities. <br /> <br /> Because the film is joking around two love birds, she does not want to be patriotic to local scenes, but she is looking for a lens in Orkedin's parents who are studying in the UK, speaks English very well, and speaks English with her husband and others in turn, trying to speak English. all the way really. Let me explain just how much humor can be so popular in this movie. And this description and description you can describe in just one word and RANDOMNESS. Often, we teach ourselves to laugh, not more, and we will do it for others. It was justified by the Law by Jack Neo as it was Actually - We often do not see people when we are ourselves, but when we are in the body of another man, we only learn to see who we really are. <br /> <br /> He was buried several days before his wife was met. <br /> <br /> The other purpose of this film is to show how her husband's neighbor would not love her husband's spouse and how many guests she wanted to find. Pak Koboy saw that his motorbike was on the agenda and his new girlfriend set off. The manufacturer did not succeed in finding her husband to find another wife. His wife was really small or KPC, because we called it China, and he intervened in other people's affairs and sent his daughter to say that he would only use adults in the orchid. As a result, what is going on, comes around and, therefore, the evil things to do with it. Doing good to people around you at all times will not hurt if you do not have the ego to maintain it, then what is worth doing? The film is centered around Hussein's brother Hussein, who went to the city late at night and was drinking and found 'girls'. It is contrary to the Opposition, but perhaps because of family problems. The brothers stayed with the aunt, and their parents were far from them. I will not reveal much of the storyline because it will destroy most of the interests you want to find yourself, but the smallest of all the elements that the manufacturer wants to send to the audience is our lives. He did not want to see us, at least from the sight of his sight. Some of the movies are from our own body, keeping us in the character position and using our empty ideas to follow the events that happened. Depending on the type and genre of the movie, you will beautifully describe how such a good movie will sound and have a significant impact on you.
