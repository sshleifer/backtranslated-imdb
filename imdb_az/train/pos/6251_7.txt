It's not brilliant, groundbreaking and innovative, but 'Dog Days' is a very interesting thing for some reason. It's like opening a bad dose of heroin, but it's not really. This is an Austrian movie after a few depressed, dissatisfied and thrilling people and relationships that insult each other. It is a concern, but it is very well behaved and it is interesting to watch the horrible little things of these characters. Surely not from a weak heart, this high pessimistic film does not produce any results or results at the end, and we see the lives of those mixed people in just two days. Level: B
