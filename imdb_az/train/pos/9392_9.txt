I came home late in the night, and I joined the TV to see Siskel and Ebertin summarizing the week's choices. I have not heard anything about the "Red Rock West", except for the two fingers and before I go. Due to the lack of money and the lack of promotion, the distributor often said that they would not be in the theater, but they were better off. <br /> <br /> The next afternoon I followed their advice. They were right, I did not have much fun in the movies. As we have pointed out to some readers, there are several holes in the field and the last 10 minutes will never end. But it's worth it for the fine craft that comes into the first hour. The best part I have ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone is perfectly drawn. Dennis Hopper is almost upset, unhappy, but improves everything. Supports and music make a great contribution to almost every scene. <br /> <br /> When I later rented my family, it did not work well. The long stages of the tension in the theater were difficult to assess at home with devastating effects. It is worthy of your full attention; turn off the phone, especially when you're worried about starting out, watching and listening to everything.
