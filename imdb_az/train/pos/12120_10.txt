Bette Davis may find situations in which Davis, an author who reads websites, has nothing to do with his activities. I found a site that claimed Bette Davis's success because of his success. However, in 1934, most of Devis' films are reflected. The most obvious example consists of two films: Frisco on Fog and Human Care. Although they are both negative, the characters they play in these films are quite different. Arlene, dull, uneducated and soft Cockney waitress Mildreddən the more beautiful, glamorous and frivolous loved one is a surprise and much more. Dear Davis, it is not necessary to say that both characters are playing very original and with the same enthusiasm. But that's not all. Taking into account that the past role of the day's most wanted actresses had to play. The last role that seemed to be the most undesirable, crucial role in the career, was for months to fight prostitution. This was the last role that began among the stars. <br /> <br /> Author: David Davey knew this from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Kokney waitress Mildred Rogersə a medical student who is not her boyfriend Phillip Carey (Leslie Howard) talking about the film (Bette Davis), a few weeks points, but there are more powerful ones. The story is just too big to be explained in 83 minutes. For example, it is unclear why a gentle student does not show interest to a kindhearted waiter. Dear Davis, there is a scene we are exposed to in our eyes, but when these feelings are fully developed. Nevertheless, the story of integrity, superior play a role in Howard and Davisdən not see the faces of the characters and fantastic Steinerin reflecting the feelings of the music is preserved. In fact, the film was merged by walking segments reflecting the two-ton repeats on the back of Phillip. Every detail is a good idea - Max Steiner, consistently used in film, wrote a beautiful leitmotif for every woman in her life. Və Sally'in üzünü təqvim qarşısında görən gözəl bir səhnə, Francis Dee nin nefes gözəlliyi səbəbindən gördüyüm ən tatlı səhnələrdən biridir (Ms Dee Gone'da aparıcı rolu oynamaq üçün çox gözəl sayılırdı) bir Wind ilə) və Steiner'in cazibədar musiqi. <br /> <br /> Camera movements are also original and fresh among some scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ən iyrənc xarakterlər onu istifadə etdikdən sonra onu tərk edəcəklərini bildiklərinə baxmayaraq, əlaqələrinə cəlb edən kişilər olmalıydılar, lakin maraqla qarşılanan simvol kimi təsvir olundular. Mildred is always known - a peculiar but still honest way - to know that Phillip was betrayed and not interested in it. He just refuses to hear. Phillips is the masochistic nature of the club's foot and child experiences, which is the main cause of his love problem. He is moved to the club's feet until Mildre, and maybe he should be free to create a normal life. Of course, selfish and intolerant Mildred, after disclosing his commitment to volunteer Phillip, made his own contribution to hell. Given the interconnectedness exploded in empty once you understand it for what it's less money Phillipin (Maugham novel is different). <br /> <br /> For modern standards, the movie is somewhat obsolete, but in the next few hours, you'll be able to get new exciting information. acting, attractive music and original arrangement, therefore, deserves the highest possible limit.
