Movies like Chainsaw Massacre in Texas, Suspiria and Halloween have changed the horror appearance in the genre, and there was more Gothic in the genre and less severe. The Hammer Horror series and the "Rosemary's Baby" were frightened and excited by the audience at the turn of the 1960s and early 70s. I can not tell you how many times I have rented this movie in my childhood, but there was something about it. <br /> <br /> I did not want to restrict myself to zombie movies, and in the 1970s and 80s, I was making films that were very popular with popular films, but the very sad Amicus movie company was a good start. <br /> <br /> Pros: Magnificent, eerie music honey. Strong speeches in high pouring. Brilliant cinematography. Especially the first and last vignettes, very good old fashioned excitement and chills. Some exciting moments and pictures. Slow, but fast moving. The house is a terrible, repressive settlement. The film is a great production design and decoration that gives you a true Gothic horror feel. <br /> <br /> Defects: Some pacing issues in the first half. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify;" "Clothes," The remainder of the stories is felt as before, but ClichÃ©s was the second story, 'Waxworks' is a beautiful move and these moments, but fear and persistence <br /> <br /> Last Thoughts: For the first time in many years, I've seen this movie for the first time, and I can see why it was hired for a long time, but this is not a masterpiece, but these horror films are made with style and class <br /> <br /> My rating is 3.5 / 5
