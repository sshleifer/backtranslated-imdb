Mobile Suit Gundam Wing, fourth in the ongoing Gundam era. In contrast with the earlier writings directed to mass wars, this is a bit different; Instead of the state of the army, this is driven by five teenage boys (their ability to mix them more easily than normal ones) and machines called "Gundam" for the metal pens used in their machines. Destruction of Gundam leads to problems, instead of replacing less-destroyed weapons platforms and "Dolls" piloted "Mobile Suits" that flies to Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> The whole point of the series is a metaphysical question that sets out part of Gundam Wing's Anime. <br /> <br /> Mobile Suit Gundam wing kits have matched well-known magazines, most notably anime, Naruto, DragonBall, One Piece, DragonBall Z and InuYasha. The Gundam is very divine and melodramatic is not dramatic, and it seems that it appears in the series of events, in fact, exaggerated, because it is not in a supernatural way, not a superfluous battle between deadly men, like the gods. Normally there is anime that the best way to go on a "small" fight is to take half an hour - something that will never happen in real life. <br /> <br /> Gundam is convinced that these characters will not die, that machines will be destroyed and rebuilt, that war is lost and victorious, and that these actions will not seem to be satirized. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is in the details of the magic and is grateful for having more anime in this series. Emotional. Instead of mythical prophecies, magic or luxurious martial arts, Gundam Wing is hard-line science fiction, a country that hates hard-line science fiction. (Note: The author says that because of the religious issues that form the basis of the Neon Genesis Evangelion series, real-life-fiqh is not fantastic), they love Star Wars, but they hate the EU. (film). What is Gundam Wing then, and Gundam SeeD is ready for both Japanese and US releases with two voice groups. <br /> <br /> An American audience only needs to wait two to three weeks before the end of the season in Japan, or to catch the EditedD episodes organized on the named version or even on the Cartoon Network. <br /> <br /> Emotions are those that are struggling with these two battles, technically backwards. Heroes, Mobile Suit are the defenders of the richest and aristocratic citizens of the Earth from a group of terrorists who are weak in any way that generates heroes of the Gundam wing. It's not a battle, it's a "total war". Everyone, every building, every street, and everywhere, is also a target for attack. <br /> <br /> My only complaint and the reason they did not take the account, the fourth of the road, are dead only for a few episodes and nobody will really change. Meteor and OZ: It's a great time for things that give us information about the characters between Meteor and OZ, but at the same time, this project looks the same. But the last two episodes and predominantly Cartoon-Network (2001-2003) Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: The Infinite Waltz movie is more of a tension.
