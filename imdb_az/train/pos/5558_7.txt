This story is a man who was introduced to Tom and Jerry in the 1940s, especially in the long run. The only difference is that if the mouse (Jerry) does not, it is in danger of removing two cats instead of one. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Tom's home-named name has an unrecognized friend ("Butch?"). So, this is "Mammy Two Shoes", which does not believe that there is a mouse in the house despite having two TWIN Cats <br /> <br /> Anyway, the one holding Jerry will stay with the other, so the competition continues! <br /> <br /> Even though I'm still familiar with the area I know, make fun of the cartoon with a fairly original look. Jerry was also competing against each of the cats, so you just had to have good enough gags to recommend because you're just an admirer of Tom and Jerry.
