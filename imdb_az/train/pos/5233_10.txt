Gert de Graaff does not want to describe the genre as "thinking event" after the example of Merab Mamarashvili. The nominal story is the occupation of Bart Klever for the ephemeral substance, the essence of personality. His new film is simultaneously formed on a script computer and in his own imagination. This monologue responded to Fellini's 8Â½ and Gert de Graaff worked for 13 years. Playing with genuine and fictional characters and audiences, this reveals the interaction of real and imaginary paradoxical existence between Guttenberg and MacLhuen in two different galaxies. For a while, I believe that the cause of all unhappiness is the stereotypes that the mass mentality is cursed ("male", "Catholic", "window washer"). When the creator of the author finally finds himself in a decisive dilemma, we get trapped with him: how can he come from the future film? Bart Klever? Five minutes before the deceased, the creator's wife and his wife were so deeply immersed with their little merchants that we put the "frame" together with the main character. <br /> <br /> So, why is it worth the artistic value to renounce daily care for her and young girl? <br /> So who is this Bartin? Klever? Is there a brilliant prophet or someone like Frenhoffer, a masterpiece of Balzac? (Will be deleted from everything else written on the next computer as the next writer)? Gert de Graaff shows that this question is answered by ourselves. <br /> <br />
