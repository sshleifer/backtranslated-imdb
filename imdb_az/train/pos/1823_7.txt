When I was 4, I was watching this movie with my comrades, but I was never surprised by something strange. The other day I was babysitting and I saw my cousins ​​all the dogs went to heaven, so we rent both movies and watch them together today and she really loved these films. Many memories come back to watch this movie once again, and I must admit that I'm crying a bit. I am 22 years old, and the end is still coming to me. All Dogs are one of the most impressive animated films to go to Hell, and I was honestly shocked by this rating of 5.8 and thought that this movie would bring good memories to others. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that "Charles" is a heroic dog, a dog that was killed by another gambler, Carface. But when Charlie wants to revenge, she is born again, or is the end of her life, when she can not stand it. When he and his best friend, Itchy, Carface seek and spy on him, Carface learns how to get all the money, and has a little orphan girl who is looking for animals and who wants to win races. Charlie gets her daughter, Ann-Marie and fake promises to get money. <br /> <br /> All the dogs go to heaven is a perfect family movie, not Disney, but she learns that she should first put Ann-Marie at her. <br /> <br /> This is a great family movie to watch. It is simply too sweet and tactile to note. I know this is illogical and some people say that I'm crazy, but when I was a kid, this movie believed that dogs were the dogs. How did they not? They love it and I think I'll cry again. But in any case, I will recommend this movie for everyone, it is an entertaining movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
