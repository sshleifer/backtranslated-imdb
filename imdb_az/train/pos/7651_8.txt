An exciting TV-based movie is a betrayal of one of the foremost characters of a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother with a sensitive mission that decides his brother will not appeal to court for the death penalty. But he goes to visit him and when Elias comes to Koteas, the problem begins. There is nothing to do with the mobility of the boat. He said "G.Q." according to the proletarian roots prisoner's version. magazine is a very complicated language for someone who has spent most of his life behind the bars. This realization came after a meeting with my old friend, whom I had not met for several years in Panama prisons several times. The young man I did not know was not just because he was old, but because of the long-term punishment of the criminal system. There are prisons and prisons, but this "prisoner of love" is definitely out of this world.
