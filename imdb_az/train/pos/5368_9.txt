This is a great action movie, a great liner from Arnie. One is prepared with a very strenuous movements to make you happy. The Characters were awesome and Richard Dawson was very scared as the main villain. Yes, there is a tone of height, but there is a great end, which is extremely entertaining. Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso together with a great chemistry wrote a great story. Character development was also good, some excellent speeches. The director is great! Paul Michael Glaser makes a very nice job, keeps you stylized, uses a rich color, delivers great camera angles and generally saves the movie very fast! good job. There's a little eye on it. We hit a few bloody guns, cut his head, throat, bloody chains, corpses, blood and blow. The operation is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger, as always, AMAZING, has a great, delightful curse on the actor's department, throws it into a donkey, and has always been a great physical asset and entertaining tone to watch! (Arnie's rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso, who works here well, she was really cute and was a good chemistry with Arnie! Yaphet Kotto, here's how much you need to do. Marvin J. McIntyre is as good as a geeky boy, she was nice! Richard Dawson was awesome as the main villain and was very scary and he had fun to watch. Jesse Ventura, Jim Braun, Erland van Lidth, Gus Rethwisch and Professor Toru Tanaka, all have to do very well as stalker. Generally, we must see! 5 to 5 1/2
