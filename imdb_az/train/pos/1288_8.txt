Preston Waters came out on a bad pedestal. <Strong> </ strong> </ em> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> They can not do this in their rooms because they are not enough places. When returning to a birthday party, others get $ 32, $ 35, or $ 50, and it costs only $ 6. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br> A boy checks checks when leaving the bank. After the child, a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer) delayed him and abducted him. Quigley will give $ 1,000,000 to his owner for tomorrow to come to the bank. Quigley begins to write a check for the loss, but a police vehicle can write his name before he raises the area. Do not be afraid to give a check to Preston, telling him to finish his father. <br /> <br /> In the evening, Preston says he will not want a new bike for his father, he wants a room back, better than his own home. His father took the rest of the evening to the room. In his room, Preston's figures can not get worse because he has forgotten checks, as in a shirt pocket. <br /> <br /> After carefully reviewing the computer, he sells it to $ 1 million. The next day, when trying to put cash in the bank, he thinks the owner should give him $ 1,000,000. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Preston is a fun thing to get used to. including his own home, and even with a secret bank lady, and is actually a FBI agent (who wants to watch three bad guys). <br /> <br /> Finally, the person who performs this job says he's named Mr. Macintosh. <br /> <br /> But things will eventually grow up (money is running out, bad guys get it). <br /> <br /> Generally, a pretty funny whistle. Miguel Ferrer plays his role very well. If you love her in another Stakeout, you will love her here. <br /> <br /> Rick Ducommun (Boss from the Ghost Machine) plays a nice friend in this movie.
