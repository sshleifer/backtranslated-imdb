I just saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) and since then I've been watching every single movie that comes to the radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has intensity (and he even looks a bit like Owen) just wakes up from the screen. <br /> <br /> This film is not an insult. <br /> <br /> This is a movie. beautiful story, very convincing people (well, this is based on the author's early shenanigans with roketri), a great cast? Chris Cooper is always good and Laura Dern is always on my list? <br /> <br /> This film was very important to me. I've been at the same age as Homer Hickham in 1957; I was staring at the night stars to watch Sputnik because I was afraid of the darkness; Like Homer, I experimented with a rocket in my backyard, and even used the same chemicals for fuel; and, like Homer, I've completed most of my attempts with an explosive disaster! <br /> <br /> According to some information, it is very important for me. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a basic family movie, but it seems like a dead dog. Take the time to see children: you will have a good smile.
