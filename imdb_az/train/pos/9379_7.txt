I will watch Nicholas Cage more and appreciate him as more actors. Now, watching this movie (2005), I see that it does not fit into the genre of films that originated in the early 90's. Actually, I do not think the movie will be considered a noir, but sometimes it's sometimes too dark because of the illumination of the characters and the surprising personality. <br /> <br /> Typical speeches from each of the three basics are actors who do a good job with all their roles. But I thought Hopper and Boyl's characters were not developed because sometimes it was difficult to understand what they were doing and why they did it. Hopper loves it or hates it. The area is really good, and some of my portions are very unreal, even though the director (for example, when he first saw the sheriff) had the parts he needed to miss. All this, you have to watch this movie. *** 1/2
