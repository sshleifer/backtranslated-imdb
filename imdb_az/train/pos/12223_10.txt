When I returned in the 90s of the first century, I saw True Crime and watched it many times since. Maryam (played by Alicia Silverstone) is a great mystery at a secondary school in California, where a classmate's younger brother was tortured and murdered by an unknown killer. <br /> <br /> Mary, Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police student, sees how brilliant she is and decides to work together to find a murderer. <br /> <br /> This is a very suspicious. True Crime is very "true" or true to me. I have read a story of a news group that says that the complete stoppage is here and that's right. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role, and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job as other actors. The places have been set up and writer / director Pat Verducci really reflects the truth of the teenage life and the truths of Maryam's loneliness (watching Meryn's Toni's photos followed by a dream sequence). <br /> <br /> I would like Verduer to shoot more films. <br /> <br /> I have never seen a movie like True Crime. 10/10
