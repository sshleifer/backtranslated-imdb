This is an example that can be seen in a small budget movie. Taking into account the director of the film, the actor is perfect, and the whole atmosphere of the film is very important. Gore is well-implemented and is less used (see for the perfect barbed wire death) and moves punchy when used. True, sometimes there are dangerous lines in the script, but in comparison to other films in the same (or more) budget it does not matter much. In general, this is recommended. Believe me, this is better than it is! 8/10
