"Trampa Infernal", which speaks about the explosion, is the most beautiful opening credit! The names of the leading players who are inspired by the slightly inspiring music tricks on the legendary "Friday 13" theme (Tsh-Tsh-Tsh-Ha-Ha-Ha) appear on a split screen. Introducing the absolute dark Mexican slasher / backwoods survival thriller intro and it's just cold with every passing minute. Two extremely competitive and testosterone overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other directly in the bar. According to an article in the newspaper, there is a tree without a tree nearby and has killed many hunters who already hunt for it. According to the contest, everyone who kills the bear will be declared the ultimate killer hero with the ball ball. As for the arrival, they are not against a month, but, of course, is a conscious and completely maniacal war veteran who has many arsenal weapons in his asylum and a large number of battle tricks up to his arm. After a full decade and derivation of American slashers, the Mexican efforts of the 90s appear and look fresher and brighter. The formula is simple but effective, the lead characters are fairly reasonable, and the right building is very clever, with sadistic killing. Maniac was supposed to be an admirer of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers because he also uses a sharp blade gloves and a white mask to cover his face. Murders are unpleasant, evil and barbaric, and I really hope this is since the opening sequence mentioned above, and many defective blood garbage. The forestry structure and especially the camouflaged booby traps are spectacular. "Trampa Interior" is warmly welcomed to fans of the genre, a Mexican slasher / survival bed.
