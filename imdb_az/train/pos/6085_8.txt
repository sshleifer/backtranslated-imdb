Critics are silent. This movie is funny and smart. I liked this movie very much. Why does anyone hate this movie? People like this movie to be loved more. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are real comedians and have done much to make this movie. I do not see movies like yours. People should not only watch it and comment on it. I love this movie. All of this is OK. There are sections, but it seems as though at least it did. Jerry Stiller liked this movie, because this film acts as King's Show Show. But this is better. I do not believe that it was so low.
