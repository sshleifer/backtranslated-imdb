In 1996, the "101 Dalmatians", Cruella De Vil, was captured by London Metropolitain Police (God bless them), 101 puppets - stealing and attempting to kill the Dalmatians. All of them were covered with mud and straw, and he spent the next four years with a "tin." Unfortunately, four years later, he was released from prison. I say that this is 28 years - dogs! So, in 2000, Disney decided to release the successful live action version of the classic film, called the "102 Dalmatians". There is an additional 102nd Dalmatian in the family there (Oddball is the name, I think I should know it since it has been shown recently on television) and the puppy has no spot !!!!! Also, Cruella (again playing Glenn Close) fled again, wanted a bigger, better coat than a puppy! <br /> <br /> Especially liked about the theme - I'm sure everyone loves the "Atomic Dog" song from the 70s. We've heard a little bit of this movie now !!!!! <br /> <br /> "102 Dalmatians" is a big movie that I'm wondering - "103 DALMATIYAN ???" LOL <br /> 10 stars
