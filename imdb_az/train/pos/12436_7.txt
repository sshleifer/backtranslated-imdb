Now, for a few years, I've read Blaise's modesty, collecting the numbers of stripes. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by the fiasco movie based on the novel "Modesty Blaise" a few years ago and as a result it was good. <br /> <br /> It was a movie that I was supposed to do or did not commit violence. The director focused on history and psychology. Fashion was created on the basis of her tales, and in what part of her life her childhood was not affected. I think these thoughts will give more insight into the future (I hope). I just liked the old style of the movie. However, not everything was good, gambling was not good. almost dull and unrealistic. He could have imagined it. I do not think the bad guy in this movie really feels, the only reason for his existence is that humility could explain his story to someone. They also could expand the film and show more after creating the "Network", but for the next movie I will talk about it. <br /> <br /> And forgive me for my bad English language.
