In 1990, two Jim Thompson replaced the second (the second most prominent Griffiths), after the DARK, there are signs of all Thompson: dangerous women, trusting games, or others. <br /> <br /> Jason Patric, perfect for an old boxer who refuses to go sport because of the incident (director James Foley Raging BULL-esquire series, back story) and very rarely seen by Rachel Ward. But Bruce Dern is the secret weapon of the movie: his sweet talk grifter uncle Bud commands each of his deeds. <br /> <br /> There's no funny relief in this movie, so be prepared to get out of it.
