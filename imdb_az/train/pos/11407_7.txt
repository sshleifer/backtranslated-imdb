Updated January 1, 2006 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Parsifal is one of my two favorite Wagner operas or more precisely musical dramas (Meistersinger is another) although it pops. The composer's libretos, religion, paganism, and erotism are likely homo erotism as usual, and its length may seem to be as dry as this land. <br /> <br /> Wagner, the famous antisemitism (Klingsor can be one of his Jewish traitors), of course, was demolished his premiere (not for RW's request!), his favorite conductor, Hermann Levi! <br /> <br /> Given that Parsifal expects many video versions, it's also foreign or good. This film, compared to the opera, is a fresh air breath. Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, the director, has created a lot of thought about it, but it is difficult to know why there are some voters. For example: the popular singer Parsifals (from every species!), Puppets, Wagner-mask and various puppets and travelers, in Nazi Swastika. (Although I remember, "real" Engelbert Humperdinck wrote true music to make scene changes.) Although Wagner himself died too early to become a true Nazi, many of his grandchildren (like his second wife, Cosima). at least at the youngest age, at least with friends, including his grandson Wolfgang Wagner, who oversaw the Bayreuth Festival. In fact, Wolfgang's son, Gottfried Wagner, has come to an agreement with his grandfather in an honest way. <br /> <br /> Cyberberg looks politically unclear as I read it. A well-known film about Hitler in 1977, "Hitler: Film aus Deutschland" (sometimes "Our Hitler" in English). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, an audio CD composer based in Armin Jordan, has not seen so many eight-hour-long and non-spirited people. Plays Amfortas (read by Wolfgang Schöne) Edith Clever, Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick, dual Parsifals (Both are sounded by Reiner Goldberg) and Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland play and read Gurnemanz and Klingsor. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the opera has been in the long run (except for Kundry), it has been described that the 2 and 3 items are quite old, and nobody is opera. (Is Grail a magic? This opera, Grail, is Jesus, who was drinking in the Past Supper, as it was in recent times, not Mary Magdalene, but an unhappy idea!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Yes, I agree that "Kna's" approach is superior to the second, stereo version, but it's probably better than all saved versions). <br /> <br /> Not all the Wagnerites are Parsifal, I think it works well as a filmed opera.
