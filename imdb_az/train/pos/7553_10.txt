When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely screened. His magnitude kept my focus so much that I focused all my attention on the whole process. Anime advises not only fans but also those who love the great movie cycle (or those who love really strange things). The art style is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the characters in it are breathtaking. I have heard complaints about the strange copy of the English text in the film, but I think it's totally in the strange style of the movie. The description of Salam Kitty is not entirely epic to this film. I would like to see more and more works by everyone doing this.
