Back 74 Eric Monte made a classic T.V show at Good Times. JJ is always my favorite and I love watching Reruns in T.V Land. Jimmie Walker has always looked like star and not Esther Rolle. But John Amos, Jimmy Walker's popularity, felt that millions of fans felt the time to sit and watch Good Times. If JJ had always been there to rescue Kool Aid, the show would be dead. Drinking Kool HELP was like the show on the show. When I was 3 years old, I was 8 years old. Instead of the years 1974-1979, I grew up as much as in the 1980s.
