Okay, so I'm not really watching movies, and that's why it's like Dark Remains. I caught doing this (a surprising feature full) DVD and was afraid of me foolishly. The only additive that was missing on the DVD was a pair of new pants. <br /> <br /> But the next day I only do that by just 10%. If I had been watching coffee over the coffee table, my girlfriend would have taken hold of me. <br /> <br /> When I was watching the screen several times, I was not brave, but I did not decide to look again. <br /> <br /> Filmmaking was tight and the character of the characters was really compelling. The simplicity of the film is that I miss the truth of my jump - it's just a wooded, cabin and used prison, and it's a lot more dark. It was surprising that although it is not a million dollar product, makeup effects really look like that! It's also a movie made by someone who has great love for the movie. Sound design and music really used my environment systems, like many Hollywood movies. I noticed that this film was on-line at LA Shriekfest - it's a great success, so film festivals have seen their creative talents and maybe have done much of this movie. <br /> Close your voice, turn off the lights, and if you want to keep your girlfriend - order pizza.
