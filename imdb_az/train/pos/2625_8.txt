Not surprisingly, it disables awesome and good animated movies for one of Disney's straight videos. As with the previous Lion King 2, Disney has brought back the vast majority of original voice actors who have a great deal of difference, and I'm happy that they have kept the traditional animation level. The plot moves around for a while, but we are full of jokes that change from dazed to dull. They gave us some silly musical sequences that resemble jokes to break the field and jokes. For most MST3K, moments have mild and unused potential, and do not add much to the movie without speaking as an instrument for an hour-long soundtrack. The new characters are at least unpleasant and old characters are doing their job, so I do not blame them there. Generally this film is not bad and is more for a nice inconvenient filler among the headlines of Lion King.
