Some movies will love you more than the first few seconds you know. It's one of those films. Look at the two rows of "Two Compensation" and "Postman Always Rings Twice" - a fine example of the Modern Movie Nineties in the '90s. Nick Cage plays the main character associated with the murder of husband and wife - his successes are worse than worse, he works and tries to get away from people, city, violence and salvation. Red Rock's Threat. Cage, Hopper and Walsh, with a hipnotic slide-guitar trail in the backdrop of the music and with a lot of curls and turns, this great performance makes it a real joy. Favorite Line: Cage nodded when looking at the empty gas in the get-away car and said, "F *** is in the story of my life."
