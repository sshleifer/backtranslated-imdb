But if you want muppets, I'm afraid you do not like it. Basically it was established in the same section (this time in New York, LA). She is a very fun cameos and muppet hi-jinx. Kermi and Miss Piggy left the film early on as many of muppets as centered around. I'm very glad. Have fun with your kids to watch.
