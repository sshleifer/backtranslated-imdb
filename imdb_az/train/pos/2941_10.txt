This is the first show by Eddie Murphy. Do not forget the naked professor and my dear colleagues, Eddie Murphy. Mr T. (Immaculates his gay actress), Michael Jackson and other artists are murder. At that time, I find the entertainment of really popular artists attractive. <br /> <br /> My favorite actor is his place at his annual BBQ with his family and plays Bunny's lady who dropped her drunken father and staircase. <br /> <br /> This show is the best medicine when you drop! If you follow the 'Raw' does not disappoint. Very good, but not compatible with 'Delirious'.
