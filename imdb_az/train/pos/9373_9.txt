Like many of you, I am the greatest admirer of the real thing - the 1940s, but the Red Rock West is in the past for all of us. The term "Neo-Neir" has been used illegally in the past ten years so that it does not lose its meaning and influence. On the other hand, John Dahl's film deserves to be described in such a way. Casting was all around perfect and could have felt right at home with Thai Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is as tight as you are sitting for the first 15 minutes. James M. Cain praised this. Many modern movies are frustrating that I'm not as old as I used to be, and even so old. Movies like Red Rock give hope to the future, respect the past.
