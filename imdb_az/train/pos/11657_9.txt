Oscars are the surprise candidate this year's Best Animated Feature. It's an Irish movie, but it's been developed jointly by Belgium and Brazil, which I suppose are the animators operating in all three countries. This product is one of the most beautiful and unique movies in recent memory. Character design is thick, dark contours with very simple symbols, a little reminiscent of Persepolis, French animated film some years ago. This movie is not black-and-white. Oh, no. This film is a great reality, just one of the most ugly and surprising uses of the colors I've seen. The overall design of the pictures is mostly geometric with the rectangular or oval symbols. Most of the film can be used to find the circle - the main aspect of visual design is a circle in the center of the image. All of these geometric designs have one purpose - a young boy who learns to be an artist who works in the lighted manuscripts (Kell's book is a true light, the film's art is based on his shooting). The film's story is not particularly profound, but it's a pretty good fantasy story. Brendan is a young boy in Celsus, a city in a city surrounded by huge walls to catch the Vikings built by his uncle. Kells encourages Aiden to describe Brendan, the newcomer. It promotes something like emptying the Kells and exploring the nearby forest. Bruno Coulais gives a fantastic score, as good as Coraline. I think it's the best of the year.
