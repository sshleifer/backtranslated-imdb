The rescue is John Boorman's 1972 horror film. Businessman Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronnie Cox) will go on a canoe trip on the Cahulawassee River before drinking tea. On the way, men are attacked by unpleasant things (no purpose is envisaged). In spite of the bad events in this picture, Boorman beautifully enjoys the natural beauty of the river. The place was really well chosen. Indeed, it would still be a great movie to watch, and the canoe trips went smoothly. The lush forests and subtle landscape make the horrors more horrible. Thanks to Vilmos Zsigmond, the cinematographer is not only a scene, but also a beautiful way. Stating that Burt Reynolds is outdoors, Lewis is starring in this film. I think that John Voight demonstrates his role as a suburban family man, Ed, who is rapidly forced to change his behavior to ensure vitality. In fact, the scene climbed to my abyss is not a stuntman. It was Voight. To reduce costs, filming was not insured and the actors made their own stunts. Soundtrack is particularly noteworthy. As part of Eric Weissberg's and Steve Mendel's Dueling Banjos sequence, guitar and banjo performance is one of the finest in film history. In a few other points in the film, we treat it with a mild, banjo music, which is a pleasant accompaniment to the lower part of the river. For all the good points of this film, I thought it was a bit odd. It does not create anything very good and is not really terrible as we have believed. The area itself is somewhat weak and does not go anywhere. Nevertheless, this movie has good sources to get my advice. I liked it, but there is really much to lovers. In fact there is really no. It's not a very scary movie, like an adventure movie that is a little drunken. Think of Rambo: The first one meets with a Boatta Three Men. See for your very young Charley Boorman as your son. I love this movie, noise, cinematography and actor win more than a decade.
