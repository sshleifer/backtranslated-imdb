Sweet comic story of two people who are on the road while preparing their wedding. An old police writer and a public school teacher marry other great people, but each other falls into this great new structure. Perhaps, the "partners" are both A type personalities, and some are more comfortable. Nothing is heavy, but it smiles at me. And hey for kids - sell Natasha Henstridge angle and gals - sell them happy romantic, everyone wins!
