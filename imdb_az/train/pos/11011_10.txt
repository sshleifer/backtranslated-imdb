RKO Radio, Bombardier stars, Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott, as key trainers in a school for bomber pilots. O'Brien and Scott discuss the teaching methods and their students oppose Anne Shire's love. O'Brien's methods sound during a bomb attack in Tokyo. Scott and his crew were captured and tortured by Japanese, but Scott, who was fatal, managed to set fire to the gas bombs, and therefore provided a perfect target for bombardments. Stylistically, the Bombardier is one of the most important war movies with the subtle poignancy (trainee Eddie Albert's death), which is an alternative to the scenes of ridiculous "Yellow Warning" melodrama (Japanese, as they tortured Americans with their teeth). Bombardier remains a delightful propagandist, although it may seem unclear today, but the film is sometimes mistakenly ranked as the first debut that Robert Ryan had ever seen before the cameras since 1940. < br /> <br/> Anyone who wants to copy this movie, please contact me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
