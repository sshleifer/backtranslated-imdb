I saw the movie's Holes and said it should be the best movie all year round. Everyone brings a child. Who is going to get a hole as the Jews are punishing? Who is Louis Sachar? Although the film was different from the book, it was still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley was one of the greatest. Intelligent and height smart, but ZigZag / Ricky was long and Armpit / Theodore was bigger. Also, the X-Ray / Rex should have been one of the smallest guys, but it was not. The only thing I did not like about the movie was the flashbacks quite convincing and long. I've seen more than the past, but this is my idea. Especially I love the job of the guys. It was supposed to be a moody and challenging kid, Squid / Alan, played by Jake M. Smith. Jake M. Smith has just done this job and has done a great job like all the players inside the hole. So, I must say that if you still do not see the holes, you will avoid having to re-emerge or have a full lot of fun.
