All the dogs go to heaven, it's one of the best films I've ever seen. I've seen it for the first time when I was 3 years old. Now I'm 12 and I've rented it, it thinks of me and remembers me a lot, it's "days." I love music, I love Charlie's paradise, I love the song "I'm glad to be here". I like Charlie's appearance and his voice, and Bert Reynolds could only play that Charlie's voice. I love this movie, it's the 1st best, because it's original and great. I remember, of course, that nobody could describe, even remember me. Only I can go back to those days. I love the characters. At the age of 12, I think how I feel when I was 19 and I hope I can follow it when I am old. When I first saw it, I never really knew that I would go back and feel this way, I hope it will be possible to watch. I'm very happy that this movie was created and the incredible idea came from the mind and heart. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it perfect. An incredible movie. When I am old and my children, I hope that this feeling can live, it is very difficult to describe the feeling.
