If you do not see this beautiful movie about life in the 90s (L.A.) then you have left a special treatment. It is one of the most bizarre and most powerful films on the life of the Americans in the 90s and even into the world of today's existence. It continues with a child's education, a fairy-tale (love more than one), love, adultery, empty nest syndrome, selfishness, and so on. This story is set up to the final summit, and when it happens, it always goes by love for friends, family, and love. It helps us to dig deeper and look for things we want from life. Gives us questions. We have done enough for others, we resemble it, and so on. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the perfect performance with Mary McDonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover. These actors are beautiful and really show the true glimmering and meaning of what is being sent to all of us. These are my favorite actors for life after seeing this movie ten years ago. I'm still using it again and again. Do not forget to count how many times to enjoy a beautiful soundtrack along with it and try to figure out the helicopter fly and see the symbolism for the movie? Hmmm ... I almost believe that this is Steve Martin's first serious role playing role in any movie. He also does a great job in this film. This can be a surprise for most of you. Take it back, relax and enjoy a really good movie .....
