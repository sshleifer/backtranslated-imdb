I really enjoyed this movie. As you can imagine, the player was terrific. Jeff Combs has more capabilities than he knows. Only a fraction of this flick was the last I would change. <br /> <br /> The death of celebrities was terrible for the Sci Fi Channel. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting religious messages in this movie. Jeff Combs performed an obvious figure of Christ and represented the creation (or shark), anti-Chirst. There were some particularly scary scenes that were "the end of the world." I just saw it after the third look of this classic creature. I know that many people will not refer to Christianity, but you will receive it soon.
