Sophmoric is this movie. But all this is ridiculous. This shows "boys dressing room mentality" playing "on the other side". It's good to see such hesitations come back and how stupid it is. <br /> <br /> See a small group or mixed sex with 97.3%, laughing at 2 hours from the room. Another 2.7% ... Can you really make them happy?
