In 1594 in Brazil, Tupinambas Indians are friends of Frenches, and their enemies are Tupiniquins, friends of Portugueses. A Frenchman (Arduíno Colassanti) believes that he is a Portuguese, even though he is being seized by Tupinambás and believes they are French. The French are their slaves and live with Seboipepa (Ana Maria Magalhães). Later, he uses dust from the balls left behind to defeat the Tupiniquin in a Portuguese battle. To celebrate the victory, the Indians decided to eat it. <br /> <br /> "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" is a slightly down-budget movie from the great Brazilian director Nelson Pereira dos Santos. The scenario is very original and the story is talked about at Tupi. The film is often shot with natural light and is very real. Actors and actresses make naked speeches, and Ana Maria Magalhães is a spectacular showcasing a beautiful body and stunning performance. The sound was made by Brazilian musician Zé Rodrígue. This film is the beginning of the country's exploitation by Europeans at that time, paying attention to Portugal and France, trading with Indians and replacing scales and mirrors with our natural resources. This film is based on the Brazilian 1971 Brazilio Cinema Brasileiro Best Screenplay (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), Best Dialog (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and Best Cenograph (Régis Monteiro); São Paulo Art Critics Association (Associação Paulista dos Críticos de Arte), The Best of the Year (Ana Maria Magalhães) and several other awards. <br /> <br /> My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francês" ("How Much Was My Taste?")
