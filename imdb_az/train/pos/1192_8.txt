Richard Brooks' The Last Hunt was a movie star Stewart Granger could not even hear the word? he also violated the vintage poster for the film he was presented for signing in the years to come? but then the director fled with his wife, so it is understandable. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best a few years ago for everyone, regardless of their attitude to the best western and environmentally friendly 50s. In many ways, westerners of Anthony Mann, seeing their heroes, abstained from screaming and shouting at each step. Here, the legendary buffalo hunter of Granger has already been lit, but the buffalo stamp has led him to retreat with a challenging and proud racist armed weapon after Robert Taylor's quick shelter speeds of poetic justice. "I have a guilty conscience, and I can get some money." When removed by the Indians, he was fully aware of his loss as the heads of the disappearing Buffalos and Taylor slowly exhausted hate. When two men leave Debra Paget's footsteps? Indians kill the sole victim of Taylor's band? <br /> <br /> Taylor is, of course, not an ironic cast? Granger returned to Taylor for 50 years after a series of epic roles he developed for him in films such as Quo Vadis and Ivanhoe. His hair color can not be persuaded but his performance is a shallow and severe man, so he does not find a weapon that he hates, and he wears his weapon. Granger's accents are not always convincing, but Jimmy Stewart creates a good sense of calm in his mold, trying to keep his new thoughts and reconcile his actions with confidence before finally making it possible to adjust. Russ Tamblyn's semi-milked skins and Lloyd Nolan's one-legged old timer is as good as it can earn, but a real star script: is it a perfectly pleasing look and character? Is not Stanley Kubrick's ending debt for Shining? balance the historical defects with a fun drama without selling any of them. The new French DVD is an addition to DVDs, but it boasts a 2.35: 1 transfer with the English soundtrack.
