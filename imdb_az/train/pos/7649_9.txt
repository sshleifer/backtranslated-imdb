By Jim Belushi, this is a modern shepherd version of A Wonderful Life. Michael Caine played Belusha, an "angel," who would be able to see how life would be. Jim does his best with a good story and a supporting player; It looks like real chemistry between Hamilton and her. Oscar is not a competitor, but a good warm heart.
