Playwright Sydney Bruhl (Michael Caine) had a number of flop games after a great hit. He gets a game written by a student named Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) who is fantastic. Sydney is so good that it kills it. <br /> <br /> The backdrop of a thinker. This was a game at the beginning ... and shows. There are many groups and all the discussions, but I have never been bored. It is very well written with plenty of abundance and very good working force. Caine has a great performance like Bruhl. Reeve is surprising, very good. I did not think like any actor, but it's really good in this role. Dyan Cannon played a role as Bruhls' spouse. Irene Worth is psychologically good at Helga on Drop (and pretty funny). But his emphasis was on my mind. The director is very good with a set of Sydney Lumet. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> It contains one of the unromantic kisses, but it's gentle complaints. <br /> <br /> A very good tension. Critics hate this movie, and disappeared since it was released in 1982. This is too bad - better.
