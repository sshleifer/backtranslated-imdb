BASEketball is a very funny movie, which is a very funny, generally fun movie clip, very funny, a funny comedy for your pants and a classic slacker with its bad boy boy. One thing I did not like about BASEketball was that the kid really did not need it in the movie, but when the child was not in the movie, there were not some funny scenes. When you read any pro comments about this movie, it does not exclude all of them because most reviewers are not like this movie. Some basketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want.
