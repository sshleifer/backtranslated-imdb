Operation This movie is a very good moving film. I say that the speeches are somewhat weak; but for the most part the player is very good. The only actor Jude Law who killed me with pride was Harlequin Maguire. It was incredible! Tom Hanks did not appear to be reliable throughout the film, but he was incredible. Paul Newman, as always. Cinematography This is a masterpiece of the movie (and I use it rarely). Conrad Hall is a true genius. If you stop it at any point in the movie, you will see the elegantly designed work of this man. He sets up every shot so that nothing is thrown away. There is a card as a quality card when the camera is still there. As the camera moves, each shot is planned to reduce the excellence. But it does not stop there. Conrads color and color selection is a work of art in light and dark settings. The road that he has set up is the most beautiful lighting I've ever seen. What he did in this film was his work. This film is on the list for the best cinematography with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo. The story tells people that this film was a gangster flare in the 1930s, but I believe they miss the point of the film. She is a love of a prosecutor who is trying to save her son from the life she chooses. It is a brilliant story that turns into a beautiful tie between two people who have nothing but one another. Writing the screen is worth an Oscar. Music Thomas Newman regards this sad, but hopeful story as sad, but hopeful. Music is the most beautiful and moving points I've ever been to. Direction is a new director with a sense of directing Sam Mendes. The symbols he used and his speeches from his actors are rare in today's movie world. I'm going to be a follower of the next Sam Mendes Film. 10/10 One of the coolest and most beautiful films I've ever seen.
