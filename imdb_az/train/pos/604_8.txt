In the vicinity of his centenary, Saura met with an unprecedented abundance of talent from the Spanish art community to create the songs of love songs for their homeland. Twelve "impressions" of the suite do not allow the performance of each performance before Sauran's camera. The creator of large flats and mirrors along the set combined with a screen, shadow, fire, rain and rear projection adds dramatic dramatic effects to various choices of song, dance and instrumental performance. Albeniz's photos combine their passion for music throughout the program by combining their passion with the great creator. Saura on her stage begins to dance with teachers in the beautiful elegance of old flamenco dancers in a traditional suit covering all Spain.
