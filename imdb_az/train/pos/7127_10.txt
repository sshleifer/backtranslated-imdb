A film that is again interested in the trials and challenges of the Great Britain's World War II. This film is so good that it touches the human element. This film is definitely the tradition of the English line classics like "Ms. Miniver" and "Hope and Glory". As in this film, we see the despair of the people during the war. <br /> <br /> Here, the demonstrations were released, especially by John Thaw. <br /> <br /> We see why this child has entered his bed. <br /> <br /> The old man takes the child and brings happiness to his sad life. When the child is returned to his mother, the old man goes to London and seeks only to find the tragedy. <br /> <br /> He is capable of assassinating the boy and confirming that the child is better than staying in a child's home. <br /> <br /> The picture is very good, because it deals and builds a good relationship.
