My time has come a little late, but I'm glad to see this as well as the continuation ... it praises those who bark me to give a pure and basic treatment to the idea of ​​romance ... and marginally separates the idea of ​​this relationship! <br /> <br /> It was written in some of the films that I would personally enjoy a few parts of my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I think Jesse and Celine are doing wrong phone calls. it was a very delicate way to tell each other what they wanted to say, though their respective friends were 24 hours each in length ... two thought that the two people, both of whom thought, had an ineffective effect on the other party <br /> <br /> <br /> This type of flavor, even in the minds of the writer and the director, is not exactly drawn to the writers. Actors make it into something that can be difficult to justify right or wrong idea ... To be character, you need to go beyond the story and life story of the actor ... here actors are doing just the right thing! Kudos .. !!! and another feather that makes it even more beautiful before the sun sets!
