The first "side story" in the universe's Gundam universe presents a new look in the war between space and space colonies. <br /> <br /> It is not the focus of a small group of individuals who continue to play a key role in the conflict, but take into account the daily civilian population and how it looks with the war. some Gundam staples, its premiere is an attempt by a ZEON squad to capture an experimental Gundam, but this is an organization that is interested in watching the show. This series focuses on Alfred's relationship with a young teenager and a secret federation pilot and his neighbor Christina Mckenzie, a new Zeon pilot named Bernie Wiseman. <br /> <br /> Alfred develops some kind of "brotherhood love" for Bernie, and the young Zeon pilot falls to Christina. <br /> <br /> "War in the Pocket" proves that a great epic tales about special individuals are not needed for a good war story. There are no uber ace pilots that can be seen here, or large-scale naval battles. This short 6 episode focuses more on sensual drama on OVA politics or philosophy, and I really like how realistic the characters describe. Alfred thinks that typical daily children playing with fierce computer games and armed forces are cool. Then an emergency course in the terrible realities of war. Tough friendships and relationships between Bernie and Christina are played very real, without anyone entering the romantic drama outfit, who do not know that they are soldiers on the other side of the war. It goes for the love affair between Alfred and Bernie. I almost do not want to break most of the story here, but this is a much more heart wrenching to watch the tragedies that appear as a movement in the whole way until the end of its emotional devastating twist. <br /> <br /> This show never falls into the "drill" category, although there are no inaccessibility. Heroes are enough to hold the show. Do not worry if there are a variety of mobile costume moving scenes here and there. I'm convinced that at a level higher than each OVA, it will provide a great animation and a desire for some "compulsory" mobile suit battles in a Gundam series. <br /> <br /> Normally, Japanese or English would have to leave their personal preferences. But in this case, I strongly recommend the voice of Japanese English voice. Only Alfred's letters are more convincing in English, but outputs from the English voices are parallel and even superior to Japan, and each character is sounds with such realistic feelings and intonation. <br /> <br /> In short, this show does not try to surprise viewers. What we do, especially the death of innocence in the battlefield and the horrors of a war with the eyes of a child, conveys many heartbreaking issues that come closest to the home. A really small story that gives more credit than what is given.
