It was a beautiful movie. These women tried to save their husbands. Players' performances were great. I have to think about the movie long ago. I think every student must see this movie, they can think about war, relationship, friendship and love. I liked the film because it showed how strong your love is. I wish I could be strong like a woman. I really liked it because I said something about relationships and would like to see a movie. You can compare the film with "Der Untergang", pianist. If you combine these three films, it's best to see what happened during the war. We must remember something like an eternal war.
