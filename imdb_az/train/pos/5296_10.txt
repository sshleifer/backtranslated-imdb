Totally cheerful. John Waters' respect for the most loved (Baltimoreans) people is a twisted thing to look at and to laugh. It's turned into a kitsch museum empty! She has laughed at the theater since her birth. From the days of Dreamland, my old friends, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, liked to see the Waters camera. Casting is simply amazing (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). Old Waters uses the best elements of the persecution (especially Underrated Polyester) and many new surprises. He made me sick, in a beautiful way. Thank you, John!
