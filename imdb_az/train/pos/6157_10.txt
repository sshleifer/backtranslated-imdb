This was my 3-year-old video store, and I was so glad I did watch the animals on the island of Nabooboo after joy. We have acquired it and have been watching many times since; In fact, we've rented a few times. My son's watching and attention-free non-cartoons are very small; A nice change from Dumbo and the Little Mermaid. Acting is obvious, the songs are gratifying, deeper into your head, and you can not help, but only singles together. The story is endless, especially about WW2, and there's something new when you look at it every time. I've heard this in comparison to Mary Poppins, but I think they have very good films, but my son's interests are not in Maria Poppins. This is one of the movies that reassess the children and think that one parent will not fit. We have days ahead of Nap time and bed, and when I want to repeat any movie, I do not feel that there is something unbelievable.
