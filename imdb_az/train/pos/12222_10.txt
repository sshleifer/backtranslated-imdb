I thought that this movie blended me beautifully and that my uncle, whom I watched with me, was thinking. The young kevin dillon was hot to tell the truth. Hahahaha ... but I thought it was foolish to go to the girl, and I think it's wrong to say "I'm inside" before her death. I think he thinks he's gotten what he's doing with him and that he's too young when he does not care. How old were the other girls? I do not think I can trust the police like myself. It's true, though, that even if he wanted to be a police officer, I would still be suspicious or misled. He was laughing at his eyes at the store. However, it was foolish to enter the warehouse with him again, and HELLO was a police officer who died! This is back-up.Sometimes these movies make me fool about me mad and make me think what a stupid things are about a movie.
