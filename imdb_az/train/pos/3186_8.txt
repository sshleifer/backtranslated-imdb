I like this movie very much. The plot is simple and easily digested, humor is light and clean, and the story that covers the wrong personalities is so widespread that I'm looking forward to how this movie is going through this story. It turns out to be very nice. Women's performance is prized; Descriptive of the innocent, naive girl who tried to fabricate some of the white lies in David's complicated role was very attractive. I've seen Vera's dances very well. <br /> <br /> Today, I believe that you will use this film thoroughly for those who have quite a lot of swearing.
