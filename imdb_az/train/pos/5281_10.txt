it's a 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Thelma and Louise', not a nice road movie. gently and easily builds two main characters. viewers quickly learn the reasoned tension, which is the cost of the director. There is a young French (and English) boy who wants to work well in France, a French girl friend and a drinking alcoholic, parties like young men. With his paradise and the wisdom of the elders, he has a Persian father who speaks Persian (and French) who has a courageous Muslim belief and rejects the new culture around him (like mobile phones). The film looked at a very strange policy - a very strong policy - from the previous Yugoslavia, Turkey, and then from the Middle East to Mecca. Areas where Muslims are included in the war, pressure and ethnic cleansing; where dictators have been subjected to torture and ill-treatment to power, and where religious communities are continuously fierce battles with each other. yet these films and their capabilities are just acted on the agenda of the agenda. The relationship between the two is the basis of this film and is based on faith and politics. I say that we are all human beings and do not understand and care for one another in order to be good governed in this world. of course, is not 'Naturally born Killers' and is better for that.
