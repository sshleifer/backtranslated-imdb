I love movies that do not provide a typical "happy ending", and this is the reason I love the movie. Alice Marano (Denmark) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) were secretly caught in Thailand for drug trafficking after calling Thai authorities over the phone. The film works hard to keep track of the girls, whether they are girls or Bill Pullman's perfect bloody adventure. Jacqueline Kim, a more courageous, respected spouse, is transformed into a great performance, and he is also a lawyer. I want the girls to be more insulted in prison, another commentator suggested that I could say that Thai prisons could be extremely cruel. Nevertheless, this is the end of this movie. Alice ruled for 96 years because Darlene could be pardoned, and we (the viewers) realized they were innocent. Any movie that is opposed to my last expectations will earn extra points with me, and of course, this is a good acting drama.
