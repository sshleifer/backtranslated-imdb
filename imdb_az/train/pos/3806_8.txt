This movie took my breath in a few moments, just loved it! Let's remember that the character box and story could have been a little better understood, but hey, it's a simple (short) story of a few people trying to kill a dragon. <br /> <br /> Common design, atmosphere, beautiful scenery ... all this is just magical! <br /> <br /> In this movie, I have so much love. Character designs were great and funny. If you want a bit of Tim Burton business. I can advise anyone who is interested in great design, which is a simple, but beautiful story.
