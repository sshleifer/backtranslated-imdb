I think this movie is a masterpiece, but I took at least 4 times 5 times to see it. First, this is a face of WW2, which we often do not see in Hollywood movies. In particular, the German soldiers, the army and the Nazi government were more "humanist". One of the great things that surprised me was the recollection of a crime committed by a forest in the late 20th century ... this forest is where Berlin is the last chapter of Alexanderplatz: These are Reinhold's forests that killed Mieze. Another tip for those who love tafsili is the representation of the doors. Fassbinder faces changes when people enter a door each time or when a door opens. Many doors are displayed on the screen, open and close. And in the identities, behaviors of the heroes and so on. It changes. Did you notice that?
