Red Eye Freddy Kreuger is a thrilling movie by Wes Craven's creator. Wes Craven describes the story of a regular hotel worker, Lisa. After joining her grandmother's funeral, she decided to take the red-eye plane. During the waiting period, he meets a man named Jack Rippner (how fffrreeaakkyy?) And they are kind of a friend. On the contrary, both of them sit next to each other on this plane. That is when you start to fear. This movie is a good thing for those with a weak heart who do not like exciting and thrilling movies, so they can work on their pants. This is an excellent example of bone shaking. Wes Craven did a good job with this movie. Like Rachel McAdams, a clever, sexy girl, she chose the right-wingers who knew what she was doing and when she was moving in a movie. Cillian Murphy, a great actor who is a bad character in this movie, is frightening your bones and a terrifying actor and face can really enlarge your eyes. Wes Craven did an excellent job and I hope he does more like films.
