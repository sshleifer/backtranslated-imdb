There are very few native movies in Post-Colonial Africa, and they are a mixed group. It shows the best and worst values ​​of Africa with allegorical allegations of being subjected to slavery in the 1970s, and this is not a big difference in human values. <br /> <br /> İngilis həkimi David Linderbyin gözəl afro-amerikalı həyat yoldaşı Dr Anansa Linderby, əslində, Afrikalıların və xüsusilə də ərəblərin qərb pre-konsepsiyalarının qeyri-kafi təsiri nəzərə alınaraq, Ərəb köləli treyderlər, bir yeniyetmə Sanufu qız və bir with a young boy. Lead koləli trader, Solomon, combining with flowery rhetoric, and sometimes humorous, and "follow him" is not in place, but it is not standard in the scene with the bitdir Arabs. film is worthy. Of course, Peter Ustinov had enough skill to solve some of the scripts and could save some of the other things that could happen. <br /> <br /> stereotype issue, while maintaining the son of Solomon and the Arab workers unintelligentdir paedophilic tendencies, and it does not describe the gratitude on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of David's first ports is a local police officer, stereotypic, dark, and inexperienced African bureaucrat. David then meets two stereotypical white ex-pats, an English (performed by Walker, Rex Harrison) and American (played by Sandell, William Holden). Sandell is an employer with a "conditional" opinion on mixed racial ties that David refuses to give priority, even though David does not provide advance payment. When David learned of his love for Anansa and found it difficult to find love, David was happy to take David in a helicopter to help him search for Ananda. <br /> <br /> Suleiman and his captives are not able to cross the border and take them to the neighboring area. Sandell's hesitation and David's helicopter shot as a result of lack of experience with firearms, but David survived. <br /> <br /> We have just met Malik (Kabir Bedi), the African-ruled governor who lost David's family to Solomon. <br /> <br /> <strong> Saudi Arabia, a group of Sanufu girls with Tuareg find and they know they are on the right track to find Suleiman . <br /> <br /> Ən ürək döyən səhnələri birində yalnız bir qul qul <br /> <br /> Daha sonra biz təcavüzə uğrayan gənc oğlan bir cadı doktoru olduğunu, bir cadugər doktoru olduğunu, fövqəltəbii overtones ilə mükəmməl bir səhnə, o Uses his knowledge to kill one of Solomon's Christians. Anansa fights on the other side of Suleiman's death, despite the fact that the boy is undoubtedly on his own. <br /> <br /> Suleiman and his slaves are in the slave market. / <br /> <br /> Suleiman, Anansanın "concern" that there is no doubt that it is corrupt, but the smart legendary rich Arab prince (Omar Sharif) is trying to sell. Anna's U.N. , while the prince decides to make a very illogical discussion without considering the consequences. The scene is the scene where there are two best people. <br /> <br /> Kölə bazarında gənc oğlan, orta yaşlı bir Alman pedophile'a satılır və biz, <br /> <br /> Davud və Malik Suleimanla qarşı-qarşıya qalır və Malikin baxımından acı-şirin bir sona çatır. Finally, David and Anans are reunited, and Malik, who is the ruin of his life, feels comfortable to see himself completing his task. The overall film area is perfect, but loses traces of almost all the leading characters' stereotypical descriptions. The credit should apply to all leading actors to resolve many scripts.
