Although he wants to make a film about Gandhi in India, he is not shown as a man who can not make a mistake. This film shows how a Mahatma can not be a good father at least in his eyes. <br /> <br /> The competition is very beautiful, cinematographic fantasy, curious fantasy, but movie shootings. I think this movie should be left without expectations of any box office. <br /> <br /> The winners of Eurovision Song Contest 2012 were awarded. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Harilal is listening to his father's death. Dialogs, no shouting, but a silent shot by Khanna. One of the best scenes in the history of cinema. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gandhi,
