When people think of Chicago, Walter Payton, Ditka, and the "Da Bears", Ryne Sandberg, The White Sox are cursing in 2005 or immortalized Michael Jordan and his sixth championships (and Finals MVP) with Chicago Bulls. <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, rarely people are thinking about the blessed side of Chicago, ghettos, narcotics streets and their life in urban areas. <br /> One of the most spectacular TV shows and groundbreaking <br /> <br /> Good Times was another Norman Lear classic, the producer who gave us the "Good Times," as a small boy in CBS It was "Good Times". The "Jeffersons", the best African American site ever and the "Family of All" is the biggest show of all time. "Good Times" has revealed the challenges of the Ghetto and Urbanization projects, and has been greatly influenced by the charming, well-written and thought-provoking areas, and particularly by patriarch and patriarch of this fierce family-run family, played by Esther Rolle and John. The players in the team were also primarily Janet Jackson and the young boy James Evans, who, for the first time, understood Ralph Carter and the younger age of life, were fairly well-off and he said that this was played by JJ Jimmy Walker, the show goes up somewhere from the ground and is basically for funny relief. His emotional age is approximately 11 or 12 years old, although he seems to be a boy in the early twenties. J.J. it becomes frustrating and it is often a mistake for mistake James Evans (Amos), never J.J. get your own life, find a job, and get out of the house. J.J. <br /> <br /> Two classic episodes, and a little bit different from their younger brother, are important to get a college degree or to support a family that's higher than the family's well-being. <br /> <br /> Two classic episodes were working on Good 104's Janet Jackson firefighter, and Florida Evans was looking for a good medical aid because he could not afford something, but a very professional physician who did not want to give up still had a clinic doctor Family has more legitimate attention than projects. Another episode is a place where James Evans can not afford to rent $ 104 a month. Evans wants to get the biggest frustrations of the family by throwing off the project without going anywhere. Florida Evans goes to the center of the social services council to help her family either to receive loans or receive a grant. The government does not consider it a bad family because they are not entirely illegal in the poverty line, but unfortunately, the assets of the five families have more than $ 4,200. James and children want to go for money, but Florida is a good moral person, and no matter how hard it is for them, they do not want to do anything. Finally, the family finds a solution to keep their heads on the water. <br /> <br /> From the 1970s, the Good Times classic show protects you from the fiercest world of water. James and Florida Evans are also trying to improve their children and prevent social welfare. In the 70's, I was very young to understand the message on CBS's first release, but I am very pleased with the TV Land repertoire in 2006. "Good Times" is one of the classic backlinks. day
