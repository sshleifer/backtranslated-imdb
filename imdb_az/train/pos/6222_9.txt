This is really a great movie. Some songs have become immortal classics and are among the best dances by Fred and Zinger. All Fred and Ginger movies are identical. After the end of the song and dance, the film has some other characters. Why are all the negative comments about Randolph Scott troubling me? Harriet Hilliard and the romance of the film's sub-section, I will watch it over and over again. He adds to this movie and is sensitive to it. There is a winner and a great smile. Randy, my first ten is on my list all the time. It's good to see him as a cowboy. Ok, so he is not really a great actor, but a great number of stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, and so on. He liked it and could have gone upstairs. All of Fred and Ginger's films had subfields that were dependent on other actors to fill the gap between music numbers, otherwise the film was about half an hour shorter. I just wish many people would thank Randy and I needed to get up for her.
