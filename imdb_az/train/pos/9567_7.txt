I also watched DVDs of this movie. Cambodia (English subtitles say that the character speaks Thailand, but the movie says Cambodia) is a very violent human being, using hunger, to teach them to kill and kill and kill. He sends Pang to kill some people in China and a police partner is killed during the killing. The father of the police is a fist squirrel who is frustrated by a firefighter and a policeman in a coma. Wai's president is his father's friend and worries about Wai's wrong behavior. He grabbed his father to deal with drug dealers and hit him and put him in a coma. Pang escapes and hides at a garbage pond where he came here to find his mother and does not allow his father to go back. (Pang does not talk to China and does not understand it, but it is the cause of his apparent father, perhaps Cat III). Wai gets more restraint than taking Pang, but Pang is almost irreversible. Even after stealing a boat, Pang takes his wife home to her home and is pregnant. Wai joins and joins a bad man (educate the guys) by contracting to fight and train to pick up cotton. Pang, who was a victim of the great victim of Wai and Pang, left Wai's death and left to die just like the next guy to die of the death of Pang and raise him as a killer. This movie was shot with beautiful pictures with a beautiful soundtrack. There are many cruel violence scenes. The long nail woman pulled out of her foot. Knife and Torso Knives The guns shot directly on the head. And a very intense beating. Perhaps it is tense and disobedient, but worth seeing.
