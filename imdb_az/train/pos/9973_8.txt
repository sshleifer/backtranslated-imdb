I liked this version of Vanishing Point versus the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version quite boring. It's better than I am to stop in the middle of a movie several times (as I did with the 1971 version). Of course, this could be only 9 in the development of the 1971 version. However, I saw many remakes, liked the original and older one better. I've seen the version of the 1997 version clearly and actually keeps it intact, without breaking the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, the version of 1997 was more exciting and not "bloze." (Boring)
