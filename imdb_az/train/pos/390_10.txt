When I saw these films, it was the first thing I thought about: It's not really a movie, at least when we hear the word "movie" is not self-centered. it is absolutely symbolic, and everything in it is a figurative meaning. That is, if you do not use symbolic expression, if you do not get acquainted with philosophical, religious and spiritual life, you think it's just a fairy tale ... and even a strange, chaotic one. For me, the legend of Zu is perfectly transparent. And I love it. The struggle between light and darkness tells a story about an ancient struggle like humanity and of events that stand in front of every human being who examines those feelings in life. The film is clearly made by Buddhists. I'm not a Buddhist. My religion and the vision of the world and man are different. But since we are all human beings and have the same human nature, we have absolute experience and understand each other. This is a really nice movie! And I'm a movie that's a kind of movie. There are many empty stories that are good for the time pass.
