When I see this title in the video store, I will never forget it. I was always a great stranger and when I saw this video I hired and looked. At that time I was very young to appreciate all the delicate humor and lines, but I remember that I was old enough to understand the audience. Especially if you are an admirer of "Al", you will use this film thoroughly. MTV-esque is produced in the "Rockumentary" style and explains a true (but sometimes exaggerated) story of how Al would be as in 1985. If you like her humor brand, and more importantly, her music.
