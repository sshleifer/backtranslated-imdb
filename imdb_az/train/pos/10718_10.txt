Spacecamp is my favorite movie. This is a great story and inspires others. The player was excellent and my husband and I went to see Lea Thompson in Cabaret because of his performance in the movie. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger Accident has been celebrated. I knew one of the Challenger astronauts since my childhood at Carnegie Mellon Campus, where my father went to school; <br /> <br /> I know the ex-pilot's close friend. <br /> <br /> Last year, the Boy Scout for the National BSA was a technical overview for the Astronomy Merit Badge and still the followers of Spacecamp. <br /> <br /> As I reached a single adult, I ran to the late astronaut and challenger when we explode, we were following the engineering education program. I was sitting in "invisible" with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, which eventually led to something accidental at the Astrotech shareholders meeting, so I got closer to the accident and any similar movie similarity. I was a good student, and four years later, I was quite surprised to find that Rockwell's engineer did not fly to Challenger in 1986, and then he endured Endeavor's advice.
