This is the first sight I have seen last year! Very bad, incredibly original, incredibly great looking (Technicolor looks beautiful for this cool screen) and actually has the depth of what it says about character and society. It really shines everything from Intelligent Security, Homeland Security to racial issues, but at the same time laughing and living in fear of the world. Carrie Anne Moss returns to a comedy performance that will not betray me! She's cute, funny, and sexy! Billy Connolly is great as Fido and can only be frightened! Like Dad, Dylan Baker is priceless. In fact, the whole castle is perfect. Henry Czerny as a bad guy, Tim Blake Nelson, a neighbor of a hot sexy zombie girl (now we can think of it) and watch this movie! Nothing you've seen before.
