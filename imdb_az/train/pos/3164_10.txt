I do not believe that there are more than 70 shows. 70's show has all 8 seasons! I absolutely love it! I slept in bed every night and watched several episodes before going to sleep. At the end of a long day, it is wonderful to go back and get a great smile before you go to sleep. I was so sorry that they opened fire ... at least they are trying again! I hope and pray that you will come back with at least a merger ... Maybe Donna finishes her college and we finally see her and marry Eric !!!! It would not have been strange! It would be better if it lasted for several years!
