We always watch American movies with special emphasis from each region (south, western, etc.). We are the same here. <br /> <br /> This film, along with the United States and Europe, will also favor the cinematography industry. <br /> <br /> This film was not even about a parallel world, but even for those living in a big city like SÃ£o Paulo. All actors are improvised and they are very real. Camera invites us to share the world of confusion, the uniqueness and the world of each character. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and even the worst rent at home.
