Perhaps this is the best film, and if Brian De Palma presents here, it is a great cinematography, even though it is not one of those who burned on your pupils. First, there is Brian De Palma's director's touch, which can be one of the best directors once again, with a performance beyond Al Pacinos, who brings an immortal hero to the big screen (Tony Montana). There are many different (severe) scenes that you will never forget (most of Tony's are with a chain in a large hammock like living room), very superb liners are often used in the word "f * ck"), there are superb small details ("the world is yours"), or not well known from Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be said of anything big here and it's easily combined with one of the best gangstermovies in the "Godfather", "Good fellas" and "White heat"!
