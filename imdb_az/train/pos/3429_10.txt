It was filmed on Friday (1/19) a night in Sundance for Park City and was transferred in an incredible way. It was more than I was in a theater and the angry soldiers who were in their first-hand position. Some of the spectators acted equally and whenever we wanted to turn away, these men and women have at least witnessed that we share experiences with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze, and Herold Noel, war veterans in Iraq and the film. You can now say that while they are at home, it is still in the war and that it will always be. If you support the war or not, it is our duty to support the troops except a bumper sticker. Watch this movie!
