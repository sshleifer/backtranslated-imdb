I went to see Fever Pitch with my mom, and we can say that we love her. It was not a typical romantic comedy that hit one of the other and puppy bla-blah ... You did not wait for the first kiss of the climber, or finally come together. It was more realistic, because all movies did not come together, but through the relationship. People can actually be related to the movie because it does not seem to be unusual or unusual. It was really funny and I think Jimmy Fallon's best performance. All this ... I would definitely recommend it!
