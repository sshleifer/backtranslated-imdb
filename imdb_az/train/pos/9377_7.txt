Doodle is a double tilt with a double twist and more folded than a pad. A great cast that blends with an interesting area controlled by the Sea Director Twin Peaks-Business. Nicholas Cage shows a very small number of actors and a great portrayal of a man who is looking for something right. J.T. Walsh (RIP to a great actress) is always a nice villain, like Dennis Hopper. It is such a shame that we have never had a high profile profile. But I'm sure he has followers. All this is a great movie that shows you do not need a commercial soundtrack to become a great bangs or an entertaining movie.
