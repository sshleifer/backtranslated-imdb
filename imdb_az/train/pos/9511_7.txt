A bloody gangster story that took place during the Great Depression. Another famous cunning, Michael (Mike), tells us about Sullivan. Anyway, this time the story turns to the other side: Mike fights to save his life and his only remaining son because the rest of his family was killed for his dirty games of his manager. He revenges and gives his son a glorious future, but in the end he is killed. <br /> <br /> Mike Sullivan's great role was played by Tom Hanks and played by Mr. Rooney (Department of Mafia), part of Paul Newman. The film has made a great impression and we have heard the famous phrase "robbing banks." This film is still worth watching, though Sam Mendes is expecting something bigger than the American Beauty.
