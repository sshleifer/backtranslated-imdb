Although I've seen this movie a few years ago, its effect has never left me. A description of Stephen Rean's invigilator is deep and moving. His anger is felt until he can not stop the death. Everyone in the flood is happy with Sutherland and tries to guide the police to coordinate his efforts, and a problematic citizen x. Every day when we are bombed with stories of mass murderers, I think of the hard work of those who want to find this film and murder.
