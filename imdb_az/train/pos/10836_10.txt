I thought this movie was fantastic. It was cheerful. Kinda reminded Spinal Tap. It must see all kinds of fan of more than 70 rock. (I hope my friends are not even twenty years!) <br /> <br /> Bill Nighy gives good performance as a leading singer off the kilter trying to retrieve this old spirit. <br /> <br /> Stephen Rea is perfectly suited to the movie if she tries to keep the film together. <br /> <br /> If you love music and you're in a band, this is definitely for you. You will not be disappointed to see this movie. I do not know, I know. Even my family found it funny, and this one says.
