A light-hearted comedy, Nothing shows us a world we sometimes want to run: no world. Anything you want may be lost due to invoice collection, bad memory, or even hunger desires. <br /> <br /> They were very good at this movie, and there was a good start with a couple of things that I did not like about anything, and they were not even part of the main movie. <br /> <br /> First, the post-credit scene (and yes, one): Good for a giggle, but what have they tried to do? I mixed it back to something after a movie of nothing, and I wanted it. Instead, we heard a random sample of voices and screamed. Secondly, trailers: After watching the trailer on the DVD, I was trying to build it in my opinion and it was not really necessary, and it was said to be the same as someone else, and it never promoted a fearsome movie. Well, I can say poor marketing. <br /> <br /> If you see it in the movie hire shop, take a look because it's not a big movie watching anything. If you have a large screen, you may want to wear shades.
