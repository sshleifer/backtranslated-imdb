People are about to have a tension and disappointment if everyone expects a great zombie movie after reading a title. As for myself, I was expecting a low-budget cheeseball zombie flick - and exactly what I got. I'm not disappointed at all. I thought it was a cool movie in this movie. The zombie had to have all these, all of the zombies were simply turned on because they were modest zombies. Of course, they understand it, because it would be quite costly if they would make a completely rotten zombie FX. I understand everything and I do not know how seriously anyone can take this movie. For the love of God, it is called "the living dead animal"! You would watch "Redneck Zombies" and any Uwe Boll movie, and you really expect this to be beautiful? Of course not! So, like schoolgirl girls on this movie, there's some logic in IMDb, and I will not understand. Oh and YES, there are bad movies there, so stop saying that it's the worst you've stopped because you know you're full of it! Have you ever watched "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "The House of the Dead" ???? THIS APPEARANCE is one of the worst I've ever seen. If you can not see that there is only an open-minded zombie movie made by fans of the zombie movie, then something else is with you. I just enjoyed it. He's away from me and I want to see him later.
