I watched this movie a few days ago in a small independent film in Paris. It was last evening in the French capital and it was the best I could choose. These twenty episodes thrilled my impressions in Paris without leaving the kitsch or the sentimental schmaltz heartwarming. Each episode is full of surprises, strong emotions and surprising images, and every short film is managed under a good short story rules. To me, such a film requires more talent and character than any epic two-hour drama by writer and writer writers, and all of them were perfectly competent! The stories are carefully selected from the point of view of Arrondissement and perfectly adequately express their competence. Each episode was seen from a different shoe, had a different theme, a different style, and still had twenty stories with a harmonic orchestral film. In my opinion, the episode of the movie concept is based on the fact that you can vary between different feelings and moods without excessive load safety, just another way: melancholy melancholy, melancholy pure joy, despair, anger, anxiety, passion and passion are unique to this movie freshness and harmony. We should not forget all about love! These are the symbols love between the characters in Paris and the director and actor / actress for this project. I do not want to go to the episode details because there are many, but it is worth mentioning the world-famous actors and actresses and their approach to this project. Some have played with their own image, some have completely broken down, and some have interpreted their stereotypes or their roles in their respective countries, so the intertextuality was given in the film. Generally I can offer this great collage and wait for the DVD to be released.
