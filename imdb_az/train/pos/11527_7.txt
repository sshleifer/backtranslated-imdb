Miriam Hopkins was the "Red-haired lady" in the biopic of Mrs. Leslie Carter, a wonderful actress supporting Miss Claude Rains in 1940, including David Belasco, Richard Ainley, Lou Payne, and Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give beautiful speeches. Hopkins was a wonderful actress who really feels for Mrs. Carter. <br /> <br /> Dear Carter's second husband, Lou Payne, is an advisor on this film, Rainbows are as big as a fabulous, egoist producer / writer / actor / impresario, David Belasco, one of the big names in the theater. , this is a weak representation of Ms. Carter's life's realities. Indeed, it was a very open and bitter divorce, and, of course, was a scandalous character and an actress. However, he arrested his son Dudley, so there was no fighting power. After breaking down with Belasko, he did not come back and actually started working in his pocket, and in fact, shot several films to the end of his life. At the beginning of this film, the driving force for Ms. Carter restores her son's retention, but at last she understands that when she leaves her, she has a comprehensive relationship with her father. In the film (and I'm not sure if it's true in real life), she set out on her mother and lived in a theater hostel. This also adds an extraordinary atmosphere to the movie. <br /> <br /> A bad movie, probably, is either a description of either Carter or Belasco. One of Ms. Carter's most famous moments was in Maryland's heart. She wore a six-foot-long wig. The fans on the stage burned their hair after hanging at a height of 35 meters from the scene holding a call center to protect the hair from raging. Very visually.
