I've always been an admirer of David Lynch and with this film, Lynch has proved to his critics that he has the talent, style and artistic integrity to make films outside the world of well-known surreal aura in the past decade. As well as the G-rating of the movie, pure Lynch is also in style, pacing and tone. The film is skillfully moving at a hypnotic speed and full of emotional and power scenes. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is as beautiful as expected from the Lynch movie and breathtaking assembly lines are breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth has become a beautiful look. <br /> <br /> It is great to see a film dedicated to the artist's memorial. <br /> <br /> With this movie, David Lynch has proved to critics. <br /> <br /> In this film, David Lynch said he could take a strong motion picture with the Blue Velvet and Elephant Man, as in the 80s. Critics have lost their image over the last decade after releasing movies such as Twin Peaks: Fire With Me and Lost Highway, but this shows that the film is a FWWM and LH method, and as if the Straight Story has become one of the most moving animated images. I have never seen Straight Story. This is a story about family, friendship, and love of good people. I would highly recommend it.
