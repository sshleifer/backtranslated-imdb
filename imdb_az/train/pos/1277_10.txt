I think this movie is one of the best about Mike Hammer, determined by Biff Elliott's performance, Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's manuscript is perfect, and Mickey Spill's novel has many improvements. Its direction is powerful and creative, and it uses beautiful light and shadow. Franz Waxman believes that John Alton's camera work is superficial. Casting takes part in numerous memorable performances as well as veteran players, as well as Charlotte Manning in Peggie Castle. All this is one of the best private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex should get more opportunities. I have always appreciated this movie.
