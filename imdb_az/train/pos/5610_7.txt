Roman Polanski skillfully manages such changes in the same subject with Repulsion. <br /> Polanski </ b> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> starting with a psychological disorder that begins with self-esteem, a progressive physical defect flourishes, and its characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and Le Locataire itself) are very good at being tortured. The shared error for the heroes and spectators is not really the same as the horror and tension of horrible movies, because there is no supernatural element here. If terrible movies are some sort of catharsis (inexpensive or inaccurate), Polanski sadistically gives us torture and dark humor in the latter opus, we tend to prefer our nerves beyond our borders. <br /> <br /> Change, horror, all these play with the expectations of the audience (alternatively deceiving and fulfilling), does not mean the fullness of people's nerves. My book, Rosemary's Baby, is a much greater achievement because healing paranoid and simple rationality are in constant struggle: when a story is forced to identify with a single character, it is about a pair of moving in a strange apartment. Moreover, if the fantasy elements are in the mind of the hero, the situation is very disturbing because we, the observers have to judge him, and when we have to master it with skill, we have transformed it into a "paint charm".
