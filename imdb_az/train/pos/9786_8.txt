I liked the main castle performances very much. Emma Lung is brave and interested. The director has made speeches where characters are not dimensioned. A complex story ranging from eras. The impact of the loss of power and the closure of a large employer in a small city also evaluated the main story of trade unions. I do not agree with the statement that the old man should be attractive. There are many relationships with older men and young women - men do not look good. The character's depth is not so intense. The film has a good look and cinematography is also good.
