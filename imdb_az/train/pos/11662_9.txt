The secret of Kells is one of the rare, beautiful and eye-catching animated films I've ever seen. Before watching this movie, I thought I was not paying anything and that there was nothing to win in that category, but I found a serious rival in Kells. <br /> <br /> Kell's secret tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, who lives with her uncle, Kell's president. Abbot is a loving guardian, but maybe a little too tough and more concerned with reinforcing the wall around the city by attacking the vikings rather than raising the child's imagination. When the legendary brother Aidan (seen as a striking Willie Nelson) and taking his child under his wing, Brendan goes on a journey in the woods and meets a lovely granny named Aisling (and more than once). With the help of Aisling, she tries to save the city and helps Brother Aidan complete the mystic book of legend. <br /> <br /> It can turn darkness into darkness. <br /> <br /> The secret of the Kells: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of- kells.html
