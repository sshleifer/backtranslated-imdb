This movie is not great, but good and pleasant. It feels like an indie movie made from a play script. Morgan Freeman plays the essence of himself, the director says that the script is not written for him. And there is a slight mockery for a filmmaker going to a supermarket to investigate. I do not want to say that he really ended the film and we're watching it. <br /> I saw that the dialogue was a little too positive for my taste, but it was still refreshed. It's a movie that inspires the viewer to look at his life and choose the direction to go. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: A beautiful movie based on dialogue with two actors and a few additions, looks like Morgan Freeman. good :)
