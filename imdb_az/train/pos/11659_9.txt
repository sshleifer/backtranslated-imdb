This animated feature (a joint production of Ireland, Belgium, and France) is one of the most strange issues for a film: The famous book of the nineteenth century is the Kell's book. This story is a must-have for grading around a banner around a prophylactic abbot, which is a festive abbot, who is worried to prepare for a defense attack expected by the abbey fears vikings, a prepubescent boy, a prepubescent boy named Brendan, needed to finish the book The forest to find the materials. To do that, he finds a friendly fairy named Aisling unexpectedly. The use of art and color creativity, and the use of geometrical forms, is manifestly ambitious, but not different types of eye-opening, with a hand and gently hand-made (some computer animations in several key passages) in a medieval and traditional Celtic style sort is not a good one. Had someone been a nitpick - apart from some anachronisms like an African priest in the 9th century? one of the Catholic mysticisms in this film will have to say that the mixture of Celtic Paganism would not really come together. And the funny relief is sometimes a bit too wide. That's why I can not give them the highest rating. But this is a minor problem with another beautiful and perfect creative film.
