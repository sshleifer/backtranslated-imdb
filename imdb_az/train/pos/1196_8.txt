I was watching the film shot for a few days, the last one was only two scenes in the film. The place was Lake Sylvan in the Black Sea. Bring the wagon, stop the carriage and so on. So, this Dakota youth were eager to see the movie and were not disappointed. Local buffalo flock, shooting scenes were real. (yes, Doris, the animals were damaged while filming) I think, was copied by the thrill Jack Nicholson in the Shining? A western / social comment over 50. It should be in the same class as the High Drop for the real western drama, or used as a public statement such as Blackboard Jungle or Rebel Without Cause.
