Like the great classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie is humorous at different levels. I presented it to my 10 year old daughter and my 11 year old son. Both were fond of the movie - they laugh a few times ... and my daughter is not a fantastic fan. The movie has made me laugh despite being seen several times ... adult level humor (ie adult life experience, where no baudy or R-rated thing is found), it's equally enjoyable for adults. Like the humor of adolescence, Mars's sounds are based on the characters of various films / actors. Martian pilot, Blaznee, Jack Nicholson's voice and behavior; scientist, Peter Seller's Dr. Strangelove. Special effects are a striking thing for this movie. The lack of top 10 actors really works for the film and actors play their role - in fact, the power of the producers' actors and their skills in the box office form (a great example of Wayne Alexander's "Vern" character). I have to write this review ... kids play it for the third time in 4 days. There is nothing good for a rainy day or night night-on-and-I'm-compressed movie.
