The Grinch is made up of Jim Carrey and I'm very sorry for his performance. If I were not a big admirer, I was amazed at the result, but I enjoyed it. Like Cindy Lou, Taylor Momsen was the sweetest little girl I have ever seen on the screen, and she showed her competence in the player years. Even at some point I was tired! I did not know what to expect, because I did not read Dr Seuss Tale Book, it was humor too dark. Generally, I loved the film (except for the songs!) And would recommend it especially for family viewing.
