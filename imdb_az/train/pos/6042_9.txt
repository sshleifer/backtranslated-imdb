Taking off rented movies, I chose Freebird. I lost the first three parts of the film, it would be a waste to see the rest. Fortunately, I really was heated and I liked the movie a bit. The second half of the film made me laugh and laugh all the time. Thankfully, though they were part of the CGIs, they did not appear or spread. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that all of the actors have vast European voices, such as sounds or their cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really liked this movie, and I have to order a copy of my own collection.
