Since this is a Black History Month, and many Afro-Americans are watching the chronological success of the movie, I have obtained this movie from the library at the VHS because it was in Duke Ellington and her orchestras. Franz Liszt's jazz version of "Rhapsody" was a manifestation of the mysterious-musical comedy blend that was mostly overlapping. Like many others, Kitty Carlisle, especially Sweet Marijuana, Carl Brisson's "Cocktail for Two" and duet with Carlisle, was a dance duet prepared by Gertrude Michael, her beloved lover. Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen are going a bit more with the love / hate joke as producer and detective, but they grow up on you. And Toby Wing is teasing a sexy mute teaser like Nancy, who wants to say something to Oakie, but always from her "Not Now". I was not surprised by the obviousness of those cartoons that caused many murders. And here you get a naked load of women (of course their breasts are covered, either hands or a refined ball). It was a very important code. You need to look at this movie for any movie you are interested in. P.S. For a long time, as a resident of Louisiana, when I was born Carlisle, I was celebrating a New Orleans birth.
