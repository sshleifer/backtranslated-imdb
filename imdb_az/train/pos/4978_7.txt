Beautiful Shirely Temple short. The children who shouted the lines for that day and time seemed to be normal. Perhaps we had to be "seen and not heard." Besides this is fun. Taking into account the film era, there are certain aspects of what has brought me so much social, as well as many progress and liberalism. I will not go here, I do not want to spoil you, but watch for yourself and see those elements. Shortly thereafter, it was easy to see the charm that Temple was developing. It is worth watching that you are a fan of the Temple. A good way to kill others for ten minutes while waiting for a good night column to heat the stove.
