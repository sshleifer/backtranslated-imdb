Let me know that when I see at least two episodes of StarTrek, I do not consider myself Trekker or Trekkie. These are the people who are living in the basement of their parents and who are contracted with suits with rubber ears. I put aside the fantastic historical mistakes of this film. The player was on average better than average, but the plot was no surprise. They tried hard to turn the technology down, but still special effects were a big mistake. Now, when it comes to historical errors, the first Capitan company pilot Commander April, then Captain Pike, Jim Kirk, and others. According to Ricker and Kirk, the Klingons taught them and gave them technology (hence, a directive was created) I said there was no reason to ignore such a beautiful series. Hopefully, the fields will deepen, and then special effects can come back.
