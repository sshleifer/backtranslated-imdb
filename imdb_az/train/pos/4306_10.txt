Ten years later, the film tells us what the truth about movies really is. It confirms me as a movie that will touch the Grand Canyon in a way or in some way. I really believe that there was a Grand Canyon before the movie was shot. In my opinion, the biggest difference between these two films is the time they are released. I will not claim to be the best one, but I will fight against the idea that they share the same message. I would like to hear from those who have ideas on this subject. We will begin with a statement you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can find me there to write any other topic about movies that we share, as there is a real love for the movie.
