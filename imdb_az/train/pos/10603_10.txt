My four and five year old daughters have always been tired of being exposed to Nickelodeon, Disney, and so on. All of this looks like routine old-fashioned cartoons again. My daughters were ill because they could not go to justice in the afternoon, and I wanted to rest and rest for a while. I went to the TV and started looking for something different, I turned the channels. My finger stopped Harvey's voice when he heard my voice. I resemble every single thing this person does, and I saw a little duck doing a noise ... it would be good, it could not change its channel! My daughters were amazed at the animated film, and I looked at ALL the show, and I loved it more than I love it. This is not necessarily a helper for "gay rights", but has never fallen under the child for any child. There were friends I had for something or something else .... very greasy, very skinny, very feminine, scary, not smart enough, just a parent .... you name it! Children, as a rule, can be very cruel to each other, so I'm glad to see a thrilling cartoon, which actually conveyed a LIFE MESSAGE to a spectator. My daughters just accept others and do not choose others because they are different. If my eldest daughter really is selected for her friends (a mother and a little girl are often selected, my heart is hot when Kassie stops for her!). <br /> <br /> Thus, you condemn this show because you feel you are a defender for "gay rights" or you have to "take some ideas", yet this magnificent little cartoon <br /> <br /> If it's best to tell you what you need, it's much more than just helping you out with any TV show.
