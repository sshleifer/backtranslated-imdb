<br /> <br /> The movie "All dogs go to heaven" is a great movie. I was two years old in 1989. I did not understand it well, as I understand, I like the songs I love in this movie, my favorite songs "Let me be surprised" and "I'll come home soon." These beautiful songs, the only thing that disturbs me <br /> <br /> The most beloved part of the film is my favorite part of the film while flying around Annabelle and Charlie. <br /> <br /> Some movies, movies, films, films, movies, movies, movies, and everyone else have to offer it. I'll give this movie 10/10 stars.
