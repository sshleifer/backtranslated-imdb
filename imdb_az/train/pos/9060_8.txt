I've seen today at the age of eight. I thought I was cute. I will remember with another poster that I do not accept anything like a book, but still love it. All the kids are pretty good and all are pretty entertaining. Billy is a new child who is threatening school to feed 10 worms a day. If she loses, she should go to the hall with worms in her pants. The film was originally designed to show that Billy had a very weak stomach and stomach. Hilarity occurs in several different ways to cook worms. A good message about choking and, of course, happy happy ending.
