I joined Camp Chesapeake. Located at the top of the Gulf of Chesapeake in the north of the North East River. The camp was similar to the summer camp. It was created by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started a young ship and then became a Junior, Senior Consultant, then a Waterfront Director. If the camping continued, I would do my best to become a camp manager. Alas YMCA's authorities decided to close the camp and sell it to the MD. A few years later, he came to a boat camp and was terrified of the devastation of the MD and the natural destruction of nature. The 350 hectare area has been very active with all the benefits of connecting with natural proposals. A black man named Curtis Ford and his family were residents and guardians of the property. Mr. Curtis was my friend and mentor. I liked his existence. He was a waterman, even though he could not swim. If I were to ask where the fish were screaming, I would have been able to locate the ball and throw it. At the end of summer, it was a family camp. These memories will be with me for eternity.
