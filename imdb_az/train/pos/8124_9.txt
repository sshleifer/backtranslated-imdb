Great movie about METROPOLIS, this old clean fantastic movie. Sometimes, though the film is somewhat promoted and the player is a little spacious, it's a big movie for two reasons. The first one is extremely original in style and content. Even in the 21st century, I can say that there is no movie. Secondly, the special effects for the time were totally unbelievable: to create beautiful scenes of the post-apocalyptic world and a great city of tomorrow, using matte images, models and great releases. Of course, you can come back and beat the movie because the effects of today's standards are just so-so. When the film goes out in 1936, you have to understand that the art is in the state of the art, and the audience should be amazed. <br /> <br /> In many ways, it reflects the "modern cities" exhibited at WORLD FUND in 1939. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is interesting, because "or will we be appointed for greatness?" As a result, both of them will appear! <br /> <br /> The last note: I've seen on TV twice and just shot a while ago. Three times the sound and print quality - especially the sound. If it's on a DVD, hopefully it will provide a more clean and optional theme. I would really appreciate it when it sounds like a video!
