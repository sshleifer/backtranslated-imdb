I was disappointed with the lack of tasks in this stunning and effective little movie. Jordi Molla is probably the best of Ted Demme's role as Diego, who authored, directed and starred "Blow". <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give you any point of the movie as a movie (at least for me) was very excited if you did not know anything about it .. If you have a netflix account or you can enter a video store that will carry it ... highly recommend it I am. <br /> <br /> The Billion's direction is very impressive and shows a lot of promise. <br /> <br /> An incredible, unimaginable image and <br /> <br /> Beautiful Spanish "No somos nadie" (On Allah Air) is a great movie that you can show to your friends. <br /> <br /> YOU know.
