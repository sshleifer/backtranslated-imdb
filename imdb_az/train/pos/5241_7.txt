Thaddeus O'Sullivan, a powerful film from the heroes of British and Irish actors, is a perfect film. The film deals with a terrific theme and effectively takes Belfast's hopelessness and hearty atmosphere in the 1970s. Surprisingly, there is nothing to glorify both sides of this conflict. On the one hand, it shows a young Catholic father who wants to raise his family without having to worry about it. On the other hand, he is dealing with a network of Loyalist networks intending to promote violence. Very interesting and happy, entertaining. Do not wait for any laugh. 10 to 7-i.
