<br /> <br /> This interesting Giallo boosts a typical but still thrilling field and a truly sadistic killer. <br /> <br /> A year ago, Emilio P. Miragli's director, and also a very interesting film, La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba (also see my comment), started a little slower, but generally with unnecessary subtitles or sequences it does not go unnoticed. /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian work, but a video was shown in a 15-minute version of the condolence "Horror House" in Germany. At least, the crime scenes that provide every strangeness have been completely violated, and the viewer is still killing the killer. But the Italian version containing all the images will still be searched. <br /> <br /> The La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte, with its purposeful twists and red biscuits, is somewhat superior to believing Giallo Giallo fans and Miraglyn's above-mentioned tensions.
