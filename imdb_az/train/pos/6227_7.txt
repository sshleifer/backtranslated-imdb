Of course, at least one of Astaire / Rogers music. It's just a badly designed and progressive one. This is just a few minutes longer than Swing Time, but it feels a bit longer for a while. This is partly due to the secondary romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Hilliard. Scott is rarely interested. I love Hilliard. She is cute and I love at least one of her songs, "But where are you?" ("Get behind the devil," his other number, and the weakness of the Chess Grand Chance, which was cut off by chess). If there is at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astaire and Rogers, watching the Filo will be a really bad movie. The dance competition rises to the highest point of any of their numbers. Dance is just fantastic. Two dances, "I put all my eggs in a basket", are not quite grown up. His imperfections make it even more perfect. And "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of Irving's best songs in Berlin. So the film desires to watch its great moments.
