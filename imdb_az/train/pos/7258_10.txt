I was fortunate enough to get a DVD copy of this movie recently and now I've seen it for the second time. For the first time in Australia, I was in late night television 20 years ago, but I will never forget this strange and foolish movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is so unconventional for many people - <br /> <br /> By knowing that I was the producer of a copy of this movie, it was dead, the main actor was dead, no British television or movie archive, no video or DVD was broadcast that television networks had been copyrighted in the 80s After having won the right, they threw him out. There were no devices that could be marked for consumers when it first appeared on television in Australia. <br /> <br /> Recently, I could see why it was unforgettable at the second glance. Sometimes, many Harold Pinter is very intense and intolerant claustrophobic in the scene game. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, please email me everybody wants a DVD copy, and I'm sure we can do something.
