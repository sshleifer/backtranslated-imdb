This is a really good movie. Sumitra Bhave has always made a sensational film and this is my favorite movie for me. This film should be worthy of the National Award and it would be my choice to represent India at the Oscars. <br /> <br /> This year, at least a thousand times better than the Shaaws, which goes to India's Oscars. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this information (and all other Indian movies) does not have IMDb information and is sometimes incorrect. Sadashvili Amrapurkar was a very important character in this film, and he did not even write on these pages. The remainder of the remains and the crew are not mentioned at all. Although Sonal Kulkarni won the Indian National Award for this film, he did not receive awards or nominations. <br /> <br /> 'Doghi' is not a Hindi movie. It is Marathi and proudly runs thanks to the kind of dance and glamorous and semi-slim designer shells. <br /> <br /> Rare is a real life story that is understood and respected. <br /> <br /> It is a story of two brothers, Gauri and Krishna, who, roughly, can be translated as 'two women'. This is actually a very simple story, Sumitra Bhave can not enter many sub-areas and this is a very difficult movie. The entire film is set in a remote village in Maharashtra, and the screen rarely teaches two female protagonists from home. <br /> <br /> This film does not have an aesthetic solar cell. <br /> <br /> The film opens and we get acquainted with the whole house prepared for Gauri's wedding. Gauri and Krishna's father are hard-working farmers, home is full and happy; There is nothing short of wanting a simple life. However, on the eve of the wedding, Gauri's comrade comes with a fatal accident. Gauri's father does not bear tragic news and suffers a major catastrophe. Gauri's mother was responsible for a home without a strong, working member. It works like that and can do it at the time, but it is impossible to finish it. But life is still easier than Gauri. Imagine trying to forget people sincerely, making Gauri a chance. <br /> <br /> Gauri's mother writes to her brother. He is hopeless to accept his offer. He transports Gurini to Mumbai and works with a knife where he is. Gauri improves his money and conditions. Gauri gives his life for his family. <br /> <br /> However, Gauri does not go out to meet her when she returns Krishna's wedding to her home. He does not allow Krishna to approach him, and Gaurini does not let his guests. Gaurini loves Krishna's life. This completely breaks Gaurini and decides to return to his unsuccessful life. But Krishna runs away and Gaurini fights. He urges his beloved sister to return. Krishna promises to stay with her. Promises to meet with the world? <br /> <br /> This movie does not require anything. Everything is necessary and sufficient. Gauri went to Mumbai, but he never said what he was doing there? subtle dialogues know what is happening to us. <br /> <br /> "Doghi" is responsible. It respects the subject of movement. Does he respect his viewers? <br /> <strong> <br /> </ strong> <strong> Direction is beautiful? silences carry the story forward, no words can be. We have studied the scenario well. <br /> <br /> Everyone who appreciates good movies is like a Doghi.
