It's really sad, Six degrees and Brothers & Brothers are really the truth television, it's a trash that is nothing but a recurring game. I think that over the last few years, dissatisfaction has grown fame. But networks with Jericho (I enjoy it) and more vocal support from other shows may begin to reverse this trend. I'm not like others and I will not support any new show if it's second season. Maybe I can decide to watch and catch DVDs and online reviews. Until ABC, you've lost me as a viewer for any new show.
