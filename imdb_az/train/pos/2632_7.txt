If you are 7 years old, claim your adolescent 6. After this half of Arslan's King, he looks at the wrong characters of Timone and Pumba, including the story of his original story and how he talked. In Disney's largest tradition, series are made, and sometimes the television series is made up of the biggest hits of small characters. You may be suspicious about it, but children and serial fans will not likely; they have enough jokes and songs and interesting things. It has a lot of funny gags for the attractive central characters, fast temps, jokes that cover the first movie, and old audiences. <br /> <br /> When Timone and Pumba decide to follow the first incidents, the animation is as good as always, less brighter than the original. The film often stops for the moods of the mid-film as a true audience. We see how Timon came from a nearby place, and he decides to go beyond what he sees to find his ideal home. Getting acquainted with Pumba on the road, he becomes another aggressor and friend. Soon, Simba, a natural predator of T and P, faces a lion shepherd, but they form a trio. When Simba understands, she must follow her fate and leave the group, decide to help others or not, and how. Of course the usual Disney elements and themes here are friendly, good against bad and so on. The site is simple, but works on a very high level, easier than your average animation. As CG films show, Disney's traditional form must be more intelligent, but they will not forget their popular roots. Toy Story has been clever since junctures and suits all ages since it's coming, and this causes the market to change. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong>
