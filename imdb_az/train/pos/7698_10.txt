But this is a great martial arts film. Liu Chia Liang takes the second place as no one is fighting choreographer, only Sammo Hung's best comparisons. During the war - it is immediately apparent from its proud technics exhibition - on the contrary, camera angles, and so on. The Directive is strictly driven to be intimidated by its sensitive ability, not just the excitement of the audience with speed and movement. This film also takes advantage of Liu's presence in front of the camera. Liu's performance on the banquet scene, kung fu, is one of the highlights in film history. Liu is backed by beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hung (from My Young Auntie's reputation) and Hsiao Hou. The acrobatics were breathtaking and wired in any quantity. As for the site, this movie is not only a revenge but also a characteristic and spiritual development along the way and a most appropriate decision. The humor in it is also the best. If you just watch a kung fu movie, that's a good choice - all of this.
