Here's my first David Mamet directing movie. Fitting, because it was his first. <br /> <br /> The story here is incomplete and, like any film, consists of minor shortcomings, the vast majority. It's not like the "Grifters", but with the film's level of functioning. (John Cusack was bland in this film, but it was the character of his character). Acting here is very straightforward (I sometimes thought of Crouse as a kind of attack against psychoanalysis). At least at the beginning. It's never really good, but only about ten minutes later, a hard line goes beyond reading a hard line. In the early film, some of Lindsay Crouse's lines - the way to read - sound like an internal monologue or story that they do not have. <br /> <br /> <strong> Things that Mantegna came from were taken. <br /> <br /> Here the dialogue is not as entertaining as it should be. I was waiting for the ring-and-ding-ding lines that shook the tongues, but they were not. All this is talked about and read much. Maybe Mamet developed and loosened after this movie, but if not, then others can direct their words. Together with them, they are very valuable and eventually lose their rhythmic, jazz quality. Strangely enough, the film does not look or feel like a game. The camera is kinematic. In my film "Glengarry Glen Ross", my problem was viewed as a very cinematic theater, but the actors in the movie were only executed, but they were comfortable and free. Everything has run out. <br /> <br /> If film lines sound like movie characters, or even play lines, I'm glad to sing, but here's a movie (or even a book). speaking game lines. It's just a strange manifestation of a theater and film that he's not working on. This does not mean that the film is bad - it's often funny. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < / STRONG> How he deals: he is a psychiatrist and one of his patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help her with gambling debts, so she enters the John House game room. I will admit that the device is incredibly incredible. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that in the United States, the United States, the US, deficiencies begin to begin. The most important thing is that I found the least student - the most entertaining. As in Crouse, we also take a lesson in art. <br /> <br /> We see the end, and then we did not see the second end, and then I did not see the real end, but maybe you did. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > There are so many good things here, since opening, incredible bits and strange lines read. If the first part of the movie appears stagy, stay with it. After half an hour of work, this will really get a momentum. If you like a fun movie, then come here. If you want Mamet, look again at "Glengarry Glen Ross" - James Foley did it better. <br /> <br />
