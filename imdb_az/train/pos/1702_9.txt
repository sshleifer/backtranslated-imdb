If you dream, you can give this movie a low degree. <br /> <br /> This film is not just for everyone to ask, but the movie for these guys is great! Old Science science fiction films and radio shows have long played, with the B-most of the table. Through Spaceballs and Airplane 2, you may need to extend your imagination to get jokes, but it's worth it.
