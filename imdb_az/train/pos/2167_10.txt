In 1984, I saw this movie, for the first time I started watching "The Spinal Tap" and in 5 minutes we were ready to sleep. So we went to see this movie. If any conspiracy theory is in your head, you may want to watch it. <br /> <br /> When watching this movie, you have to ask yourself: Do you think the government will do that? (In my opinion, they have no doubt) <br /> <br /> But I do not want to give much information because this is a spoiler and I need to see the movie for yourself. <br /> <br /> However, we are talking about this movie after 20 years to tell you, and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing in the world.
