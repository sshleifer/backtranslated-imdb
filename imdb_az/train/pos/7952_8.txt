This is one of my favorite family movies. I love being a little and still holding me in my old age. I still laugh at the same old jokes and even tear at once. I have never been able to talk to animals, or at least I did not shoot the UN cartoons, but I'm going to stand up for it. It's a pretty old movie, but it always takes a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> Another animal that I can think of right now is not like this. I can give a lot of praise to this film, but I do not think it's a show. I really keep the promise, "The place where the heart of the house is." Or at least the message I received from me. It is definitely recommended for a good family movie night.
