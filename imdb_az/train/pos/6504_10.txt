My husband and I have watched this series at least three times. I can not imagine how good it might be. This was not a "complete" date of World War II, no library could pass on such a date, but this is the best summary of history. <br /> <br /> Olivier's story is perfectly written and, of course, given in a superior way. Interviews are all over Russia, as producers are not allowed to speak to many Russians. It's worth it to have this full DVD on DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For example, there are films in the convoy and underwater battles, but the episode is still very good in this regard.
