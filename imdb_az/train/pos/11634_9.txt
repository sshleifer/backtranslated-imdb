I came back from a cutting-edge selection of Redeye and said that I did not have much fun in a movie for a long time. WES CRAVEN is the best. It brings a wonderful end to summer thrillers who are very craving us. This year's tension is ... Sure. <br /> <br /> All actors are beautiful and moving real and entertaining. F / X was large. He stopped persistently. In the most part of the film I was on my side. For a while, I heard an audience being embarrassed and excited in a theater. <br /> <br /> REDEYE is looking for excitement, action and looking for a good idea this spring. Go, look!
