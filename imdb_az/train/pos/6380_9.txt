Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I did not think that this movie would lead to my expectations. True, this movie was slow, but I liked it as it wore it on the movie. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a man named Milo. Milo believes in orthodox Atlantis. Alongside his dad's friends, he has a wonderful adventure. On the way, friendship, betrayal, trust and more should be loved. The sound is great. Certainly, they can only do movies with voice talent. Music is not special, but unpleasant. Animation is not good, but still good enough. In general, this is a good family movie for all ages. I appreciate the 9/10 movie.
