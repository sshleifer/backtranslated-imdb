After Emmy lost in the GYPSY's television version of Mama Rose, Bette won the next year for BETTE MIDS: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a live concert for HBO from Las Vegas. Midner, who has been performing live on the stage since 1970, is still one of the most vibrant live performers in his work. From the opening point, Bette, classic "Friends", dropped from the wings above a beautiful scattered cloud, commands the stage with style and charisma from the rap compilation number "I'm looking good". This way of working as a segment of its way through various musical choices leads to a joke like a few other performers. The section showing the Burlesque greetings lasts a bit longer, but it can combine old Sophie Tucker's jokes to make good use of it (although she forgets to joke in the middle to say it, hysterically until her name is remembered). Bette also looks at GYPSY's "Rose's Turn" and his movie "The ROSE" as well as a shameless fur for hit movie FIRST VIDEOS CLUB. She is coming home from ROSE with "Be With Me, Baby" and a hit letter number 1 called "Wind Up My Wings" from BEACHES. This music comedy is a must for fun entertaining and Midler supporters.
