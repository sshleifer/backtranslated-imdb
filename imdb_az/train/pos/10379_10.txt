Plato's escape is an entertaining movie with Gary Busey.it. This saw me driving a car and I thought it was a fun thing. Gary Busey plays a tough piece of money for the assassination of a powerful Cuban lord, and now he has to live long enough to prove that Plato is innocent with the help of his comrades, played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (expert). Plato did not like the movie about the runs, the film could not be prostrated before, but it was still fun to watch the game enjoyable, and the move was quite fun, especially in gymnastics Gary Busey is a good hero. Normally a bad guy plays and Steve Bauer is as good as Plato, even though Jeff Speaksman performs well, and he can not move well to finish Plato's run.
