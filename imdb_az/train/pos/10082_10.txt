The film is really magnificent, unique and invigorating. The story is universal, a war between good, evil and the world. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT is that its rating is wrong, it is cheating and travesty. Blockbuster evaluated as it was X movie. The truth is closer to G than PG and can be seen by children who can read clear and simple names.
