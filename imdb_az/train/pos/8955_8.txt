"Bell Book and Damascus" were recently displayed on the cable. We did not see it for a while, and we decided to look at this comedy again. Based on the hit of Broadway by James Van Druten for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early days, the film was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash. The film's director, Richard Quine, has turned his director into an exciting comedy. It appears that, according to some comments made by IMDb, the big issue seems to be a combination of two stars, in cooperation with Vertigo, was released the same year. Film viewers did not think about age difference when this movie was released. In fact, the majority of older men in that era were always associated with many young women. <br /> <br /> The film shot in Manhattan during Christmas was a comedy for spectators. Kim Novak was at the height of beauty because he praised her, no matter what the camera was playing. Like a witty man, Gillian is attractive. James Stewart, publisher Shep Henderson, will also be doing the best. <br /> <br /> Mr. Stewart is an excellent comedian who shows why he is here at a high level. <br /> <br /> A nice addition to any movie while supporting the role of Elsa Lanchester, played by Kuye. . Jack Lemmon's Nicky Holroyd, Gillian's brother is also good. Ernie Kovacs is seen as a writer, Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent way to spend the winter at home, watching Bell Book and Damascus.
