Der Todesking, the second album of Jörg Buttgereit, author of "Nekromantik", is a mighty work. The film shot around a chain letter from the group "Brotherhood of the 7th Brotherhood" shows seven episodes of one day each one weekly. these are the oldest. <br /> <br /> Do not touch Hollywood movies and music, enjoy happy or even "normal" movies, or wait for the movie to be good if the movie is directed to the scene. <br /> <br /> Nihilist is well aware of Der Todesking's avant-garde approach. Why Buttgereit's films were generally banned in Germany in their 80s and 90s in their native country. Der Todesking does not really pay attention to the characters appearing on the screen, but senseless apathy or depression is the life of most people. <br /> <br /> There is no reason to live in Buttgereit, De Todesking can be the king of death when choosing the cause of death and how and when to die. <br /> <br /> Buttgereit's movies are categorized and Der Todesking is no exception. Almost all of the same stuff and films, the "movie of the art" will always be the closest description. Der Todesking is an original way to capture, create a mood and manage a central object on almost every scene. During a scene, the camera is slowly floating in a 360 degree circle and a day in a small one-room apartment. For a while Buttgereit uses sound and movie corruption to describe a collapsing mental state of a human being, though his handicap is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> The third, seemingly enjoyable scene names, age, and entrepreneurial activities committed by real people are shown on the screen, which implies a ban on the film in Germany. <br /> <br /> Episode films (and in particular, only one scene is indefinitely related) is generally disrespectful and Der Todesking is no exception. Although all the episodes have the same point of death center, there are strong episodes in the outcome and results of these changes, but one episode or even two may seem like a filler, partly discharging the overall power of the film - yet, jaw-releases, rotting body a very powerful interactive film that helps to keep the film together and to turn the mightier moments into a lull. A global atmosphere is amazing, terrible, frustrating, and even disgusting - in the middle of the film I was present at the film. <br /> <br/> This is a movie that has left a lasting impression and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a special experience and looking for something that will definitely be remembered in the coming years. It is not recommended for fans who do not show the weakness or time of the heart, this is a small, different film that really enhances the audience's emotions. Whether it's confusion, admiration, or even a hate, the smaller the crew's success will be so cool in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The main theme of the film was released in the limited edition 666 "8" vinyl edition of the Die Fahrt ins Reich der Menschentrümmer part I-III, now you are looking for it long ago, and you still get the "The Nekromantik" soundtrack CD In the movie Lo-Fi synthesizer, the music makes it an important part of the film's atmosphere, as dark and quirky, almost illbient, and very, very rarely hear anything else.
