When I was shown in South Korea's Cameo Theater in 1969, now in the popular Crowbar Night Club, I saw this movie. It was the last year of wild 60s and this movie really hit home. Everything is there; generation gap, sexual revolution, pursuit of success, and conflict among those who follow the tradition of the family, until those who want to find their way to life. <br /> <br /> It was a fast paced, cheerful movie. Vegas was the hippiest summit, Sin City all this glory. Beautiful women, famous comets, laughs, confrontation, romance and even a happy ending. It's a great time for everyone. <br /> <br /> The poster from this movie is the wall of my bedroom. I'm looking at him and I'm back in time. my age, my father and my time, a great time in my life.
