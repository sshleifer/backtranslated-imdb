Bill and Ted's Wondering Trip is the perfect movie I've ever seen. Player and decor and so on. Although poor, who cares? The story line is brilliant and the jokes and words that come with them are the best, and the ideas are great. Everyone is coming to see this classic. The best part, of course, after the "melvin" death, I crack for 10 minutes and miss the next part of the movie. It was better, and then it was great. The most funniest movie of all time !!!!! One of the best part of the film is that Bill and Ted make a great shout and guitar solo, which was fun. Bring Bill 3, Ted and Eddie Van Halen on Rock!
