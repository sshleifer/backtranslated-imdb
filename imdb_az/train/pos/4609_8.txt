It's probably Jackie Chan's best movie in the 1980's and someone who put it on the map. The scale of this self-guided police drama is clear from the scenes of opening and closing, where a picnic village and a shopping center collapsed. There are differences between the original Chinese and dubbing English versions, and does not result in the fact that many jokes do not become the latter. And the latter is blocked by the stars calling something like China. <br /> <br /> Along with that, only part of Chan's staging in Canton is a trial. In Hong Kong, the trials are conducted in English, the style of battle and choreography of martial arts are quite as humorous as the non-Canton audience does not miss most of them. For all of this, a Chan whisper is not a dialogue, it's a motion and a painful thing. It's easy to follow the story: Chan plays an untouched Hong Kong detective who has followed a bunch of Cho Yeun and protects a star witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is superior to the end, and there is little time to breathe. I will never think, but what a fun and united movie. Perhaps this is one of the best martial arts films in the world.
