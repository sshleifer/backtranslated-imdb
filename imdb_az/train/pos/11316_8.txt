(Some spoilers) I did not read James M. Cain's novel ("The Postman Always Rings Twice"), so I can not compare this version of the movie, but the US version of 1946 (also called "Postman"). <br /> <br /> Because of the very clear references of the Fascist regime, I read that this boat from Italy is better. Yes, no matter what? The film is a wonderful piece of cinema where the neo-realist movement in the film industry is to be shot. Of course, why can you see it? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Gino, a living parliamentarian has a way out, but he must have been persistent, because Giovanna is an oppressor with an old man who has no money for a lover, his job (her husband's trattoria, behind the bar and in the kitchen) is her sex. In the past, he had limited choices and knew that the restaurant / gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa) decided to marry, knowing that he would not be happy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bregana, under the pretext of helping her to return to the village to buy the necessary part (actually kept in the pocket), tells Gino that Gino Bregana's grace ( damaged water pump) and remained alone with Giovanna. <br /> <br /> Gino feels that she is drowned in a relationship and needs to move again when Giovanni suggests her husband has been abducted. Gino, who does not want any part of this, abolishes the train journey to the city and is a benevolence paid by Spengolo, another companion and a friend of his own. Spinolo for Gino represents some kind of freedom and they become friends (Spinolo da Gino symbolizes morality and conscience), traveling in a carnival and finding a job. Finally, Gino is busy dealing with it. Breyana and her husband went on a carnival for a month and agreed to return home to Bregana Gino "come back" <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> After a while, Guy demanded her husband's salvation. After the bad behavior, Giovanna is more cold-blooded than ever before, with little conscience, and sin and shame eats in Gino to harm a person who does not hurt it. How much does he want to leave? <br /> <br /> <strong> Solidarity in the Caucasus is strong. </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lana Turner and John Garfield have ' It was very good and interesting. lawyers Ossessione tries to pay more attention to the psychological effects of the crime of the lovers only. <br /> <br /> A little word: If it's a difficult time, it will strengthen the latter result and give a powerful testimony. How much love is killing her husband before love has been declared by beloved lovers (as in the US version, there is no attempt for the first time); A very fast-growing relationship with Gino's dancer / hooker? often express his love, and he is ready to risk a great deal for a familiar man! ?? all is quite unreal, is not it? Did I find something that I was very worried about this time frame problem? I thought I should have left something somewhere. Otherwise, it is worth the watch. Both the player and the direction were good direct. Recommended.
