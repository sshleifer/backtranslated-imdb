CB4 was terrible, but Cundieff had a good idea. Like Spinal Tap, the movie is smart from start to finish. Everyone who saw him in the mid 90s is surprised. The performances are laughable, but not so much that they are cartoon characters, more like Marx brothers. These guys are real and quite different. Someone reacts to situations like that. When our performance hats go to the concert, or we shoot weapons and beat a record company, we can only pick you up. N (n *** as) W (H) H (hat) takes you seriously to drive yourself, then you curve. even if you do not get into the rap music, you'll still be loud. Comparing to CB4 George Lucas's Star Wars is like comparing Gil Gilards with 'Buck Rogers'
