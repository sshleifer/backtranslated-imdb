I liked this movie very much. Of course, this idea is more than one ... the federal government plans to install an implantable controller in a thief's jaw at a time to hide a more dangerous thief / computer hacker. However, the scientist Sanders, the "volunteer" of the feds, who is implanted with the device, is a very joyful man, and for a while he has fun with his head. Alvin is more self-esteemed, more passive, or more than a single-dimensional character, even if it shows that it is not easily manipulated. Definitely need an hour.
