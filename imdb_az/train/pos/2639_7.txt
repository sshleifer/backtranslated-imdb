Being an admirer of the first Lion King, I was definitely waiting for this movie, but I really knew it was not really the original. <br /> <br /> I know many Disney fans are afraid of direct-to-video because I also have a mixed feeling. <br /> <br /> When watching Arslan King 1Â½, it was a point of view on this movie. Will I be religious about the King of the Lion, will I spell certain scenes, or will I only consider this movie as another look at the story of The Lion King? <br /> <br /> Lider King has 1/2 sweet and funny moments. Timon and Pumbaa drew a show in the first film and was definitely worthy of a centralized film around. People just love these symbols! My favorite parts of the film include the installation of Timon & Pumbaa's interest in young Simba and surprises with some great Komsomas. <br /> <br /> Everyone at the top of Lion King came to Simba, just like most of the jokes you performed in the bathroom. Of all the jokes of jokes, I do not think many guys are bothered by the Disney's profit margin for the younger group (after the target audience). -o-video films. <br /> <br /> Along with this, I will tell you that when I contact the film directly from the original movie, I'm a little worried about it. I met the scenes just because of the painful thumbs and the original. <br /> <br /> As for musical music, it was not too bad, but do not expect any classics to come from this movie. At least LK2 was a nice ball, "Love will find a way." As for the audio work, good work has been done in this film. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella have always done a great job, even though Julie Kavner, also known as classic comedian actor Jerry Stiller and Marge Simpson, did a great job. By checking the Virtual Safari on the Disc 2, you can even use more of these great sound effects. This feature is definitely very fun! <br /> <br /> So all this, the Lion King is not a perfect movie, but a favorite and entertaining. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Rating: 7/10. Many of Lion King fans will appreciate this, and thank you for doing so - a fun, sincere look at Lion King's masterpiece. My Yahoo! Level: B (Good)
