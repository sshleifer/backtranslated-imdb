John Water ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best film I have ever seen. Baltimore (I live in Washington DC, Washington), gives Vorhol the colorful use, exaggerated movements and emotions to the audience. Pecker becomes larger than the city can handle and is separated by his lover (including sexy Ricci), a human-loving art manager. The picture was a refreshing taste in my mouth - a kind of fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and this taste was straightforward and straightforward, but it was deeper and more critical. This is a holiday that has the right to life, liberty and weapon, and that's because it's all else. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
