Eddie Izzard is a genius not a comedy and Eddie is in the best way. His outfit is extremely witty and cheerful, and his approval is one of the best on the stage. Instead of insulting the audience's intelligence, she relies on her wardrobe advantages, Hitler, the fall of the moon and English humor. With many memorable laughter, one can not help, but we can repeat some of its lines. More, "Do you have a flag?" one of the funniest lines delivered in a standup routine. Everyone in the top notch standup comedy should see the "Kill Clothes". Eddie Izzard struggled for success in the live scene. However, the lack of commercial success in the film should not show how talented it really is. "Killey Game" is a treasure, happily lets you find videos on your home and can be repeated again.
