Great sounds, lots of adventure and intelligent dialogue make this a very good movie. Adding three characteristic "character" to the leading animal, Chance, which gives the story more depth and meaning, especially with the old man, shadow and hell. Earlier versions of this film did not give any real person or motto that perfectly performs the animals. Sally Field loves everything, but the cats, who really are proud of this film, shine like Sassy. Great contrast between the cat and dog perspective, and just the right amount of soul and hot fuzzies to make the plot and the resolution perfect. There is even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery. Absolutely perfect for evening or kids. The hats are dispatched to Disney.
