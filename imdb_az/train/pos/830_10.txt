I did not expect much of the movie, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan plays a very different role. She slipped the slick Armenian suits for a funny look and paid for it by showing that she was a perfect actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear play beautifully and interact with friends for a long time. Humor is dark, Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis have great performances, mixed with an element touching the story of friendship and has a great movie. This is probably one of the best friendly friendships for a long time. Brosnan's career can be expected in the post-Bond era, which is definitely a movie.
