Small SPORTS warning! <br /> <br /> Good movie ... A good movie. I told myself myself, because I am not a big fan of vampires, and director Deran Serafyan's voice is often a bad news. Most of the films are below average films like Death Demolition and Armed Forces. It was one of the first films, and maybe he should continue to shoot horror movies instead of moving. This movie really admired me. A good success, no famous actor, or a great budget did not take part. The story that really keeps you focused. Especially the fans of the original Dracula myth will be delighted. Sarafian illuminates another aspect of the famous Bram Stoker story and is committed to the truth. It tells Roemenian about the life of the Count Dracula and his dead bodies in front of the castle and frightened the Turkish army. Of course, it is based on reality and "based on a true story." <br /> <br /> In this film (Vlad Teppish) migrates to the United States and is facing one ton woman. And they are all beautiful girls, I'll give it to him. In general, it provides the fans with good intentions, enough blood and more, to provide ridiculous fears and an interesting story by unknown faces. This movie is really unclear and has been hidden in a dark shelf on my local video. However, you need to clean the lid and put it on the VCR. Heck is better than the famous Nicole Kidman movie. These two films do not have anything in common, but I blamed this movie to draw attention to this beautiful little picture. Check it out ... my modest idea = 8.5 / 10
