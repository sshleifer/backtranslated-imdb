Better than a film made for a typical movie, HELL DUVITATA (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, pre-Murphy Brown Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye) and the legendary Faustian plot are highly conceptual. Urich enjoys it all the time, and Lucci takes on the role of the femme fatale, especially in the mother and in the devil. STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE's hybrid version, the movie, adheres to Miltonesc's vision and fears, probably will not have many complaints until naked, maudlin denoument. 7/10
