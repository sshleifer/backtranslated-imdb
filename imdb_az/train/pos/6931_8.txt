In 1955, after five years of release, James Stewart and Anthony Mann complemented six films, four of them being the West. Their interaction was clear from the beginning, and less than the Universal program was meant to be a cult and a classic. The buffs of the period do not consider Ray Teal or 'Anthony' Curtis, then the first ten names on loans, and then want to be Tony. Perhaps ten years later, the "psychological" western was well established, but in 1950, mixing with Axawi Qain and Abel rarely said nothing to solve a number of other issues along the way, and still had a conventional western surface and a complete credit to everyone to give To add to DVD collection.
