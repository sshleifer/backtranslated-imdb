Written by Truman Capote's famous novel by director Richard Brooks "Cold Blood" deals with the brutal and brutal killing of four families by a couple of unhappy criminals. The film is particularly superior to the characteristic investigation of the killers Perry Smith (Robert Blake). <br /> <br /> There are several well-known names in the cast, but they bring the story to life. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent as two offenders with different identities. Blake also plays with each other while getting too many opportunities to explore his characteristic idiosyncrasies. <br /> <br /> Richard Brooks also received an Oscar nomination for his writing and direction. In my opinion, both were perfect, although the script was wrong with some bad advice in recent stages. Oscar-nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall has also been edited. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones, who has provided the last Oscar nominations for the film, also draws attention to jazz. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other criminal films, this does not give compassion to violent acts. Brooks turns murderers into killing instead of condemning them firmly. Whether or not you agree with this idea, Hollywood offers an interesting alternative to a common approach. That is why I recommend for the film and the technical experience.
