It's a good movie for a person's dreams and drives, or a boost to push them out. It is a beautiful and inspiring film. Why should some people, especially those who are good, find and find the wrong with each movie? Dennis Quaid shows a good performance on this true story of a subject teacher and high school baseball coach Jim Morris who pushes the team to make a shot in a professional baseball career. Brian Cox is an old-fashioned old-fashioned Marine Officer, with a perfectly supported player, who has made his son's most of his accomplishments without his support. It was good to see her in a movie as nothing more than a man. If I have a complaint about this movie, do not let Royce Applegate sign again national anthem. <br /> <br /> Essentially, this film belongs to several major baseball movies, such as the Mills Field and Nature. It has two thumbs and a "good deed".
