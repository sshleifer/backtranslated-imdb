I saw that this movie was released and we have received much more than that. A strange actor (I always find one of the most interesting parties in the film). This role is played by dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset and Wallace Shawn is always something. The script is intelligent, small, and tongue-cheeked, almost enjoying everything in Beverley Hills. Paul Bartelin's "doctor" and Ray Sharkey's advisor liked it. It's rainy and dirty, but thank goodness! If you're a prude, I'm coming from this movie heartily. FREI is at Rock & Roll High School for everyone who likes to perform 6 degrees Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov and Paul Bartelin. Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were in "Comet's Night" together. They were in the third place "eat Raoul".
