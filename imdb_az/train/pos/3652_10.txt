On Sunday afternoon, I began watching a repeat of this television movie, thinking that only one silence plane was a catastrophe. I made a mistake. <br /> <br /> "Pandora's Clock" is a very clever political tension far beyond the quality of television films. <br /> <br /> The newspaper is very good, including veteran actor Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume and Robert Loggia. Daphne Zuniga becomes one of the best performers of the CIA, and Frasier's Jane Leeves is also very good. <br /> <br /> Dialogue is very well written and the story is awesome. In fact, the last hour is full of space and you will not be able to leave for a second. If you have the chance to see this movie, spend time - about four hours. You will be very rewarded!
