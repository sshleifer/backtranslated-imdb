It's a good day, it's one of the movies coming on Saturday afternoon. There are other retro squirrels like the Navigator's Flight. A cute movie with a little subtle comedy to lighten things. And for 20 years, stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson have changed. <br /> <br /> Personally, I really like these movies from time to time. There is nothing too deep or too intimidating. Just a nice story line. I have never read Mr. Phoenix loans in the near future. <br /> <br /> When he was preparing this movie, he was really a baby. Kelly Preston was a pretty young suede actress. He and Lea did a great job in this movie. I'm not an Oscar movie. But worth seeing. Especially if you have children, let's be between 8 and 11 years of age. Or those who are interested in the space program.
