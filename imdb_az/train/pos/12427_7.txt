This movie has a lot of potential. The scenario is sharp, the dialogue (usually excellent) is very good (although it may be losing noise), direction and cinematography are strikingly good, but some experiments only do not work. The main problem here is David Duchovny. A geek boy is always a geek boy; and it is a sad, simple fact that Fox will not be able to play anything other than Mulder. He stops, he tries to be calm, he creates, he wants to be a match. In the end, he works very hard. He overplays his character, overspeaks his lines, and he is carried out in any way by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, each of which has a class over its ability to function. Timothy Hutton (as always) was really good. It was a momentous moment or two that saw her dramatically dramatizing, but you can tell her that she is having fun with her. He looked at that part and turned into a physical and atmospheric character. Angelina Jolie was also really good. He did not have many roles; In fact, he could use something more powerful ... though his character did not grow well, though he was good. And the chemistry between Hutton and her was obvious (maybe Uma left her ...); In general, it was rough around the edges, but it was a solid effort and a great supportive role. If David Duchovny had broken his role, that would be better. 7/10.
