If you like scattering, this is your movie. It is impossible to predict what will happen in the future at any time. Nothing looks like it does, but it ends as you think. Heroes are all flawless and attractive. Cage is good. Dennis Hopper still shows the bad side. JT Walsh is perfect in its latest performance. Laura Boyle is yours. Dwight Yoakum takes a great film in a community. I'm classifying this movie as "I'm really a really bad day". It's not a slow moment in this movie. A real dream. This film is incomplete, though it is obvious.
