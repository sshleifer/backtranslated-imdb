Not really. This movie is very entertaining, though. I went and talked to the girl last night and had to use the idea that "there might be something in my eyes". The film is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey falls as a reporter of good luck who can change herself and her town. In fact, all the characters are large. <br /> <br /> To meet your spouse, the movie is not very funny or pleasing, not a good flick. <br /> <br /> All 8/10 all marked .... * I'm an easy grader. It's all over BigV!
