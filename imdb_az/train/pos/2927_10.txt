Eddie seems very unpleasant by Murphy (even Beverly Hills Cop and The Nutty Professor so it's really going to show you how good it is). To be honest, she laughed so much, including the Naked Gun and the rare Bargearse. This show is striking, although this is full of words beginning with the fourth letter (ie the enlarged version beginning with M), but it did not bother me. What I saw was the most fun thing I've ever seen, and maybe it's the most funniest.
