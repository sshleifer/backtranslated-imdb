I watched this movie when I was in the morning in the morning. This, in turn, showed that Salvation was an attractive film. I have done a great job with Boorman for managing this movie. The tribes of the hill and the dueling banjos were experienced in how early the scene was. It was so good and early in the region that the population was essentially preserved and displayed in a simple way. However, in spite of the end of the "duel", the guy playing the banjo smiled (banco's favorite), but when Drew tried to wipe out the guy after the duel, the child was very protective of answering. Sea trip never left you. The scene of aggression was brutal, but it was necessary to show what the group was doing against these revolutions of Georgia. It was well thought out after Beatty's traumatic shock. Some said that they were not too impressed. I do not agree - if you pay attention to the truth, Reynolds was left unanswered during all the actions immediately after he had left the arrow through the attacker and drove a teeth boy. Ed was later confused when he killed another guy on the cliff. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I read "10" after reading the message. The thought of this individual seemed to be based on personal interest, not an objective glance, and his vote was an inappropriate attempt to lower the rating.
