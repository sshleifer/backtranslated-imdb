I've been an admirer of this movie for many years and years. Due to the fact that Teri Hatchers had come to the forefront, I had to watch the film on the shelf. Why in 1991 did not people see how beautiful this film was to me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are not an incredible thing. Although I have never watched the daytime soap operas, this movie kills me every time I watch. The player is not the second to comedy, and the writing is very clever. If it were not for that, it would be advisable to watch it. Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... you will win a few titles ... outstanding performances.
