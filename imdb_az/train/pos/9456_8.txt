Unlike many other films that are bothered by their blatant dissatisfaction (Man Bites Dog) or their violent violence (most Peckinpah films), Rescue shocks are due to its suitability. Undoubtedly, the scene is inaccurate in his dissatisfaction, but the effect of the movie comes from its slow structure and the embodiment of the four potentials, beginning with everything else, and after all. The moment when babies pass through the bridge, the people who did not accept music before, and show their human consciousness against them, is one of the most dangerous in the modern film. The tension steadily grows during the canoeing journey and continues after the last loans - making the dreams of the latter symbols a horrible reality. The purpose of the film is to help the Ned Beatty and Jon Voight, especially as the victim and unwelcome hero. Burt Reynolds was not that good either. The cultural impact of the movie is demonstrated by the number of people who can refer to the 'Banjo area' - perhaps only Get Carter has found such an impressive job in the tourism industry of a region. Once I understand, I can only think of a few films that make me a serious episode of depression - the best I've been thinking of Se7en's pressurized atmosphere. While many are very good, Salvation is classic over all of this, because there is no point in comparison with it - it is unique.
