BLOB is a great fear film, not just for the horrific appearance of the irresistible, body-torn title character, but a real public message. It is, in many ways, a "good film of fear". The clever story is unfavorable thanks to harsh speeches from all shooting. The two romantic potentials, Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut, bring a stunning depth and insensitivity to the processes. <br /> <br /> These are misunderstood, but very good young people and it's easy to root them. <br /> <br /> This is a pro-public film and its young conspiracy problem is mainly a result of boredom, some defective character. Steve McQueen's drag racing opponent is almost an enemy in the process, but soon after seeing McQueen's seriousness, he joins a campaign to get rid of the invader from the invader. Thus, in the first place, a cartoonlike situation suddenly develops depth and human realism. <br /> <br /> Authority has miscalculated the first skepticism of children's allegations: the threat is accepted by all, and all clashes within the society are eliminated. When Aneta enters the school to buy Corsaut's firefighter for freezing Blob, the purpose of this combination is to officially confirm the adolescents. Any day, entering school, it was considered a typical vandalism act of an innocent criminal - a special action by the authorities of today. It is clear at this turning point that there is no dividing line between young and old. <br /> <br /> This is an unusual movie, which accepts the concept of a "generation gap", but because this is a more realistic and real crisis, people come together to naturally improve. <br /> <br /> The Blob is generally referred to as the Night of the Night (1968), the perfect tonic for depression. <br /> <br /> The film's cheap, but innovative and effective!) visual effects. They are surely clever. Blob's accomplishments are accompanied by miniature sets designed to return to the many tricks that we have seen. The camera is usually connected to a set of very solid "locked" positions (the lights turned out in the room and the lighting remained constant because it was lit). These scenes were often framed in a moment as the room was slowly rotating - the silicone board was slowly filtered and the action was sped up. On the one hand, this movement was similar to stopping photography, but using an artificial column is an articulated doll. Even today, the effects are surprising and surprising. <br /> <br /> An abuser should see a very good movie, BLOB, with a title.
