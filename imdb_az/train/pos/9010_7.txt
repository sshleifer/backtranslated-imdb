A little quirky and infinite bad taste; but it's smart enough to be worth watching. Young woman with a wheelchair, Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter), is a reluctant caregiver, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artisan who is on the agenda. He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it. She wants to revitalize her concerns by taking care of an independent, fatal Jane who suffers from a neurological illness, which leaves a regular and very few motor skills. The wheelchair and the soul full of spirit, the last wish to die is to lose their siblings. He introduces Richard, who will not directly help; but is ready to rob the bank to pay a gigolo to follow. I found this flick of ambitious and humorous. Even though this is a role, Carter has a certain character.
