Okay, this movie was cool. I do not think it's the best movie, but they were sure. My brother and I still make the scenes move, and sometimes the film is removed from the wardrobe, blows dust and opens it to the inside. She likes all the way to the end, but it's a great concept. This film should not only memorize each other's criticisms and only enjoy a movie. The trial is a victory for Robot Jox.
