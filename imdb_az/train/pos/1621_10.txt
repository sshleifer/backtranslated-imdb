Harman and Isings are a true work of the 'Old Mill Pond' animation art. High-level skill and craftsmanship that characterizes this dual job is relatively more evidence of this cartoon. It is a shame that many people are seen only from the black point of view and are always meant to be a light hearted piece of entertainment that does not want to accuse the black people in any way. If anything, this is a respect for the infectious humor and music of the black race. I did not see this confection for many years because the 'racial commissar' in the UK considered to be too insulting to be featured in racial English. If someone knows I can take a copy, I'm happy to see this witness again. I think those who have never seen messages and intentions in this animated film, at the age of six, should try to alleviate the world in a very different place, but this does not mean that everyone has the right to censor things that can be seen from the past.
