Perhaps the most polished and all the Indian movies - Pakeezah Bollywood movie traps (ie tackiness, farce, wholesale and failure imitation of western film subjects / genres). The Pakeezah Sub-Continent is proven locally and locally, almost like Madame Butterfly. Sometimes, according to today's standards, it is sensitive and convincing, but the symbols are well developed and direction. During the Pakeeza era, Urdu-speaking milieux were masters of madness, and how the dialogue conveyed the delicacy of age! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Author: Muslim Hindu, who may not be familiar with India's morality, or lose sight of the nuances on the audience, even though it operates (especially between "appearance" and "dynamic" characters). is a beautiful musical account expanded by the hero who shows the outstanding command of the classic Indian dance (kathak) with a charming scenario. Despite the most romantic tragedies, the hero will die, but the audience does not leave the audience without the experience of a truly memorable cinema. Peykeza is the peak of Indian cinema produced and not weakened.
