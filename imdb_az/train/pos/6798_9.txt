(No spoiler, just plot details) I do not understand this hate for this episode. Want to watch a bad episode of Smallville? Look underground - now there's a sack. Tom Welling gives a good performance (very often I say) and Michael Rosenbaum is very nice, but he is often. The scenario of the alternative universe is really real. Martian Manhunter, previously appearing in Static, tells Clark that the head of the shelter where he was caught is actually a fantasy from the phantom zone, and if it wants Clark to return, the universe must kill him. A great episode with a good moving and decent speed.
