I had seen the movie a couple of days ago on a video, and it was hard to get it once (it's about its length and story). First, I was surprised by the script and then the execution of this script. It takes you to shoot a movie, but it's not an easy, fun picnic; time and various political regimes and their influence on the lives of ordinary people. My favorite movie was the inner logic of the movie; Logic, which is logic in life, was sometimes illogical and confused, but in the end when I thought of it, all the events and the twists were logical. It does not make sense to try to talk about what story has spread for more than 50 years. I'm glad to see Nikita Mikhalkov's character Aleksei and his critics, and look at it with a similar refusal. I have not liked this kind of thing, then later, "Violent romance" (really loving Zhestokij romans) and "Insulted and Injured" ("Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "Siberia" shows that Andrew Konchalovski has forgotten films like "Tango and Cash" before leaving for Hollywood and a less memorable movie like Runaway train. I would prefer them to "Kurochka Ryaba" ...
