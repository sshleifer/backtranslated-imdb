The "Wrote on the Wind" was a great success picture of Universal. This can only be done by a person who sees the possibilities in the material provided by Douglas Circus. Compatible with a popular novel by Robert Wilder and George Zuckerman, there was a beautiful melodrama: nymphomania, a great source of oil, alcoholism, incest and soft touch of homosexuals. <br /> <br /> Dear Circus, tomorrow is the way to what is called "Dallas" and "Dynasty" in the opera genre. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film is a complete studio. Most of the decor is fake. Like many pictures in the 1950s, "The Wind Written" was completely taken to the studio. Only look at Manhattan, or Miami, or the images that should be included in the lake, and see how decorative is a painted floor. <br /> <br /> In recent times, we've taken part in a workplace where people are relying on each other to play a skilful job. especially in the dramatic moments of Rock Hudson's scenes playing Mitch Wayne. Patriarch Jasper Hadley and his daughter, Robert Mary Keith, who plays the evil Marylee, an oil painting, decorated with an old man's desk, is a work of art with a kind of branch office <br /> <br /> Douglas Circus is probably Dorothy Malone nymphomaniac Marylee, and overacts as Kyle to a certain extent Robert Stack wants to give the best performances that are meaningful on the way to his life as the cruel heir to life. Probably, it would be easy to explain what is in front of the screen. The only thing that seems normal is that Lauren Bacall is not a person who does not want his character to be seen by Lucy Moore as an incorrect crowd. <br /> <br /> Together with Hollywood, the "Windsurf" movies show the genius of a talented filmmaker who only gives the public the only thing they want: great stories larger than life can only be seen on the big screen
