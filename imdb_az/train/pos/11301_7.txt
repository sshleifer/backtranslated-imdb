Audiogroups today are watching a movie like Ossessione and they will not really think of how it has ever been seen. The film is actually divorced from Hollywood conventions and other major theater elements. This is based on the fact that the truth is reflected in a very terrible and sober light. These natural movies, neo-realist films II. It was designed to reflect the darkness felt in the postwar world. Ossessione, peak, conspiracy, murder, pregnancy, and so on. Including, it seems, solves some fairly provocative issues that have never been seen before the war. Film aesthetics, except for a crane shooting and certain muscular swelling moments, is very small and flawless: it uses space, natural lighting and, most likely, non-famous actors. All of these elements have helped to streamline the issues discussed in the film: Negative karmic shortcomings will be followed by intentional immoral actors <br /> <br /> Gino and Giovanna duo are polar interactions but they are both minded: we want to be bored and entertain . Gino is a drifter; The only traveler who covers life and is constantly fluctuating. Giovanna is a troubled home-wife who is familiar with marriage: she does not want to leave her home and her husband, but she is more secure because she wants to be her. Gino's lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle Giovanna craves; the only difference is that he is too afraid to live his life, so he is in love with Gin: it represents everything he wants but does not have the courage. Gino is a perfect ticket to this world. Most likely, the 40th part of the most likely audience is a bit of anxiety. So before the neo-realist age, films have never shown such scandalous behavior on the screen. At least it was a little discomfort. <br /> <br /> In connection with the topic, neo-realist style contributes to the negative reflection of adultery behavior. As we conclude, adulterous behavior (as shown in the film) leads to the suffering and eventually exhausted lives. When Gino and Giovanna make an agreement to "eradicate" Giovanna's mate with each other, it is recommended to follow them as a plague after the mixed action. They return to their homes: the atmosphere is dark and irritating (as expected from the neo-realist style). They are not happy; they are really more depressed. They thought that Giovanna's wife was more happy, thinking they were thinking, but they were dubbed. The film ends with Giovannan's death that is a karmic example of her husband's death. I think it is extremely agreeable to many reasons. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < I think of the negative consequences of bad actions. As Ossessione's submarine asks, is the adultery and the wound a bad one? I think the movie responds with excitement yes! The adulterous behaviors that arise between them reveal how unhappy they are. But, at the end of the film, they seemed to have recovered from their depression and seemed to be happening in the hands of the car, the author of the film shows that their happiness was actually a facade: the car killed Giovanna by entering the cliff and the river; the police arrested Gino. People sometimes try and justify their immoral conduct, but in the end, the karma will come to follow them. Agree. In my opinion, both of them were quite spiritual, because both of them were eager to rejoice and were not prepared to go through difficult times. This was especially evident after the first sign of the relationship between Gino and Giovanna: she could not look at the pressure in the shadow of Giovanna, she also left Giovanna and sits with another girl. In general, the film seemed very risky at the time. But the audience was prepared to look at this movie for the accusation brought by war. Before the war, happy movies were incredible. The filmmaker was eager to see and think complex films of complex nature: they wanted to see the characters associated with their "sin" because they reflected their lives. Ossessione is a great catalyst for the future of the film's future. That is, we can say that many of the nature-doing we see today are influenced by the neo-realist film movement.
