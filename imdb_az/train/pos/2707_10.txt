Cor blimey. It really surprised me that this movie was a comedy. Billy Zane is as strange as a central character and can play straight to make it both natural and easy for comedy. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is really good, and it is a joy to see fitted pieces. <br /> <br /> I advise you to watch this movie with a few friends, watch the drinks you choose, and watch and be surprised. <br /> <br /> This is the original B movie, from the outer space, from kitsch masterpieces like Plan 9. But the quality of people in the film is much higher. For example, Ron Pearlman. Zanja almost took a number of steps without a clear cause in ballet style. All is a little crazy and better for that.
