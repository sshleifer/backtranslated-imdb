At least Damon Runyon came up with an attempt to create mafia syndrome. "Children and Dolls", in 1955 by Joseph Mankiewicz ("All Eve"), Vivian Blaine Broadway show, Jean Simmons (whose character is characterized by Audrey Hepburn's "Roman Holiday" as a strange similarity) ) and Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both of whom have always been the best lead men in the world, and both have recently been the top supporting actors ("From Here To Eternity") and best actor ("On The Waterfront") and their game top. Those who say "Make Lucky One Lady Tonight" to one of Brando's songs are talking in places where early Dylan's voice is heard. Stubby Kaye stole the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson, dropping his house down. Sheldon Leonard on the ground adds another page to the screensaver of the screen pirates. The film has a bright, animated film look awaiting Pop Art in the early 1960s. These characters probably refer to a stylized pathoid based on the Jewish testimony. Although the movie's social relationships and gender roles are historically all these great entertainment, and even the salient words of the Salvation Army army are harmless and do not reflect real hostility toward organized religion. In the same film, Sinatra and Brandon have enough reason to watch this movie, but there are many other attractions to offer in 149 minutes.
