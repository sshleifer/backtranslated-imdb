I thought it was delicate, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> Some movies have reminded a part of Vidocq and Lost Children, mainly for coloring, as well as the quality of the characters' closeness. <br /> <br /> Put it in a prison cell, but it does not allow you to extinguish, and this movie is farther away from a multistage blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Always very interesting, perennial "Black Art" Very important and very good to characterize, just some of them are convincing! <br /> <br /> Some unhappy fear is worthy of this opinion.
