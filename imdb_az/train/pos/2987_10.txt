These prophets have never existed. As long as I wanted to love the beaches, it always seemed to be a "feel" for me (though it's one of my favorite albums, though it's a soundtrack). On the other hand, Stella moves slowly (and sometimes slowly) at a pace and is a little manipulative in a tearful tale about a selfless self-conscious mother, but Bette and the rest are transformed into great speeches. 10/10
