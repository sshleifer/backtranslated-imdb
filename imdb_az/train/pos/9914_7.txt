<br /> <br /> It was screened at the World Isle at the Isabel Bader Theater on September 9, 2006 during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). <br /> <br /> It was an interesting point, but it was going to be very long with many shots. <br /> <br /> Cinema industry workers have tried to win more (reused computers, keyboards, cables and so on, sold to China, then sorted and turned into new products for sale). <br /> <br /> People are negotiating to raise the human element, but often because of Chinese censorship it has blocked it. Still, it was interesting. Pointing to the scenes of others living in medieval conditions, entertaining and similar parts were particularly noteworthy, showing the luxury mansion and gardens of a high-level real estate agent in Shanghai. The opening viewer of the 480-meter factory was also a great deal. <br /> <br /> The scenes of the three Gorges Dam projects were also built around this theme for Jia Khang-je in the TIF (Still Life / Sanxia Haoren and documentary Dong). <br /> The film was directed by Jennifer Baichwal, producer Nick de Pencier, cinematographer Peter Mettler and Edward Burtynsky at the Q & A scene after the world premiere. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced to the audience and thanked the most important person who chose to go to China.
