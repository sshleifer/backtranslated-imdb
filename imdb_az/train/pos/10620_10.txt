After the first look, this fairy tale was found to be less annoying than other Cannon Movie Tales. Then I think better. Some songs are pretty bad, especially love songs, but the two things are worth the music, even the song. One is the direction of art. Like other Cannon Movie Tales, this beautifully decorated period piece; every piece of fabric and jewelry (both of which are the main part of this film) looks fresh and new and differs from the villagers' smooth clothes. Even during my darling song, I saw the princess's clothes and hair beautifully. The other thing is funny time. Most of the film is disgusting, but the Emperor's empty (and finally, self-admiring), suspicious guard, guard guard for Nicholas, and the stupid prince were quite funny and seemed to be very appropriate. . And the song "Weave-O" is a sequence of songs that are not good.
