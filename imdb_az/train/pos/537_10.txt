The issue of Life and the Death issue is just the best movie. <br /> <br /> Oozes the class from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The art of cinema is simply stunning, and the effect of monochrome and Technicolor's embodiment of different worlds unambiguously works. <br /> <br /> Although I watched the movie a few times, I watched him often - never touch. to me It smiles on me, makes me laugh, thinking of me, crying me. Today is as fresh as in 1946. <br /> <br /> If I had been given a life movie and could look again, a movie would be life.
