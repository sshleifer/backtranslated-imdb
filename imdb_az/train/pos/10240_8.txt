Sea: Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, circus. <br /> <br /> Key characters: Rex, Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa pterodactyl, Dweeb the Parasarolophus, Ooo the Triceratops, Louis Cecilia and Captain New name -yes ? <br /> What happens: Four dinosaurs (see above) are fed a little? Cuddly, friendly dinosaurs who will be "brains of cereals" and now children will be fine. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This is a cute animated movie. When the dinosaurs go cuddly and friendly, the animation is a little floppy and good, but in the same way they look nice. I like dinosaurs when they are happy and friendly, they are beautiful, friendly and good. I (almost) love all the characters, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but naturally, I love others. Generally, I love this movie! :-) Recommendation: People who love good kids cartoons, people who like dinosaurs, John Goodman, and people who think circuses are always invisible? Enjoy! :-)
