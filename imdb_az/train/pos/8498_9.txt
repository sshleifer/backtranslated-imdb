This is a beautiful film that makes a film that is important in life with its dynamic, intelligent story and culture differences, making it a very regrettable film. Do not obstruct the world's kinologists not to see this. Keaton has beautiful moments, and I'm not interested in the comedy's inappropriate interpretation, as actors like Keaton are jumping off the jungle and appear pretty easy. Great movie around all!
