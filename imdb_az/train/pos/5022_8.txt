Frailty - 8/10 - This non-sensational theme puts aside the headline "Bill Paxton Directs", snapping biblical horror thriller is pretty good old fashioned rip. Finally, only Kubrick's "The Shining" can be a South South Gothic cousin, but hey, it's a damn funny concept. It also has a doozy of a plot twist ... and a very sophisticated spiritual message. From now on, people will catch up on the basic cable late in the morning and watch a movie that is watching itself. Very bad director Bill Paxton had to go to the star ... oh good ... yet a good lease of satan.
