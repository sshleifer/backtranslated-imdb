After reading this movie, I read drama about a man who was a supernatural gift made by the society as a monster. Probably something different from my existence. But it was a happy surprise. My friend and I both thought that the film was very romantic (it was really bad that man's leadership was not helpful), and enough cunning, motion, and even humor (some of the third 3 films now called each other's name and story) The whole movietheater was laughing. In short: I was not expecting a really good surprise. I'll definitely get this movie on DVD.
