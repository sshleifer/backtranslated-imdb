American playwright Howard W. Campbell, Jr. (Played by Nick Nolte with impeccable wear), live in Germany with actress friend Helga Noth (Sheryl Lee) before the start of world football. At the very top of his life, Howard is prepared to be a Spy on behalf of the Allies by an American agent (John Goodman); Howard has everything to lose, but he finds the offer irresistible. After his wife and the end of the war, Campbell is camouflaged by the anonymity of a single life in New York City, which extends itself to neuroses. The main issue of the film's novel and source of Kurt Vonnegut's novel (really a question of many critics) is, "Campbell is a hero or a treasure?" Director Keith Gordon and screenwriter Robert B. Weide give us tips, but no answer and no idea what this uncertainty is. At the beginning of the film, Nolte Campbell is clever and convincing; Until the end, he is scary or indefinite, or scared and totally identifies his contribution to humanity for his role in the war. Gordon applies a certain glaze to the portraits of the Nazi bourgeoisie, which captures the dramatic side of Vonnegut. On the Flip side, Campbell is limited to only a New York apartment (which, in lovingly called "ceasefire"), to be discovered by only one speaker group, the humor produced is completely different from the author and is temporarily deferred to the dramatic tension. But the morale (even spiritual) paradox "Mother's night" gifts are not entrusted to a simple resolution and remain unequivocal? Campbell's black-and-white scenes, as well as the characteristic of Israel's Campbell's internal affairs, we do not offer an independent thinking; the war changes it, returns to America, changes it, and meets with the Nazis in New York and forces the facade of its "movement" to extend. spreading anti-semitic on a wall. Perhaps this is the best response we can hope for.
