Have you heard a story about the king's treacherous heroes hired to kill a dragon? Oh, that's it? In a whole world, there was a small world of small islands that were rarely seen on the clouds, and should the heroes have to make dangerous shots on their next trip to the island? Is the water flowing up and the remains of big cities left on the horizon? <br /> <br /> I'm furious with this movie and I'm really glad! This is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Many computer animation art, such as Pixar cinema, is a part of today's world. Animators have been thinking about everything on the screen and surprised by the detail of this detail (where the character is in the background behind the green background of green fungus is my favorite). Monsters are also fully implemented and beautiful to watch the movements. <br /> <br /> Although the land is entirely unique, there are enough attractions to make sure the film is watching. Our heroes are interesting and interesting to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon to provide the audience with almost impossible research and burn everything on their way. Of course, Hector is a favorite character. <br /> <br /> Hector is a brave lieutenant, and a small blue creature with the desire to speak a ridiculous and ingenious mixture, providing comedy assistance in a way that Jar Jar Binks can imagine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Experience incredible animation, breathtaking scenes, and anything different from what you see on a movie or television screen. It's an entertaining way to spend at least an hour and a half - no matter whether you're nine or twenty-ninth (actually I'm)!
