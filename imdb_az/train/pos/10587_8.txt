This film is not a chocolate, despite the Troma production and its crossing. A dark sign for adults. Operation is a matter of Sugar Bread and it is a miracle if the tower is not destroyed. A strikingly strange movie: eye shadow and contrast. Especially worth a look at the fans of Warhol and the chic decadence. According to all cruelty and mistakes, one morality can be glaring, even though it is twisted.
