This is a very short b / w film of the 2004 Oscar nomination in Spanish. The young woman enters the cafe, takes a coffee and keeps a few musical instruments silent. All the cartridges are motionless as models. A guy enters a song about only what is happening, but quite joyful and what happened at 7:35 in the morning. Very striking, there is a striking moment from the start. The people, the place, everything is quite ordinary. Like a Bolero music piece, the thing is up to a high level building. Its composition, theme, action and intelligence are 8 minutes long.
