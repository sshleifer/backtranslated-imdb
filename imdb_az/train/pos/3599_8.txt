This movie is a real gem. The back of the site is determined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clear, their motives are completely convincing. The dialogue is fresh and very real. The situation resembles the characters and does not touch everything and is not hackneyed. That's up to the walk. Then the film rails went a bit and as little as a hockey and incredible. But I do not want people to watch this movie. The first 3/4 of them are really remarkable. I gave this place 8. Here are some nice speeches. Watch this movie.
