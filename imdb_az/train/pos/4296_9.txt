It was my one-stop film for the year 1991, except for the brilliant JFK. This is a beautiful movie! I liked it. I love the stories of different characters that they live with and how they deal with their lives. Kevin Klin is good here, but is surprised by Danny Glover and especially Steve Martin. I never like Martin or his style, but here he is great. I liked all the words he gave to Klin closer to the Grand Canyon. The writing was excellent. Larry Kasdan is IMO, a great dialogue writer along the paths of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here are some three-dimensional characters and well-thought-out stories and messages that make us feel welcome. Really great movie. 4 out of 4 stars
