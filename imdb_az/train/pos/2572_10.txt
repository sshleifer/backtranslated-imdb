I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog movies and comedy films, so it's a couple of times better. K-9, k-911 and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is hilarious and adorable to make a great team. The only downside is that Doo does not understand how his wife died. Before this film died, but how? If they're told, I should not let him go. Other than that, I'll give you two fingers / tails! These dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) have to train a lot. They were very funny, and when Jerry Lee talked with Dooley, all the noises were laughable. when my favorite Jerry Lee sang and he was very happy to eat the privates of peoples to get lol information
