This is a type of movie for the daytime on a sunday Sunday when the rest of the world can go on its own when entering a large chair and a gentleman for a few hours. Cher and Nicolas Cage (as always) deliver remarkable performances in a consistent way. There is no danger to survive, the dangerous waters are the only warm and witty way of life in New York. In every sense, it's a family movie and a film worthy of praise.
