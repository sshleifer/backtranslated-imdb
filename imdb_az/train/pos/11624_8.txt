The Red Eye is a movie that he wants to see id for some time ... Cillian Murphy plays Jack Ripner (Jack Ripner), leads Assassins, and his plan is to kill a multi-profile man and his family. <br /> <br /> Everyday woman, "Lisa" (I think) is a normal woman, going to work, at home ... worries ... hate to fly. <br /> <br /> His grandmother's death sends a few times to a delayed flight. <br /> <br /> He is a flight that he meets with Jack ... is a usual-looking man until he accidentally exposes his profession and plans to him <br /> <br /> Keefe (sp?) death. <br /> <br /> He succeeds in rescuing them ... But his life is being expensed, Jack is shot ... Keefs are saved ... oh what story * laughs * is just joke, the movie really is really good, last year the best ... then there are small things that need to be emphasized before the movie that gives great importance to the larger movie. .. (Frankenstein's pen) I have thrown a few times before catching all the little jokes and quirks ... <br /> <br /> We need to look no further than the tension fans, but there's a little tip (in the bathroom) (jack) "Ohhh ... one of these flights will be" (second female assistant) "Hey, this is not a motel" ...
