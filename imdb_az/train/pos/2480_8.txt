First, I did not like it. Acting did not really fit the Hamlet standard. Branagh was really upset, mostly shouting. In my opinion, the famous actors who did not have big names generally did a great job; Billy Cristal and Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> <strong> (And I'm not sure whether Charlton Heston is playing, but hacking). <br /> <br /> A number of uncertainties of the game have been solved directly. He speaks in the grace of this game and thinks it is inaccessible. For most of today's people Shakespeare is difficult to understand; Many people are not forced to try even in serious literature and because of their archaic English recognition. If they see this movie, they will clearly understand the interpretation of at least one person in the game. Shakespeare's followers will see more when they see it: sword battles and wars, mighty rulers and nobles, murders and strangers, bad schemes and ghosts - and great art, if you take care to look for it, most of Shakespeare's days have not done much now. <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> though one should say something more. Some people complained that they were "in the 19th century and that Shakespeare had no time". Well, during their Shakespeare era, their suits and decorations are their days for all their games. Shakespeare can be either an ancient Roman or medieval Denmark or anywhere in the day, but he has not used his own symbols as his own or used his own time suits. For the same reason his works are full of anachronisms. For example, King John has balloons on the day of Robin Hood's English and French. In Julius Caesar, they talk about a chimney that will not be invented for another thousand years and talk about Henry IV still unborn Machiavelli. And I think that this confession is meaningless - you can complain that the game is not in Denmark (they do not have to live in Denmark).
