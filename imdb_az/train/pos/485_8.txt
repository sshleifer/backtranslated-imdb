"Luzin Defence" is a good film with beautiful center shows, but most of the novel and the art of a fairy artist are shining. In the majority of the film, it was felt that the heroes helped to stimulate the story. Marlene Gorris may have studied Luji's spirit instead of describing himself as an innocent victim who had been split into brutal intentions by others. <br /> <br /> Adapting literature for the screen is, of course, a challenging issue. A novel written in the early 20th century. This film does not go deep enough in the relationship between Luzin and Natalia. Natalia's mother is not a dramatic flash point in the film, but her mother's unhappiness. Notwithstanding the unwillingness of my unusual and sophisticated personality, I felt that Lucy suffered and finally tragically endured. But it was a moving and pleasant movie, but of course not a big deal.
