After seeing Charley Boorman on Long Way tour with Ewan McGregor, it was very interesting to see how Charley would be on his show. I thought Charley had come across as a pretty landed and deserted man. If you see celebrities struggling with weight and fitness, just show people! I can not know a lot about bikes, but this show made me feel right. Preparation and initiative for this event looks great. The incident itself is very dangerous and I am pleased to see Charley and everyone see how much and how much it takes. I love the show speed and fast mood music. I do not believe he broke his collar bone, I really hope he does not have it, I will not wait to see the next episode ...
