Sabrina loves The Teenage Witch and saw every episode. I remember when I sat at 6 am every night and waited for Nickelodeo to arrive, but when Sabrina left school, the show went down. The best series should be when you're friends with Valerie (I'm not sure which one is). The next series (friends with Dreams) was still good, but she did not seem to be right when leaving the high school. Although all the main characters are not the old "sparkle", Sabrina said that the first series she was in college was still relatively good and could be watched, but Sabrina's move with the permission of the spouse was not right. She is no longer a teenager, so the show name is incorrect, and the show does not look just right when the show is just married to Sabrina Harvey, without Hilda, Zelda and Josh. In the last five minutes of the episode, he said he was doing good to take it. All this I still love to watch the old episodes of Sabrina's Teenage Witch, but I think the writers are far removed and Sabrina has left secondary school. Because after that the show has lost some magic
