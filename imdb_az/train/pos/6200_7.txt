Henry Fool is a better movie. But it's a great way to watch a movie like Henry Fool. Henry is very serious about his "lies" and his mysterious aura. Henry Fool's shot is more clearly revealed with 'Fay Grim' when Simon puts his ear to Henry's hill over the hill. At least meta-jokes (very good jokes about movie writing and jokes) are good, but the film's opening was a little saturated. Hartley's use of Dutch angles throughout the film, yes, this intention, but I feel compelled to use it, it's not something uncomfortable to call me. This flawed film should be a sophistication for Hartley or Henry Fool's fans. <br /> <br /> Do not listen to watching the unkind look before you see the first movie. If you do not see Henry Fool, this movie's intrigue, satire and mind have completely lost. This is afterwards. It's just dumb.
