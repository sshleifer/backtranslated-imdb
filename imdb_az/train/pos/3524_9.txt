According to Chuck Davis and Emefy: I have seen PHANTOM LADY many years ago and still not a jazz buff. Until the end of June there is an exposition of Paris, which has not been missed as a special fun NINE penalty from jazz movies, including the new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLI, Le SIECLE DU JAZZ, jazz films, and famous drums by the Phantom Lady. I've seen Gene Krupa and Elisha Cook Jr - almost in all movie speeches and confirming the following: 1. Elisha Cook Jr was DUBBED in the movie. Some progress was that most of his other appearances killed (mostly Howard Hawks's ALL SLEEP). 2. He was probably called to the group at the PL. By the 1937 Hollywood HOTEL's SING, SING, SING series, I knew her style after graduating (and exploiting) her roommate, and eventually we got everything we could from the French "la caisse claire". 3. At least as shown in the Museum, the PL censorship is not subject to censorship. Harry Carasso, Paris, France
