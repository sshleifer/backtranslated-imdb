As a Bolton native, this movie has a clear appeal to me. Landing is interesting, and Bolton has a lot to do in the passage - there are some scenes of negligence, but it serves to show the city to be rebuilt and the old way to go is that the film is in the heart of the film. Lightweight James Mason takes a pleasant ensemble on a story about an anger over spirals, a full-blown generation of conflicts, and then a pleasantly resolved filter. Despite being a little young to remember, the minimality of Lancashire's life in the 1960s is here: on Friday, the songs around the piano, the market constitution, the good neighborhood, the danger of companionship, the importance of mass self-esteem, and Naughto's most funny lines. There is no doubt that this film should be presented on DVD - well-prepared and most performances are well-conducted.
