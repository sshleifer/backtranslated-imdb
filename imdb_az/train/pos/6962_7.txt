My Super Ex Girlfriend was a pleasant surprise to me, I was expecting a horrible movie that was really foolish and predictable and what do you know? That was it! But this movie has a very nice laugh and a fun area where everyone can take a blow. I do not know if it was a very cheerful movie, but Uma and Anna were very nice, and Steve was a very nice movie and it was actually a movie. > <br /> <br /> Jenny Johnson (Terrible is the true name of my best friend), the typical average librarian is not the woman looking at, Matt, the average man, when she asks her, is more than she expected, G-Girl is a super hero of the world at a certain time! But when she finds out she is a jealous and naked girl, and decides that she will have a good idea of ​​a while, Jenny will not see this because she's just another daughter of Hannah. <br /> <br /> Life is a hell of hell, maybe let's face it and choose a better girl. <br /> <br /> The effect was dark; This film is really made and I liked Umai in this movie, it was such a step from the beginning. <br /> <br /> My Super Ex Girlfriend is a fun movie about not really taking seriously, I'm not just a cute romantic comedy, I think laughing, everyone can. <br /> <br /> 7/10
