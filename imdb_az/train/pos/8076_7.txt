Family involves two families after each other's blood. <br /> <br /> Viren Shah (Amitabh Bachchan), underground freezing, operates from Bangkok. India has a family. Once mistakenly killed Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Shah, he also has one family (one brother, wife and parents). Sheikh's brother, Aryan (Aryaman), will take revenge on his brother's death. <br /> <br /> This film has a turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film is entirely his own, rather than his dialogues, his expression is more important. The minimal role of Akshay also coincided with Amitabh. <br /> <br /> I did not understand what Bhumika Chavala did in this movie. <br /> <br /> There were several empty points in the scenario; whom; Amitabh is still the city's most wanted criminals. His kidnapping was also unclear. The family of such a big person can not have any security cover.
