Gerard is a bit of an imaginative writer. It also appears to be Catholic, or so cynical, of homosexuality and Catholic sin and tendency to the clairvoyant. Flushing is a "seduced" by Christine at a visit. Christie's new lover is part of a rude business that's moving away from her, and she decides to stay around. As a result, there is a heterosexual compensation. Then Christ knows that all three previous husbands died from violent deaths. Kristin killed them, and he or she, Herman, will be "the fourth man"? Verhoevé's overheated, gentle melodrama, OTT is a delicious blend of Hitchcock and David Lynch, full of eroticism and religious images and is more of a red color. We can never be sure that it is a dream and a dream, and that we are seeing a true or realistic picture of Gerard's dream. Entertainment is performed in a clear way. Moreover, Christine's infinite Gerard or twist Herman means an infinitely more unpleasant character that we can hardly tune in to both men. In fact, it is fair to say that Gerard's income will not come too soon. Speeches from Super Jeroen Krabbe and Renee Soutendijk and the fantastic film "Starship Troopers", which is easily the best film of Verhoevé.
