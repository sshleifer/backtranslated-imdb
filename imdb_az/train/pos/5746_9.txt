Not enough words to convey the emotional power of this film; This is one of the most hated things you can ever do but only fulfills the hopes of the end to the most beloved, enthusiastic, and emotional. Every player in every role is wise and sincere, especially clever and simplified by Jamie Lee Curtis, a solid wound and furious Ray Liotta, and a heart from Tom Hulce, who must have him for every award in the book. (He is # 1 for Danny Peary's Best Actor in the 1988 Alternative Oscar). The last half-hour is limited to melodrama, but if the movie earns every tear and is not made of stone, most of them are.
