Gentleman Jim is not really a boxing film. It's a tool for Errol Flynn like Jim Corbett. But boxing scenes are a real eye-opener for the contemporary audience, he said. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays an Irish bank employee and fires a heavyweight title at the world championship. Flynn suave, but fits in the role of an unexpected Corbett. Her rival, John Sullivan, is still better, the old bleeding of Ward Bond. <br /> <br /> The subject of the film is a man pushing for a great chance. Corbett leaves his secular life and builds a new personality like Gentleman Jim. Jim is a chance to adapt to any social environment. He is lying and selfish. Heavy boxing champion Sullivan is described as a simple rude, but his honesty and sport give a certain contrast to the main character. <br /> <br /> Movement and excitement are aplenty and a nice end with all the necessary rewards. Errol Flynn gets the girl.
