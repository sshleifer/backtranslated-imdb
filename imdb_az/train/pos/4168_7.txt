Not only does this movie have one of the biggest films, but Ike Eissenman of the 1970s and Kim Richards are third team sports. I remember this movie when I encountered Linda Blair at the Stranger home at '78 'on Halloween week. I missed the first movie they chose to see another movie. Then, as I repeat, I saw the right choice. The film is not really bad, but there is really no fuss and surprise. Nevertheless, I love the scene where Richard Crenna does not benefit from the family dog.
