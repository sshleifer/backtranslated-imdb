This is a film full of love for centuries. The film is made up of Keaton, a woman looking for love during the Stone Age in ancient Rome and the present (1920s). In each case, he fights Wallace Beery for the usual wimpy Buster and his lady's love. Even though I admit that I could be the most obese since three times, I liked the best novel. I really liked the scenes with the lion I saw in a strange car race, just like a man in a suit, but I really liked Keato'n's beautiful acrobatics that I really liked. But all three periods were good old fashioned entertainments and are still an exceptional and enjoyable movie, although not the best in the film. Check him out!
