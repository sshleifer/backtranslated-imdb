Riget II is a good result, but not good at first. This series does not seem to be as seriously as the first one. <br /> <br /> We return to Denmark's Rigshospitalet, Danish national hospital. Ms. Drusse is about to leave the hospital as her job is done, but she wants something else. <br /> <br /> Spouse and relatives resemble one another. <br /> <br /> He is a wife. Everything is very entertaining, but the series is a bit more serious. The story kept many elements from the last series and added the new ones. Well written, but some of the new elements are somewhat foolish, but they keep more like a comedy. A good story, but as good as the first series, is original and exciting. <br /> <br /> Players are in addition to regular players. Everything is very good. It's a strange story and setting. Some parts of the global heroic show and symbols change throughout the show, so it is important to keep it seriously and actually save it. But these actors are perfectly in control of this situation. <br /> <br /> Most of the good features from the first series are kept. Cinematography is one of these features. Trier's world-famous handheld camera offers a series of stability and reality. Trier gives the camera the ability to move and follow characters, and Trier uses those capabilities. Well, action, great lightning, and good composition and arrangement provide this pleasant view. <br /> <br /> First, prepare to make a good impression later on. Also be prepared to see more. I did not think that something green was good. I thought it was unoriginal and incompatible. Never less, but the effect of ghosts is really good. Non-digital effects are very good. The younger brother is just like the truth, but you accept it. In general, the effects are good. <br /> <br /> Music is also pretty good. Moody and beautiful. Someone really touches. This is really nice. <br /> <br /> Firstly, there are quite a few music in the action scenes and work very well. <br /> <br /> All these are a good result. If you had seen Riget, you did not see a disappointment. There are a lot of the same features as the first row. But before I see it, I recommend that you take the first line. These two are a series you do not want to release.
