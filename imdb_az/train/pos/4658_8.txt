Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together with Karl Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart, talk about only two of the most beautiful players in a comic, exciting comedy "Hot Million". Ustinov is an ex-con composer who takes on the repertoire of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and holds a decisive job by Malden. Not smooth sailing; In the company he played at Newhart, he drew his opponent and his neighbor Maggie Smith (who knows another place under the name), becomes his secretary for a short time. He can not hold a job and he is seen throughout the film for various uses - all of which have been dismissed. When Newhart makes his progress, Ustinov makes a patch for the chair, but they decide that they are preparing for each other soon. Of course, Ustinov is not naked. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. You can not love Ustinov and Smith, Ustinov's deception, genius, ways to overcome difficulties. But there really is a twist to show those who have brains. Do not miss this movie set in London in the 60s. Only Maggie Smith is worth hearing, "I'm out of business."
