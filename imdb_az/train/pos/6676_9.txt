****** WARNING: THERE WILL NOT BE USED ************** <br /> So who are these "Mystery Men"? Simply put, the Secret Man, unlike each other, fires their true identity and the identity of the daughters, trying to live the lives of the youngsters. Külək (Bill Macy) gün ərzində tikinti işlərini davam etdirir və gecə saatlarında yoldaşını və uşaqlarını evdə tərk edir, küçə yoldaşını isə qeyri-adi və unikal Külək döyüş tərzi ilə mübarizə aparmaq üçün cinayət axtarır. Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) prepares silver at night and sells attic pots in the nightly whirlpools when her mother does not deal with the delay.

Everyone who wants to turn pigeon-hole films into a neat little category fights in a missing battle. It is a parody of the superhero genre - nicknamed ridiculous suits, Burton sets endlessly (and sometimes decorated with more coarse material) recycling sets, to the comic-book genre is pretty good. But at the same time, it's a serious superhero flick. And at the same time. Even though it is not necessarily a unique idea (for example, this movie is generally a novelty for the big screen, as a rule reflecting the short-term Inferior Five Works of D.C. Comic). In order to accept the heroic world in any way, it requires ceaselessness and then inevitable requests, and we all know that these guys would be real if superheroes are real. If you were flying around New York City with Big Guy S, you would see about half a dozen news on your shoulders on a regular basis. Of course, the winds are fighting very well and the Blue Raja is hitting all the parts of the super-hero world - with great precision. But does this make them a real super hero? Only in their thoughts. <br /> <br /> This movie is a comedy even though it's dark. Desiring to point to the ridiculous nature of the patent of the unusual, proven heroism. A liner flies like a comic genius on stage. Janeane Garofalo is a nice dialogue with the bowling ball. In addition, it's not a comedy like a laughing laughter or forever memorable jokes. <br /> <br /> What is really a good movie of Mystery Men, in the end, is a very good job. The weak / naked good guys are finally right, and become a really super hero for a brilliant moment; serves justice; and the movie ends with a scene that re-creates reality (as realistic as possible to make a perfect disguise of drowning balls and eyeglasses). If the film does not stop trying to tag the movie, the movie may be a big tear. <br /> Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani, like the conscience of Mr Furious, is compressed and destructive as he is interested in his love. Tom Waits, genuine inventor Dr. Heller looks confused with her line, although the opening scenes that retiree women receive in the nursing home are worth seeing alone. And the villians are never more than gun-toting petals (one moment is in the film). <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Kinematography is treacherous and unbreakable (even in the middle comic book, it is so exciting), sometimes music that exceeds the décor, but in general, this movie is incredible. <br /> <br /> 8/8/5/5 (Total Votes: 0) 8/8 I think.
