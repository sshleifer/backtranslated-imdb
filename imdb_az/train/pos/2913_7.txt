"This Man's Navy" is a less rare and well-drawn look than the Navy's (LTA) activity, as other comments have shown. LTA crew were proud of the fact that shady convoys never lost a submarine attack. And shooting at different NAS venues gives a valuable insight into a long-term aviation type. The first half of the film is affiliated with Beery, his relationship with the service palsy and Tom Drake's character and mother, and stabilizes Drake's leg. Only the second movie starts. The second film is mainly LTAs that are on the move, taking a sub-subtitle, children are killed and very damaging. The look is very strange and real, I think. Then we go to Southeast Asia. Is there an LTA on the sea? Do not worry, this part is really wild, with a blimp used to extract a bit of air from the forest. And Japs are shooting like mad. The shadows of the Vatican were so slow that they were running. This is a blimp we talk about. Finally, a WWII drama is associated with a very unusual part of the war.
