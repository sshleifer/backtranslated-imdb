It is difficult to find a bad history drama based on the lives of any number of British monarchs. Only if you are a good British or Australian actor, the works may look good and will provide a formula for Oscar's success. <br /> <br /> Young Victoria is no exception, just justifies everything, is surprised by cinematography, and with beautiful, soft lights and lush colors and fabrics. The film, which Emily Blunt eventually can play, begins on the 18th birthday of Victoria, and deals with the intrigue and its future rise on the throne and Prince Albert (Rupert Dude)'s famous marriage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <strong> Has a pretty typical territory, the development of Victoria's relationship with Albert is a bit more interesting. I acknowledge: I have received qualifications during the Victorian era in history, and I'm a bit attached to these figures. Despite many shortcomings like the ruler, Victoria and the people of Albert were one of the first leaders to improve civilization. After the death of Albert, he left his heritage in art, public health and education, Victoria's conservative views and mourning culture. Just because Victoria and Albert were not their lover, they did not respect each other, usually between the monarchs. organized marriages. Even though they were behind the scenes, they were, of course, one of the most famous. Blunt and Friend have the right kind of chemistry to make the right combination of double justice, limitation and desperation. Especially in such a film there is a different love that is not shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> But we will not see this love enough. While cinematographers try to fit into the work of political finesse, they do not gain the needed acceleration to keep the tension at high levels. Also, the couple is like one another, not superficial, sometimes mixed, without being included in a more prominent public work. This is not a big problem during the film, but the effects are quickly overwhelmed and you are trying to remember those who are watching you, though it is a pretty different Blunt that captures the famous monarch's expressions. <br /> <br /> Victorian achieves a lot of success, but it does not have a sparkle that goes from class to classics.
