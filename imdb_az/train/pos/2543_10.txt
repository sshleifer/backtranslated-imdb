Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi have shot many films, but generally (interesting) Karloff is generally the best of both. The only exception is that Carloff's "Black Cat" (1934), played by the evil head of a devil cult, and Lugosi's revenge on his life. But it's more commonly called "Black Friday", where Carloff Luke is trying to improve brain surgery while he is a deadly thief. "The Raven" Lugosi Karloff is a sadistic surgeon who finally blackmail Karloff to help his evil plans. Rarely, they are completely negative characters. <br /> <br /> Carloff Lugosini, who killed her boyfriend, kills Lugosini, but Lugosi is trying to blackmail him. <br /> <br /> This is a 1936 movie that is exceptionally exemplary, but sympathetic to each other. I did not say that some of the other films were rarely taken by the audience. This is a rare form of radium, a rare form of radius, from Carloff's physician Janos Rukh, a heavily-guided scientific genius charged by the "official scientific community", according to his theory, in the meteor that happened centuries ago in Nigeria. Sir Francis Stevens and his wife Lady Arabella Stevens (Walter Kingsford and Beulah Bondi) have received the support of a well-financed expedition and another scholar, Honorary Doctor Felix Benet (Luke), Spirit's younger wife Diane (Frances Drake) and Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton) is a friend and protégée of Stevens. <br /> <br /> Before them, Rox warns her mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) that she should not be and can lead to tragedy. <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> "He finds the substance, but its remarkable he is slowly burning and trying to touch people or animals, and he has built friendships and understanding with Benet, who describes the radioactive fight cocktail to use against the danger of Rukh, but there is something incredible here. The antidote can only last for a while and be renewed.Radioactivity affects the brain of the soul, and friendship with Diane Ronald is increasingly jealous (unfortunately, it was encouraged by Sir Francis and Lady Arabella) and that he was forced to claim the death Benet and a few others gather the power of the miracle that Radium X has given to human beings. <br /> <br /> The film is, of course, chosen with some science. Madame Curie has recently died of cancer she worked with Radium. In 1936, he understood the dangers of radioactivity, but some thoughts came out. The wave of murders by Rukh causes newspapers to talk about "curse" in the expedition. Of course, with the idea of ​​a "cursed" expedition, based on a hidden treasure hidden in a few hundred years ago by an English-funded British philosopher, we have been involved in archeology (the prophet Howard Carter and Lord Carnaevon), not physics or geology. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Benet tries to tackle the cause of the deaths and returns to a really demolished idea in England in 1888. During the Whitechapel Murders, Sir Charles Warren ordered many photographers to shoot a photo of their dead to see their retinas see Jack Ripper on the retinas. She just found photographs of the retinas of dead prostitutes. But thinking did not die. Jules Verne uses the novel "The Brothers Kip" in 1899, and here Dr. Benet uses. <br /> <br /> This is a story of a science fiction, but the Spirit finds a portrait on the plate, but Benet accidentally drifting and pulling the plate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < This movie has a tragic tragedy that is missing from other films. Other speeches, especially Mrs. Kemble Cooper, are also good. He was remembered in the David Copperfield as the most frightening sister of Basil Rathbone (Jane Murdstone). His last act here is the only way to end this tragedy, and we can say that he did not suffer more than his target.
