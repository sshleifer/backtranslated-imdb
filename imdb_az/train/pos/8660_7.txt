It is a racist film, but it is worth learning and taste. For the first time, natural tendency is to focus on Erbe & Dad. They have a comfortable, peaceful thing, and still have a home to graduate from high school, and retired and reunited by waiting for inspiration to do something. Secondly, you understand how your sister's groom's side is broken by her friends on the blues bar. He takes them, it's a thing of the past, and they are talking about air as critical moments. In the same scene, your brother's blues song is the least sensitive, and if you resemble that kind of music, it's really tearful. His performance feels like the peak of the story; a blues story backwoods with good kids, SC is their element of "colorful people". The entire white people of the film seem to be a lifeless, meaningless life not just for babies. It's as cool as you can get artistic.
