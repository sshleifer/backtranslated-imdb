There are many police dramas there. I'm sure why. It's probably about the good and bad old foundation. <br /> <br /> In this film, as we watched Anne's tough initiative, the police in the Baltic region have a documentary style. There is no attempt to scream the police. On the other hand, Anne has a soft heart that is a little bit deeper on the other hand than when she really is on the ground, sometimes in harsh and brutal circumstances. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. No one to relax you. There is not much unpleasant feeling in this. The police are involved in the lost battle. Tomorrow will be more and more people with more trouble, more crime, more family violence and more. Let's see this. <br /> <br /> The world we live in. <br /> <br /> On the day she goes by, she closely associates with the police and their families. The only real heat in the film is a 12-year-old image of a broken family, Benny. Mother has her own way to burn things. He overlooked Benli's carpet and tried to help him in the best possible way. I was surprised to go to Benny's father to deceive him. He wondered if his father or his own needs had been ignored. <br /> <br /> <BR> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;">
