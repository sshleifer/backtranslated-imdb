It was another beautiful film of the Berlin Festival. But, unlike Sally Potter's "Yes" that I saw a few days ago, I felt a strange feeling that I wanted to cover the entire world after filming, and I just wanted to be happy in life, and this time it was just the opposite. There was something dragging on me It was cold and suddenly difficult to breathe in the air. <br /> <br /> Nina has frustrated and locked her life, but then suddenly there is nothing left to it, a dazzling day, a bright glimmer that opens the horizon and believes in the fulfillment of her dreams. There was nobody on his side, but suddenly there was no one who could find his wife and share the secret feelings of his life. <br /> <br /> But the movie's name is "Ghosts", and the ghosts appear and they are not as they want, there was a vagabond girl who was invisible to any roots Tony The way to protect them? The Ghosts also represent strange ideas that people have hidden fantasies, minds, and hidden by all people. Francois, a French woman, is the victim of such ghosts. He once abducted his child in Berlin, but was stolen from a supermarket at an unprecedented moment. <br /> <br /> Nina can be a child because her toe and a heart-shaped birthmark are the same poem Nina agrees with this idea because she has only one friend not by the need but also for a mother too. But the end was empty, and Tony lost a man and her mother was a sick woman. "Marie's dead", Francoise's husband closed her, and the statement could not have been even more heartwarming. Nina is just a "ni√±a", a non-name girl, and there is no hope for a divine fulfillment. There is no Mari to accompany our friends in this world. So, finally, we look at Nina alone, a happy and indefinable future, to go along the path she opens.
