After watching the movie, Deer Hunter, a single masterpiece, Jacknife had a large footwear full of footwear. Deer Hunter, who has a devastating effect on a man after the Vietnam War, has the same issues. In this film, Robert De Niro, like The Deer Hunter, is here very well, Kathy Baker.but this film belongs to Ed Harris, a powerful, emotional and effective performer. The film is based on a scene game and I have one or two scenes that I felt only for one or two scenes as I watched a scene game. This was not a big deal, and the film did not really go down. This is an epic of the movie.it The Deer Hunter. They belong to a similar era, and there are similar themes, but they are two different films. Hunter Hunter was great, and I think this movie is great. For me, Jacknife is 10/10
