OLIVER TWIST was the argument and success of Dickens after his release in 1837. The shape of life in the ghetto of the city was shocking and new, and was a novelty that brought the central figures of the novel to criminals. /> <br /> One day a young woman who made friendship while traveling to London agreed. Salam said, but it was tougher with her. She did not understand that. A few days later they came together again and he asked for his face. "Yes, if you did, I did not like your novel," he said. "Indeed, everyone thinks it's high." She wondered, "What happened to her?" "Oh, Charles," he said, "I'm not Jewish, how can you make a fagin like that?" He did not expect it: "Well ... you know, last year's thief trainer Judy was a court of Solomon, a model for Fakin and a Jew." <br /> <br /> Dickens found that things had not been solved. "Yes," he replied, "he had received what he deserved, but Charles said," You are called a Jewish Solomon ", as you call Fahin" Jew "! Moreover, Solomon was not planning a murder. Dickens had to admit that he was carrying it. <br /> <br /> Oliver Twist was published in several editions. Dickens tried to develop Fagin a bit. Then he gave a thought. She reworked the chapter entitled "The Last Night of Fagin's Live", showing her the fear she faced. Further information has been added. <br /> <br /> He knows his wife decided to change Fagin. One day he met in a friend's house. She stared at her as if crazy. "Do you like changes?" He asked. "Charles, the changes - are still a" bad guy "called" Jew "!" He replied. "Yes, I kept them, but you did not see how scared you were in prison." The young woman realized this, but she was afraid of such fear. "Oh ... after that, I'm right about it ... Have you seen the small details I added?" He asked. "Which details?" He replied. "When you see Fagin for the first time, he prepares a meal for himself ... do you read it?" Dickens looked at his recognition. Instead, she seemed to be mixed. "I read that he was a fireplace, but the passage should be skimmed." Dikkand smiled and smiled: "He prepares a pork sausage for dinner." "Yes!" he said. "He eats pork, my dear ... I see - it's a good Jew!" His wife looked at him, shook his head and left his friends' house. <br /> <br /> Dickens has never totally shaken his figures, but the situation has led to partial attempts to correct the final novel. In the FRIEND (1865), he has a small character, Mr Riah, used by an unscrupulous landlord to hire poorer tenants. <br /> <br /> Mr Riah shows that Mr. Riah, the homeowner, is accused of being Jewish. <br /> <br /> But Mr. Riah is a good man. He is a very good person. He is very, very, very good, good person - it's good to be incredible. <br /> <br /> If Fagin saw Mr. Ryan on the move, he probably would have followed him with a stick. <br /> <br /> Fagin's antisemit description continues up to now. Dickens's genius was regarded as a novelist. However, there is still a problem for script writers and directors in presenting a story about the film: After the Holocaust, how can a decent novel treat a film without being exposed to a divine illustration? David Lean showed how Alec Guiness appeared on one or two scenes showing the human side, and eventually faced with true dignity in front of a group. Sir Carol Reed is re-written in the original music version of the novel's musical version. OLIVER became a hit West End music in the mid-1960s and was then taken to Broadway where he was hit again. Lionel Bart's "Food Glorious Food", "I Look at the Situation", "Think Yourself", "The Boy for Sale", "Who Will Buy", "It Needed Me" with a nice score, deserves this success. Reed starred as his nephew Oliver Reed, Ron Moody as Fage, Mark Lester as Oliver, Jack Wild as Dodger, Shane Wallis as Nancy, and Mr Bumble as Harry Secombe. Hollywood has never been a great music success for ten years - the best picture Oscar was the latest music to win the GIGI in 1958. OLIVER won it in 1968. <br /> <br /> And Fagin is an eternal cartoon problem? Good Fagin music is captured, attempted and executed for the committed murder. And even Lean Fagin showed that he was trying to control his confederation in his actions. Fagin is too old to be associated with this kind of excitement. He loses his treasures (though stolen items he knows and appreciates), he decides that he can reform. She is allowed to do this with her loyal acolyte, fertile Dodger. I do not think Dickens will evaluate the change (which may be female friend), but a modern audience, of course, deems it appropriate.
