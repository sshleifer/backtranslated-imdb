Still liked it. Warren Beatty is just as comic book hero. The film, which captures this movie, writes an incredible cast and a mediocre script. I really expected something more in terms of movement or structure, but there is so little. The main reason for watching this movie is watching some of Hollywood's biggest stars in an unusual movie. <br /> <br /> Madonna was a person who did a terrific job and even did not take part in the film. He did not belong to this movie, and his acting was pretty bad. At some points, the film still stands. You expect something more, and you have nothing. Al Pacino plays a really bad friend and is very good. She and Beatty are an excellent good boy and bad guy. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in another film from Isthar. I did not see it, but I heard bad things. Something about this movie is good, but it would be great. I liked it as a child because I thought it was cool and visuals the movie was incredible, the sets were incredible, the writing was fair, and it would have been a bit better with such a castle in the film. <br /> <br /> <strong> It was interesting, but could have ended up with a bit more bang for such a large-scale movie. The reason for watching this movie is the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The film uses 7 comic book colors. <br /> <br /> Suit and makeup were also impeccable. Facial makeup for villains was great. Beatty is not so big of just the character of life. It's still a good movie that can be so much more. This is better for me than Batman, the other comic book adaptation. Of course, the film was much bigger in general.
