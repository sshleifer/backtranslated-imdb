My Tutor Dude is a well-scripted romantic comedy movie that has something similar to my Sassy Girl .. it does not have kiss / sex scenes. Hollywood should learn more about Korean production. <br /> <br /> The film is a lightweight heartbeat, combined with seductive charming CG scenes. I like the part that Ji-Hoon kissed Su-Wan. When Ji-Hoon beat Su-Wan's first love, she threw Su-Wan to another girl and soon became father. <br /> <br /> How was the father at the next stage, which brings the audience laughter. <br /> <br /> Mao points: 8/10
