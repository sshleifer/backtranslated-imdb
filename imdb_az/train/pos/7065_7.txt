Your favorite movie about the three sisters from Switzerland who want to bring their parents together (the mother is still burning torches for her father), so they go to New York to stop marrying the father. A blonde gold digger called "Golden". Dad did not see his daughters ten years later, but they are incredibly clever and think that it is beautiful, but Precious wants to marry a rich man to see the mourning daughter Alice Brady. The young men think of a precious Mac, one of the richest men in Europe, thinking of deceiving two women who get gold. However, an incorrect personality claim is that the number of girls is a well-known Ray Milland, as it goes along with the scheme, "Because of Kai Kay's brother." Barbara Kai's reading looks sweet and cute like Kay, Ray Milland looks young and handsome (although, unfortunately, less), Alice Brady is pretty good as planning moments - but Deanna Durbin plays with her young sister Penny, who stole pretty much like a realistic charming and sweet show.Surely with beautiful vocals, he sings several songs throughout the film, although I would like to see them more like that, but the film is a bit silly, but I found it to be fun and entertaining.
