I'm a great Jane Austen fan and she's really good, except for being a feature-length movie (she wants to be a true fan and want to see a mini-series). Gwyneth Paltrow is actually a little clueless, but takes well-intentioned rich girl and Jeremy Northam is Mr. Knightly with her rank and nobility. I love Evan McGregor, but I love him as an actor, but he never protected the movie. I said that as Jane Austen was an admirer, it was not something to me, but it was something that had taken a long time for a long-term movie, and I really felt that the story really covered it. I saw every adaptation of this book and I felt it was the best!
