<br /> <br /> Legion Zorro, which fights Zorro, is somewhat different from other Zorro films. First, it consists of 12 chapters. And this time, Zorro Douglas is not a top studio star, like Fairbanks, Tyrone Power, or Antonio Banderas, instead of actor Reed Hadley as a worker. Although Hadley is as powerful as the other side of the process, he is doing enough to help him become the only hero in the world; Here's a story that took place in Mexico's center in 1824, as a living god, a native of India, and a new comes to a place where a man is attacked by a warrior to help him overrun a Mexican Republic. One thing, Zorro and a few followers think they will do their utmost to stand. <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, at least an incredibly cheesy moment per episode, sound effects to funny activity. <br /> <br /> It's a great thing that this array is stronger than most arrays and can never be understood or smiled. action - fans of Indiana Jones movies will see most of the money borrowed from this series.
