There is a common problem between the "Male Male" and "Saturday Night Live" sketches. Well, a five-minute successful sketch will usually not work well within ninety minutes. This film, like Tim Meadows, laughs like Leon Phelps, a man who missed the wrestling that had been abolished by Leon-Ferrell's Leon in the 1970s and Leon. So this movie is funny, but it's not Wayne's World!
