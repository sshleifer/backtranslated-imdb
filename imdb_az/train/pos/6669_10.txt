I saw this movie the day it last year. I thought I was cheerful. Yes, it's now in the video and I've seen it again. I love this movie! They sometimes dance, but this is the third time I've always loved the movie. Special effects are complete, but intelligent dialogue will shake you. I am a person who will tell you that I'm inspired by this film, so avoid dreams and other things. But enjoy it to all others! Acting is superior. Hank Azaria is the best (she's not funny or fruit), then Ben Stiller (uh, do not make me hurt, hurt me), and then get the best performance of William H. Macy (from the fargon) garafalo praised, but I think Kel Kelly is as pretty as the Invisible Boy. Two Challenges: The dullest part of the film is romanticism between Stiller and the parole hearing between Claire Forlani and Casanova. Some scenes do not move the story in any way, but they get an explosion. Kinka, and especially writers, are accelerating, even though the lovers go, but they are switching and you are more ready. After seeing it, I swear that you will get tired of the explosive heart (I think it's pretty cool). The camera is also pretty cool, acting with an angry pace. Also, Tom Waits delivers remarkable performance (he has a cool hero's heroism of this kind) and, as someone else is saying, the best parts of some of the characters when showing humanity. The Captain Amazing is pretty laughable (especially when I started talking about Casanova's perfect plan) and was very good at hurrying Casanova. A merchandise: no funniest comedian (eddie izzard) is almost spent, but his heart is in the right place. That's all, a beautiful movie. I'll give you twenty stars, and I hope everyone will see the glimm of a man with a $ 6 million in the best film of the film. As I thought about it, I would laugh now. 20/10
