I am a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. The majority of the US series is shown here (the original language with subtitles) and Batman was the first to show me much interest. Unfortunately, there was a "panic hysteria" among Batman's mothers, because Batman is very severe. Geez, look at today's kids to compare this series with innocence. So, I have the chance to see two or three episodes from my mothers who are more than 60 years old! I was so surprised that I could collect funny and bubblegum cards to pay off (still there!). I even got the View Slides slides ... I wanted to see the prison. All children need some kind of hero. <br /> <br /> Years later, I finally had the opportunity to see an adolescent teenager and I'm very glad. When I looked up as a child, the tongue-in-actor fled to me, but at the age of 17 I understood. Yes, I was watching them now, and sometimes there was a happy soul on the internet that I did not release in my episodes and DVDs because I was back in the cave for the night. It was full of excitement because I was happy to watch and jokes. Seeing that Adam and Burkin were a delight, and this television movie is a fantastic thing in every respect. <br /> <br /> I congratulate people who make this great nostalgic "holiday" ... I will follow it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: SE SEE! Rent it! Accuse a friend! Get it! I never expected to rate it like 9/10 ... It did a great job!
