This show has several clich√©s and a few super-like moments, such as Dawson's Creek (talking about the way out of a 16-year-old life), but generally it looks like a decent show. The majority of cartoons seem very realistic and the story was good at the pilot - eventually it ended with a good lesson. I hope every episode will not change as a lifestyle, and it would be a drama for this tool. Jeremy Sumpter believes that she works perfectly well as a teenager with a passion for baseball, and many of us, always fearing for the group that she wants to be part of her, may sometimes be related to tunnel vision.
