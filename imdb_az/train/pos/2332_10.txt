"Imagine that you can bring life through a single touch". When I first heard it, my focus was on Trailer and after the first episode I found myself on this show. The fairy tale of a modern day that brings my Spirit and draws me throughout the show. I think Acting and Casting is just perfect, each character brings something unique to the show that enhances its excellence. Even once Villains manages to overflow a Unique sense, from Bee Man to Guy, who can catch Kittys, they do not let me down. Generally speaking, Deaths that often lead to severe moments will often result in Purely Comical (like a Exploding Scratch & Sniff book). <br /> <br /> Even our great sins show that we have one day, Daisies is a mystery, not a mystery, but a fairy tale with a hint of love story, Comedy and Drama ..... err show a bit of cooked, just the few remaining ones. <br /> <br /> I was shocked at the ABC for years and had no reason to apply to the ABC for years, but this made me smile every night. Daisies Pushing returned ABC for me. But after two seasons, a show, like a few prizes, a Great Fan Base and Positive Answers from the Critics, was demonstrated. Ned again touched ABC and killed me forever. I'll always be an admirer of this show, and I advise those who love the love of many who are talking more about the show and watching it.
