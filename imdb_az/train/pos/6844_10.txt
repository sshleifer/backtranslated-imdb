"Kill Outfit" Brian DePalma's best film is an absolute excitement of today's unbeaten stagnation, humor and style. DePalma has a bum rap in Hollywood because most people claim that Alfred has gone away from Hitchcock. It is not. Hitchcock can only imagine what DePalma is doing in the tension. Unfortunately, the original uncut version of the "Outfit Apparel" is no longer available on the video. The current version released by Goodtimes has confirmed Jack Valenti R's rating. However, there is still a copy of the original part of DePalman. Angie Dickinson, coated by Warner Home Video, is presented in a green cardboard box or black clamshell case with a silver lined theater poster. If you can find one copy, they will also receive it. <br /> <br /> <strong> There is a person living in the Caucasus. Dickinson, Dr. for obsessive fantasies. Kate Miller, a sexually explicit spouse, has been treated by Robert Elliott (Michael Caine). <br /> <br /> Miller is taken by a stranger when walking to the museum (DePalma is a real tour-de-power in terms of camera work and durability). Since the story of advertising and boxing has given you a story, you can guess what happened to it. But there are some difficulties. A prostitute (Nancy Allen) is the only witness to the murder. Kate Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) is a young genius to solve the killings. Dr. Elliott's answering machine has a certain message about it ... a missing razor blade ... <br /> <br /> What I described above will not break the film for you half an hour and DePalma's biggest surprises are for the last hour reserved. This film is, however, enough for Valenti (MPAA Head) to request a film break. Those who want me surprises. The opening shower scene and one or two violent scenes and some Nancy Allen dialogs (Valenti "cock" has changed "exaggerated") several cuts. This is a very bloody and bloody film, but objections are sexually explicit. I would like to hear how Valenti's "Lost and Delirious" song, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who saw two women, was harming a younger thought than attacking chains. <br /> <br /> "Dressed in a slaughter" is good, not just the first level of technical loans, but the speeches are very good. During this time, Michael Caine, who is in a lot of crap, gives one of his best performances as a doctor. Angie Dickinson is usually better, maybe he really plays a great role here. Nancy Allen has become one of the lowest and most frustrated actresses in the world. Keith Gordon is as beautiful as a genius and I love all of his inventions. DePalma is one of the best filmmakers ever to be recognized that deserves it. The last joke of the AFI 100 Best Thriller list is that very few people really knew what a tension it was. If they were to open their eyes once they saw DePalma's excitement and, in fact, the best artist. It is better than "Psycho". <br /> 4 stars ****
