In America, ease of creation was either released in a different network or at least had the full episode speed. Unfortunately, this was not the case. This is a small number of remote and remote, given that American audiences (in appearance) do not include unbelievable diatribes, or are attracted to a crook when it comes to the humor that involves scatological functions (both sound and odors). One of the main problems was that it was brilliant for a rare audience who was able to anticipate, but was not watched by an audience without a hint and the boardroom. Which is sad, but unexpected. Although I have been prepared for direct DVD broadcasting, I have seen at least three more seasons in this show. Mutual relationships between substances and living creatures were sub-contexts, and there were other conversations just waiting to be under the surface. But just because of Political Change, such conversations are only in my mind.
