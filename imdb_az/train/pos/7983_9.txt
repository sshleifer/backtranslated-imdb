It's hard to overcome this movie in several ways. Everything works well here; casting, actress, scripts and cinematography are the first. For competition, it is a passionate, severe story of love and human value. There is a very sharp technique and technical merit for the film critic. There are some tactical mistakes, and as discussed in the boards, the CIA agent's education is seriously formulated, and ends with no end to realism. However, I do not think that the CIA agent's pragmatic approach is to do, but Creasy is more motivated by his heart's reverence for his heart without considering its consequences. Like Jesus himself, the Creator is transformed into human beings, whether in the pragmatic sense or not. In any case, I condemned Creasy with the usual bourgeois morality, and praised the truth that led bad guys to one another in a methodological study of justice that resulted in a return to both themselves and the innocent. <br /> <br /> In any case, it's worth watching this movie, though you're attracted to this genre. A perfect soundtrack, great writing, impeccable casting and solid performance on board make this a top-100 (or better) movie.
