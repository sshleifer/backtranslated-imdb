I have to say that this is the first romantic comedy I've ever seen. there was deepness and despite the fact that you talked about it from the beginning, there was longing and anticipation. maybe the thoughts that will not come together ... this is an indie movie. this movie was well-written, managed and acted. The dance next to the road scene was spectacular.
