Rated for Strong Language, Severe Content, and Some Fraud. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A Fear of black fear is one of the funniest, most original comedies I've ever seen. Basically a gangsta rap version of the movie This Spinal Many people are shamelessly shocked by this film of a movie. If you can not find this movie anywhere, do not hesitate to get it even if you do not like rap music. I give a perfect 10/10. Only movies I can think of right now, Secretaries, Garp'a world, chase 40-year-old Virgin and Amy. This movie is a hilarious stereotype of the gangsta film. Film is a film about Nina Blackburn, a documentary film about NWH (in hat). They are basically a stereotype of a rap group, a band of the band, Black Hat, has a legendary comedy movie and I strongly advise you not to be a fan of the rap scene. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;">
