"Dance, Fools, Dance" is an early Crawford-Gable tool since 1931. Crawford plays a wealthy young Bonnie Jordan, who is a party of his own, who slipped and slept in his clothes to swim to jump over the yacht. This is when her father dies and penniless his brother (William Blakewell). Bonnie works on a newspaper using the name Mary Smith; his brother works for grocery stores. Chief Man Jake Luva - Plays another crook described by Clark Gable. Then, of course, it would turn into a romantic hero, but in the early 30's, the MGM used him as a bad man. <br /> <br /> Gable and Crawford have created a great team. His face expressions are a bit on the wild side, but along with his dance, the film is one of the fun things to do. See Jingy Cricket's Cliff Edwards as Bert. <br /> <br /> It is always interesting to see pre-movie movies and Dance, Fools, Dance is no exception.
