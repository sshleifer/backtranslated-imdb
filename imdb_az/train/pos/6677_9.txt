Film about Wannabee, nothing happened and little heroes opposed everything. Previously we heard this. <br /> <br /> If some poems are Winds, Blue Raja and Mr. Furious, you know that this is not a story rich in artistic guarantees. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Film stereotypes. Why can not rage be super-power?
