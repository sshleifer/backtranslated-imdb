Do not you see a man in white suit, Danny Kaye or Jerry Lewis, who works in Alec Guinness at Sydney Stratton? <br /> <br /> The Alecin is the best of Guinness's films and one of the shortest time in the UK, Ealing Studios. It is so perfect in the times of the new Labor Government and the society in which they are building. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness thinks that this little little snot of a man can invent a dress that never needs to be cleaned, in fact, any kind of foreign matter when it touches it. <br /> <br /> He is a continuous cuss and he succeeds. Of course, there is no such thing as the kind of clothing in the society that is affected. Finally, everyone misses him as a smuggler, almost like Peter Lorre, M or Orson Welles in The Stranger, or even Oliver Twist as Robert Newton. <br /> <br /> As you can see in some serious movies, such a sad situation is a sign of a great comedy movie that can play for laughs. The weak Guinness costume is not only rude and white, but shines like a neon sign. <br /> <br /> Another outstanding surprise, apart from Guinness, is another surprise, like sneakers like Joan Greenwood and Ernest Thesiger, the largest clothing manufacturer in the UK <br /> Come to think about it, Paramount, Ealing 's suit and gave John Travolta for Saturday Night Fever?
