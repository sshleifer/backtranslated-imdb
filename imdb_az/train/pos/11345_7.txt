<br /> <br /> For some of the movies, this is a very nice movie. . Mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, a dragon claimed to be a new thing to me with conjunctivitis, and a magic-speaking flute (at one point 'well-known' Billie Halliday). <br /> <br /> The flute is an "exciting" witch's convention, and the witches are restored with gay old times. <br /> <br /> Children are dragged to nude, and then like a "fairy" to get rid of the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
