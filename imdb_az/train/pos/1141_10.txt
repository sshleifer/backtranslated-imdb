Everyone who does not smile through this film has been spectacular. I was watching it at least twenty times and looking at my tears despite many scenes. Sally Field is absolutely perfect. Celest Talbert tries to take his place with hope that his supporting club will raise his star. Fields up to 45 are still beautiful and have a nice pixie quality and are a perfect figure that denies having three children. <br /> <br /> The tower of Soapdish is full of stars that perform their roles perfectly. Kevin Kline, Robert Downey Jr. such as a master Elizabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher, is a great casting director who plays an actor in a small part like a barless waiter like Carrie Fisher. <br /> <br /> Kathy Najimi is as exciting as a costume designer, and the best of all - Cathy Moriarty is as excited as Nurse Nan, who takes her to the land to get the characters out of the show. <br /> <br /> This movie supports and supports writers, actors and actresses, including the best comedy, the best leading lady in a comedy, the best lead man in a comedy and many other bests she has won the Oscars. You can watch your DVDs over the next twenty-five years. You still laugh when your drive is released.
