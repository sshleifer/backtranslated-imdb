I believe that this film is diverse and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. In Thailand, they come together and show different societies that are very interesting ... Different societies managed by Portuguese, Japanese and King. The courts surrounding the court usually struggle for power with some betrayal. The closet is beautiful. The film is also made in local production in Thailand. Those who perform as performers are very interested. This is fun and I think that schools can be used for its historical accuracy, because it shows that Europe is very different from traditional Hollywood, which is the subject of Europe's local kings.
