Raising Victor Vargas is a must-see movie. She felt a lot of heart, and it was so frustrated that she had many humor. Teenagers have a lot to do, such as real life. Victor, a tough teen, but in the end deals with love with all the right places that deal with girls and family with a good heart. Finally, after talking to an old fashioned grandmother, Victor learns the true meaning of the truth, and a girl who wants to use really uses it. I'll see people watching this movie as you watch a real family. She knows how much this movie feels. Victor's grandmother made a heartfelt feeling when he put something on a simple surface. Victor really was a heart and did not believe he would do something like that. It was really sad for me as it really was for me. Generally I give this movie as B +
