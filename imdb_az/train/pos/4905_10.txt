"An album of old songs thinks everyone is new." This movie has a challenging combination of speed and mood that sets separate movies apart from opening moments. Why not? Dame Judith Dench, a widow who plays alongside a widow playing a saxophone to help her survive the Olympic Dukakis, like a cheerful widow living in the Scottish castle alimony on many streets, to Ian Holm, a drummer who loves all the members of a World War II girl (more or less) swing band. But wait, there's more. In the end, add the album and the most distinctive Clique Laine on strange vocals to Leslie Caron and to be the hottest band in England since Blonde Bombshells Beatles. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) tries to unite the blonde's Bombshells to play the grandson of the film in school dance. Imagine how difficult and courageous it is to have a group of sex women stand in front of an action called "open wound" before the Britney Spears family. <br /> <br /> If the actresses are up to 30 years of age, most bandwidths make the best hits and have more than one month's music, more than a month's flight, real talents, real music and <br /> <br /> I love this movie and I know that I will watch it more and more every time I like it.
