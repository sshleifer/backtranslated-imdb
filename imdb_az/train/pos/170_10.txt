Do not listen to those who criticize your lover against each other, this is a gem! Young rich Joan and his brother are surprised after their father's death - now we must work for a job! He naturally gets the reporter, and he is, of course, a driver for nature! With their co-incidences, their career greets the head thanks to the gangster Clark Gable. By the way, there is a chance to swim for a few beautiful young men in the moonlight and have a few dance dance numbers (with all the grace of a steam bowl) for Joan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Joan reflects most of his emotional sequence that looks great and promotes his long career (thank God, dance stopped!). Gable is remarkable as a bayonet gangster - if it were not a star yet, it should have been a hero. It's great to see him playing something different. And William Bakewell is as poor as a mixed brother. And some great montages and tracking shots are Harry Beaumont, who has a fast moving action to crack with - with an eye on the audience at one time! Great fun!
