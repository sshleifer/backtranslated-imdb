Japanese cyber-punk films really did not do anything for me, but most of what I have seen should at least be fun and at least fun. PERSON MACHINE is no exception. <br /> <br /> The story is a kind of parasite that takes the human body, controls the organs, makes them "necroborgs" and fights them together. each other's cooking is the sole purpose - to use "parasites" as "gaming". The film is mostly surrounded by a shy guy and gal, but the parasites are interrupted and the losers who are exposed to violence are cut off. <br /> <br /> KEYFALL MACHINE will definitely be compared to TETSUO (as with most cyber-punk movies) and for a good reason. Although the films are absolutely different, some thematic parallels are definitely true. The MEATBALL MACHINE has fun, splatter moments, and vitality / borg FX is definitely a high point - TETSUO-meets-GWAR is both a prepara- tion and a blend of ingenuity. Depending on your taste for these types of films, MEATBALL MACHINE can or may not be yours. If your hyperkinetic cyber-punk movies have a healthy splash dose - this is for you ... 7/10
