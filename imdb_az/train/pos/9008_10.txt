I have seen this movie without knowing it ... I am an admirer of Branag, I shoot more Shakespeare, and at first I just saw it ... and I ended up tearfully because it was great, great silence, values, influence and brave philosophy about Helen's daughter's life . Television is recommended to those who are bored with programming (at least in Spain).
