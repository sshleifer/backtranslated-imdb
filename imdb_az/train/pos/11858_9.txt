This movie is just great. If you have a chance you have to run it to see it. <br /> <br /> Although it has nothing to do with the original movie since 1932, Pacino is doing a great job for people like Tony Montana. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you think that Pulp Fiction is good with the words of the oath (if you see it), then there is another point to see how Scarface can tell them. (pretty sweet) Although the movie moves a lot, the area moves too fast over time, does not keep track of aspect ratio in real time, yet it's easy to watch, but should be always peeled to lose something. <br /> <br /> It's really so great when you see that this movie looks like a breeze of three hours. <br /> This film is one of the best films that moves and directs. you've forgotten that this movie was done in the mid-1980s, but this is really the root of a bad guy ... "Tell good night to the good guy"
