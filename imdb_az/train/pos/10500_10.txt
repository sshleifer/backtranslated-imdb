Although the Super Mario 64 is not the rest of the series, it is still classic and is as good as the old games. This is very replay valuable and less expensive games. Plus, this game is very different. There are 15 levels with several different tasks and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very difficult, but the lack of problem never goes away from the game. After you beat it, you need to delete your game and start it again. And for the second time, or for the third time, or for two hundred times. Any Nintendo 64 owner should have a reason to be a Nintendo 64 owner.
