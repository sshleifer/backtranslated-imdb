I saw this movie when I wrote in summer for Israel. My Hebrew is not good, so the subtitles were very helpful, I did not miss any part of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has dropped me off !!!!!! Today, one of the most prominent taboos in the Middle East is a homosexual relationship between Israel and Palestine. Allows one person to access both areas of conflict at a time. Dilemma caused emotions. An act of tragedy rises when taking one of the angry and angry lovers to an extremist party! must see!
