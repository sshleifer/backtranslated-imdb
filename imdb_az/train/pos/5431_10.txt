I have seen this movie many times, and every time I can watch it, but I can not help but enjoy it. Gunga Din is one of the Classic Yearly Hollywood movies in Hollywood. When the players themselves were forced to shoot a movie on the basis of fantastic special effects, the human being had a scene. The charisma and companionship of the screen by Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr are very entertaining and entertaining to watch. The language and cheek attitudes of three actors play their role honestly and flawlessly. Some may think that this is "rooted", but I think this is a "classic" filming and doing the best. It should be remembered that this film was taken up by Europe in a war in Germany and that the audience went to the film to escape the horrors of war and carry them to a place where people are bigger and heroic. Goodness will always win evil. Gunga Din performs it perfectly by adhering to the actors during their acrobatic escape. In short, a classic film that does not take it very seriously and does not want the audience.
