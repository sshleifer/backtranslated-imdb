Best movie from the best horror films of the 70s. It's realistic parameters and atmospheres. As usual, usual negative comments were inevitable. At a certain point, I noticed that most of the scary movies were not enough at times. Of course, the most frightening films are outdated and denigratory, where music critics are like a mental mechanism that moves the mind of their potential. <br /> <br /> Before you read this review, you already knew what the final decision was. It's really good, because it's a good gift in 10 films. Raines reads very well and remembers many of Kubrick's films in a movie produced. He really made the impression. Perfect movie. I think it's a film anthology for years.
