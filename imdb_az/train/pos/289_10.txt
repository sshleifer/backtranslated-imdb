I love all of the movies by Michael Landon Jr. And Michael Landon Jr's "Dale Midkiff" could not have been as good as Clark Davis. <br /> <br /> Dale Midkiff has a way out of this character. <br /> <br /> This movie kept me from scratch until the end. <br /> <br /> Missy & Willies' trip to Clarks with baby's daughter's death was just God's time. <br /> <br /> According to one of the films, several films have been shot in this movie. <br /> <br /> Therefore, you can see this movie and easily understand it. <br /> <br /> <strong> More movies will be filmed in the future.
