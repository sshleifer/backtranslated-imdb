Perhaps more than most films, this is not for everyone. For some people, the idea of ​​slowing, reflecting, and allowing events to happen in their time is a good description of their personal hell. <br /> <br /> In some cases, there is such an approach that they speak about some of their deepest parts. <br /> <br /> I think it's a function of the place I'm in my life these days. I count myself in the camp of the last group. The meditative tempo of this movie was almost hypnotic, and immediately I was directed to a mythology of a place. <br /> <br /> Certainly, it is necessary to become one of many countries so far. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dear Mrs. Farnsworth, Alvin is True, Now, when he is sitting on that tractor seat, I know he has come to an agreement with his own death, and I want him to spend time together with me before I leave. Hopefully, it was not just a "move", but a small light of satisfaction and truth that many people brought to humanity to share such terrible honesty. <br /> <br /> Taking into account the realities of production, I'm not sure if the economy gave the full credit to Mr. Lynch for his courage to allow the story to slowly develop. I understand that there are a number of areas of modern life that are beyond the scope of film production, though it is a very clear description of "time money". The depth of our hearts is not an adventure, and for Mr. Lynch's credit, he understood that he had not just talked to a story - inviting his viewers to spend time with their deaths. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the power of the film to get acquainted with some of the precious parts of your own, you may be worse than spending a few hours with Straight Story. . When you are just listening to the reflection of the night, give yourself a little extra time.
