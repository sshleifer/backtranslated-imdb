I am proud to say that I have an unbroken copy of the 70th Crown International genre of comedy cheese on this DVD. It's a really goofy and pretty unonsequential flick with vibe with a beautiful breezy'n'easy 70. An attempt to come to an honest point in the excitement of true love and friendship is again a tire and a quick queue. Of course, it's basically a pic of a young man's fantasy - a teenage goofus character Bobby Hamilton gets girls, a chance to respect his friends and show a bully at a local van - but that's a very dopey and hatred of goodwill. Stuart Getz, a sweetheart as a strange hero, is a glamorous lead, the main purpose of Getz's love is a cutie like Deborah White, Connie Lisa Marie is also pretty sweet as a unique blonde babe, and Beefcake Neanderthal Stephan Oliver (60th biker film perennial) terribly hated like Dugan Hicks. Especially Pre-stardom Danny DeVito, the boss of Getz's fun carwash owner Andy, is wearing very ugly high Hawaiian shirts and is definitely doing a dull ne'er-do-well slob with lovers of gambling habit. Especially, I like the scene where two boys Danny beat - one on the other, working on Danny's mouth, behind the back of his back! And Sammy Johns' insidiously charming fluke hit theme will be returning around the skull for at least a week's song. In short, this charming retro-70 entertainment!
