I'm going to be like Gackt and Hyde's appearances, and I did not expect it to be filmed in an artistic-like movie that's just enough of a plot to make her interesting and diverse. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I'm going to follow the next movie like this. In particular, I love it as a vampire movie, but it's not a freakish vampire, it's not a flick. All the characters had human characteristics. The growth of these characters shows that it was incredibly enjoyable, and that really made them feel upset over the course of life. I gave up to two fingers until this movie. The absolute best movie I've seen in the past five years.
