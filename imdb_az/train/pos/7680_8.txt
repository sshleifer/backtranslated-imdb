Holly is a film-driven film, but it's neither manipulative nor sensitive. In his heart, Patrick (Ron Livingston), who is not going to be very lucky, is a character-driven film that will gradually become a conscience and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), which will not be very successful. strong will, but ultimately a very young Vietnamese girl who adapts. Everything was open and well done, from live places and photographs to effective editing. The modern classic score can be somewhat disruptive, but it is a top-breaking composition and emphasizes a remarkable limitation on the whole. It raises a lot of issues, but with a few accurate answers, this film is able to raise awareness and affection to many people who share Holly and her condition. Kudos made those who could succeed.
