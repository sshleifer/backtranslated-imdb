I really was looking forward to this movie after it was presented as a feature film for people who love movies about nature. The film shows the different climates and related animals, starting in the North Pole and heading south toward the film. The footage taken from this movie is often breathtaking and beautiful, and I wondered how often I could get a portion of the shooting on the earth under water or in the sky. But, well, I'm a big part of what I've seen in David Attenborough's "Planet Earth" television series. I found the story of Attenburton's Planet Place better than the story of the Earth. 'Place' is a movie that's easier. He skips most of the scientific details in Attenboron's "Planet Earth" series. For example, the Earth says that a tropical sea is the ideal kindergarten for a young whale, because it has little predators. Planet Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery because the water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough food to support large animals, such as large sharks. For me, this is a significant difference. Together with the great voice of Attanboro, the planet makes the Earth a better documentary. However, I think the Earth is worthy of looking at beautiful images and it is easier to understand that it is interesting for children.
