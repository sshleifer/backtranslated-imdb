It was one of my favorite films. Recently, I enjoyed watching DVDs. This is free to watch older VHS versions. </ Strong> <br /> <br /> I have not seen it for so many years and watched it to see how amazing it is today. stops up the film. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore was nominated for the Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore was awarded the Oscars. It was against Arthur, but John Gielgood won the best supporting actor. Moore's performance at Arthur is proof that no comedian can win the title if he does not win the Best Actor Oscar (Gene Wilder in Young Frankenstein, another example). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon's artists have a nice look on the character of each movie and a warm heart tone. Very simple, IMHO film is a rare stone. <br /> <br /> With regard to the DVD available from October 1, 2007, it turned out that Steve Gordon died a year after the release of the Artur series. Although the video quality is a breakthrough on older VHS copies, there is still no widescreen version available. <br /> <br /> DVD has a few good extras, but not enough. An example illustrates how a clearer option should be made for a recent editing, delivering a clear message from the Director and wishing he could include scenes (as hysterical). <br /> <br /> The DVD, which is the perfect format for inserting this material, should certainly offer it. <br /> <br /> This is the original "Arthur", a classic comedy for books.
