<br /> <br /> This is the second part of The Animatrix in the animated short film collection that gives a little more detail about the 'The Matrix' world. they do not work and live together. This is a small history lesson in the 'Matrix' world. The first part ('Osiris's Last Flight') is not as good as it is still entertaining.
