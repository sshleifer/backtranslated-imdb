This movie was very, very, very, very funny. All actors are quite realistic and very strange. <br /> <br /> The film was generally different from the "appearance", but also imagined and bleached, adding everything to the space, dark, weird vibe. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, that is, what you call "basic", but I liked it. It's different from what I've seen before. . . with an unexpected, strange rhythm and stroke lines in strange places. Children suffer such a heart failure (and pimply) that can not help, but I feel for them. In other words, they are far from the "hollywooded" version of teenagers. <br /> <br /> All this is a good thing for me.
