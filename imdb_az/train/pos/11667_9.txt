Kells' secret is a movie I've been waiting for a few years after seeing some early images in the Caricature Hall in Kilkenny. Now I'm here to tell you. Cartoons are hardly stylized, but worry about me until I'm afraid. All movies are a thing of beauty and great imagination, especially for the animated lanterns that live on the page of small figures. Better to describe, I love Brendan Gleeson as Abbot, who likes the voice and liked the voice of Sprite Aisling, especially. Forest is a triumph, it's a beautiful place. The story is well understood, it is a mixture of truth and fantasy. Really, Brendan takes the audience to praise him to look for the perfect material for the book. The theme is close to my heart, so I am not calligraphy and lighting, but all those who see this and who are not lovers of artists admit that this is a beautiful little movie. When the DVDs are released, I will definitely buy and I would like to say that a good cartoon hall and all the people involved in this mammoth project. May be more. :) As I come here I say I can get some copies of DVDs and everyone loves them! Wish them all the success of the Oscars in the world, such a joy to see this nomination.
