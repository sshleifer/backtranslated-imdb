I always wanted David Duchovney to go to film business and finally he did it and he was proud of me. This movie lived up to my expectations. Duchovney, played a very good game, managed to stay consistent with something new instead of playing Agent Molder. That is why I give credit to his role because I have not seen anyone else playing this feature. David was very good, but nothing compared to psychotic Timothy Hutton. It's a brilliant performance you're not tired of during the movie because it will never surprise you. He has weaknesses and powerfulness and considers the story more convincing. I was very pleased with the stunning, good thing to the story, and I still had many memorable quotes that I have always used. This film was also a spectacular one. I will not offer blood for anyone who loves drama.
