This movie is great. <br /> <br /> Now I love my films for stories and dialogues, but now and then something like Moonwalker comes true, and despite all the flaws, it's fine. /> <br /> This movie is not very entertaining Michael Jackson advertising. Starting with patient images, the 'Man in the Mirror' assembly assembles his accomplishments and completes his bits and career, passing all the height of his life, and then transforming into a really entertaining segment. After watching his adventures running Miki's manic stop-motion fans, he had a funny music video for 'Bad' and 'Speed ​​Demon' and finally danced against a bird's suit. The stopping movement is not as bad as some believe. <br /> <br /> Therefore, "Leave me alone" and see a great video to make the main feature. <br /> Yes, the assassination laughs. He laughed too much. We see Michael coming out of the building, then he is being shot by thousands of soldiers. Then we flashback the hit showing MJ and stumbling over three underground lair. "Mr. Big" (Joe Pesci) is a nepharious villain who has a plan to buy every child in the world at an early age 'drug' (no feature marked). MJ and the little girl who was with her were fired, then fled ... or something else. The area is a really important part. <br /> <br /> We get two cool sequences that turn into a MJ, then a robot-spaceship and, of course, an incredible 'Smooth Ceza' sequence. <br /> <br /> This is a very pure movie, fantastic for anyone who loves MJ. More than any of his hits, some cool little bits, and some pretty good special effects (especially the Robot / Spaceship sequence), especially with an ebay money. The kids will keep quiet for a few hours, as well as a maximum of 20 children, the first time they are released.
