Warning! <br /> <strong> In the field, there is a movie that comes to me. Especially liked by Lexa Doig's player. Sometimes I got the impression that he was Camille. But do not worry about what happens with Bob, Cassie and the baby. Once Bob was first established, I believe that he finally loves him and regretted what happened to his brother and he has to lie to him. Otherwise, it is a bit strange that she will take her baby and love her. It's up to the viewer's decision - I do not like these endings. Dean Cain was as good as usual, Eric Roberts .. well, I saw better, but even worse. <br /> I believe that the film is more about analyzing human relationships and responding to unexpected situations. a criminal story. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line, I liked it very much.
