Stunning. Completely stunning. This father is a movie about two children who suddenly have a vision. An angel claims that he is visiting him and says he should kill the demons. Then they get assignments, and they begin to circulate the jaws to the naked eye, ordinary people. They kill their predecessors with the so-called devils and flutter them in the flower garden. Their fathers claim that they can see their sins when touched. <br /> <br /> What I love about this film is to capture the vulnerability of human perception. Are their ancestors completely crazy? Or is it true? The audience will decide. Decide for yourself and watch the movie. Now.
