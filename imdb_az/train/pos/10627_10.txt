So what is a real independent movie? One day and at the age when the main founder of Hollywood has a solid and advanced look, the public perceives the film as an independent film, is not usually a smart marketing effort. <br /> For whatever reason, we must be glad to have such films as "Hate of Happiness". In front of the board of directors, this film puts its own template (indie horror movie) without any contradiction. Love or hate is not afraid of what happens to "Hate" and when watching this movie, Kallio (director) just got to tell you that the film did not do it to distribute fake blood, so there are stories to talk about. Those who are good. You can find this movie in the horror movie section of your video store, but do not be fooled by this story, love, good people, and oh so far away from the tunnel. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie, if you are expecting thirst or Evil Dead thirst. <br /> <br /> Check out this movie if you have the realistic points of horror / threat genres. <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell has produced this movie and I'm sure he is proud of telling everyone that there is no Evil Dead. <br /> <br /> Although my advice was, Bruce was not always trying to put a bank on the "ashes" image, and it is clear that he is a Dead-ites, who eats something pretending to be hated by Mr Campbell, to check and see if Mr. Callio and Mr. Campbell are trying to show you. <br /> <br /> Nothing about this movie is good to see compassionate performances in an oscar caliber (perhaps deliberately), a scary movie. Often, actors in such films would not even try it with Hate, and all actors seemed to take too much of their beloved ones and did not start typical horror movies. <br /> <br> Technically, "hate" is now sufficient as a movie. <br /> <br /> In some cases, the hate budget is improved, and the "hate" continues to run faster. <br /> <br /> In general, despite the appearance of many millions of dollars in hate, I personally do not see a problem with that. This is really a movie that cares about the medium. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it was repeated several days ago.
