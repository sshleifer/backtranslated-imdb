2 WORDS: Oscar awards. Nuff said. Everything was in this movie. Comedy made me laugh, Drama is one of the biggest dance scenes to cry and Breakin 2 opponent: Electric Boogaloo. The player is the top part of any independent film. Jeremy Earl was in the biggest form ever since his stay in Joan Cusack Show. Many of his lines have been executed with a clear and quick mind of the dynamite seen in many young Jimmy Walker. When I got the line "My Bus .... This .... Gone", which was the true turning point of the film, I saw the young Denzel Washington's next emperor. My grandmother loved him very much, bought it on the DVD and recommended it to his friends. White Tony Donato and African American Nathan Davis see the garden and cause warmth in your eyes and heart. The new dynamic duo came out soft (at the knife point) and delicate (giving Nathan women Tony instructions) and conquered Hollywood.
