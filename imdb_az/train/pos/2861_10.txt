I love this show and LOVE my 11 year old daughter and I watch her. It is a fun, adventurous and entertaining way (although it can tell a lot of time in advance) teaches good old fashioned values. <br /> <br /> My DVR has been set up to record all episodes and I've been causing these events to happen. catching the tail of an episode (before the beginning of the next ... so I do not know what episode is) but there was a complete scaling error! <br /> <br /> Adam Sheriff presented a Hero, a small "skin" in which the hero was disintegrated from her dress. <br /> <br /> Well, Roy's coat was there, so he put it on the table and put it right in the torn place. It was a changeable rectangle ... I think that a skin piece (after 1950 after Naugahide?) The hadith of our Prophet (saas) is as follows: "The Prophet (pbuh) this time the template is more in North Carolina and has been built in a totally different place on the coat (still well aligned with the pallet's pitch) and from the iron (it's WAS smack dab mud), and my daughter has had a good laugh because we played the short scene again and again! br /> <br /> Perhaps though it's a totally LOVE SHOW and sequencing mistakes make it much fun!
