<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Just ask a question: <br /> <br /> In some cases, this kind of Edith B. Beale, Jr. and his daughter, Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie), have the same punishment for a train crash - you do not want to look but you have to do it. <br /> <br /> Big Edith and Little Edie East Hampton is once living in New York, once a magnificent mosque, slowly rotting around them, once beautiful gardens are now ornaments. <br /> <br /> Like the young women on the wall next to the wall, the wall (with cats in the wall) and <br /> <br /> Living together for several years has broken many obstacles between the two women but has planted others. <br /> <br /> The dress is optional. <br /> <br /> < br> Edie's favorite suit is a c-dressed hose t bits and pieces of shorts and covered her body and head bent over. <br /> <br /> Edith says, Edie is still 56 years old. And it really is. <br /> <br /> Their eating habits (ie eating habits) are strange). Ice cream spread to crackers. <br /> <br /> For a birthday celebration of Edith for Wonder, a dining party works on fine porcelain with plastic dishes. <br /> <br /> Time is not important in their world; <br /> <br /> Edie says, "I have no watch". <br /> <br /> Edie, relationships with men are very strange. <br /> <br /> Edie feels like Edith, happiness. He says, "If a man does not offer you, you can be dead." He will answer, "I'll take a dog every day." <br /> <br /> It is clear that Edithin does not see the role of Edie in the absence of men. Early in the film, she says, "France was dropped, but Edie was not. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's hard to hear what's happening, and women talk at the same time and contradict each other. <br /> <br / > There is a strange relationship with animals in the film, Edie feeds rabbits in the attic with Wonder Bread and cat food.Cats (and many of them) are everywhere. <br /> <br /> Edie says at one point: "Aristocrats' obstacle is a responsibility" But they will not be responsible for it. <br /> <br /> It's hard to watch, but it's a worthwhile movie.
