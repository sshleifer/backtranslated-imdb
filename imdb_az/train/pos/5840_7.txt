The premiere of the movie is quite bare (as is the case with "hornofobia" from the film), the film is a pleasant and a little bit flickering. It's also a bit better after this movie - it's probably the latest Laurel and Hardy movie produced by Hal Roach. In fact, it would not have been a bad idea not to see their latest films, as all the chemistry disappeared in these films and the boys only play tracks for patches - the true Laurel and Hardy movies would not do anything. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <STRONG> It sounds pretty funny, but is not. Not surprisingly, with all the missiles, Ollie will have a nervous breakdown and take some time from work. Dr. James Finlayson recommends an ocean tour in the team's latest film. But they do not like sails, and Stan has the idea that only a tire-like ship can be hired - they can get all the sea air they want without worrying! After a boat, a dangerous fugitive boat and all of them accidentally set off by the sea. Fortunately, this part of the movie was really good, and the latter worked very well. <br /> <br /> Although it was not a great full-length Laurel and Hardy movie, there were not any disturbing and entertaining musical pieces that were much better than most of them (BACKGROUND OF THE YEAR or FAMILY BABIES). In addition, there is still a decent physical comedy - you will almost certainly not see anything after this movie. Part of this was a reduction in the health of boys (and the growing girth of the company), and some of them were related to the heartwarmingness of these subsequent films.
