In fact, my voice is 7.5. Anyway, the movie is good, it's a good idea to see it, it's not the most funniest movie in the world, and it's not even genuine because it's an idea we've seen before, there are other funny parts there, but this one has its own taste, this is a movie for lovers ... Who does care, not exactly? In addition, there is another movie that has the same theme: Under Chris Rock, I'm here, men are a very funny movie, if you want to, and I know that you won the movie. I liked the character of the hero hero, Ashton Kutcher, but the movie is good.
