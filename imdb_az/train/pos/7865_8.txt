Page 3 is a great movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Part of the film was looking at me in space. Konkana You did a good job in the movie, though a more glamorous or enthusiastic person would do better but did a great job. All supporting actors were also very good and helped throughout the film. Boman did a great job in Iran. There is something remarkable in this film that this story is very big and very realistic, does not defeat the rifle, it is very much about sending a message. I think that such films should be done more, I'm sick to watch the same sweatshirt movies again and now make digestin difficult. Everyone should look, it's a big movie. -Only 2 cents :)
