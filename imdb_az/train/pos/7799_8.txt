It is very slowly but sophisticated, structured and ultimately touching. <br /> <br /> A beautiful, very real life-style look at the winter season in a small Florida beach city - I was there and that's all right. <br /> <br /> This is the actress's Ashley Judd and makes a great impression on her. It's hard to believe that this movie is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in theaters, and recently renamed Ruby. Except for the 80's apparel, it was very good. Anyway, it's a very bright and touching thing, and it's hard to think of his career as elegantly. Talk about boy, early promise! Everyone who saw Ashley in "Ruby in Paradise", this beautiful, natural beauty turned into an all-encompassing art film and serious activity - instead, he turned "into a girl" for silence moviegoers and slasher films! <br /> <br /> Some commentators say that it is progressing very slowly, not for everyone. This is not a motion picture, nor is it a romantic thing. The director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", an excellent character explorer) is deeply respectful of this ordinary young woman's life and is described slowly with her story and many details. So I think this is one of the most moving and respectable future stories about young women I can remember - this is not about rubber sex or "disappearance" of her sister but her life choices. <br /> <br /> a movie, if you take the time to watch it ... I think it would be a really nice movie to show young and young girls (or boys on this subject). <br /> <br /> The director of the script, Nuneza, was filmed on the story of a special kudos, a truthful and beautifully illustrated film. in a female novel or a memoir, but in fact, Mr Nunez has his original work. From 10 to 8.
