Only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we remembered. But even when I left, it was only 4. If you had not yet, Dr. Rent Dolith, Showtime, Spy, Pluto Nash, and all Eddie's family comedy movies - watch it. Hands down, you need to laugh at 90% of your time. The other 10% of your eyes need to erase your tears. <br /> <br /> You really need to look one more time to understand all the jokes. From pink humor to a joke for kids (if you see, you will laugh) - you will love its stuff. You can, (or you are a great admirer), try to download clips from Eddie's actions. <br /> <br /> But this is Eddie Murphy's "X-rated". "<br /> I can say that if you do not like comedy, do not have the sense of humor or do not have fun. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie Beverly Hills copes, you will leave the famous Eddie Murphy classic, and maybe someone will not miss it.
