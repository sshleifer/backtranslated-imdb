In the hands of a talented filmmaker, this movie would be regarded as a fear of masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Michael is "just wanting to die", but the film is fascinating, original and a little scary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is more than one fear of clairvoyance behind the scenario (few shocks), including Chris Sarandon, as the lover of heroes listening, insists that these exciting things have fallen. Burgess Meredith is as sweet as a loveless neighbor. Eva Gardner is worried as a delicate lover with her young and beloved Beverly D'Angelo. John Carradine is doing a job sitting on a podium. And look for a short community from Chris Walken at an unknown time! This movie is creepy and creative. When the subject is a subject, land folds are very beautiful. I will not give you any detail, it will disturb the peak and it will have a great impact. A better filmmaker could have done more, but still sufficiently satisfying - at least those who have at least seventy horror sensitivity! <br /> <br /> If you love torture fantasies that count against modern overproduct bodies, I love it. Almost nothing. This route is quite spartan. There are, of course, a little bit of make-up to the end - most are not really makeup ... but perhaps I have already said so many things. <br /> I appreciate it a little bit higher than the quality, but I'm so glad I did any "8" movies I saw.
