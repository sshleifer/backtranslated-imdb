My first child was born in the year in which this program came out, and then played a record for boys for each Christmas. After the release of the CD, I received about ten copies and gave family and friends friends and relatives ... they always become their favorite Christmas album. Recently, I found several DVDs for sale on eBay (likely to be DVD-R from the video-tape). It was a perfect copy and more than 25 years later, the show was again in sight. There are some songs in the show that are not in the album, and some songs in the album are studio versions of the same songs on the show. Both CDs and DVDs will remain in our library as well as the best Christmas fun.
