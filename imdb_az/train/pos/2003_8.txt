The main problem of the first film "Vampires" is that none of the characters are sympathetic. The carpenter learned the bug, and this time he used an unpleasant vampire hunter and charismatic vampire. Female vampire Una, of course, is the best quality vampire since Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, there are some good concepts like a cool slow-motion restaurant scene (why Carpenter did not use it more?) This movie could not be close anywhere. Seeing powerful vampires on the move and at least a long choreographic battle sequence (for example, inside a city) was a bit disappointing. "Los Muertos" drags a bit in some places while driving at a faster pace than the predecessor (though it's not as bad as "Vampires"). <br /> <br /> Even though it's like "Vampires," the end of this movie is not too intense. <br /> <br /> The majority of the abuses can be as bad as Los Muertos, but this is not necessarily. This is generally welcome and is among the better entries for the genre. This is not a unacknowledged action spectacle such as a Dracula remake (almost every other vampire movie) or Blade II. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < . He had to go away - it could make the movie quite unusual.
