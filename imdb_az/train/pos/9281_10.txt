I did not know how and where the Iranian filmmakers came about when it came to such a sky. <br /> <br /> Many directors resemble one another, but they will not be able to imagine a single film as Jafar Panahi did. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < while I want to take a look at the football match. You will experience the same excitement and feelings as the female actress in the film. <br /> <br /> A few days before meeting with her husband, one of the smokers and the military educators. It resembles Venus VS Mars, it really differs in the minds of men and women and, like women, shows a struggle for equality and opportunity in a multi-patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> I saw Jafari Panahi's film (first Crimson Gold) and was looking forward to seeing again. <br /> <br /> This is a compulsion I have already tied to Iranian films!
