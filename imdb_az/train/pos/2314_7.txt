I heard good things about this movie and I was a little surprised. Reese Witherspoon is astonished in a striking manner at a young age as well as in a surprising manner; Indeed, all small (small) molds are very solid in the American space in the 50s. The reason why you do not appreciate this film is basically up to the end, and the sadness of the older brother does not seem to be the truth, and this has made me a little bit out of the movie. Perhaps we have to fill the plot, perhaps a little bit longer. Maureen's character is pretty much developed. Dani (Reese W., small) was traumatized and understandable, but why his sister was more upset? Since he is over a few years old? Has the latter more than the rest of the film broken? The story of the film, when it comes to Maureen and the Court only on the tractor (warning: this scene is striking, it looks like it's trying to shake it backwards). . What you want depends on whether you can ask for a happy story of a girl, if you like it, you will be surprised. The man who is on the moon is both strangely and illusory and the old film is tough? quite unusual combination? I liked the nature of the court, although we could follow the girls watching. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I love the fact that both of them will harm the younger brother (most men, most of whom were not films) and were killed. <br /> <br /> In my pretty rough ratings rating 7/10. For some reason, I found Jason London laughing at a tractor.
