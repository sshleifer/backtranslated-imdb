"The Telephones" tend to fall into low budget traps and hurrying plans, so this movie is always a trend to reduce this trend. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott, Ebenezer Scrooge, is a perfect, all-inclusive cold-blooded tendency, and still gives him a sympathetic character. The production cost of this film was no exception, never relied on special effects or noise structures, but was based on the depth and clarity of shooting and strong background on the spot. Of course, it's a single movie.
