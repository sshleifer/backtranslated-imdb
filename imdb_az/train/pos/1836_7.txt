<br /> <br /> Time Dir-Vipul Amrutlal Shah Kast-Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Ã‡opra, Shefa Shah, Recep Yadav and Boman Iranians. Written-Worthy Cappadocia Rating - *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We got it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen Vipul Shah's "Time", probably we found the first breath of this year. Trading is packed with all the necessary ingredients, the 'Waqt' movie is a must for filmmaking with Indian audiences. A film that thinks a distributor feels happy and the next visit to the phoren! There is a happy family (not always?) In this beard of the dear Government. On the contrary, there is something selling toys when sending the letter and as if it were married to Sumi (Shephali Shah)! (Amitabh Bachchan)) is an ancestor of Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar must make a serious decision about his son's disregard for the responsibilities of life. His love for Aditya leads to the dragging of a serious matter. However, when faced with a situation that would test the race against time, Ishwar's Adity's departure from the home had no alternative - he hoped that the new troubles could be more conscientious than his own life. However, this estimated solution is becoming a problem in itself, because it goes between her beloved father and son and the fences continue to grow. <br /> <br /> There is no need to be a rocket scientist in order to understand that such a story provides extensive opportunities to resemble comedy and drama. Thus, at the beginning of Boman Iran and Rajpal Yadav, there is a comic, then annoying comedy trail; There is a post-interval for your past relationship between Abi and Akki! Writer Ait's Cappadocia (written by Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu in the original Gujarati film shot) is a good job of maintaining a good liquefied liquid. Dialogs sometimes tend to be contradictory. This does not help the songs look like a leak on a younger surface and prevent the procedure. Obviously, it could go away with few numbers. In the leadership front, Vipul shows that he has a natural ability to explain the story. "Waqt", as well as its previous debut efforts, 'Aankhen', controls how much interest you have. In an individual note, the feelings of emotion were very surprising to me. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Time" is related to the performance of a single point in the overall rating! Amitabh Bachchan is always as reliable as possible. His energy appears and his age is like that! Shefali demonstrates a great performance and is facing a superstar at every step. Boman and Rajpal are sensitive to their homes. Priyanka does little to fulfill the role of a hero. Despite all this, "Waqt" is Akshay's tool. I always argued that Akki's role was as good as it was. Put it in the "Mujhse Shaadi Karogi" and it's fantastic, but it's in a bad situation at Bewafaa. Here Akki is the best. Whether it's comedy or emotionally manifest, she's perfect. There is also a motion picture for fans! First, the best of his previous work was in Aankhen, along with the same director and Big B! <br /> <br /> 'Time' is never a memorable movie. This is not one of the best films in the industry. But for the masses. <br /> <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar - Trivia - This is Akshay Kumar's second second. A sequential film from Bewafaa, then at the stage! <br /> <br /> Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> April 22, 2005
