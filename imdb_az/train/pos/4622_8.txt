I first met Linda Fefermann's Seven Minutes in Paradise and worked at a video store at age 14 and liked it. I recently watched the film and realized it was a lost treasure. Film stars Jennifer Connelly, about twenty years ago, would go to win the Oscars for the Fine Mind like Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays Jeff Moran, the best friend in the world. The film is definitely a softer, softer and smoother version of Pink's Pretty and a beautiful genre of the 1980's. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's father leaves home on a business trip, Jeff is sure that she should act as she lives at home. sucks Natalie's friend Polly played elegantly by Maddie Corman, allowing him to. But it's not about watching the movie, making the kids sit and getting it. The three potentials are so natural and striking that the best results in their performances are heart attacks. These characters really care about each other. <p style = "text-align: justify;"> A great movie for preschool teenage adolescents
