Since the late 1980s I have not seen this movie and decided to take the VHS version. Land is very slow, and when the actors are engraved, they look like tranquility. Music, hip hop / freelance artists and breakdancing scenes make this movie special. Breakdancing is better than Breakin, but I have to say that the Breakin '1 & 2 screen is better than the energy and the excitement. It's a movie I'll keep in my library, but it's not a movie I can once again watch once in a blue month.
