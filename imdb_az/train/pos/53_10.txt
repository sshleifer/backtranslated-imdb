The house really surprised me. Compared to other Columbine school movies, this is the best. It does not reflect school shooting in the home, but rather shows the impact of the community and the city. The film works on two controversial characters. Alecia (Busy Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is an aggression that witnesses all shooting. He will not give any emotion about it. Deanna is a popular girl and the only victim. Alecia is forced to visit Deanna at the hospital to graduate. The police are investigating Alecia because she knew that the shooting would take place. Alecia and Deanna are very different and do not start at first. In the end, they develop mutual understanding and become friends. (in the style of the breakfast club). House Shows the power of intimacy and confusion after a school shooting. I would recommend this movie to everyone and everyone.
