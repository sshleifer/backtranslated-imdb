If I did not know anything better, it seemed to be on the stage, but it was not. Perfectly designed and beautifully visualized all of these images! The unfortunate events that took place on September 11, 2001, have made this documentary and classic classic so unsuccessful. Only the images in the images should look at any American or individual who touches only on September 11 tragedy.
