Try everyone who thinks this impression is not for them. Network TV shows that clones are cloned or show realities with some people who do not fit in the truth. When this show reaches a family-oriented television, it is noteworthy that learning some lessons in life, learning what a true friend and family is and perhaps learning a little about national pursuits. Jeremy Sumpter is one of the most attractive young actors in show business today and is perfectly fired as a young, somewhat naive new wave for the fictional New York empires (big name!). Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms are the main iron, and all this is exceptional. This show is worth the chance to catch up and see. Hopefully, it will stay around for a few seasons and we can learn and develop Pete Young (Sumpter's character).
