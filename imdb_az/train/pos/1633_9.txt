When I went out in the 80s and still loved this whip! I still said the classic lines like "repeat it again" and "you want to suck my ball off." Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Despite being denied and denied by the MAD, this little gem will always be a treasure and a movie that will bring with me when it is sent to an alien island! I only want DVDs to be released, because my VHS tape is worn out! If you like the comedy you want, it is definitely for you and should be regarded as classic! This is the best and worse military joke! Lease it if you do not own it!
