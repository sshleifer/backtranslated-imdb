This is one of the best films I've ever seen. Hanks, Newman, and a very good move by everyone. Indeed, Jude Law's best performance. Cinematography is perfect, editing is good and is a great original account that fits the mood of the film. Production design is also a feature of this film. For me, defeating Godfather requires a lot, but this fantasy cinematography will win this competition. He is definitely the best candidate in my book.
