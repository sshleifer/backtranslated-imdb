The lovers of Elivra, as we did at the late night film studio, love this movie - it is simply cool - its car is great, and for some time Transylvanian Dolly Parton is sometimes innocent and naive - it's also a sexual thing - plus Mae West- s more than just a touch - The sounds are also good and the hilarious as the best plus Sally Keltyman Patty with comedy player Edie McClurg. <br /> <br /> After a while, I think Elvira has beaten potato chips. <br /> <br /> This movie will be followed up again and again. I'm not going to go to Elvira's Haunted Hills anymore and see if it's all right.
