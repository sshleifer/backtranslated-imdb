Very rarely there is an indie comedy that makes a strange impression. Cross Eyed is a rare stone. The writer's director did not solve the problem of directing his work but gave a hilarious performance as a bad guest room. The scenario is interesting, not just the difficulty of the writer who fights, but it blends the writer's world with so much comedy that you can not help, but you follow Ernie as a character. Very funny stuff. Despite the small budget, Adam Jones tries to make a serious look. It is not mixed around when it comes to drawing a good movie. I will not wait to see the next job. This man can think people and think; this is special.
