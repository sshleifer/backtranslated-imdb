The quote I use for my summary is about half in half, because the captain of the Chinese Revolutionary Army (played by Philip Ahn), as his unity, was looted only to the forefront. Of course, the next looter was shot and shot, the main character of the film, the old-fashioned slumber girl O-Lan (now his second-best Oscar for Luiza Rainer, 99). <br /> <br /> The next scene O-Lan describes in a passionate way that his bag of damaged stones, his persistent husband, farmer Vang Lung (Paul Muni), is the classic dictatorship of man's managerial fraud, false accusations, disobedience, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong> O-Lan is in the form of a classic price (self-esteemed son of the old woman, after she retired from an old woman, acknowledged that Vang Lung thrown into a bucket after throwing it in the dirt floor): "Meat is meat."
