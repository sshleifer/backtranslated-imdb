Others have believed in all this from a serious point of view. God was very entertaining for Hop-a-Long Cassidy. It was a great deal of respect for Western TV series years ago. It was not meant to be a great cinema experience. So what great special effects would not be bonanza. It was a fun, cheeky tongue, looking at the old West. Man, relax and enjoy.
