It's been a while since I watched this movie and series, but now I'm updating my memory! It was a very funny movie based on a classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together. Bo and Luke Duke help Jesse uncle General Lee to work Moonshine. Boss Hogg, hiding the Duke from the farm, is hiding around the local construction site of Bo and Luke Hogg, and finds coal samples. Soon, Boss Hogg, Dukes know that Hazzard County will be mine mines if its can not stop it with the help of its beautiful cousin, Daisy. Burt Reynolds Boss thought it was not right for Hoggun and Sheriff Roscoe Coltrane was very serious. Apart from this, HAZZARD'S RECOMMENDATIONS I recommend!
