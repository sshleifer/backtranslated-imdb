Tis is a pretty typical Tom and Jerry short - a situation is expected, conflict and mayhem. The characters behave properly, the natural tension between different characters leads to total chaos. The best (and funniest) part of the peace treaty is valid and respected - all kinds of strange miracles appear in front of your eyes. A warning word is the most intelligent thing Tom can do to help you perform the morning purification process! Be advised.
