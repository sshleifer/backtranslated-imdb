Since Saura did not do anything like that before, Iberia will have an event. He is still a great director and a great filmmaker of the Spanish culture, but he has done a lot of things like the previous one, and although we can applaud the fortune we give, Blood Wedding (1981), Carmen (1983), El Amore Brujo (1986) , Sevillanas (1992), Salomé (2002) and Tango (1998). Iberia is regarded as a series of interpretations of Isaac Manuel Francisco Albéniz (1860-1909) music. and especially for the piano "Iberia" suit. Isaac Albeniz was a great participant outside the Spanish musical culture - reformatted the non-Hispanic audience. He moved to France in the 19th century and was influenced by French composers. His Iberia suite is a creative synthesis of Spanish folk music with Liszt, Dukas and d'Indy styles. Ravel travels around Homo, not as homogeneous as Bolero, but as a beautiful standardization of Spanish rhythms and melodies, not to move in that direction. Naturally, he has missed Spanish Albéniz and revives the performances of performers in terms of ethnic and regional dances and styles in Iberia. However, welding is a complete and diluted form of Spanish musical and dance culture compared to the Spanish extinct Spanish flamenco. Flamenco from the Andalusian region was a deep part of the Guatemalan, Hispanic-Arabic and Jewish cultures. Iberia is just a peninsula of Spain, Portugal, Andorra and Gibraltar. much more concept has been diluted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sauran's Flamenco music is a dignified manifestation of the essence of the Spanish style, singing, dancing and singing, a man and a woman proudly. Despite arrogance and elegance and confusion, even bullws and torero motions are full - with a series of electrical sequences without input or result; They are alone. Saura has always emphasized the staginess she co-operated with choreographer Antonio Gades and other artists. In 1995 Flamenko left a story excuse, and only singers, musicians and dancers had a wonderful lighting and great screen shots, flats and mirrors, film expert Vittorio Storaro, and co-workers. The beginning and end of the sequence in Flamenco is often rude, but atmospheric, only marked with ink and heel legs and sounds. Sometimes the film is fed after a performance, and you see the bend of the dancer, its lying down or laughing; or someone says unexpectedly. In Flamenco, more than any of Sauran's other musical films, the intense mutual effects of singers and dancers, and rhythmically slandering the arguments that make the story a "reminder" to the observers. <br /> <br /> Sauran said he was really magical and maybe in the best way he had all the conventional story. Iberia is similar to one of the purest music of Saura: story, dialogue, a pianist who performs only short album music and gradually moves to a number of dance and some song or region showing names. The main element in Flamenco music is an incompatible sound and this is the most unique and unique part of world music. Although it is related to other songs in other ethnic groups, nothing is equal to the listening, ugly, ugly, ugly beautiful sounds that are capable of doing anything. Later, dance and foot dance and dance with other elements. Iberia has only one flamenco song. If you love Sauran Flamenco, I want to see Iberia, but you will be a little disappointed. Style is available; there are some great sounds, dances and music. But the Iberia source and concept strengthens it less and creates a less rich and intense cultural experience.
