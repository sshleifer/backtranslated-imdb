I do not live in the 1960s, I can not guarantee the exact representation of this film, but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience. The best feature is Josh Hamilton (with Honor), Jerry O'Connell (Drivers), brothers divided into war. Bill Smithrovich, a long-time actor, has a heartfelt performance as a serious father, who believes in his own father as one of his ancestors and who is forced to question his values, but proudly goes to Vietnam, the other is the opposite. In general, this is a strong and heartwarming film that hopes for everyone to live.
