I love this adventure, because it is filled with adventure, love and intrigue. Well, I love it a few times! This is a show that shows all the characters work well and respect each other. It's good for me to see Dick Van Dyke as a television star because I just saw him in Mary Poppins. The main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve, are very close to the audience. This is a show to watch!
