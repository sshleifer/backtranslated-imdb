This is a perfect series for family viewing. The BBC is gathering around the TV to watch it. This is an updated version of Robin Hood, and it also addresses children and adults. Our young people and those with us sit together with their mother and father and watch Robin's next use. <br /> <br /> We will not wait for the next episode every week and watch the free "On Demand". <br /> <br /> There's a lot of fashion in the cabinet. Every story has a moral. It's fun. Violence is not superfluous or unnecessary. The soundtrack is completely fantastic with a part of John William. <br /> <br /> The goal is that there is so much rubbish from the rotting "reality" television of your brain to senseless violence. What should be done for this and should not be compared with this renewed "Robin Hood" movie Errol Flynn. This is a gem that everyone loves. Parents who are concerned about children who are waiting for a lot of violence will be enjoying Robin's loss of taste in fighting and bloodshed. It's a Robin Hood that will not try to get out of the war better. Maid Marian is also an attractive role model for young girls. Instead of stopping and doing nothing, he is acting as "Night Watchman" in helping the poor. Nottingham Sheriff, as well as the sheriff, overcomes the best evil as it seems to be a cross between Billy Joel and Tim Curry. Guy Gisborne is played by a very nice player, many who do not want women to describe the role of a bad "Guy". <br /> <br /> We're just saying "Where is Friar Tuck?"
