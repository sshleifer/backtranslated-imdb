79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers did not do anything with great movies. This is a great music, though they do all they can. Randolph Scott has several prominent music numbers that are well-supported. Two different looks, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball are memorable early screen displays. Ball is especially good and a blonde. "Look at Music and Ragga" is one of the best numbers of music. Harriet Hilliard, "Ozzi and Harriet" is well known as Harriet Nelson, plays Ginger Roger's sister. The main area is quite familiar, but it works with an exceptionally unobtrusive castle. Excellent art direction and account.
