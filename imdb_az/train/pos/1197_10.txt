Only mistakenly watched this movie. What a small stone. The film, shot in 1956, looks and feels like the late seventeen film. In fact, it is better, more limited and accurate than the Blue Soldier. Anthropological vulnerability of the environment is premature. Simple cinematography is superb and very realistic. More than dances with the wolves, Son Hunt tries to convey the look and feel of the "murder areas" of the buffalo at the end of the 1800s. Perhaps the ones in the film were real killing. The film was taken during the buffalo culls with legitimate woods, and the animals you really look at are actually bones true. As a result, many western masterpieces made a perfect move, directed and shot.
