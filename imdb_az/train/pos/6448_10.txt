Kay Pollack (the man behind this film) is a real big man trying to share the philosophy of life in different ways. He has written many good and well-written books on how to control your emotions and make your soul happy. His books and the message in most of this movie really causes your thoughts to cause your problems and depends on how much the rage is. <br /> <br /> We need to keep your mind open to watching this movie and learning something very important in life and listening to all your listeners. If you listen to and watch, most of the pieces in this movie are "secret messages" (or instructions for survival). <br /> <br /> I will not learn the meaning of life, but I will learn how to live ... <br /> <br /> So keep in mind when watching: <br /> <br /> "Mind looks like a parachute, it does not work unless it is! "
