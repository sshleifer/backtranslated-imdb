No, this is no Alice fairy story of my friends! The nickname "Wonderland" is based on the true story of the terrible bloody Wonderland murders that took place in the 1980s in California. Johnny Wad himself was in the center of this blood lake. Yes, John Holmes! Daddy Ding Dong used a shotgun more than a 13-inch dairy machine. Apart from being a legendary adult filmmaker, Holmes was like a hardcore addict who made friends with various Hollywood junkies. Val Kilmer was sometimes as spectacular as Holmes, but once Holmes did not give the character completely. The film features Hollywood soundtracks like Holmes, Josh Lucas and Dylan McDermott, as well as Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow, and Eric Bogosian, a 'who's got' who is dangerous for Tinsletown. These characters play directly or indirectly through the Wonderland murder. This support group was Josh Lucas, the most fierce and influential of all the most charming Ron Launius. Lucas is gradually becoming a big Hollywood player with a charismatic turn in A Beautiful Mind and Sweet Home Alabama. Director James Cox, as Holmes's famous body, has proven to be a bit of a cigarette lighter, demonstrating over-the-counter scenes. Holmes was finally acquitted by Wonderland murder. He died of complications due to AIDS virus. "Wonderland" will wonder what's going on in this bloody night, and if Holmes really puts forth his gun. Disease! The bad Holmes movie! Okay! It's enough before it's penised. Bye Holmies! *** Medium
