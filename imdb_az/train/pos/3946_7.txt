I found a totally inaccurate and completely harsh comment on this movie, so I decided to write myself. I've seen this movie for the first time, and I've been holding it a few times since then. Above all, we can say that this movie is the right thing to do. It does not cause some budgets and other deficiencies. It's worth watching. The main purpose of a film about Walt Whitman's visit is to create a decent, narrow-minded Anglo-Canadian society in South Ontario and bring people to life. The film is about the kind of Whitman catalyst that inspires people. And in this sense, it's exactly. Particularly effective as a doctor by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore - is very good. Comedy and dialogue are powerful and pay attention to the mood and behavior of the time. In general, what do you dislike? Besides, is there a movie that will bring Whitman's life so vivid?
