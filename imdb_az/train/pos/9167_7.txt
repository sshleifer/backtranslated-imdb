This is better than my version of the 1990s, but it's still not good. This is likely to be history, but since 1980, it is very good compared to other points, such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> This adaptive length lets you better fit. Over 90 of the 2 versions of the book and at least St John Rivers are at least covered. Timothy Dalton is as good as Rochester, but Jane's actress is very old. There is more than a dozen resolutions on adapting this length to the TV.
