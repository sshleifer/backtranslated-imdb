What is the common misery of critics of England or the insistence of a few masterpiece fans? Revolver, at least by Guy Ritchie, is a worthy attempt to add a little substance to his guards. But then, nothing is more disgusting than an ambitious movie that is more than a chewing gum using a more funny / concert-artistic film frame. Luc Besson's credits as a producer are expected to have a certain element of Cinema de look: he created a series of edited and compiled action series and oozes style, put together in a few beautiful fantasy worlds that America and Britain coincide , all of which are marked as one-off entertainment. But Ritchie simply wants more than just repeating his films for a quick money, and has spent a lot of time reading and reading about life, universe, and everything else. If the issue is something that has a problem, the trash can be trimmed with screen nails that many attempts are trying to throw with many effects (Machiavelli, Goddard, many chess principles), motif and technique: the movie ends with epigrams of three minutes on the photos of the bodies of the victims of the Temple's victims and sometimes it feels like he did not read a fortune cookie he did not want to be transformed into a movie. More than trade for caballing, the film's center (a bit metaphysical) is really a mixture of the principles of trade, chess and trust that is a difficult game that makes it difficult for philosophy to be accessible. br> <br /> Lastly, Jason Statham has a lot of problems, internal fears and anger, which are a lot of ambitious, but always an entirely successful framework of the enemy (the word), but there is much to do. I do not need to start a new religion, but I'm surprised that there is no US distributor. Maybe the only deliberate counterfeit detection of Ray Liotta was found in curses?
