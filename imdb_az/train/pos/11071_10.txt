I gave him one of the best films. Jason Statham, Ray Liotta, and all the crew surprisingly surprisingly collapsed in a surprising way ... Just look at yourself and push your courage to accept - it's strange, but there are all the answers you're looking for ... The best , mr. Ritchie! I really liked it. Those who are looking for simple figs and shoots are disappointed in the intestines. But there are many movies in Hollywood, and we can not remember what the next day you are seeing today. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, and it would be hard for anyone to expect this to be able to describe such a clear and genius. Absolutely unseen, surprising, dazzling ... We can get an idea of ​​what's going on, and I do not doubt it. In fact, no word can not express my impression ... I'm wondering how it is possible to shoot such a movie after the Hollywood garbage that we are still watching. Thanks to the whole heart, it's just fine.
