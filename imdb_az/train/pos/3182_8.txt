Handsome and amazing English aviation pilot George Taylor (a solid illustration by Guiseppe Pambieri) is beaten by rebels after a deserted night in Hong Kong. Corc responds and falls in love with sweet and virgin Dr. Emy Wong (beautiful and charming performance by lovely Chai Lee). George got into his health and returned to work. Emy Georges has been a victim of despair and prostitutes until he has heard for a long time. This film is not a recurring wallpaper in the sleaze filter, while the director / writer Bitto Albertini delivers a truly satisfying delicate nudity and evaporation soft-core sex content. Instead, between two well-drawn and highly attractive characters, Chi Emy Wong is a strikingly thought-provoking, tactile and tragic love story. The picture begins with bubbly and hilarious, but tonight sweeps into a tougher and heavier mood on two-thirds of the road. Emy did not go into the vision after thinking that he had left him in an error way; extremely sad and terrible surprise bummer ended. Of course, this artistic work is melodramatic, but it's never too ridiculous. In addition, sex scenes are pretty tasteful and even erotic really. Tony's Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a wonderful support section, including jealous and secretly secretary Helen Miller. Guido Mancori's polished cinematography presents beautiful copies of exotic places. Nico Fidenco's strange, blow-up score hit the groovy point. A value for those who want something different.
