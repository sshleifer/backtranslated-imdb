After removing my thoughts about twenty-seven times, I feel that I can conquer this theory for a comprehensive French drama "Read My Lips". After writing more than five hundred articles, I have never found such words, I have never found Jacques Audiard's delicate but inspiring love story. Thinking about this movie was loved and hated by what he liked, and though the "love" was too strong, the elements I hated had caused more debate in my mind. "Read your lips" drama. More precisely, it is a characteristic drama that protects public uncertainty with criminals through the shadows of guilty office work. Here's how it's beginning to collapse, is it all? but more, much more. As a viewer, immediately draw on Emmanuel Devos's description of this fragile woman called Carla, as well as her power in the office and the difficulty of hearing. Audiard not only made the characters in the film, but also instantly disturbed the audience, noting that he did not wear it with his own voice. <br /> <br /> Looking at the life of a difficult and uncomfortable woman, we are then provoked and given the opportunity to meet Paul. Vincent Cassel), a slicked hairstyle, a prisoner, a homeless, unemployed, and a forced exterminationist who was involved in a case of deprivation of liberty. How Carla and Paul are in this meeting. Sudden, unsettled moment of gravity. A man who thinks he loves him, but is dark (and where he is more fun)? and where we think we love it, but it's dark. Restoring a fixed role creates an unknown sound tone. Who is the most sincere in our audience? Paul is in the office, Carla helps him; Carla cancels a contract with his opponent, Paul helps him; Carla's ability to read people's lips is a talent. Regular leaps are waiting for you to shine some light through this dark cave, keeping your cafe back and forth. There is never. Audiard can not just let this story happen, it gives us more symbols; It's as complicated as someone else. Even when we are missing out on our rock, divorce officer with a solid foundation wife? it was angered for the first time in this movie, but then it was the main principle of the film for discussions. But none of them were for our symbols. Devos' solemn and ugly appearance is breathable, as it changes the image of Paul; the truth of his beauty has been discovered. The film's joker Paul continues his exploits and exploits of friendship for the last one. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> Cassel and Devos only play cards all the time and I was still sitting at the end of my cafe. The story, which is the weakest part of this movie, is not accidental. Interwoven stories are primarily inappropriate, but Audiard allows them to bundle a bit. Nevertheless, the whole oral officer was very transparent, but this last scene was over. It does not try to make it clear, but it is difficult to describe this complex (yet simple) story. Much happens, but it is up to you to combine the pieces. Carla's favorite scene is when trying to find out where some money is. Sound and scene use was brilliant. <br /> <br /> In some cases, this is very important to me. <br /> <br /> Although this is a mediocre French movie that I can easily forget for sure, is it time out? I was wrong. "Read My Lip" opens space to discuss situations, not just with symbols. One rooting on a scene to Carla, and the next Paul. When Carla discovered Paul's apartment, I found myself angry. Audiard brought a real emotion to the screen with his characters and development, and he was not missing the plot? actors could carry. I can offer this movie to everyone, but let's be ready; this is not a movie watch at one time. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. <br /> <br /> Lesson from **** ****
