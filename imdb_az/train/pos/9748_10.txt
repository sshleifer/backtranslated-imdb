When I was 17, I saw this movie when I was still in classic rock (still) ... <br /> <br /> I hate the Soprano voices I never loved before the opera, but it changed all of them. The film was very nice and had such a beautiful sound. <br /> <br /> I heard CNN's death today in the pancreatic cancer house, which will be released, and this has definitely left its trace in this world. If I find the movie, watch it and enjoy it. * Smile * Maybe you should head to Amazon.com and wait for it to be sold.
