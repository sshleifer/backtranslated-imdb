I saw the premiere last night for me and my brother ... it was as good as we were pasted for all the things .. hahaha .. I think I closed for the season .... .... they also have a really good actor .. this is the coach boy and pedi the loving player was very good and the plot had come to me but I really can not figure out how it will continue to extend for a season .. probably will be a big twist tho .. wait till Tuesday .. until finally Jeremy sumpter? I can say HES will be great! <br /> <br /> <strong> Aimee </ em> <br /> <strong> Aimee
