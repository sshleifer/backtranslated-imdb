The story and characters are the best I've ever seen. The graphics were good for PS and cut scenes and sound overs were nice. I beat the game at least 3 times and liked every second.

If I remade for ps3, I just get the system for the game and maybe mgs4 is incredible enough to provide the idea of ​​the dragoon system and its execution and even if these ads are sometimes cheating on the inventory (fool buster stick) is.
