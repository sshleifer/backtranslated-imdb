Dramatic license - hates some, but needs to compile a lifetime story. In the "Lucy" claim, Lucille Ball's 20 years of marriage for the early years of his teenage years, his early career, and Desi Arnaz are all cut and reworked. Lucy's life is clear: Lucille's struggle to find her role as an actress laughs at the brilliant comedian who eventually sings Lucy Ricardo's legend; Desi Arnaz is ugly, romantic and finally impossible marriage; Lucy & Desi, the creator of the first television empire, will eventually provide its own place as TV's most memorable sitcom. <br /> <br /> As Lucille Ball, Rachel York is a praiseworthy job. Judy Davis, as Judy Garland plays, do not expect to see the same miraculous transformation, but York Ball wants his strong will and he is also very laughable. His comedy, though different from Lucy, is still convincing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> but he has his own attraction, and especially on the opening scene, Desi's emphasis is on a decent job. Madeline Zima was not very memorable as the old Lucy, it was decent. <br /> <br /> Rebecca Hobbs and Russell Newman were not very convincing because Vivian Vance and William Frawley were very happy. Since they were not good actors, they were not all things that were just right for people to play. Most of the players were from Austrailia and New Zealand, and repressive accents could sometimes be identified. <br /> <br /> Although the main structure of the film is contrary to historical reality, there are many deviations, and some because of invisible causes. Jess Oppenheimer, the lead author of Lucy's "My Lovely Husband" radio show, which began in 1948, is described in this film as coming to the scene to help with "Love Love Lucy" in 1951, and is truly the creator! This film describes Marc Daniels as the director of "Lucy Love Me", running away from the fact that William Asher replaced the first season after the first season! In addition to budget restrictions, Ricardo's plans to live in the same apartment as all the living places in New York when they changed their apartments in 1953. The kitchen set is a bit wider and has a wide range of original. The Connecticut home seems pretty close to the original, except for the right and left parts of the house, except for the compressed and rebuilt. <br /> <br /> In 1953, Lucy's Desi, who also spoke about buying the RKO, despite the crash of the RKO until 1957 during the red shock incident. These changes could have been dramatic for the license and are trying to convey the main facts of the film, but would it hurt them to respect Oppenheimer and Asher, two important people in the history of "Love Lucy"? The biggest gaff, at least a few come from the "I love Lucy" recreation scenes. Realizing what is happening in the film and done by billions of people is always risky, but more OBVIOUS changes are made. The scene with the giant bakery was cut off and anyone familiar with this episode would immediately distinguish the differences! The number "We are a baby" is shortened, but besides, this was practically dead. Rachel York was actually the best "grape stomping" scene, with nailing Lucy's mannerisms. Instead of trying to re-create Vitametavegamin and candy factories, producers have made a wise decision to show them how to train them. These scenes were effective due to this approach. <br /> <br /> The film's main flaws, on the other hand, suggest that viewers have long talked about Lucy's life because most are completely erased or completely erased. In general, Lucy & Desi's marriage is a worthy portrait and can not lead to actual mistakes when developing the character effectively.
