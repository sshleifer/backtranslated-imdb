This is a Portuguese boy's greetings. <br /> <br /> I believe that Sopranos is one of the best manufactures, and truth and fantasy are so complicated that it's hard to see the difference. It has the same quality as GodFather! James Gandolfini is like a paper glove! I really liked Soprano would never end. Perfect! There should be a theme in the school :) When I was a child, I saw Sopranos, but I'm too young to stay awake until the episode ends, so now I've got all the Episodes in DVD, watching all the episodes in the house, and after dinner, I'm not addicted to prison. In my opinion, Prison Break and Sopranos are the best series for television. The arguments of both are beautiful and the actors are perfect. <br /> <br /> Congratulations on such a business. Thank you for reading.
