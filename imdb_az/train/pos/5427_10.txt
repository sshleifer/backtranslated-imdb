Three sergeants in the British army deployed in India are sent to stop a killing known as the Thuggees. One of the sergeants, Cutter, escapes from the camp in search of the golden temple, and seized by the Thuggees, who is driven by the dangerous Guru. Gunga Din, who is the boat's water, is back to help the camp, and the other two sergeants leave it, but they are kept. Now, the key sends a completely detailed information, but they do not know if they are trapped in a trap. Gunga Din, who saved the day, though. The perfect friendship movie, though politically wrong today. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks will give you many charming and exciting performances with Jaffe and Giani's very bad Cianelli. Rating - from 10 to 10.
