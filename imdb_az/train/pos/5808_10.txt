Moonwalker is such a great movie, you will not be able to pull your eyes from beginning to end. I love all the clips of Michael and dance in love and just love the "studio tour" bit ... soo funny :) And 'mini movie' all special FX and so on. to cool off with ... Michael is a genius and will always be there!
