I am very sorry for the people who go through the pad and pencil to record flaws and write down how bad a film is. I feel the same respect for people who go to the movie and who can not stop the truth and / or allow themselves to drag 90 minutes of busy life! Get the GRIP people. ECGTB is a very interesting film. If you take movies seriously, this is NOT for you. If you look like the movie in any way, this is not for you. But you do not like what "I'll be watching hell" of Priscilla Queen or Moulin Rouge. Or the general comedy called The Sweetest Thing. Then run yourself to Cowgirls. There are some really funny parts. Actually cheerful. It also has really good music, kd.lang for kudos. 90 minutes Uma Thurman also ..... should I say more?
