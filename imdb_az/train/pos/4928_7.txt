Taking into account the period of release, the story of the 1950 film "Panic in the streets" was very surprising. The body of the mysterious immigrant immigrant was not found until a further examination of the public health inspector claiming that the body would carry bubonic plague disease. However, with the present drama of today's world, it's strangely helping to make the film look current to today's audience. Casting and crew are flawless. Jack Palance, starring Richard Velmark in "Night and City," is Paul Douglas, a leading actor in this film, and young (and pretty beloved) Barbara Bel Geddes. Non-professional, non-professional actors (typewriter Kazan typically) fill the remaining slots in all sleeves. Elia Kazan directed Joe MacDonald's films (later in 1953, the better 'Pickup on South Street') and along with the great Alfred Newman, he worked with Richard Widmark. Nearly everyone involved here has done a better job, but the "Panic in the Streets" is a very rewarding thing. Especially for film-noir enthusiasts.
