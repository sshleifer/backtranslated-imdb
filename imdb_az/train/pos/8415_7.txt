"Doctor Caligari Cabinet" is the father of all fear films (and German expressionist movies), this is a great father before WWI. Starting in a free hole, the titular student contracts with the devil - Satan submits to him a "golden sack" instead of "something in this room." The devil chooses the mirror on the student mirror. <br /> <br /> Some restrictions from the technologically advanced state of the film shot in 1913 are exposed to the film; The plot cries for chiaroschuro effects, but the film is a necessity, almost all stroke in the sunlight without shadow. <br /> <br /> The scene from the poverty mirror still collects a wall cover. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the Prague Student is still more valuable to the tendency to have more self-interest.
