I saw it in the theater and immediately thought that it was enough to have a video. <br /> <br /> The Sci-Fi movement, despite everything, is a great win. <br /> <br /> Without leaving any story, it's worth seeing the Sci-Fi love without much thought. The story is groundbreaking and the plot is very good. Do not deserve your time to see! <br /> Maybe they will continue? :) <br /> <br /> From 10 to 8
