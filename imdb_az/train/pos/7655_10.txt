I have not seen this movie about 20 years ago, and I am still impressed with the impressive and impressive player. Of course, a Mickey Rooney is really an unusual thing in the ring-leading "Killer" role. (In addition to Orson Welles, he made Mickey Rooney's name as the biggest movie actor). I also remember jazz-brassy honey and naked black and white photography. I love the last line of Mickin, which goes for the dose of lead poisoning (I think Stranglers have drawn a line in one of their songs - hold yourself.) This is a big movie and unfair film. Come on! Side note - was written several years ago in the latest Film Review magazine, Don Segal's "Last Mile" and Mickey Rooney wrote "Babyface Nelson." Another rave of Mick's intense and sincere performance. Perhaps this is the beginning of a highly appreciated principle for a truly outstanding cinematography show.
