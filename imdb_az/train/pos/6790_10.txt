This game is one of the best RPGs. Fist, in fact, is more fun than another because of the battle system (if you target the attack you can damage the enemy, dragun'a, special attack, magic ...). The scenario is very good. The characters are all beautiful and you do not have a long dialogue to support, as it happens in several games of the Final Fintasy series. When I just want to go with the story, I'm tired of the dialog boxes that are related to the past. Ambientation is a must-have in this game, combining the medieval fantasy with futuristic science fiction. The animation effects are incredible, and I like it more than other modern games (Dragun's legend is not remembered for 8 years). Then, the map is very large, there are enemies in every place. Finally, Music is not the best I've ever heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.
