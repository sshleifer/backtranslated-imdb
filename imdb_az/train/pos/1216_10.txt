As a child, I chose the first Care Bear movie because it was so dark. I've always sat down and watched the first one. As I'm great I've learned to choose this one. In my opinion, this movie is very dark for babies, but when you are older, you learn to treasure it more than you realize it is, and it does not look as dark as you are when you're a kid. <BR> This movie, in my opinion, is better than the first, everything is deeper. The first movie may be contradictory, but you should not see the first movie to watch this movie. The robes are so pleasing, I'm taking the 'Flying Colors' scene back. <br /> <br /> The sound is great! Great support for Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this movie, downloaded it all and listen to it all, and I listen to 'Our Beginning', which is called 'I remember at the moment'. <br /> <br /> I think animation is great, animated animation, and I love Carol Kings, the best movie in the film. Both films are fantastic. When I sat down, I watched 10 years later and saw that the animation of the time was good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify; I do not think it's weird and strange. /> <br /> This film is about how the nursing womens come from and how to defeat the Demon, Dark Heart.The latter is surprising and again, the Nude Wives will beat any 'Pokemon Movie' with moral issues. Nevertheless, this film teaches everyone about morality from all ages.
