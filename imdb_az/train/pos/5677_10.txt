3rd and, in my opinion, the best of Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> Only Lord Percy is the most extravagant character of the previous series, but the Prince of Hugh Laurie's Regent, line. <br /> <br /> Packaging is a convincing regency of kits, beautiful cut sarcasm and small bits unreasonable, 'macbeth' actors and Prince John's impressive 'charming us' chicken impression, and missing words from Dr. Johnson. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
