Generally, as a great fan of fantasy, and especially works by Neil Gaiman *, I longed for this film very hungry and I can finally and unexpectedly protect myself from the fear of disappointment. And what do you know? I do not need to be afraid, the film version is bl ~ dy wise. <br /> <br /> Different from this book, but in a good way - less strange, funny, yet deeply sweet and magic. <br /> <br /> Special effects are totally stained and feel a natural and correct part of the magic. <br /> <br /> The Divorce World without disturbing and unobtrusive. The focus is on storing and accelerating, casting the key, awesome Princes (the pen-call literally means reading) is currently stealing the best-selling British comedies and most funny moments of most-shot movies Rupert Everett, Little Britain's famous David Walliams, "Green Wing" in abundance. <br /> <br /> Actually, I'm a little criticized in the movie that sometimes comedy elements are a small OTT, and the subtlety goes out of the window to punish the main story. Ricky Gervais, for example, Rico Gervais, "Ricky Gervais, made ordinary David Brent from the bouquet of comedian bureaucrats" and, in my opinion, created an undeniable essence of the magic writing of the evolving story (although according to tradition , I believe in the True Character of the True Book "beautiful" Ricky Gervais "- it comes when I think about it) .... <br /> <br /> But this is a perfect cast and scripted fairytale instead of good motion and romantic blends, as the hero Tristan Charlie Cox takes the right mix of naivety, sophisticated comedy and self-realization for a story like "a modest young boy begins a life-changing study"; Claire Danes, as Yvaine, is beautiful, feisty, and just as strange or ethereal as his perfect Robert De Niro, one of every reviewer of the community, b hs is a really worthy of praise, good fun playing the role (he also appears as a possession) ... Michelle Pfeiffer at the summit, cool and evil, the evil witch Lamia, my favorite film overall performance. <br /> <br /> If you recently enjoyed her unpleasant performance at Hairspray, then you will agree with her thoroughly. <br /> <br /> So you laugh out of this view, of course, you can smile and even cry - Stardust is a beautiful, heart-warming surprise for the whole family, the golden heart and the richer than ever. One of my favorite films of all time is completely fantastic, like the fantastic bride and Stardust, resembling a similar theme and similar subjects and areas ... and only twenty years after the princess was released, she was fresh, smart, and funny Stardust's delicious dessert will be shown in our television series (or even the next device) in the coming years as it is loved by the family.
