A vast, but compelling expression of friendly relations between civil rights leader Steve Biko and Donald Vuds. The first half of the film is stronger when you see the relationship between two men and how they help each other, but the second half is not strong because of the Biko's elimination. However, a film shot by Kline and Washington's big demonstrations is the latest in a movie on the map. Washington became the first candidate for the best supporting actor. In general, a good movie can be trimmed down a bit. 7/10.
