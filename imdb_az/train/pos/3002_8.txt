"Kennel Murder Case" starts in a run and does not stop until the end. Everyone had a basis for killing the victim, and a few tried. William Powell, Philo Vance, is terrific as a gentleman detective. Mary Astor refers to a strange brother who only wants to marry Scottish gentleman and enjoy her heritage. This film is also associated with Nancy Drew, Reporter on DVD. If you have a rental (or check your local library), do so. It's pure fun!
