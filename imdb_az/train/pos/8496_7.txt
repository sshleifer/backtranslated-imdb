Wow, it's been years since I saw this movie. Watching him in 2008 is, of course, very different from watching him in 1986. At first I did not think, "I'll do it through the movie." Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so surprising, arrogant, and disrespectful that I found it hard to watch. It has embodied every negative stereotype of Americans. If it were not bad enough, the appearance of the smaller American city would have been even worse after it had been shown. On the mutual spectrum, the Japanese was presented as emotionally robotic businessman. Not all of the movie was funny, but just because of the nostalgic value. <br /> <br /> As in some boxing, judges are shaken because you understand the cycle. This film went from seven to seven, which I appreciated for the end. The latter was excellent. You always want a harmonious end, and that's just it. We emphasized the importance of the city's work there and the need to keep the factory, but Japan's traditional and traditional values ​​and the tradition of American customs and values ​​were the most important. It was a medium film ending with a high note.
