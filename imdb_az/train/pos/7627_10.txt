I watched this movie a while ago and after seeing Graceland 3000 miles all this flooded. Why is not this a Video or DVD broadcast yet? We did not leave this magnificence of the film in the presence of other pits. In fact, this is a free John Carpenter movie. Actually, I did not see him on television, or since I watched him. Kurt Russell is the perfect choice for Elvis. This is definitely a role-playing game. After leaving the terrible horror of horror, I brought this gem that I like to play again on TV. It is done well until you perform well and read it well. Elvis's biggest hits are most expressed gusto. This is what Russell and Carpenter have come together with, since I had to release some of the great films (escape from New York, escape from The Thing, escape from LA and escape from LA One), or to release one's own version of life, this is the curse of the king but also to destroy this magical thing. If it does not, we will be at Heartbreak Hotel.
