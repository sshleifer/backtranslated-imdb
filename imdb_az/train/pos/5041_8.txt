Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious man waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) at the FBI office. It claims to have a knowledge of a serial killer followed by the FBI. When Agent Doyle arrives at the office, he tells him that the serial killer really is his dead brother. Agent Doyle demands some evidences and explains his wife's story of life since childhood. They were a simple family of three: his widow's grandfather Meiks (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father collected two brothers and said that an angel of God had visited him and determined his family to destroy demons. What happened later is one of the most intimidating films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four months ago at the VHS and watched the DVD yesterday. Despite being a low-cost movie, the scenario is devoid of any defect. The cast is beautiful, but I would like to stress that Matt O'Leary performed as a young Felton. Implementation by young people is very difficult and complicated. Bill Paxton's direction is remarkable. There is no open violence in this fear film. Great debut behind the camera. I'm sorry for the Brazilian title of this movie: "A Mão do Diabo" (Devil's hands). At least "God's hand" was, it could be accepted. But it's really ridiculous to summon this movie as "the devil's hand". Screenwriter Brent Hanley was not worthy of such a respect from the Brazilian distributor. This movie is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> "My voice is eight". <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mão do Diabo"
