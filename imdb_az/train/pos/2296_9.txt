_Les Acteurs_ Jean-Pierre Marielle's absurd story is a cup of hot water, a conspiracy story against actors, a story of old actors slowly lowering their career, French actors and their films. <br /> <br /> The story of the film, supported by a strong deficit of cinema and moving (the fourth wall, hidden cameras, playing or playing), is played by famous actors (live in front of the camera - not a movie-maker) and is watching actors in a series of episodes that make the movie quite entertaining. When Andr√© Dussolier releases his film and releases Josiane Balasco's role as a great actress, especially as Dussolier, bitches about himself, as actors fend off each other in the street, as fights do not recognize actors at least 50 years) anyone who does not know or work for anyone who does not know French movies is less interested in this because most of the references will be missed, but in public life, aging, action, action will be a good mark ...
