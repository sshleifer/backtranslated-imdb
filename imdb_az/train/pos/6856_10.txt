Brian De Palmawith is a well-known work from around the globe. It was extremely suspenseful and often scary and thought fantastic, plus all the characters were awesome. Yes, many parts of Psycho run away, but still have a brilliant horror / tension, fantastic opening and shock, and an unexpected finale! Certainly one of the best fears I have ever seen and the elevator look is one of the most memorable scenes, and Michael Caine is simply incredible! The end is very good, and the nearest hospital scene is terrible, and the last one is shocked to hell with me! It did not fail to leak me and the stack sequence was completely brilliant, and Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon were fantastic chemistry together! This is a ridiculous masterpiece with beautiful demonstrations all around Brian De Palma! Direction Incredible !. Brian De Palma is an incredible job here, Amazing camera work, incredible angles, fantastic use of colors, awesome magnification and great POV shooting, and keeping the movie very fast. There is a little blood. We bloody knives, knives, bloody armed wounds and 2 bloody cracks. The actor is incredible! Michael Caine AMAZIN here, he was incredibly creepy, very unpleasant, mysterious in the actor's office and really did just the incredible job, I loved it! (Caine Guidelines!). Angie Dickinson performs an unforgettable performance here and was pretty good and was a good chemistry with Caine. Nancy Allen unhappy GORGEOUS! And here's fantastic, she was extremely cheeky as she was a prostitute, was excellent chemistry with Keith Gordon and put a great show !. Keith Gordon was very good as a kid, had excellent chemistry with Nancy Allen and was very pleasant! Dennis Franz is good as a detective. In general, this is, of course, one of the best films of horror and immediate release, and let's just see! 5 units *****
