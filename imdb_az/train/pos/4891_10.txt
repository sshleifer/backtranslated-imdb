A great concept, a great cast, and, unfortunately, there was not much time to challenge the story. I liked it and wanted more. Dench, Dukakis and Laine, are now a few real women! Still, Dench and his character were just enough material to run scripts on just a few moments. <br /> <br /> <strong> Qafqaz> - No questions! - No arguments! <br /> <br />
