Broad Sprayy Splashy Film. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) likes to walk around the dice and organize illegal crap games. If Adelaide-loving blonde (Vivian Blaine) was unhappy, she wanted to get married. A great bet, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!) Decides the final game in the City. He said GÃ¶yne could not get to go to Havana together with Mr Graham's mission officer Sarah Brown (Jan Simmons). <br /> <br /> This is a real mixed bag - there are some nice things here. Songs are good and dance is incredible. Crap game at the end of the real show stopper. Also here Brando is really very good - it may seem strange to read and dance it, but it does. Seeing a large, voluminous Brando was a lot of fun with pulling some challenging dance moves! Sinatra is also very good and Blaine is as beautiful as her patient girlfriend. His song and dance numbers are strongly emphasized here. <br /> <br /> Now for bad things - Jan Simmons is a wonderful actress, but she's stuck in a colorless role and can not do a lot. The film is more than 150 minutes away - the scenes between Brando and Simmons are really dragged and shortened. And most of the characters speak sensitive English - contractions are never used. Maybe gangsters try to get a fun out of the mouth, but that's why I'm worried and that I'm going to shoot me. <br /> <br /> It is worthy to take the songs and dances, but it takes you a while to finish it. I'll give it 7.
