For anyone who likes a series, this movie will be something to watch. It also leaves more than anyone you want. I liked the way each character (detective) creates. With the expiration of the fourth cafe because they put the cause of another film. My guess is, of course, Bayless. We've brought together many scenes like this series. This was a series of lives. Thanks to cast for some nice television.
