I will not be able to say that Freddi's heroes are cheesy and dull. Certainly, you do not know good television when you see it. The episode is full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative to kill people. I love Freddy's Nightmares and hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The Best Episodes: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think that this array is presented, then you have ideas, but it does not mean anything and remembers your mind. Freddy's Nightmares will always be one of the best series and soon you have to come to accept this fact. If you do not like it, do not watch it, but you do not deny it.
