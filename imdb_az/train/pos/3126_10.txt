I do not give you a ten star rating easily. A movie really has to impress me, and Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Moreover, this trilogy has come to a great end, so I believe it's one of the biggest trilogy of our time. Although all three films are different from Ludlum novels, it still stands as a stronger place in cinematic achievement. <br /> <br /> Bourne Ultimatum wanted to tell me about the sequence, but even for hours I did not try to smile. <br /> <br /> From the start of the opening, go. Paul Greengrass did it again. Everything we love from previous Bourne films is here once again: action, dialogue, and, of course, a vibrating camera. But for me the last one was not a problem. <br /> <br /> I think that this film is supplementary to the filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Before I go to DVD, I will see this movie several times, it's just horror. It is a perfectly satisfactory result and the time test should be a fantastic movie and an absolutely unforgettable trilogy.
