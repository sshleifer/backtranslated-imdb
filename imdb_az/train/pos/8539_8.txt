Tactile and sad movie. Describes the trials and challenges of an author who wants to come to paralysis due to a bike accident. The film is based on the relationship with her lover who often has many enemies against her and interacts with her other crash victims, especially a black-down and faced and white-supremacist biker. The film is often hearty, often sad and always convincing. Quit the Kleenex box and follow your partner conveniently on Sunday afternoon.
