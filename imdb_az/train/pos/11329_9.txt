The combination of perfect black and white photography and "Eugene Onegin-a twist" sounded a real beat for me. The atmosphere generated by very dark shots was sometimes contradictory with very bright whitewashed white. <br /> <br /> Transparency of Lensky's heartbreaking arcade from the Tsexioski opera, Eugene Onegin, is a feast of the conventional convention, but the actors' faces are characterized by a subtle, but immediate appearance. /> A good film for me is to use the opportunities provided by that media, so the story is more important than the imagery and the atmosphere - Marienbadda is a good example of a movie last year. Krisana is in the same pattern.
