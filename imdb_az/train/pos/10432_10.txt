From the very beginning, I was not surprised to watch this movie. I thought it was a stupid, romantic film about a French woman who met an American train and decided to visit Vienna with her. Since I tried to believe that it really was a movie, I was not really as intriguing as this one. Still, I followed it! And I was surprised ... The film "Before Sunrise" is a thought that we can say in a philosophical way, that we are punished with death at our birth, or that some people may live together for eternity or that we, sometimes, can live in prophecies. <br /> <br /> The latter was beautifully selected (we do not know we will be reunited at six, six, six months at Vienna station) - we really hope that we are optimistic. Actors acted in a very good way, so I believed that I had a love story like that.
