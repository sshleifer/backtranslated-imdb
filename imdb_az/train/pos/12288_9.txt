The House of Spirits is a wonder of family intrigue, South American politics and super-natural forces. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, and Jeremy Irons are all passionate and passionate about Isabel Allende's novel. This, in my opinion, is one of the best films of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons are many believers like Esteban Trueba, and in the role of Clara, Meryl Streep keeps his subtle, loving temperatures relatively short. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas are a wonderful couple fighting for the adoption of the family in an alien culture. Esteban's sister Glenn Close gives her a very moving performance. The Portuguese village is an acceptable replacement for a non-tropical Latin American country. The parameters of Clara's house and Esteban's lantern are impressive, and US cars are well-connected to the post-war environment.
