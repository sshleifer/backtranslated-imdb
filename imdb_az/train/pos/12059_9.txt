I love the fantasy stories in general, but I love the stories of excitement, especially in cold, atmospheric and elegant creepy English era. This corresponds to all counts. A mixed young lawyer (a "lawyer in Britspeak") is sent to a small village offshore to locate the property of an aged, deceased woman. In the 1920s, many middle-class Brits have been on the brink of the sea for a "health". There is nothing "solid" in the Crythin Gifford village, which is a creepy place for the elderly woman's sweat, embracing Victorian property on the edge of the salt marshes on the surface of the fog. When a lawyer succeeds in a little girl (none of the locals will help you cope with the danger - then you will learn why she can do that in the film), which is causing the black woman to rage. He is not a film but an angry, but a bad black silhouette of evil and evil. The watcher sees only a few times, but in each context you feel his bad reputation. When the camera is dragged onto the lawyer when you read through the legal documents, you are planning to see the woman at any time. When the lawyer goes to the cooler to open up a creepy old house for electricity, you think snakes on the camera and that you will open there too. Do not wait for the woman in the dark to make her nails suspenseful. Previously, we have seen many elements of this story (a locked room, no smoke, no nonsense that ignores the warnings of the local people), but the director is trying to merge them into a completely new and modest ghost story. Waiting for a woman to look at a friend you can warm to warm up one of your friends. . .
