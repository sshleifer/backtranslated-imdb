Everyone who finds the enrichment of this film is a hopeless bonehead, which should be directed to car-watching movies and romantic comedies. This movie is gnawing and has no awesome moment. Why? Because the crisis is a very intelligent dialogue between real people and explains their efforts to protect the crisis. I repeat - a clever dialogue! This is about the characteristic of Rohmer films, so many people do not like them. They prefer to act. <br /> <br /> Rohmer has always been charged with "talking". Watching the film "Rohmer". Yes, he is, but for me, this is not a criticism, but a compliment. Shakespeare also talked. Are there more players than Hamlet? If the subject or theme of an artwork is based on ideas and conflicts on values, then these ideas and values ​​should be discussed, and this is all the film. Aristocracy and anti-Semitism; loyalty to old friends who are put into a giant test when we believe that our friend is a wrong way; the cost of human life and the responsibility to get rid of life, even the person who has the life, even though it is so beautiful and despicable. <br /> <br /> In this film, two films are drawn to play these roles. . Lucy Russell, who is fluent in English and speaks French as a second language, is particularly brilliant. Make a grace to yourself and watch this riveting movie. This screen can be the latest movie by Master.
