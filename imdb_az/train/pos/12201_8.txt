The Lady and Shanghai, released in 1946 and released in 1948, was one of the great films shot by Welles after returning from relative exile to make Citizen Kane. Dark, this film is as tall as Film-Noir movie, describing some early periods of Cold War. The cinematography of this film is packed with Welles' strange angles, fast cuts, long straps, and illuminating lighting. The use of surrounding street music is a pioneer of Touch of Evil's incredible long boot and China's mysterious Chinese characters and Chinatown sequences can only be regarded as inspiration for Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately, Welles is a decision related to a technical film that completely hurt the film. The plot of this story sometimes lacks some incomprehensible film technique. <br /> <br /> But despite these criticisms, Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) are happy to watch the movie. Orson Welles is not just Irish creepy but honest but dangerous sailor-torn identities. Rita Hayworth, who was then married to Welles, breaks her ordinary roles as a sex theater and takes on the role of real depths and contradictions. Finally, Glenn Anders is strangely and surprisingly described, or Elsa's husband's legal partner is something classic!
