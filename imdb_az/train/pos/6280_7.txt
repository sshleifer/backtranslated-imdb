<br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? <br /> <br /> In the film, especially Vinnie Jones, there are some superb players in the film, with its typical malady attitude and hardcase appearance. <br /> <br /> There are only two small flaws in this movie. The first is a poor plot, but people do not watch this movie for the plot. Secondly, exposing large theft cars (car crash). <br /> <br /> For the first time, Nicolas Cage played a key role, but people really can steal a Ferrari and turn them away. Role, I first thought "... shade.", but then "... naaaa suck!" <br /> <br /> After looking at this movie, finally "... yep o suck!" implemented. <br /> <br /> I'm going to end this unusual look, "part of an offender clarified the viewers to the general cinema as an ugly finish under the glamorous lifestyle of life and inspired them to change their way of death, and then that death was a little noble with it. and has a great reputation. <br /> <br /> Ps - Angelina Jolie Voight can look very nice!
