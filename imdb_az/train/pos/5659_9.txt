AG was a perfect introduction to drama, tension and tension, so rare to American television. Sharif Lucas gave many viewers villagers. We have rooted for Caleb because he opposed Sheriff Lucas's accusations. Learning the connection between these two characters is unthinkable, we were angry and afraid. Manipulation that caused fear of what Lucas would do every week was really striking. This show has been rarely tested by "american entertainment", with fewer ways to master the Gothic monkey. These suits made a big mistake in supporting this show. This show embarrasses the current reality of "reality" demonstrations - they are a very satisfactory picture. The call to the DVD box kit is good. This show is a quality overview for a sophisticated market for quality viewing. The public, which is tired of saturating the mind with the true value of the deceit, will explain this true story. Bring a DVD box kit!
