It was a great romantic comedy! Historically, it is inaccurate (Einstein has not had children and brothers because he is elsewhere), but he has created a huge wheel. He brought together two beautiful people playing two of the best players. All supported players (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry and others) clicked on the whole screen and this was a great experience. It's like driving a car around, so it looks like it's all bikes for people around it, and it's contrary to the posters. And wearing socks on one stage ... was informed that the professor never wore his socks! (Two new entries for the IMFD goofs section). Historic inaccuracies and inconsistencies with each other were a great film to watch with a huge cast. I'll give it 8!
