This movie is beautiful in every way where there are no adventures of modern action. Take some time. Relax, enjoy. Think about it. People who see this movie slowly or dullly look really good about a week and see how well they are so careful as they look at it for a reason or a good storyline. There is no other reason for you to hurry. Initially Brosnan was playing a native American. Taking into account the story line, I think it's a cast. Now, return to my hermitliyim. Jahfre
