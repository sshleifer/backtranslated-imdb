<br /> <br /> Butterflies were so good, even better, that even this series could be the best of Britcom and its competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbors, just two names) are best for the best, classical, classic and intelligent comedy, but also expanded horizons - perfect, soft and great in every detail - great social change in the UK <br /> I watch and watch this show as a teenager and I'm afraid of it all . The described lifestyle is remarkable. This was the first time I saw real people using wireless phones. And all the characters' wardrobe was still moving away from the 70th century still in North America. Then there was a d√©cor, a shop, a front, a car. These people, even the philosophical approach of life and the epigrammatical humor together with the sons of despair - developed. <br /> <br /> In the near future (1980s), he was an example of the "New Europeans" who could influence life and style in the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. The claim that a suburban sleep can lead to dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction, especially for North Americans, who have always been described as money and things (the situation was described on American cinema and television, but not intensively) butterflies or film Montenegro. However, when it is not quite astonishing, the means described have made it too extreme. Is sexual intercourse really a potential issue, not romantic? <br /> <br /> Many butterflies have dazzled, but some people have been pushing their foreheads ... then. <br /> <br /> Butterflies appeared in many ways - prophecies. At the beginning of the time - post-modern traditional, widely spread lifestyle, emotional betrayal and genealogy, and men's dissatisfaction (described by extremely difficult father-son relationships). Too bad, this series has not come out of a big way, and all of this has been given to create a momentous moment of sight and time for a predetermined slickness and disaster.
