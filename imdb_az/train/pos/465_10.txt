Marlene Gorris founded himself as one of the world's greatest filmmakers. This sensible, visually impressive film is based on a story from Vladimir Nabokov, and he is well aware of the author's dark iron. I think the best performance of John Turturro (I'm usually a fan of him); Emily Watson is also brilliant. It's worth seeing.
