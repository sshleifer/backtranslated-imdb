I saw this movie last year at the Taos Film Festival and just drowned. A rich, warm novel brought to the screen, beautiful action and well-directed. More than anything, David Lean reminded me of the two films, both capable of managing a complex story and creating powerful scenes that influence different levels. The best film I've ever seen.
