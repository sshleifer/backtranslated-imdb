The last part of the movement's decline is probably the hardest hit of three films. Playing with the Anti-Bond theme is progressing further. Bourne does not like what he does and wants to know about his stained history. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is shot in a script that moves from a cinematography to a choreographic / stunt job. <br /> <br /> Film Bourne begins to flop when fleeing Moscow police. The story goes right from where the first film was released. Or does it do? Time is a bit confusing here, but Bourne remembers things. Suddenly, looking up at an eye will catch him, but he does it and does not kill anyone. They are not his target. From there, we get more of the past with Nuh Vocene, a new player who knows everything about Bourne and who will protect her. <br /> <br /> Pamela Landy returned to Nicky Parsons, also known as Bourne. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is in front of you, practically in everything. If the car looks better than the first two, the car's chase is even stronger. And the veteran footballer who follows Bourne is superior to the beautiful part of Albert Finney. At the same time, it has small political pressure on investigations and other government policies, but it is very good in a small and integrated area. All this is the best trilogy outcome this year, if not the best action trilogy.
