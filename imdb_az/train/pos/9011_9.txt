I found this movie in a lot of crash, but I'm happy. Kenneth Branaq's performance was close to Helena Bonham Carter's stealing, but stronger chemistry produced a more pleasing film. This film focuses on the excellent films he has with Branma, Emma Thompson. Carter's star, as well as young women with disabilities who want to succeed themselves here, have been as good as I've ever seen in a women's ward. It is difficult to describe the disability, but most of the time, his eyes only reflected his pain on the situation. If this movie appears after the films that have been attractive for women, Charlize Theron is "outraged" by Halle Berry, and I'm sure Carter would have had a great idea for Oscar. If I stay in the cube late in the night, trust me, it's worth falling asleep.
