<br /> <br /> Ealing does not deny that comedies are good, but this movie is the best for me. <br /> <br /> The basic structure of the film is part of a small part of the city of Pimlico, London, the United Kingdom. Then we follow the lives of the warriors to capture the treasure we found after the bombs exploded, and soon we get away from the black market traders that accept the liberation from England's law, and there is no rationing. <br /> <br /> When the government decides to close the border, they are fighting against the system when they are imprisoned on their streets. <br /> <br /> For their water and food, they have to ration water. In fact, before all these things start to get worse than evil, the place where spiritual progress is coming. They emptied all the food they thought they were destined to deliver and surrendered, they just responded to all the situations in London. There was a lot to do with sending food. <br /> <br /> This film was a perfect match, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren. It is not just right, very passionate, and the story morally does not force my throat. It's worth seeing
