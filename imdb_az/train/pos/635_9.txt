<br /> <br /> I went on a small show on July 19, without knowing more than the names of several actors and searching for some sort of fantasy / adventure. <br /> <br /> It's not really something I have ever seen, and a unique story is definitely praised by theaters or sooner or later. Although it may give the first impression, this cheese is not mixed, sticky or laughable, and is really fun and funny. The stream is very good, nothing is inevitable and will not be dragged. The soundtrack adds a lot to magic and movie, for better vocabulary, just silent, often in movies or on television. I did not stop watching the screen, even though I knew where it came from; <br /> <br /> In my opinion, no one left the theater. <br /> <br /> I understand why something is almost impossible for this movie and I'm not as bright as it is.
