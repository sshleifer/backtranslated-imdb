This is one of the funnier films I've ever seen. But there were moments, but they were attractive. it was a delight to watch the Altmanesque scenario, gorgeous physical humor and comfortable friendships, and could link it to most of the life. and I can say with Steve Carell's sake of honesty that I'm scared of for the breast ... it was really. Surprisingly, it is a kind, affectionate comedy about love and many of our relationships along the way. Catherine Keener was terrific as Trish and Steve Carell's all her friends were flawed, but lovely and very entertaining. Carellin's suspicion of being a serial killer is a cheerful metaphor for a 40-year-old sister. but the simpler truth was primarily to be in love. original, seductive and very funny. highly recommended.
