For a beautiful view of Andy Goldsworthy's sculptures, watch this movie and meet her with a full eye-catching and relaxing experience. Musical imagery perfectly complements, but does not attract attention. Some commentators have called for an interview with the artist's weak points, but consider this: how do you extend it in this movie if you read Andy's books for a long time or read one of his excellent lectures? This environment is more profitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artist's works and is used in that sense.
