You know, Robin Williams, by blessing him, is the religious classic of this decade, with all the unhappy comedies (except for Death To Smoochy, for which he had thrown a bomb when he left). Recently dramatized dramas, especially Insomnia and One Hour Photo, were fantastic. <br /> <br /> This night's listener is in the middle of the best work, regardless of mediocre assessments and fast DVD freedom. <br /> <br /> This is a serial killer or someone who is physically insecure for that matter. The film's concept is based on actual fraud that has not yet been officially confirmed. At school, I had a horrible abuse and eventually read a biography by Anthony Godby Johnson, an AIDS-infected child. I moved to the story until I read online reports that Johnson did not really exist. When I see this movie, Robin Williams in my mind is mixed feelings that are so vividly portrayed. <br /> <br /> Tony Collette, in the last place, also provides the best dramatic performance as sociological "caring". His role was far from those in movies like Little Miss Sunshine. He even looked at the camera he thought he was looking at. It takes a good actress to play a role, and Tony Collette is probably one of the best actresses of this generation (since 2008). <br /> <br /> The presence of at least one woman in this world is unbelievable, and it is very scary. <br /> <br /> I'm a good, dark film that I made this offer. Get ready to be tough, though at the end of this movie you are left with a strange feeling.
