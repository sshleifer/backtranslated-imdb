This is one of the biggest children's films created. Every time I say dove, I cry "Wait, Peter wait for me!" when the family car gets away. This is one if you love animals! The best movie! The lines in the movie are sometimes stupid. Sassi says Chance; "Cat rule and dogs drool!" I could do without such lines, but I liked this link because I was six years old. The storyline may look mixed into somebody, but I love it. The shadow of the old dog, who is preparing to take it when it's gone, is really moving when you think about it. She reminded me of a childhood dog. I think everyone can find a piece at Homeward Bound.
