*** Possible Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> Recently, I watched this movie with my 11 year old son and laughed at the right places and was delighted to see that he was excited about the move. Ron Ely is as accurate as Doc. He is tough, calm, almost always in control (and in his eyes with occasional shine). What more could he want? I've never read Doc Savage, so I do not know if I'm loyal to the source, but I like the light tone and sliding. Many people compared this movie to Lost Ark's Raiders. In my opinion, this is not fair. The budget difference is surprising (Raiders should have at least 10 times budget). Doc Savage Raiders does not have extensive work. Special effects are also at a minimum, but when it comes to people, the story is very entertaining and humor is just right. Sousa 's music is appealing (I love this theme - every time I watch the movie, ending the theme of the day with longing) The best way to approach this movie is the pleasure of RELAX. The magnificent five and the Doc include the exciting opening sequence, followed by the Indian sniper and the comic coincidence of the Doc and Captain Seas along the New York rooftops. A bad guy is not good when lying on a giant immigrant (really!) A great movie to watch on a generally rainy day. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... thank you Lord for being here!
