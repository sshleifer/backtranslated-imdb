Everyone who has lived for many years in South Africa has been subjected to racist oppression of the apartheid, which has completely taken over the Black population. One of the most famous apartheid activists was Steve Bico, who was killed in prison. After the murder, reporter Donald Vuds wanted to convey Biko's message to the world. <br /> <br /> In "Cry Freedom", Woods (Kevin Kline) meets Biko (Denzel Washington), his accusations. When Woods is trying to spread Biko, he and his family are in danger of being attacked and finally forced to leave the country. <br /> <br /> The last scene shows that the police opened fire on protesters. <br /> <br /> Cry Freedom, one of the two films to help galvanize the anti-adhesion movement, maybe the best thing for all participants.
