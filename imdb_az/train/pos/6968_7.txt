As the new BSG is not as expected by the original Serie A fans, Caprica can not afford what (most of) the new BSG fans expect. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the BGG's great CGI excitement, it will be very exciting. If you love drama, you'll probably find something you want and maybe even get to know each other. <br /> <br /> The story line explores how Cylons develops, hates man, and the origin of a tawhid society. Writers are struggling with the people 'play God (s)' and the creation and redeployment of 'human' life. <br /> <br /> According to some sources, it happened in many cases. My smaller share (or hopes) there may be some small inclusions in the BSG (beyond the back story I mentioned), but it is likely that the storyline will be very specific. <br /> <br /> Like the BSG, I have to wait and see that Caprica is growing up on me. But it is too early to say it. <br /> <br /> This is the previous series, but I'm ready to give it a chance. In general, I thought it was interesting enough to see how this actual array was before "throwing the towel."
