Tiempo de Valientes, a friendly action, tactfully adapts to the genre of the film, but overcomes its roots thanks to the great interaction between the perfect cast, its advantages and prominent photography. Diego Peretti, Detective Diaz (Luis Luque), assigned to investigate the two small-head crimes allegedly assassinated in arms smuggling, was appointed as a shotgun with a shotgun. Silverstein encountered stars. Diaz has been dismissed, but he is the best person in the business and should have professional psychiatric help to recover. Silverstein and Diaz soon found themselves in a conspiracy involving the Argentine intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separated them from an important point that Silverstein had to develop on its impressive encryption capabilities. Peretti and Luque are perfect together and the Peretti screen does not seem to remind Terence Hill and Bud Spenser, though Peretti is classic as the Hill is beautiful. Note that Tiempo de Valientes will not be welcomed for almost two hours or even for a long time, and writer director Damian Szifron is a potential successor to the film's attractive codex. Generally, a beautiful and very entertaining action comedy that does not get the least general confidentiality and insult your intelligence.
