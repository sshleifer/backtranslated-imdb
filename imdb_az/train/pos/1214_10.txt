Later, the Career has dropped more, and they can not come if True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse or Dark Heart are but they do not want to benefit from Dawn & John in terms of the club. After True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse, Dawn & John send back the camp. The club and cousin bears grew up to be ready to fight Dark Heart. In the end, the dark heart stole her legs and the children (Dawn & John) tell Christy that Dark Heart is bad. They work together to keep Care Beares. Then, True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse found the Dark Heart shade and returned home to find out where they were going. Children (Dawn, John, & Christy) came in but were not strong enough to stop Dark Heart. True Heart Bear & Noble Heart Horse Dawn, John & Christy released other care bears but Christy has the way and Dark Heart has come to help the magic hit.
