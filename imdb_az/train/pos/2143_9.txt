Other dance-related films are not the same. Several normal people found themselves in dance. Unlike the Hollywood dance movies, the characters of this movie are not beautiful and hot. They see you every day in your offices. They have some oppressors on their lives and finally find themselves and dreams in dance. This touches me very deeply.
