Thanks to Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart's father / son combination a very good Mann flashed. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comedy of Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He sees the young man's picnic or bending. "Mr. Dunston made a mistake." Jeff Webster (Stewart) only feels sorry for himself, but it is clear that he can not go beyond Brennan. John McIntire is honored with the truth according to the justice guarantees as the Skagway Law. Another major topic is helping people and, in turn, helps people. <br /> <br /> The title above claims that Tatum can not survive without coffee. This proves that nicotine dependence is fatal. Probably the first time and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I offer this movie and now I have a DVD.
