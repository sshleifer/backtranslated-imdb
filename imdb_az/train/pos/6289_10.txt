This movie has received many sticks. It was released by critics and was charged with breaking Nicolas Cage's career. People do not think it's episode, but rather a film's Oscars, but it's the only brilliant Bruck-buster movement. Rapid cars, fast editing and a great soundtrack - clarify what is said on the tin. Also a pure treat for anyone who loves cars. Everything is: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and Eleanor can not forget! I think it would be a good action movie and personally want to jump to finding a better movie! Then again maybe only me!
