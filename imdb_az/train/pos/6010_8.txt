"Zabriskie Point" (1970): It was especially interesting for me at a specific level, as in the same conditions of life, in the same conditions. Counter Cultural Movement in the late 60s and early 70s, beyond campus. We are slowly following two unrelated young people in separate stories touching each other. One is a young man in Los Angeles, and he is exhausted in classrooms and lunches in the campus of all the far-off, lying-revolutionary shepherds, and the other is Phoenix to see his father and employer, the "workman". The film is that young people in the Italian visionary (Michelangelo Antonioni) are "FULL" and that the era of self-righteousness is psychedelicrazies, "we know everything and change everything for the better". Who is the only "revolutionary"? What does it mean? Do you dress like someone and walk around? You "fly beneath a radar" but do you warn in advance? Have you talked about the task of protecting your plans without changing the group's consent? "Zabriskie Point" is definitely a "episode of the time" - it's packed with a call, a form, a bit of surreal movie (after all this is a movie by a man who called us "Blow Up" in 1966) and more. It offers options for a cultural revolution and goes to Antonioni (which seems to support it), and young people are attracted to see what they need for radical success. Therefore, it becomes a strong, scary movie for everyone, at any time, anywhere.
