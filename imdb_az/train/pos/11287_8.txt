As noted by other reviewers, this is one of the best Tarzan films. Unlike others, I like the beginning of the film, which gives a pretty clear idea of ​​how the trade pattern should be. Now there is a need for exposure, so why does Harry want to return to the woods? In addition, at the beginning of the film, it contains one of the most exciting and terrible follow-up sequences. This is Harry's safari group, and he has to flee from a tribal tribe. The pre-censorship values ​​add many things to realism, and describe the awful dangers awaiting the Europeans to enter the forest. The film is likely to be anecdecent, even though the local Africans have been treating them terribly, their network employers. In addition to sexy Jane, a thousand elephants, some great sets and two braces! An adventure classic should not be missed.
