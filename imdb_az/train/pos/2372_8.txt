<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Just this time my mother was brought back from America, followed by the negative he was afraid to explain here after saying, but yes, I say, the player is cute, some of the effects make it laugh. <br /> <br> However, it should be remembered that this was not in 2005, but 1898, and I thought it was very good for such a low budget. <br /> <br /> I liked this version much more than the Spielberg version I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I've read my book many times, and it is almost always in my "ahh yes, in the book" <br /> <br /> At least the good work has been done to fulfill the original version.
