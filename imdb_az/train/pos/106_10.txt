The first von Trier movie you see is waves of waves. I'm sure it's a beautiful movie, but it's definitely in the shadow of Europe. Europe tells a young German-American story that wants to live in Germany after the Second World War. He does a job organized by his uncle, as he flees to a luxury train. From his work, he almost abandoned Germany, met with the murder of the traitors, and hunted for members of the former Nazi Party. Society is subject to corruption. His practice, with sadness in the train, focused on his work and narrowed his understanding. The key characteristic is that the main character is suppressed by a group called "wolves" to help bombardment and terrorist attacks by bombing trains. The atmosphere is amazing. A person who is trying to put the viewer under hypnosis is then taken to the scene from the viewer, counting it to awaken you on a new scene. When you think you see a lot !!!!!!! european
