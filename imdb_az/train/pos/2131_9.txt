Every time I see him a better movie. There are many nuances in this regard. William Tracey, like Pepy, brings delicious, charming comic relief. Like Joseph Schildkraut Vadas, the film is only "villian" and its greasy charm is well-used here. Frank Morgan, like Mr Matuschek, the owner of the hood shop, makes a good impression, and the acquaintance is well-used here. Especially I liked the performance of Felix Bressart as Pirovic. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullivan is engaged in a prominent work that describes a few breathing, neurotic, but attractive and attractive women. <br /> <strong> This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart. The film is presented in terms of its rotating motion around it. Mr. Stewart is up to the task of film, with a great performance that uses many emotions. Just when Stewart is dismissed, we follow a misunderstanding. Shocks, anger, fears and shameful traumas that lead to an incident. In my assessment, James Stewart is the biggest filmmaker in the history of the Middle Ages. There is no other person who can not be captured in the film, but how much it feels to the audience. He was still the creator of this film, but he is a master of craft. Jimmy is one of Stewart's best films and one of the most beloved romantic comedies you can find. I especially love this movie for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
