I did not see this movie in the theater. I acknowledge that an anti-Vinnie Barbarino confessed incorrectly. Who was John Travolta to film? He remembers Oscar's release that Travolta was completely destroyed when he did not win. There were "real" actors on the run, how did they dare? I'm sorry, John, you won. I liked the whole movie after capturing this movie a year ago on the cable. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, Wes, all done fine. When I surf, I admit I do not want to go through it. I need to stop and watch. Over the years, I have learned most of the dialogue, dancing with my forefinger on my waist and learning more about Travolta. The only disappointment for me was the noise of part of Urban Cowboy music. "We are looking at love", but Urban Cowboy classics were full of noise. It should have been a double CD ........
