You can do a lot of money with a little money. Blair Witch proved that. This movie supports it. Length and complexity are not a sitcom. Nevertheless, he owns John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes, because he can not even prepare a dress that is not longing for the budget. The purpose of this film is as sincere as Arthur Lowe, Bambling Watson, his dimness and slow foil Cleese's quick tempered mind. If you run into any movies, look for an exciting laugh or two.
