Trying to be an epic adventure of the century. And with Sho Kasugi, a cast like Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, is really the perfect B-adventure of all time. This is really pretty fun, because it even draws your interests with its flaws. It should feel like the biggest movie for those who do it. In the 1990s, there is no modern feeling. There is more of the old Errol Flynn movie. The great adventure movie is still a great thing in Hollywood, but I'm afraid that these feelings will not depend on these old films. On the other hand, this is a sense of reality. You can not just hate it. I think it's a good adventure movie. And I really love the sound. Damn, I want the subject matter.
