Many super stars in this film (Gackt, Hyde and Wang Lee Hom are very popular singers in Japan). But do not judge before you wait, I said. In this film, Gackt and his staff worked very hard and hard. A good movie with a story that goes in. Several scenes may be entertaining, while others are very sad. He did so well until I did not expect it again. <br /> <br /> The story is very well written, but I admit that their deeds are very little disappointment. This is especially true for Hyde, because his abilities are the same as the other, and it is strange to hear the way of speaking native languages ​​(except for Japan) in another language. <br /> <br /> I think Gath is trying to show us how vulnerable a person can be when he loses the most important person in his life. When Toshi was killed, Sho Kei wanted Yi-Chei to turn him into a vampire because he would not let him die, Sho's brother died, Kei Shoot Son died, and the best and beautiful scene was Sho, and even Hyde's skills were still strange, but I would give him two touches on that stage! <br /> <br /> The reason for the plot is as fast as it is, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She was a good friend in the past, and Shaw is a local mafia bastard, and her son's Sho, <br /> Whatever happens, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a motion movie with a touching story.
