Although I'm pretty young, The Beatles is my ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE band! <br /> <br /> This is a movie that runs once. I can see why she was not released in the movie theater, but it's certainly a great movie to put on TV. I fought with the director of my TV and started seeing this movie, "John Lennon and Paul McCartney did not give much detail, except for The Jared Harris Stars, after the The Beatles collapsed. I did not hear anything from him (he played John) or Aiden Quinn playing Paul. But they are, of course, not infamous actors! <br /> <br /> The film's start was slow, but when it developed, I could see how good Quinn was, especially Harris's characters. As a magnificent fan, I know what my true Lennon and McCartney are. The script was brilliant and Harris Lennon's emphasis on accent, personality and mannerisms! Quinn played McCartney very well, and sometimes he made an emphasis on Ireland. <br /> The makers say they look perfect. <br /> <br /> This PARAGRAPH can be considered as A * SPOILER *. <br /> <br /> As I said before, it was slow, but soon became a sophisticated and quite emotional movie. I lost some time in the park and we have the character of both musicians. As for the Lennon's rough line at an Italian restaurant, it's absolutely unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Unlike some biographical films, The Beatles have never made the symbols that are really good and unlike the places they are popular and where they are popular. Mas. <br /> <br /> In a word, if you are a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney admirer, you can give your chance a chance. Only about a 95-minute movie is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> If you know that the meeting in 1976 actually happened, send it to the 'commentary page' for this movie.
