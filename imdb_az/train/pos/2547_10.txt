One, this gem, 1936 Invisible Ray, often does not get pleasure. But he can not forget it. The story is elegant. Mixed and confused in the retreat on the Carpathian Mountain, Carloff is the genius scientist Janos Ruh, who sings the ancient light shades to describe the events of the great geological past. Especially a powerful radioactive meteorite accident in Africa. The only elegant Lugosi (as a rare hero) who learns astro-chemistry is to join him. Frances Drake is a cute, unreasonable young wife; Frank Lawton's romantic temptation; <br /> <br /> The story is moving rapidly in bold episodes, and special effects are still awesome. It also contains some beautiful lines. A Spirit restores his mother's eye and asks, "My mother, do you see it?" "Yes, I'm clearer than ever, and what I see is frightening me." It's better when her mother, Ruh, says: "He violated the first science law." <br /> <br /> This film is, of course, a desert island material.
