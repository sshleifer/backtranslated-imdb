When I broadcast our local station in the summer of 1970, I shouted over my brothers and the Champions. We absolutely loved him. In particular, there was such an exotic and mysterious thing when re-operating ordinary America (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ...). <br /> <br /> The Avengers had similar feelings. (Although there is no surprise for being in the genre of English and spy / adventure). <br /> <br /> Now I would like to see him again - I hope he does. I promised others about this show, and no one had ever heard of it, so I started thinking about my whole existence. But the miracle on the web gave me the opportunity to watch this information. Hopefully, there will be fans of a new generation.
