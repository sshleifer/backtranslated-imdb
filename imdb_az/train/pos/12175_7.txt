What would you say about a man who wants to get married and a bachelor party with his closest friends at a Hawaiian boy bar? All smooth sails until he took the "bachelor hat". What can you say about talking to one of the dancers and then sleeping with him? What would you say if this exact girl was her financial brother? A new down, right? Well, Paul Coleman, in a way that Jason Lee sings, leads to a blurred blur and a new low driving experience. I must say that this is one of the best guiding tasks. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR/> <STRONG> </ strong> </ strong> </ STRONG> </ STRONG> </ Julia Stiles. When we return to our place of departure, Paul should direct the problem to another. He takes illnesses, fights with certain people and is secretly or "P.O'ed", "bowel movements" of any of the members of the family. "<br /> <br /> In general, A Guy Thing is very funny and that is, it's a mixed film, and it's a mix of CTV Brett Butt sitcom, Corner, and it's a mix of scenes that have long been forgotten, If Gas is a Canadian and a fellow fan, you would recognize a small role played by the same person Fred Ewanuick, who plays the hilarious Hank series. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
