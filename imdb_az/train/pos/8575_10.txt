This is a film that I can often watch and never tire of, and with Donald Sutherland there is a lot of laughs, weapons, action, crime, good liners, and a good plot. The role of many comedies as an Assassain. Tia Carerra always looks hot and can act too much, including Thomas Ian Griffin, the FBI agent played by DEA agent Max, Max, and John Lithgow's "Livingston" from Frazier on TV. The centers around Max and Diane are controversial with each other as they try to seize Livingston, and take on Assassain Sutherland, a mixture of all the good linen. The perfect criminal has a common love story, but played very differently than what you think by Carerra and Griffith. You also have a Russian mafia, Italian Mafia and Chinese Mafia, the film thrown here, the movie is shot in Boston, where there are a few great shootings, and local, in this film great photography and music, this movie can only be a epitome of a criminal comedy, a wish there is. Check Sutherland toilet on a certain scene, very unusual. this movie is a scandal and it's a tough 10 plus for me.
