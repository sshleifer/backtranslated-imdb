A perfect document. I personally remember to grow in NYC at the beginning of the 1980s. This movie is for everyone who is not around that time. This shows that Afro-American Gay Underclass is just something you feel and the love and perfection you see is real. People are still alive and, unfortunately, still alive. Balls are still in the nineteenth eighth place. He stayed forever. This is a good "homo thug" movie. The Queens is extremely proud of their extroverts. Happiness for Storyville is another era, but the whole film is documented too!
