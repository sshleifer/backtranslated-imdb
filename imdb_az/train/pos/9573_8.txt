HELP! Wow. If you think you're not tired of a movie, you did not see Dog Bite Dog. This film does not go away without showing any punches and pictures that are very disturbing. Like Sala, it shows us the dehumanization of the human soul. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red >> <br /> </ span> </ strong> <br /> <strong> I think it's an incredible clich√©. This is basically a worry and clever detective against a professional and sensitive stroke, in a cat and mouse game. Although the scenario offers something new on the surface, many questions about the dark side of humanity are given. Is violence really necessary? We must abuse the 5-year-old child without distress. In turn, when we protect our anger, people move less than old dogs, which is a sad reality. The director is a topic that explores, without limitation, a brilliant look. Apart from cats and mouse tracking, the script also develops two separate storylines for the main characters. One is love, and the other is salvation. Even though the scenario is not new, it is still beautifully written and always stuck to the chair. <br /> <br /> Acting is really good. Edison Chen as Hit-Man is incredible; he proves that it is not just a beautiful face. He is merciless, evil, and kind. Sam Lee is also outstanding as obsessed police. In short, the supporting castle is good. Music should also be reminded. It is very simple by Ben Cheung, with some effective light-hearted songs played in major dark moments in the film. Cinematography by Yuen Man is also really good. <br /> <br /> In general, this CATIII movie is highly recommended. It was a very good paced, incredible move, a very good goal, and in the end it was really good. However, many have noted that this is not a movie for everyone. If you do not give up violence, stay away from it. If you do not like to have serious negative emotions in the film, it's not for you. In the end, a powerhouse film, 8/10.
