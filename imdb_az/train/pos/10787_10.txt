When I was a little girl, I bought this movie as a gift and loved it. we would always watch it. When it comes to our comrades, we'll have a dream and we'll see great rock tea and dad magic toys. I'm 21 and still love this movie, some of my old friends and recently came together and watched, we knew all the songs and danced and talked about how much we hated Profester. A friend bought this movie and our father's magical toy for his 2 year old daughter because he wants to pass on our love for this film. This is really a movie that lets kids trace and safety, no violence, no bad language, and just lots of great songs and important lessons.
