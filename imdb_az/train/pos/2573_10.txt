When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends come together for a movie night, there's a recurring movie once in a while: K-911, you've estimated the third installment of a highly successful K-9 franchise at the top of everyone <br /> <br /> <br / <strong> <span style = "font-family: This has often been played, no joke! <br /> < Of course, we should only thank Tom Hanks for presenting us to the genre of the Favorite Cop-Dog, with Turner and Hooch; However, this film will not measure the excellence shown on all three K-9 movies. <br /> < Some ney-sayars say that belushi has evaporated with the 3rd movie of this series, Poppycock. <br /> <br /> For me, a third installment - direct-to-video, does not look like something to be expected Although you doubt, this quality movie was watched <br /> <br /> It is time to prove, but Belushi and his bare partner will still say the best performance - HOWLING with laughter! <br /> <br /> Some of the challenges are one of those thoughts. <br /> <br /> For some information, do not forget Puppy chow!
