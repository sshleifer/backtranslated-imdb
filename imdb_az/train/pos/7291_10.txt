You're usually afraid that you're trying to shoot a lot of people into the movie. There is no such situation in this case. <br /> <br /> Eric Etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of wrapped justice, and it helps to drive people in difficult situations to distress. <br /> <br /> In this short film, a young girl and a father give great speeches, but Eric's performance is definitely a showwalker in this story. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely going to make this movie bigger than the complexity, performance and all the stories.
