I liked the episode, but as I have seen, some quick reference should be made to the secretary, who is, in effect, actually punished. <br /> <br /> I love Columbo as an unexpected twist on an episode, its resolution should be part of the outcome of the episode along with the emergence of the killer. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk and Ruth Gordon are priceless. At some point where Gordon is a famous writer, the famous Lt. Making a statement because of being imitated by Columbo, he was shown a language of the real life glory of the detective as a criminal offense. This is one of the very best Columbo installments.
