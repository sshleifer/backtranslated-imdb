When I realized that Keira Knighteley was in that flick, I said, "I have to watch this movie." He is a undisputed main character, Domino, a bounty hunter. His "work", "no movement" scene teaches us, reflects his rebellion and his violent attitude to his life. I have to admit, for the first time, I'm going to watch an action movie that is far from the weapon of the most important scenes. So it was a bit of a strain on me. In any case, helicopters fall down for all John Woo fans, there's a lovely Keira who blows up, shoots like rain and shoots with two machine guns. The cast is completely brilliant. Keira, back in the movie, saw Mickey Rourke on the edge of Taylor, which is pretty much different from the favorite action we used to see, with his usual rifle face and his strong body. Christopher Walken improves his business as a reality show producer. <br /> <br /> Let's go to the content: this movie has a journalistic form. The presentation show is a scene. Everyone watching the load. . . you know, you can say that in these situations you are breathing air. He says, besides the producer, that Domino's mother, Domino's real life, should be a "garbage, no crime," "I do not consider it a crime." This movie lives a difficult life. Domino is from a world he does not want, Ed (Mickey Rourke), the bounty hunter is "not grace", Choco (the third son of the family) uses the words "edited Institutions" and Alf The driver / bomber from Afghanistan. This bunch represents human beings, some of which are "shirtless"; without exception, unhappy, fierce, and nothing to lose, but exhausting (as they think) their troubled lives. The film's presentation says "inspired by the true story ... more or less", so I can not tell you how true these things are. In any case, the explosions and the guns (which could have been "added" to classify the movie and classify it as moving film), the story of the characters is very real to be "edulcorated". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The psychiatrist does not have a lot to do with me (Lucy Liu was never curious about his acting career). It just represents the reason (and this one story) that Domino started to explain his story. Probably a movie with a lot of "pros", just "con". <br /> <br /> All this is not "SWAT". Characters are made; There is a personality, a form. There is a name and a surname (only "Gamble" and "Street"). The translation of a girl who almost died in a lifetime.
