Though it's a better movie at the 101 Dalmation (live action, animated version), I think it's still a bit short of what Disney can do. Good film was shot, the music was more suitable for action, and the effects were better (compared to 101). The player was probably better, but later his human heroes were later given the most appropriate role, and Glenn Close should not be missed as in the first film. It is brilliant. His poor spot and superfine furrier sidekicks, a wonderful hero to escape from the wonderful game and they showed us to Disney. This is a great family movie, a little or no free material and is still fun and interesting for adults and children. As with many Disney movies, it can be classic. The third is to hope that it will still be better. Because you know they want to do the same. ;)
