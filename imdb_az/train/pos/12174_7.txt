In my opinion, this film has about two minutes of really really funny moments and a very good trailer and many people came from the trader with expectations and this time film, trailer. Let's go a little longer and slide slowly to such an exciting place, and I'm talking about the comments of people who love / hate this movie. <br /> <br /> However, if I had not thought about what was going to happen and what was going on in this movie, I still think it is very good. Julia Stiles is an obvious star, she is very strange and careless, which is evident among everyone's compatibility, she only lights up and the whole audience is in love with Lee. Of course, Lee's full-testosterone staff, his elegant mother-in-law, brother-in-law Jim and his bride-all, follow Stiles's sake of matching and compliance stereotypes. First of all, it differs. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a source of disappointment. <br /> <br /> The film itself is still a very funny, intelligent film, despite a little surprise and a few jokes that are not as fun as a writer. The theme of compatibility and "safer route" fit into several layers. For example, if you can imagine scenarios but listen to a radio program on the highway talking about everything that does not make any move until the last scene, or how everything is alright and how everything is cool and <br /> <br /> Julia Stiles 's symbols are a safe choice from one person's subject, and one has been reflected in the risky choice. Another good thing about the film is a comic comedy. Jason Lee is forced to keep his way through the movie, and with someone luck (eg, a pharmacist boy is a good chef) and part of the foolishness. <br /> I was not as funny as I expected, and there was a little twisted talent, but it's still a good movie.
