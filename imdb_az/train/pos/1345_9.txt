When asked by the British Film Institute that Martin Scorcese created an American part of the century's Cinema series, he had the opportunity both hands. <br /> <br /> Personal travel through American films is a very personal look at the Hollywood cinema, such as attractive, extensive and titular. <br /> <br /> Scorcese's story is primarily about Hollywood directors? actors, producers, screenwriters, and other collaborators speak only one word. He believes that the main conflict in the film industry is the vision of the CEO and the distributor's profit motivation, between art and commercial viability. He even opens one of the first films to investigate this controversy with Vincente Minnelli's "The Worst and Best" clip. This documentary structure dictates. Scorcese sees how dark the genres are and how the cliches are challenged, how the producer code challenges the production code, and how it falls from the grace of certain filmmakers when it is difficult to be different. However, Scorcese has never been an auteurist trap to dismiss the directors of the studio bosses (who praised Cecil B. De Mille) or those who are more renowned, but the artists of the movie masters. / Scorcese does not necessarily pay attention to his favorite directors (Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock, two of Scorcese's greatest effects, just mentioned). Instead, he looks at films that tell people and his story. For example, he shows us the sequence of John Ford films to show how the West is developing. Vincente Minnelli (probably the most referenced director of the documentary), believes that a genre of music can also cause darkening. Imagine that this task was not limited to America, Scorcese would also like to talk about his Italian influences or English hero Michael Powell. Also, FW Murnau extends the definition of American movies for immigrant filmmakers such as Billy Wilder and Douglas Circus, as well as Hollywood movies as well as US-born movie artists. Like Stanley Kubrick. <br /> <br /> In addition to simply telling Hollywood's chronological story, Scorcese compares movies from different backgrounds to fight different topics. Comes with DW Griffith in his movie language and instrument, looks at the sound, the color and the appearance of the large screen, and inevitably ends the computer, Scorcese was willing enough to keep up with George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola clips. However, it is not like ending the chapter here. <br /> <br /> Low-cost cats are back in the 1940s to show how a horror can achieve effective results from the simplest and cheapest elements. <br /> <br /> American Films become one of the best movie documentaries. There were many prominent directors and pictures that I have never found, even the most sophisticated movies of movie enthusiasts will find something new in a wide range. Scorcese also restored his balance to forgotten or degraded pictures. Speaking about Kubrick in the chapter "Iconoclasts," I was delighted to look at Lolita and Barry Lindon because I was looking at two of her best films. Scorcese's respect for the media is displayed in such a way as to allow the clips to play just the smallest bits, and cut them off with only the conversation leaders (archives and newer interviews) when needed. There is a slight approach to the 40s and 50s, but this is not a difficult thing because Scorcese is a time when growing and filming. <br /> <br /> In some of these films, I did not think it would be a documentary if there was no personal journey in this documentary. <br /> Just a few spoilers.
