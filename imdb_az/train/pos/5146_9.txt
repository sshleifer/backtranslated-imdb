I came from a position of myself as a man born to a German mother and a British father (for five years in a war camp). On one side of the family, the capture of various Nazis and other WW2 winners. These miniseries can not access every part of the Hitler's mind and give the audience a general flavor of the situation and best reflect Hitler's position. This series is very good. Like Carlyle O'Toole, Hitler likes to learn more about relationships with others because he does not do anything. People around him often answered questions without question and, of course, without questioning his deadly career. What was Goebbels, Goring, and Hessen? It would be helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope that we will explore this subject more and more people. It is also possible for people to understand why someone like Saddam Hussein will not be allowed to remain in power.
