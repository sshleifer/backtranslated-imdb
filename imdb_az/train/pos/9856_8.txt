(spoiler ??) <br /> <br /> I was not sure what the film would think. Not a very childish film. A parent must be followed with death and death. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that it was a little fun to me. <br /> <br /> I was a little surprised at 81 minutes. (loans even less) and the trailer gets you to think that the rodent is alive. But, unfortunately, they torture him. Towards the end of the movie. These two torture movies drew 2 stars. But I'm coming to the movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;">
