<br /> <br /> Welcome to Trinity. The perfect little Mayberry place is a little different. The sheriff is really Satan. There are spoiler. <br /> <br /> At the same time, this is not all. It turns out Satan is a son of Caleb. Some people try to keep it well, but it's a terrible battle. Sheriff Buck (Satan) knows who Caleb is and loves to spend time with him teaching his dark paths. Magnificent. Sneaky. He is not always bad. Often a hero. Everyone owes him great kindness because he often creates a catastrophe and ends them. <br /> <br /> In one of my favorite episodes, Lucas and Caleb appeared in the woods in a cabin. some children with guns decided to rob them. Lucas used it as an excuse to teach Caleb a bad lesson. <br /> <br /> The robber (Ted) hesitated to shoot them. Lucas Calebe said Ted had half conscience. If he had no conscience, he would hit them now. Had he been a true conscientor, he would never have been a criminal. So he called Half-Ted. It was very funny. He was surprised by the criminals. And, of course, 10 steps ahead of Half-Ted, of course. And, of course, it was always under control. <br /> <br /> The documentary about the author of the article was one of my favorite horrors of all time. Twilight Zone Night Stalker Scarecrow American Gothic Supernatural <br /> <br /> This is a good company.
