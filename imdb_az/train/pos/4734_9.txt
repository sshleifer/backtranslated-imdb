I am Jet Li's massive admirer! He is the best HK motion movie star ... and therefore - this movie is shaken! I saw him at the video store and, as it was in the main section of the main video store, I did not sign up and wanted to look twice. Immediately I knew that I would rent it. My only qualm (I suppose I was expecting it) is called (AAARGh) and not subtitled. Of course, the original / amazing / cool imagination and actions of the film have turned into one of the better films of Jet Li ... even if they fall into that category ...
