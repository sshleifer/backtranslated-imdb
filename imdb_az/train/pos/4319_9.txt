The first time I watch this movie for the first time, I love it. These nuances and perception of life are quite common and often frightening, but we pay attention to the slightest incidents in our life, which we rarely raise to a height that we normally offer the shortest suggestions of attention. Here, the film has become a jogger when it comes to celebrating these events, hearing a truck driver and his client, and hearing the screams of the baby's sacks. Dialogue, moving, casting and direction are superior. No fourth, no great verses. What I'm looking at is the truth about the nature of the characters and how their lives developed when they were celebrated. Kudos is involved in all this, and in our lives, we need more "Great Canyons." 10 to 9 o'clock.
