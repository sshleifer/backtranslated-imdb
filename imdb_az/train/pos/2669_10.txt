This story, built in Wellington, New Zealand's suburban Tawa-famous Tawa College, is the first feature of McCarten. <br /> <br /> In the context of the family, with the taste of contemporary New Zealand adults in completely excited situations with Via Satellite. <br /> <br /> At the same time, he invites strong feelings of sensitivity and hopelessness. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving and amazing films of the year is not to be missed!
