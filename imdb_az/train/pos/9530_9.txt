Conrad Hall came out with a bang. A great movie photographer, before the past, finished his famous career with this movie. <br /> Of course, in the game played by Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, the player is, of course, not bad! The amount of movement here is also true: not so much; very few. <br /> <br /> As Hanks is a professional cunning man for Newman's City Manager, none of the characters here are clearly "good guys." Hanks does not want to make a young man like him, just to increase his quality, though he teaches robbers to be illusory! Huh? <br /> <br /> Because the movement is good and the story is as exciting as the real star of this movie is a scene from a beautiful scene with the lens, dazzled by the cinematographer Salondur. His work was just awesome.
