Call me foolish, but I loved the 2001 fear movie, My Sweetheart. It's well-prepared, well-written, well-directed, well-directed, and so on. Everything was fine about it! Completely horrible and creepy (Paige's death) and simply heart failure (the first scene) were quite funny (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com). In my opinion, a great deal of all the shooting, especially the three leading roles: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (also very nice people in the filming) and Marley Shelton. <br /> <br /> I call this movie "another Scream clone". This movie is in no way a Scream clone. In fact, this movie works on rings around Scream. In fact it is SENSE! Scream is not just a movie for a masked killer. Forgive me, but Scream was also a clone (ahem ... Friday, 13, Halloween and many other scary movies also featured masked killers). I also think that the kubik masked killer is brilliant. It's strange to see a sweet, cubic face that makes all these terrible things. Another innovation (nasal bleeding) provides a fantastic ending! Every time I see it in the end I'm shaking !!!!! So, even if you did not like it for the first time, look at Valentine and give it a chance! <br /> PS- My new web site (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG) !! Soon...
