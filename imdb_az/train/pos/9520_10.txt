This is a beautiful movie. True tales of his father and son's garden. So much, Tom Hanks is the best. Tom Hanks left the box of this movie. She's usually a nice guy. But in this film it seems a little gritty, but still the last scene is smelling as a rose until her character assassination. The laying of this film was a good place. Tom Hanks's character, I feel when there is a complete silence when he kills and kills all Mr Rooney's men. There is no sound on that stage, just a feeling. I know of Paul Newman's character as he realizes that Tom Hanks's revenge has been revenge and his destiny comes to life before he can see it. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time, I was blown up and knew I had to go out and make a video, because I'm adding to my favorite collection of all time movies. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is my favorite actor, this movie has a special place for me.
