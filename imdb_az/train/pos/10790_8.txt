From Walker, Texas Ranger, this incredible flick of the series contains some of the most incredible scenes you've ever seen in a television movie. In addition, a get-go result can be predictably predictable. But there is a fun movie that works: fun. All this involves doing and doing so. Stunts and explosions are entertaining and exciting, and the area is not bad at all. Acting is also good, it's not a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is not Steven Seagal. If you are an admirer of the genre (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you will definitely love it. If not, do not waste your time. 8/10
