I'm very pleased with this movie. I thought there was a very good political tension on something that had not happened before - a secret service agent entered the worst and conspiracy area. Unfortunately, according to Michael Douglas's character, "Pete Garrison" is said to be a mole, but not it. <br /> <br /> She is an ethically disrupted agent with her first lady! <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> It has to go with the nickname "Garrison". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Douglas does a great job in this role. I always do not care about the people I play, but I'm not a great player. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is equally good (at least here) as the friendly SS director who hunts Douglas until he tells the truth. Then, both of them work together in the final, then tap and then stop. Followers are also interested. Also, I have never seen and never regretted - I see the first lady who looks good like Basinger. It's just an entertaining fun reel of fun. Are there holes inside? Of course; Probably many of them and a reason for many critical comments. But here it was unjustly buried. It's not smart enough for the geniuses on this site. My advice is: cold, just go for a ride and enjoy all the movements and entertainment. Yes, it's a bit Rambo, but on the contrary, it has the highest levels of entertainment ..... all of these are movies.
