The film was watched by many young people who watched the film in the TCM and were very young, as well as with Myrna Loy at Philo Vance's Thin Man Series. In 1930, William Powell played in the Philo Vance series, and a well-known veteran actress Mary Astor (Hilda Lake) was one of the suspects in the murder / suicide case, where Archer Coe (Robert Barrot) was dead and Archer was in a room inside. Ralph Morgan (Raymond Wrede / Archer's Secretary) was a great assistant and was the brother of Frank Morgan, who appeared in The Wizard of Oz in 1939. Eugene Palette (Detective Sgt. Heath), along with these Philo Vance films and Errol Flynn, also featured a great performance at Robin Hood. I always remember that at least the actor could be a very good killer. Enjoy a great classic from the past.
