When I read Hamlet for the first time, I do not think AGAIN FORTUNE, saying that Bette Midler was uncertain, put in play and said, "Give Romeo every day." Does a man wanting to kill his uncle has five orders? It seemed to me to be very good. But when I read more, I felt that the game was really appreciated. I saw the Olivier and Gibson movie versions (and part of Nicol Williamson's version) and all of them get the Olivier model; Melancholic Dane. Olivier at least did not do it himself, but Gibson and Williamson, "Look, I'm moving!" school. <br /> <br /> Here's the version of Kenneth Branak that breathes before the end. In the top ten of 1996 (Behind the English Disease, LONE STAR, JERRY MAGUIRE, FARGO, SECRETS & LIES, everyone likes you, ACTION, BIG NIGHT and RICHARD). and put the best Hamlet and perhaps the best Shakespeare film. No doubt, his talent as a filmmaker who does not lose interest in the 70m diameter and four hours to prepare a full-length version of Branag is great, but he plays a major role despite discussions on the film. It was my best performance of the year. Brana misses the melodrama of actors playing Hamlet as a regular, regular person, and recognizes his movements and feelings at every step of the way. Unlike Olivier, Branag uses his whole body to show Hamlet's passion, but as it plays normally, none of them look like a d√©cor. <br /> <br /> The remainder of the remainder is also the upper hinge. I did not think of Jack Lemmon, though he was the weakest player in the world. The most striking shift Charlton Heston; I've always found it harder as a board, but the player is pretty much as ordered by King. Another great surprise was Billy Crystal; I thought I would find all the mistakes as the First Officer, but it was his funny thing when he was characteristic. All this is a glorious movie!
