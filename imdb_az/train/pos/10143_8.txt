It was a great episode, one of the best of both season. For a change to the right fright, if there is such a thing, with a story that is a way higher than average MOH episodes. A man is killed by an accident in a tragic car where his wife is in his driver's car. His airbags worked, and he did not. It is burned outside of recognition (big makeup btw) and does not give you much chance to live without a full skin color. BUT, though, in a coma, he dies, but he is brought back with modern technology and his dreams look like a very strange soul when he dies in just a few minutes. Of course, treachery, as well as extremely bizarre crimes, and extremely sexy scenes. What else can you ask for? Yes, it is not so much because this baby has all and many satirical ends, most audiences should give a smile on their faces. And I liked the direction of Rob Schmidt (The Wrong Return), and there is great skill for horror. The perfect episode, this is my one purchase.
