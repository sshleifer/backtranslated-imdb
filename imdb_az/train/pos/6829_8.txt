Gena Rowlands plays an actress who lost her grip when she was a witness to her death. He is increasingly deceived by the truth, and in the end he acts as a actress in his emotional turmoil. Taking into account that he violated all the rules and gave birth to everything, he still (a little self-preserving) in a parallel, as Cassavettes fought his own film to attract his audience. There is a lot of thoughts thrown around and eventually a bit complicated (I still think of the relationship between deadly fan and Rowlands, among many things), but the way in which they are presented in their race form is an interesting and thought-provoking movie. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to have a double bill with the Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
