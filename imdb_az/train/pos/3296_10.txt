Mina Kumari demonstrates more style and grace, just walking from her feet, and most of the other movies. The director has prepared more beautiful touches than it seems perfect. Music and dance have the highest quality. You can differentiate between the first dance in the background of the director: the other girl dance, a drunken ladder, a lot of action, but she knew we would watch the Mina dance, and I did not talk to you again and again, this time you did not feel. All this, perfection.JQ
