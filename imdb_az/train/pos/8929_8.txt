First of all, I liked the '' intruders' ', others'' Fragile Self ', at different levels - mostly the subconscious, sometimes more central allegorical places. In fact, in the film all the guilty are everywhere: in the Swiss-French border, where the pretentee lives alone; its recurring day and night; in the patient's body after a heart transplant ... In the last half of the film, he returns to the ancient French colony with the hope of renouncing the past. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, the voice is not very painful, it is full of regrets and guilty, and the sense of failure is much or less. It's a terrible picture of an old man, who seems self-reliant, but in a desperate gap. Changing makes up more images to convey more sense of anxiety and desire than any open source. Some are absurd and deprived of humor, but absurdist is only logical.
