I liked the city, though I liked it very much. When Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly are coming, I'm a new friend. I have heard from them, though recently I have not seen anything with them. The first saw was Singin in the Rain, which made me Gene's admirer. I think this is better. But I thought that this movie was good and there are some parts that are better than others, but in my book this is a beautiful movie, and I love it. Frank and Gene make a good band. I still have Ballgame to gather them together. But I like my weapons that I really love and love it!
