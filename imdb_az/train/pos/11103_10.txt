Television's "grandfather" is different from each other, except the symbols of acclaim and nudity. Tony Soprano is forced to go after a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. Her psychiatrist learns that Tony really is part of two families - she is a perfect husband even though she is a loving father, and the other family is a miserable foolishness. After the analysis, Dr. Melfi comes from Libya, his mother, suspected of having Tony's problems really a border-personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightly praised as the main character; has not yet been well-known for both psychiatrists and mothers as Bracco and Marchand for their equal and talented performances. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are liked for their brilliant supporting role. Van Zandt (E-Street Band) plays Tony's best friend as his first and only role-playing and is convincing and latching. Chianese plays Tony's uncle who is a recurring actor in a fusion film, and plays ten and off nemesis. Many admirers loved the characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "good", but not remarkable (except for the "second" episode in Iler's last-last episode); Sirico and Schirripa are very disturbed and overlapping, but the show is too powerful to return them. <br /> <br /> Official opening ceremony of the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 was held.
