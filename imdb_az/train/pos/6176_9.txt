In 1986, the Spirit TV film was a pilot for a possible number. However, the creator of the Spirit, Will Eisner did not like the film, and therefore, no serial production was produced. I thought it was a very funny movie, and we took the comic's spirit with a modern twist. I'm sorry that this was not a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was the perfect Spirit. Nana Visitor was a beautiful Ellen Dolan and, of course, would go to Star Trek later: Deep Space Nine years later. Maybe by Frank Miller's release of the great screen of the Spirit more and more people will see this rare ship of the Spirit's history. Apparently, when Hollywood filmed a character or thought that was already created, someone else would find and release the previous version of the previous version of the property to win a few dollars. When Antonio Banderas closed the Zorro Mask, we were able to get the previous version of the masked hero on the DVD as the great Alain Delon version of the 1970s (though all the copies I have seen are not corrected). An esteemed one hopes to soon release the TV's TV adventure.
