When the Chamberlain family camps near the Australian Ayers Rock, Lindy Chamberlain sees her baby drifting from her tent with a dingo and begins with a difficulty that no one should ever live. The story of Dingo was incredible by the public or the press, and the whole thing turns into a vinegar. Lindy does not help the jury or the courtroom to play alone, and it is a strange one, because everyone thinks that he is guilty every day, because there is no evidence that has come to light. Sam Neill is perfect as the Seventh Day adventist pastor Michael Chamberlain who has faith and doubt about his wife. Since the Australian public just does not believe in the flames of the story and the media, it is good to see people as well as in other countries as well as immoral and stupid (or worse) than in other countries. Finally, Lindy was found guilty and sent to prison for hard work, but a few years later he was missing, and he was released, but after the family's life was largely destroyed. A heartbreaking story is very good, a little long, but worth seeing. 10 to 8.
