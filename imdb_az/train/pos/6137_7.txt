This is a beautiful gem. An unusual story that is entertaining to watch. Yes, he sings, but the story is very well prepared and heard very melodic. It was very pleasant to watch; From start to finish I liked it! <br /> <br /> During the Second World War, a film is being shot in the UK. This is about an apprentice witch looking for the missing part of a spell. She uses rough "magic" to drive her and her children to different places to care for. They are united with their schoolteacher and are surprised to learn that the lessons from the school actually work! <br /> <br /> Special effects may seem a bit primitive, even though you use them once, they are attracted to the attraction of this movie. In fact, the movie won the Oscars for these effects! <br /> <br /> It is difficult for the film to be innocent and entertaining and not to love tuneful songs. Heroes are interested to watch. I think anyone at any age can find something about this movie.
