The comedy behind this movie was fantastic for comedy. Many of the scenes appear to be a funny book and much darker than I expected (not visually, wise). Of course, this can not be a very funny movie, especially because it's too small for you to enter into many sexistic jokes (like Mary or American Pie in comparison with others). As you wait for it again, some jokes are eye-catching and entertaining. If you ever read a comic book or watch a comic book type movie (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and you liked them, you will enjoy the delicate humor that is going on throughout the film. You do not like them, but you like the respectful laugh of this movie. If you love this movie, there are some cool additions on the DVD. (8/10)
