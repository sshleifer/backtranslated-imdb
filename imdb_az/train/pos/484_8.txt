Alexandr "Sascha" John Turturro, a leading chess player in the attempt to return to a tournament hosted by Italy. His grace is undoubted, but its chess-related decision has led to the development of all aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a wonderful surprise to her husband, Vera (Geraldine James), who came to the same application to cover possible marriage partners. Vera focuses on an attractive number, but admiringly, Natalia is surprised by more than Sascha, and she is on the picnic. Sascha is drawn to Natalia and offers a second marriage. But should Natalya's heart be concentrated with what Sascha should give to chess matches and still cause problems with the past in the past? Oh, and can he be a chess champion too? A beautiful film based on Nabokov's novel. Imagine, Watson's beautiful little girl and Turturro's astonishing perfection is as beautiful as a shy chess enthusiast. Like a brave mother and other castle members, James gives a very good turn. As for the appearance of the film, it could not have been better. The decor is different from the type of eye that you put, the grape suits are brilliant, and cinematography is worthy of praise. Yes, the story is unusual and sometimes explains by using flashbacks, making a movie that will thank everyone. Then, the end is bittersweet. But if you love romance, period numbers, excellent player, Nakhchivan scene or fine art of cinema art, do not miss it. You are protected against resistance to excess weight.
