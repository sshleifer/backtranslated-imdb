A very interesting documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, consisting of animal sculptures taken from the elements of the age. Rocks, leaves, grasses, ice, and other things occur when it comes to the river or waves in the wind. Done. Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works are not really like photographs or movies. Now one can argue that Goldsworthy's works are either mortality or a description of words, but it is not easy to say what he's doing is just fine art. The stereotypes associated with artists are quite bitter, ambitious, and often foolish, and Goldsworthy appears to be contrary to one another: a person who loves nature and loves life, stabile, unpretentious, is a small village in Scotland (of course, his works are fluffy or superficial I'm convinced that some people in the world of imagination have the same reasons for disrupting this).
