I chose this movie in my local library. At the end of last year when I met the director at the film festival, I was forced to "check" her case. I am pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film looks fresh in terms of familiarity in terms of love, blasphemy, friendship, jealousy. Sometimes it may be a "talk", but regardless of the film's fall. <br /> <br /> This is a contrast between the medium budget and the average budget. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify; shooting" is quite different from black movie Check it out If you're lucky, your copy comes with a soundtrack like me.
