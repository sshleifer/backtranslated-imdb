I watched it several years ago. <br /> <br /> I remembered it as many mysterious situations and many of the melancholic things that Dorothe's fate and personal future of Bogdanovich were. <br /> <br /> I'm looking at a copy of VHS and then review it. and more. I'm currently waiting for the DVD version at any price! <br /> <br /> Country and easy listening music is first, second, blue, and happy. /> <br /> All the heroes are a great sight for me, funny situations, excellent activities, and many dialogues that transform me into a cult movie, and many people who are on the internet or movie theaters are very nice to me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I know that this movie can be a special comment, but I love it, so I will never forget it.
