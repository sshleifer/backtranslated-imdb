The 34-year-old suddenly begins telling me I'm a widow. I was devastated as unhealthy - it suddenly died coronary - its carotids exploded - died behind our house. There were many speculation from the police, he fell into something and pushed his head. I was a suspect who had been killed prior to the crash. <br /> <br /> My children were so traumatic that he was betraying a good father. I had three small children, did not study, received financial support. I was very, very hard. <br /> <br /> For two years, my fianc√©s attacked me from verbally, physically, emotionally and morally, did not sorrow in front of children and put masks and showed people what they want to see, show them my pain at holidays ... No one for me choosing and choosing my choice, of course, a grief-therapist, who sees my heart and soul to follow my spirit. I did not have a grandchild! Regardless of my relationship with them, I have never returned. What an example of disrespect for the grief! My husband (new) saw me when I talked about trauma when my husband shared my soul. I'm hiding, I can not breathe, I'm not hyperventilized, and it's a few days if I try to convey a secret pain. <br /> <br /> Now about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today, my spirit has been raised, my heart is broken. My fear and pain re-emerged from the real jinn that this movie presented; How sad it is to compare with how others expect us and inside the demons inside. Adam Sandler perfectly describes the most terrible suffering that you encounter, the most victorious and, most important, of your own time! This film has deepened all the pain I tried in years to deal with. As you can see, if something deeply damages your soul, deep thoughts are all things that come out of your mouth, dead in a dead state and you can not deal with it without wanting to walk. <br /> <br /> In the Bible, Romans 8:26 states that when God does not know how to pray for my mouth and spirit, the Holy Spirit of God brings this punishment to God's feet - It is not necessary to speak. Sandler described it to perfection! <br /> <br /> There is a scene that has been brought to trial, she goes back to meet her mental health commitment and her father-in-law (familiar to me) --- She said that the surprising truths that happened to you would not reach them. This is a very powerful and powerful performance. I started to suffocate and had difficult moments after leaving the theater where the sisters thought the body was too weak. My son was with me and when I tried to keep them all together, my first hand saw exactly what I was doing; A lesson for him, at least he remembers his father. It has been for me for 13 years, but this film brought me back to my reminiscence, demanding that my wishes give up my desires instead of a mask and my respect. <br /> <br /> I am writing this, if you are a fan of this movie, you are ready for this movie, but you recommend the 1000-Star Sandler performance at a high level. <br /> <br /> If you are not a griever yet, please take a lesson from her movie and simply listen to and accept the people's choices in her heart, find peace in your own time! Sometimes the soul can not say the words to convey our pain. <br /> <br /> Go to this movie with tissues and prepare for the soul without getting ready!
