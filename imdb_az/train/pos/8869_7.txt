In this little movie, we have some great characters, but there are many areas. Singleton is truly beautiful because it does not see a great deal of esoteric conflicts and interpersonal relationships. This is forgotten by the audience for realism, which is not the case for this movie. In fact, what is here is the possible clich√©s and stereotypes that can be put in a celluloid higher than one soap. Of course not a deep film (even if it wants to be), but better than an average college movie.
