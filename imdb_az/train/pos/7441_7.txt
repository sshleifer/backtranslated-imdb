Personally, I deceive Jerry Springer, but I found Ringmaster to be the most funny I've ever seen. The unfinished satir of "guests", which began at Jerry Springer's opening scene, laughs throughout the film. Jerry Springer, despite a brief scene showing a weak attempt to justify his existence, I'm definitely coming to this movie for the perfect entertainment cost.
