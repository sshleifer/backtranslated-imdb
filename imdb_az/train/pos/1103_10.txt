This movie has the biggest comedic dialogue and memorable quotes gathered in a movie! The area is somewhat short, but it is enough to create a delicate quiz. This is a film for all ages, convinced of your request. Cinematic art form is very entertaining; and with great stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas ... how can you go wrong? <br /> <br /> Such a comedy dialogue and time has not been evaluated for a long time and it is very difficult to imitate. A good example of this is seen in the 1986 film, Tom Hanks and Shelley Long, in the Money Market. Despite the talents and physical comedy of these stars, the film was drifting and poor views and follow-up comments. Achieving the right comedic dialogue is an art.
