First, I'm not a Justin Timberlake fangirl, but I'm not even a great Justin fan, but I did it like this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in a video and saw a big pen that I did not hear what it was. Justin did not behave badly, it was the worst of the band, but this is a very powerful group with two names, Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott, who did not appear on the first list of credits. The story is basically a journalist who found corrupt police, but I saw it well. The character of L L Cool J was obviously overlapped, but I did not know exactly what to do in the end. Morgan Freeman, as always, was just some sort of good mentorship as well as my favorite mentorship and Kevin Spacy. <br /> <br /> I thought Dylan McDermott would perform the best performance as a murdered police officer. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was confused by the persuasive and really characteristic issues several times. <br /> <br /> I'm really looking forward to many unpleasantness to be honest. Terrible catchphrases, unsuccessful movement schemes, something like that, but it was a surprising good thing, and I could not find anything. <br /> <br /> Each shot had a point, it was not really a clich√©, but really strong. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, it's a great game that interests me and works quite efficiently. I do not know why it did not appear in theaters, it was better than some garbage I saw on the big screen. I say it worth seeing.
