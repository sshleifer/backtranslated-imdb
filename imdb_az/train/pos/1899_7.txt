Arthur Bach needs to grow up, but unfortunately he is not something he needs to do. According to her very rich father, Arthur had to marry a wealthy Susan Johnson or his family's money (worth $ 750 million). The problem does not love Arthur Susan (although he is a good chicken) and fell to the top of the heels only for the waitress and part-time shopkeeper Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting man. She is really a great guy who is enriched with at least one person every day after every second. Only Arturu sits in the wrong way - he likes to have fun, to love and drink. Drinking Arthur gives the Jekyll-Hyde complex; and it makes it all the trouble, it's not fun to watch on the screen. Dudley Moore won the Oscar nomination and won Golden Globe for her performance as Arthur in this film. Moore transforms fantasy, funny lines into the unforgettable comedy gold, with funny features of the movie, but Arthur's down to a relative level and likes his character. Moore's co-star department has some help - Liza Minnelli is as big as Lina, Arthur is lonely, and John Gielgood Arthur is like Butler Hobson. Gielquid won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and why so much. Hobson has a dry grace with a stone and has maintained his attitude, but always looking for Arthur - and perfect in the role of Gielgud. Steve Gordon's 1981 film Arthur is short and straightforward, but laughs too much.
