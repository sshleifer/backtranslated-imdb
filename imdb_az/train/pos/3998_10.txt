I missed this movie in a movie and discovered it by the advice of a friend last weekend. I can honestly say that I can not remember another intimate dramatic film that improves many other things. Writing is precise, realistic, nuanced, and even limited. Cinematography and editing are simplified, but inspired by the visual story making great impressions and illustrations dominate with the most memorable ways of solitude and lying. The actor is also beautiful, with all the characters being pitiful and sensitive in the most effective ways a movie can offer. They reveal the smallest weaknesses of raw material, which are not defended. Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi and a real victory for the rest of the team. A serious movie lovers need to see.
