In my opinion, this is a pretty good celebrity skit show. I'm so glad to see Greg Kinnear as the host. There are many reasons I have to say. Although Hal Sparks is a good host, I sometimes wish Greg Kinnear would not be separated. If you ask me, it will not be any longer with any television show anymore. Still, I love those who crush different homeowners and others. If you ask me, it was very funny. Before I get this up, I must say that I love this show very much. And now, as a result, I'll give all your show to the fans of the severe sketch show. You will really enjoy it.
