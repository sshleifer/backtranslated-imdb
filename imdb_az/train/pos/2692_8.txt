I'm very glad to watch this movie. Bigas Luna, born in Spain, has a great deal of direction. <br /> <br /> Luna is once again exploring a target, a young boy's loss for women in this case is the milk. This story has some psychological concepts like the rejection complex that felt when a great-grandmother's brother was born. The sudden loss of instant milk to the youngest child in the film causes the loss of a young boy. So she tries to find a nipple that can feed her. <br /> <br /> This film is found in a recent woman and is here from the film. <br /> <br /> This film is in the form of more stories, the spectrum has certain moments (memorable moments) and certain symbols (the film usually means something of a thorough analysis of everything that takes place). The surrounding landscape, typical of the region, characteristic characters, symbolic and sophisticated sounds by Nicola Piovani, are not parallel to the real world but are of another dimension, but it is worth it to watch this movie from time to time, even in the end, and in moments even if we are a little ill with the misery and excessive vulnerability ... <br /> <br /> I am very pleased with the hero's activities ... 8/10
