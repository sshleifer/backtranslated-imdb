I am a parent of a child with special needs and I'm very excited about the movie! It was lovely, warm and entertaining. I have learned to see humor in things that are long-lasting. I used to think of how sweet it is to Frankie, and all the other characters who care for her after the death of her grandmother. Before editing the film, we kept the film in the spotlight with other parents and relatives of children in need of special care. Everyone was delighted with the film and in fact had a great discussion. We talked about how our kids were laughing and we talked about how they were disturbed. The screenwriter talked about how he worked with autistic children and other children with special needs for several years. It is based on the truth-based character. Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has taken us through a lot of stressful times. I gave her two fingers on the movie!
