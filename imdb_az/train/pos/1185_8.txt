Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger changed their good-bad roles on "All Brothers were brave." Taylor is a little worried about the bad guy, but Granger plays a great role. The hero of the story is bison and north-west. The film is perfectly designed. It's a motion picture, and the movie is a great movie idea that has never been seen fairly by my cognoscente, though it is not a heartwarming experience.
