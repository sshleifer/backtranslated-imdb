People do not seem to give enough credit to Lensman's cause. A number of issues that are key to understanding Lensman's experience have been resolved. <br /> <br /> Year: Some of the most impressive results I've seen in Lensman's year 1984. As a person watching the early 80s animation, Lensman is unique in using computer-generated images at the same time as computers are extremely primitive. The battle against geometric cutting trays in the laser maze can be an excellent example of this. <br /> <br /> Lensman has one of the most awesome movies I've ever heard of, and he's in love with it. will be defeated in every corner of the film. Lensman heavily lent to two western mistakes, and the first - to fill each silence in a movie and fill a heroine's need. Music was well-connected and galvanized scenes such as motorcycle fights at the Thionite Factory in Radelyx, the subject of heroes failed due to Chris's excessive concern. <br /> <br /> While archiving Lensman from analogue ribbon to digital format, it is always interesting to note that my efforts to eradicate silence have stopped because there is no silence for silence to use as a reference point. <br /> Western Impact: Helmut - sounds like a "helmet" and has the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn - SW has the same hairstyle as the princess, and her name is sung with suspicion of Transformers Marissa Fairborn. Han Solos, who flies by boat and has some technical expertise. Buzzkirk - A breakthrough in Chewbaka. Lens is a beautiful, concrete copy of the power that has less chance of propagating Christianity than the original SW. Although strength is based on much more than concentration, the lens is a pure concentration. Theoretically, everyone can use the lens. <br /> <br /> Technology: The Boschan Union has interesting foamed sponge vessels. They appear as stormtroopers instead of white instead of just the red shape. The idea of ​​a DNA weapon was just fine. The Galactic Alliance looked like Starblazers (or what they were called - fighting the 60s series Xylons). There were not enough ships to send ships in the battles for me - this was a great improvement in the second Lanceman film. <br /> <br /> Finally a note in Worzel. <br /> <br /> This character, unfortunately, is a unique and very interesting character, which continues on the second film. <br /> <br />
