"One shot, one killing, there are no exceptions." You must see whether you are into the seas or the snipers. two big fingers up! Great general story, great camera work, good drama, action, detail and more. Close to the truth is very close. But this is not a movie for crash, and it's a choice of editing errors. It's a 99 minute back and a sit back. The site has some depth, but this movie is not really about thinking. about his sniper lifestyle and mood enjoyment. Sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good, but the first is still the best film. Tom Berenger is doing a great job of playing his character and showing the secret side of the sniper's life. the plain that deals with all death. You need to see the sniper fans.
