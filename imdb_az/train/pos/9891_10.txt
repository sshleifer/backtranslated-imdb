I first rented this movie a few years ago and was completely surprised by it. Just a while ago, when I needed a strange need to repeat some of my favorite films in my life, I decided to give another look to Erendira. <br /> <br /> Life is about a young girl (Erendira, playing very well), never diminished the brightness of this film. By Claudia O'hana - in some cases, like Winona Ryder!), By accidentally burning her grandmother's grandmother, this grandmother performed hypnoticly by Irene Papas and forced her to live prostitution on the road to pay for her losses. <br /> <br /> The sight is fascinate and attractive at one time - although talking about a basic institution dealing with prostitution runs deliberately free sexually explicit content. The story is more about mutual relationships with the girl and her grandmother, and these days they come in contact with other colorful symbols in Mexico, where they are refugees and internally. > <br /> Film is a very sophisticated, sensitive atmosphere with very dreamy quality. Sometimes it is strange, but not a point of David Lynch. It should be noted that the film is very allegorical in nature, read the comments of previous viewers below ... <br /> <br /> Often the sound of the single accordion in the rear part, the silent and melancholy sounds, right musical accents to emphasize the Mexican spaces. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of rural areas in many areas is exceptionally superior. <br /> <br /> The film is moving very fast and at a very slow pace, rewinding and repeating the band, just because you want to do it. <br /> <br /> I hope you will see the movie in German in the Spanish language version. I studied Spain at high school and college, and I was happy to understand most of the dialogue. Por ejemplo: "El mundo no es grand grand como pensaba." <br /> <br /> This film reminds me to miss a bit of dust on the dusty old old wine bottle and then drink it. but you are very happy, but after acknowledging that there are not many bottles like this, you are a bit sad.
