When I read this drama for the first time, it would be like a sex and city, but this drama is nothing. Empathize cartoons with more realistic stories and more. The drama concept resembles a quarter of a woman's relationships with friends and problems and fights along the way. Katie GP is a dark and dark character, and you also have difficulty finding Trudi's good friends with a widow. Trudi's character is warm-hearted because he can be related to the difficulties he experiences as he is the only mother of the fourth. Jessica is a very conscious party girl and she knows what she wants and how. She is unpleasant and can not help her eyes while she is walking with her companion, unless she can fully love her newest wife, Siobhan. All dramas are strikingly addictive and the BBC continues to produce series that can do it. It's different from other women's stone dramas like the sex and the city or Desperate Housewives. It can be the next cold foot when it plays right. Moreover, the casting of men is not bad in their eyes.
