OH WOW. I saw this movie on March 12, 2000 at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan. Both stars were present and then ready for questions. WHAT IS THE FILM? Although Catholic / Protestant in Ireland was established in conflict, the story could have taken place between the two groups that hated each other. They have touched the horrors of how fast people can move when they give up their charm and anger, with a great sense of humor and joy of fun. Head of the Caucasian Muslims Office: Orla Brady called Irish Meryl Streep and heard them. I think Meryl is better than Streep. They should call Meryl to American Orla Brady! <br /> <br /> LIAM CUNNAMAMIN'S STRUGGLE AND STRONG DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEMED AND SPECIAL PEOPLE'S political warfare was brilliant. <br /> <br /> This is MOVID.
