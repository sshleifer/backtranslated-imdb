Story: Ada Texel, photographer Bob, who photographed the magazine, answers the mysterious Kathleen. Bob, who had suffered a very traumatic experience shortly before, had his free spirit and lust for the spirit of life. But his life is not as simple as it seems. Through Kathleen, Bob is confused with a dangerous network. <br /> <br /> Will it be possible to win this protest? <br /> <br /> Discipline: The dialogue in this film is very natural and remains a bit on the surface, although the story is beautifully presented and the character's "psychology" will be slightly more developed, why do these people do their work? The film gives you something to think about in depth and in my mind, though this story can never reach the emotional peak, though the characters are justified, as you know the characters at a deeper level, and the actors are working well and very naturally 'convincing' 'but I think the movie will be better if Kathleen is performed by a young actress, because it's a mess of the character, the camera is beautiful, and there are some big shots of nature on the island.
