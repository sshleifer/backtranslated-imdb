As you have a very close and long relationship with the Tint's world .... give yourself a blessing and watch this beautiful documentary about Hergen and his life-creating Tintin. Very bright and very cool production. The whole story about Hergey and the people and many different situations, which are very effective, are good for the good and the bad. Funny books and there's a very nice and clear link between them. Undoubtedly, I will be able to re-create Tintin albums in my basement. Also, the film itself is well explained and it is given a great vote. I really hope people will find it as exciting as me!
