It is very rare for a filmmaker of all ages - a beautiful narrative and a beautiful, colorful production, and adult, literate scenario, beautiful production values, good casting / movement, with a beautiful Rozsa account. Nearly two modern films are doing this work - the Baghdad Thief (1940) and the Robin Hood Adventures (1938). Some of the back part of this production is interesting. This production started in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood and proved to be a cover for English intelligence efforts! The producer, Alexander Korda, later became a knight in 1942. Here is a unique situation in the intersection of art, trade and politics! Provide a good CD of this movie for your library!
