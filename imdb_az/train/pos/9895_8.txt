Many popular high school students play a brutal joke about nerdy marty (sympathetic execution by Simon Scuddamore). Five years later, the network is returning to a spilled and abandoned secondary school to reunite. Of course, angry and jealous Marty dressed in a costume suit to get a striking revenge on his torturers. Writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale deceived all the endearingly mixed stereotypes that converted the number of 80's linguistic bodies to many lovers: fraudulent jump, Steadican shots, a fierce storm, insanely groovy hard rock soundtrack, unequal female nakedness beautiful sincerity, totally ridiculous "what is hell?" superficial tops, adhesive make-up f / x, and one of those barefoot discounts, "this was just a terrible dream". Moreover, the murderous gangs offer terrifying products: Gory, a person's stomach explosion after drinking poisoned beer, taking a small bathroom bath, a boy under a large tractor, and electro-chemicals in the middle of two people, being a wild passionate sex. The Thirteenth British Cult Terrorist sneaker, Caroline Munro, was cursed as American youth in the first third of nakedness. All of the cast, especially from Carmine Iannaccone, is the smartaleck leader, Skip Pollack, and Billy Hartman as a pinched jackpot, and Donna Yeager, as an insidious prostitute Stella. Specialist producer Dick Randall's Munroun is a fun community like Manny's crazy agent. Harry Manfredini's moody, crazy music repeats the accusations "Friday 13th". Alan Pudney's bony cinematography is a trick. Well, bare fun.
