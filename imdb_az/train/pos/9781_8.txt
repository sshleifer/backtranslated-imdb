At first I heard a part of the KALI and I sounded like something I was going to do, but my radar was flooded with all my regular movies. While walking around the local WonderBook ... I saw this box and held it. I'm very happy to say. <br /> <br /> KALI is a strange, strange, sometimes crisp, creepy film, which is a bit limited due to the budget's low levels, but it's still entertaining and worthwhile. <br /> <br /> The Taylor-Erikkson religious group uses meditation and other ceremonies to face individual "internal wolves" - but this technique does not work either very well or inadequate as ...) <br /> <br /> This film is short, but memorable and is called an "anthology style" with an eye-opening intro series, and then three stories that make up the majority of the film. <br /> <br /> The first (SHAKTI) spirit is about a journalist who visits one of the religious members held in a hospital. Journalist Taylor-Erikkson enters the area that wants to study the religion, but we can see that his true motives may be somewhat closer to home. The interviewer finds that she may have been taken by a journalist when she is in a fierce turn ... <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) is a young man convicted of psychological rehabilitation, and a young man was sentenced to a coma. This treatment is actually a Taylor-Erikson "graduate" and that his rehabilitation methods are beyond the norm ... <br /> <br /> Paying off the story of the closing story (KALI) and the "miracles" fulfilled. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm really glad to hear somebody who is helping someone who can not heal and, in fact, takes a force that holds him back. There are some mistakes that make the film really great - but that's why it's a genuine and ambitious movie. The biggest weakness I have produced is a poor and weakened dialogue. I would prefer Dublin to subtitles and choose subtitles with the original language stripe. Some reviewers say that the actor is weak, and I do not agree. I think it looks like dubbing plays is not really the case. In fact, a few performances are quite cursed (the "doctor" in the second part and the third "customer" are easily noticeable ...) and are noteworthy. Gore FX works very well for a low-budget movie, a welding-scissors, a pen-throat suicide for the removal of eyelids, a decent (but irritatingly "shaky") self-similar, and a few good things it is measured in a good way. There are no more "extreme" movies than it is, but it's definitely stronger than the average heroic recipe. I also found a nice change to the story of the cult group and to a typical horror-story nonsense. There are lots of realistic atmosphere and tension, and I do not see it for a while. Although I'm defective in some key ways, I still think that KALI's TEARS will appeal to the most "underground" horror watchers - some scenes can have much more to do with basic views. Definitely Recommendation - 8.5 / 10
