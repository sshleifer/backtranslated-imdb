I saw this last day at the festival and I'm glad I stayed around for a few extra days. Poetic, moving, and most striking, funny, in his own strange way. The directors working in this style are rarely able to find the true strangeness and miracle in the hyper-realistic world, which can not be precious or disrupt the balance. It seeks to be both native and completely controlled. I'm skeptical of comparing these filmmakers really because they have broken their effects (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... ordinary suspects), but if you love contemporary authors in this tradition (Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Greene), a true treatment we are in. This is a beautiful movie and I hope that more people will see it. If this movie plays in a city festival, go! go! go!
