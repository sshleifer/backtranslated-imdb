I think Charlotte Gainsburg is one of the best performers in the world. Some people do not understand why. Boring .... ??? Perhaps he said he was doing drilling. He was a great actress and film was good. This is a very good idea and a very good performer. The move was great. All development and perfume, flowers, churches, problems, etc. in the French space. I interact with. It's just astonishing when she goes to her sister's shop. Everything is great. For a long time there is a beautiful, beautiful actress. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I love her next movie, LA SCIENCE DES RVES. And Eric Lartigau did a very good job. <br /> <br /> Mom
