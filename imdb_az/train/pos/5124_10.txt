This is a great movie that I will not get enough credits for Saturday night shooting or fat in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who is in love with a girl, but many pigs are directed to his senses. Instead, he wants to engage in bullfighting because he thinks he is showing humanity. Although prepared in 1980, it is still in place today. Great country music music is in the process. 10/10
