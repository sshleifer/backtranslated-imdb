<br /> <br /> Footlight Parade, a true, satirical, bizarre, bizarre, witty, fast, sexy, extravagant, sleazy, erotic, heartbreaking and dark, is a fun first-class. the treatment gives a fresh edge of the material and is speedy and quick to deliver. Just think about starting 7 years ago with pictures of features! <br /> <br /> This film was adopted at a time when the content of the Hayes code restricted itself, and for a while, "realism" was a fresh, unique, critically and lively movie that eventually spoke directly to contemporary viewers suffering from depression and common philosophy. At this stage, I would recommend looking at any movie that was popular in the 1930s and 1935s with a potential movie potential.
