This is a great little movie that is very beautiful and creative, some great plans and great speeches !. All the characters are great and strange, but the story is interesting and very interesting, and Nicole Kidman is just stunning! It is very difficult to describe this movie because it is really strange, it's a comedy / romance, a minute later it turns into a backdrop, but it was still very fun, and Nikol's Russian accent was fantastic and extremely convincing. Chaplin and Kidman had a very good chemistry and I liked the performance of Vincent Cassel!!! Moreover, the many places really surprised me! The latter was very sweet and an unexpected event happened during that time! Moreover, this movie is also very small. You will feel sorry for Chaplin and that all the characters that he scammed are really likable, plus the finale is particularly good. This is Nicole's movie though, and with its incredible sexy performance! It's a great little movie, it's very unique and creative, with some great puzzles and beautiful performances! I'm very lucky! Direction is very good !. Jez Butterworth's here is a very good job, great camera work, solid angles and a movie that's fast. The actor is beautiful !. Nicole Kidman is a surprising beauty and is incredibly exquisite as she has incredibly sexy, very unpleasant, one of the coolest habits she has added to many things, was a very good chemistry with Chaplin and had a very mysterious character !! , it was beautiful. (Kidman Rules !!!!). Ben Chaplin was great here, he had a very unpleasant, cool character, there was a very good chemistry with Kidman, the only thing I did not like, the wrath of Kidman, how I loved revenge at last! Vincent Cassel looks like the main villain, yes, he was OTT, but he was very intense and very creepy, and this role was perfect for him. Mathieu Kassovitz is here, but there was not much. The rest of the cast is good. In general, I suggest this one !. 5 to 5 1/2
