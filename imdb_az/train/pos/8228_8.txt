it's hard to tell more about this movie. I did not expect what I was seeing, but I did not even expect a normal sex drama, because it's great for me. It's nothing like invisible psycho-tension. Emmanuelle Seigner, her husband, is no stranger to Polanski's genre (and nudity). Creepy performance from Toreton (from Bernard Tavernier's actor) (creepy / yes I said CREEPY). Pascal Bruckner welcomes Roman Polanski (Better Than Away), like Roman Colakchi or Clouzot thriller (I see someone telling Les Diaboliques), but Les Jeux sans Visage Dr. Georges Frangue. Death of Fibes and more). A gem! I am afraid that they will be re-established as they are with Hollywood's "Nighwatch" and "The Vanishing."
