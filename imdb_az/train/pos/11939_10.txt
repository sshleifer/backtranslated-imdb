I always love this great baseball movie! There are two great actors and two good players, including Favorit Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! There are also Ben Johnson, Brenda Fricker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey in this movie! Also Jay O. Sanders and Dermot Mulroney! The movie has great special effects and is made up of all movie actors! Baseball scenes are all real! Composer Randy Edelman's music is very good and very well suited for the movie! Some of the actors who remind me of the true baseball personalities. Stoney Jackson's Ray Mitchell recalls the character Royce Clayton, recalled McConaughey's character Steve Finleyi, and in my opinion, Jay O Sanders's commentator likened to how Al Hrabosky looks today. It's a fantastic movie for Non-Baseball fans and I strongly recommend this movie!
