OK - it's like 2 versions of this movie. John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was the only producer - they could not say such a thing in the film - they just helped with it) - The "Mature" version was made possible by Bill Couterie. John Korty did not like this version and confirmed it (as it did in the back). Thanks to the films under the Ladd films, they did not advertise this movie and threw all the advertising cash for "Right Images" so they could take them ... and did not do it. That is, this movie really does not have a chance. When they made the Twice Cable (HBO), they showed the reels with the Billin version and threatened to make a claim when John was already released (how long did the "mature" version look like that?). Showtime 'clean' version. The video version and laser disc version is a version approved by John (which holds more power than Bill). Unfortunately, the 'adult' version is really much better and more meaningful. But there is a lot of doubt that DVDs will not be released (or otherwise released). I'm sorry to be disappointed with everyone. I know this information every time, because "Twice Up A Time Fan Club" (still has a large number of articles from the movie - the adult version has a message box but has been stolen) now has a partial HBO copy). '8' is the name of the 'mature' version - 5 'clean' version. Just ask any other question.
