*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Richard Chapar's leadership. <br /> <br /> Brosnan has never been a better actor than a Bond movie, bringing together a well-prepared story and movie. After 2004, his newest role in "after the sun" laughs and brings a great deal of time. In a business case in Mexico, Julian Noble is a professional hip-man to talk, so he is also faced with a highly professional businessman Danny Wright (Kinnear, perhaps one of the best roles). On two screens, a double comic accusation will create a heroic rebellion and will not deliver the laughs. Davis is one of the best roles to give her a fascinating and fierce performance than the "American Glory". One of the most dear and best films. My final rating is 9/10
