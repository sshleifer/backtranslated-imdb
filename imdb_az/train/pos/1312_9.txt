This one was a nice movie, scratching one of the winning columns. <br /> <br /> <strong> Helen Hunt was spectacular as the Riverside police officer Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. He was a police officer with a Riverside Police Department. He knew that he was a wife and a child, who had completed a job with a workmate, all of whom took a secret job to catch a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (The same Ray Liotta) began working as a mixed, often boring police officer with Gina. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber was stoic as a worker, especially from sitcom's "Wings", but on the contrary, he was dealing with his feelings and was quite opposite. Good work, such as tranquility, kindness, and sociopathy. On the surface, he was an innocent missing, but a cold-blooded murderer was lying on the surface. <br /> <br /> Generally, the children have a childhood young adult with unbearable thirst to kill young boys. <br /> <br /> The whole film was magnificent. Each scene, every oral exchange, let us know more about the characters. The production team has done extraordinary work on condensation days if it does not value events in a 90-minute film. This movie was a good example of a small thing to do.
