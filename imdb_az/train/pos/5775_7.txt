Really people, look at the title! LOL! I remember seeing this movie, which was the night's creator of nightlife on Saturday, a few years ago. This beautiful, cheeky monster plays with two shiny moronic hillbillies, which adds to the shock factor. There are 2 redneck boat rental guys movies! LOL and the English boy and his wife love the boat scene, where they talk about all the stars and are afternoon and sunny. Bloody hilarious !!! I do not know, they just did not care about the plot, but they wanted to hit the film as soon as possible. Bottom line, you'll love the 70s shock.
