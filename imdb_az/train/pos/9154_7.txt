<br /> <br /> As the screenwriter's director was very good. His eyesight was often silver, but it was added to the film, as well as in good places where snowy features help create a spirit creature against the film. This effect has been extremely incredible. <br /> <br /> I was going to give him 8 of this movie, but after the end, he hit 7 points because he was radically departing from the first 75 minutes of the movie and was the last to make the filmmaker look smart. <br /> <br /> Although this movie was better than movies with huge budgets and seemed to be like a home movie with some additional equipment. These are not special effects, but very good for tension.
