Excellent. The courageous and original illustrations of pioneer foreigner life in the Western plains, which point to the role and place of women. A motion picture is based on love and is based on real people and their experiences. Low budget, independent film; did not give any money. Indeed, the romantic, unreal, Hollywood pioneer is not the version of life.
