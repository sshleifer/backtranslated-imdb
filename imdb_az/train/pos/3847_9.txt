Meanwhile, there were controversy over most of Verhofe's projects on this film. <br /> <br /> Death scenes with multiple graphic images; On the ground * smack * a parachute that does not open children's body. A Lion * chomp * teeth in the throat. <br /> <br /> In some cases, a boat ride on this sliding * zooming off a man falling from bloody corpses. <br /> <br /> Besides, this flick contains some bright (and surprisingly beautiful) scenes taken in the gray fishing city. Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> A beautiful woman, surrounded by blood-dropping meat plates, puts thousands of flowerpots on the screen, flowers in a dairy, a scene of love in a cemetery between two men characters. <br /> <br /> The story is stunned, but it will leave a faded, frustrating and relaxing breath for 10 minutes.

However, the two leading actors, Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk, are characterized by the fact that Hermann's character (illustrated by incredibly un-charming Thom Hoffman), while doing their best to breathe life into their characters, is very little developed and makes it harder <br /> /> I have done my best to give you an idea of ​​what you expect from this wonderful movie, and with words that are not easily summarized as you can see. If you find this movie together, look out for yourself! And enjoy the unique style and essence of this kingdom.
