Hello, this little movie is particularly interesting for a musician, film maker or music creator or a visual artist: <br /> Simplicity from a relative of David's touch / style. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic gaps of shooting, pans and sound elements. <br /> <br /> Like a simple movie, this creation is very solid. <br /> <br /> You see several types of pan: some go up and down. in a thin manner forward. There is a diagonal pan. <br /> <br /> Celebrities look alike. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It can give a fine art by simple art to almost instantiate the appearance / appearance and compose the scene. Then comes the forewords: digonales, parallels, etc. Degrad√©es of the light and colors are great, without much research for tissue like great production. <br /> <br /> All of this is not calculated, but carried out with a sense of intuition, and it makes David feel like any real artisan.
