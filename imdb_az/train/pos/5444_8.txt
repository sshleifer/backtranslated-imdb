Class Reunion is a very popular comedy ship. In 1982 and in 1972, Lizzie Borden High has a 10-year merger class. Among them are ordinary stereotypes, hunts, babe, greasy boy, nerd and so on. There are, however, old-fashioned students who have been exposed to a violent night, classmates Walter Baloer, who has been exposed to a comedy film on the night of graduation, and has been living in a mentally housewife since then fleeing Walter, and now also plans to get rid of her humiliation <br /> Despite the dark moments, This is really a pretext for lots of comic gags and set numbers. You can spoil a lot more movies, but if you're so excited about Naked Gun & Airplane movies, you'll like it, and in another movie Chuck Berry is proposing a music community. A great comedy that is worthy of a wider audience.
