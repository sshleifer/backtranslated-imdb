Charles Boyer (Luis Denard), along with Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen), was delighted with their appearances and their great moves. Even Peter Lorre (Contreras) played a role in this movie and had a bad experience in his bathroom, so he lost consciousness. This story works with Republican Courier Luis Denard, who visited England during the Spanish Civil War and broke a coal mining agreement that would greatly harm other nations. Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen) helps Luis Denard's assistant and loves her, and at the same time he loves her and helps her escape an angry mob of British mining workers who threaten her life. In this film, the real bad guy Victor Francen (Licata) gives a superb performance called "Beast with Five Fingers". Great Classical film in 1945 without Humphrey Bogart.
