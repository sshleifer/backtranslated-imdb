This is a true story of an Australian couple who killed several couples when their child was killed. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep is always perfect, and even tries to keep our interests, especially if it's a favorite character. <br /> <br /> Media shocking coverage of this case in Australia Sam Sheppard's murder in Ohio in the 50s. These real-life situations indicate that the media can actually affect the way the criminal case is resolved. "Why not sell Sam Sheppard in Prison in Cleveland Plain?" I remember that you had a hooded title. The prosecutor finally ended this brutal assault, and Sheppard was tried and convicted. <br /> <br /> I love the movies that tell the story, I love it, and put an important point in the process. It's one of those films. Other good films about the story of innocent people charged with murder include Hurricanes, Thin Blue Line and Breaker Morant. In particular, the latter is another Australian film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
