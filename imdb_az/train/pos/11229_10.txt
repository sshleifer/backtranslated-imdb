Thanks to the number of actors they work on, the project has numerous shooting. In the stylish CGI locations, their green screen needs some work. <br /> <br /> Everyone who hears "Adobe After Effects 7" should buy their keynes to get better. <br /> <br /> Stories are well thought out. But the idea of ​​kissing two kisses encourages me to push the episode. I'm not homophobic, but I can not find men who can kiss (dont mind women). Anyway ... For a fan series this is a good thing. This series, with minor adjustments on the green screen, reviving some of its executive ratings, is striking. Anyway, I advise those who use TNG and DS9 for this series.
