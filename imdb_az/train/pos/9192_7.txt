Let's start with a positive note of this research - I did not decide to fight Tony and I'm very happy to prepare a retrospective season as some people say. Actually, the creator and writer of this episode, David Chase, was completely opposite. We really do not know whether Tony will live or die. He has little to do in coma and recovery chances. This episode was very slow, and the sleep-dreamed dream of Tony was involved in an identity and fled. The sting of the Asian monks was completely strange. After 45 minutes, I was a little sick of distress, but there was no reason to break this episode. It was a strange and unexpected episode, but it was still well-written and intense. Edie Falco, in this episode, had a sad imagination that would result in an encounter with his spouse. I also saw something interesting from AJ's school and told a vendetta against Junior that AJ would probably not pull the balls. Silvio is already working as a teacher, with many episodes opening doors to the problems. There were also many big quips in this episode, and I think Vito's Pole-Smoker 'Spadafore may face death even though it's a greedy SOB. This is a great episode and, unfortunately, Tony is killing people, we adore him as an audience and feel that our show is our hero. Although it was a bit ridiculous to the result, it was a necessary episode for this series. Kudos and David Chase and writers in Edie Falco's performance are all about creating this completely original and unexpected field twist. This is part of the 'The Sopranos' season, when I did not find a figure that was going to go. I will not wait for the episode of next week. My Rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> The best line of episode: (To Paulie JJ): "Come Van Helsing!"
