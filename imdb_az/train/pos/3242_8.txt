I saw this movie with my dad. I have to be very young around the age of 15. It was a Star Movie at noon. The film had just begun, but you could say that the robbers were gathered for a score. <br /> <br /> All actors, especially Blades and Lou Diamond are very good. I think it's an ensemble, they only play well in one place. I can watch this movie at any time. I think the structure and the hero who wants to deal with a strange account is relatively stupid. But jokes are not on the agenda but at the same time sensitive and excessive. <br /> <br /> A perfect comedy for a handy afternoon.
