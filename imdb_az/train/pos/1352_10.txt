You have never seen this movie and consider it a great classic with a great veteran player. At the time of the film, people in America were different, except for the start of Hollywood films, and no exceptions to Radio and today, we had no television or all modern things. Young romantic sweet innocent tales between the young girl or the boy seemed different today. Ann Shirley played a young orphan called Carrot Ball because of his red hair, and found himself as a two-year-old owl and a two-year-old man watching over Ann Shirley. It was a small town, and everyone knew everything, and if all happens, the whole city has been informed about it in a matter of minutes. Very good people, who are trying to help each other in a very simple way, down the ground movie. Today, it looks like a mackerel and a fool, but I believe that people in the 1920s were in America. 30th and they were a great generation who love good family movies.
