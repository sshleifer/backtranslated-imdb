"Shops around the corner" is one of Ernst Lubitsch's great films. In addition to the talents of James Stewart and Margaret Sullava, is full of surprising pressure from the best characters like Frank Morgan and Felix Bressart .They are Hollywood, unfortunately, the type of actors that are not working at all. In fact, the film itself is a type of movie that Hollywood is no longer doing. ("You've got Mail" claim the artists to repeat their films, but this is nothing more than a highly exaggerated self-esteem.) In any case, if you have love for romantic comedies of the 1940s, should not be a good thing. It is good with re-vision. Enjoy!
