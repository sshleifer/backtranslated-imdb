One day I heard several friends say, "Scarface sucks ... some idiot tried to build another Godfather in the early 80's." Now, I listen to the usual way / watch CNN, so I think I'll stay away from it. Then his wife said to me by giving DVD: "It's # 1 with pelicangs," I got it wrong. This is not the best movie. It's more realistic to sell stolen cars, which is very expensive for someone in the field (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) Some humor, though ... Pelicangs and music of the 80s. Still, what's better than Al Pacino's m203? I can give it ****, perfect for Al or GTA fans: Vice City.
