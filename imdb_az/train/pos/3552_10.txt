I just want to add two cents and forgive if I repeat something I already have, but I think I should remind the genius of the genius of Damon Runon. Without a beautiful street, Damon Runon's hilarious writings would never have been created - the majority of the great classics who were engaged in gamblers and others before 1960. Damon Runyon was working as a newspaper man and Colorado, but he really made the street scene _get_ at East Coast. If you are not an admirer of old Hollywood comedies, I suggest a few other suggestions from Damon Runon's writings; The "Lemondrop Kid" and the "Little Miss Marker" are Bob Hope, a funny guy who is out of politics. (West Coast liberal, his policy is pretty funny!) Damon Runyon lives !!!!
