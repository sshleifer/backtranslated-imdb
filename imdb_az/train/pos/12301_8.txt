It's logical, but I've found the German version of the MGM's Anna Christie from the TCM ... but I've never seen this one since I heard many people think <br /> <br /> Without seeing someone else, I can not compare them, but this is a good early talk, made directly by Garbo. <br /> <br /> The film's atmosphere differs from what looks like a normal MGM, especially Cameraman William Daniels, who looks great in this movie. this episode looks like French or German expressionist films of the 1930s, and in 1929, Kiss was directed by Jacques Feyder, the great French director of Garbo, in the "Kiss". <br /> Theo is an absolute, and Anna's lover is absolutelly incredible, a child of a human-like, sophisticated, sophisticated, sophisticated, sophisticated. <br /> <br /> Hans Junkermann, Anna's spirits and Salka Viertel, perform well. <br /> <br /> In general, it is very experienced because it's just a movie. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>
