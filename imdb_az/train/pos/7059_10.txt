I'm shocked by negative reviews on the internet and I'm glad that Cinderella 2 (and 3) is a very nice and funny thing for everyone - kids and adults ... like me, 22 years old. <br /> <br /> I've found him and a very informative film, shows you the lessons to be loyal to yourself and to follow your heart. I thought it was great animation and it was good to sound; Brooke Allison's songs. This is the story when my favorite three, mice Jaq, Fairy Godmother and his magic have been one day man since this movie was divided into three flashbacks / stories.
