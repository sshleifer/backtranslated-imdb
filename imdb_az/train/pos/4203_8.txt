This is a shabby and carefree film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. There is something unusual for this minimalist and fast-running director's previous movies - a game with some stars. At the beginning of the film, Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley starred in a film about a communist agency group trying to hide America's secrets. <br /> <br /> The start of the film is through a metro station followed by Peters with federal agents. They know that there is a connection in the long spying chain. Uncertainty to everyone is a wild card in equation - a little time (Widmark) on the train and stealing Peters' secrets. Vidmar thinks he has another purse - only then he realizes the seriousness of the kidnapping. <br /> <br /> The film is almost complete, except for Virginia and the rest. Though it has not received the best billing, a special mention should be made of Thelma Ritter. This supporting actress, perhaps, worked as a dove for lifetime. <br /> <br /> I would like to inform you that this is a very good thing. <br /> <br /> The scenario and the directive are increasingly good, but with a small exception. Initially, Widmark and Peters liked it in a mutual way. This is one of the few things you'll see in a mouthful of a woman's square punch! Now this is difficult. Then, frankly, they are strangely approaching - close to being very convincing. It's still possible to ignore it with a great drama and an effective Noir movie. Watch this movie.
