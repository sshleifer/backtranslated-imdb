The Shakti, Devi, and Kali tales about the experimental commune called the Taylor-Eriksson group, were partly unknown and somewhat humiliated here, and I would say there. Many years later, some of these losses still await the right moment to show themselves. Shakti explains the story of a woman who was mysteriously murdered by her husband, who was actually destroyed and suspected. Apparently, this woman is able to predict some internal devil, or finds her brother killed when she talks to the woman as she argues. Devy explains the tale of a young man who wants to "quit." It is a skinhead, a speed skepticism, and is sent to see a psychiatrist who has just been a member of this commune, leading to a good doctor who helps the young man dream. This is probably the best of three segments. Kali explains the tale of a healer who is trying to "heal" this woman who is a part of the commune, and who can permanently disrupt the body of a woman, but a miracle she did not do, or she could no longer save her because she had abolished her. The three of these fairy tales are quite creepy and suspenseful because you never really expect what to expect, and the traditional fear movies that add to the strangulation of the premise and settings. It has a kind of low budget look and I feel it, but it tries to make a very hearty atmosphere to its credit. I watched it when it came to a very difficult situation when it was a good part of my time and my true fear (and gore) arrived. I found this movie very interesting and worried and I liked it very much. Do not find a good thing, I would give this one, from 10 to 8.
