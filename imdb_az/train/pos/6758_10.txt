<br /> <br /> <strong > appearance. Photographic and nighttime settings are the first degree (film expert Joseph LaShelle allows the stage drama to ooze scene) and face-to-face pure expressionism. Even if the players' struggles and trick are wrong, I can watch such films only for their visuals. <br /> <br /> But it's primarily here and it's the base of the worst films in the apartment, the alienated male unit (feeling lost by many who returned to the United States after the war). In fact, only Dana Andrews is a problematic, just as confident as a single detective, but has a small but important affiliate in the film, a leading woman (her husband), an early GI who has a difficult time and resources. The killing of one person may actually be monumental, and in general - a regular man who succeeds in internal problems while dragging him to death by accidentally passing a silver plate on a soldier who has won a medal. Women are crossing each other - we think that they are married and offer them as much as they did in a child film. In fact, even though this is a interpretation, we still see the path to the psychological luggage of a person by focusing on the highest moral correction in the crisis - at one point we have to turn ourselves to a small crime. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to Andrews. Kirk Douglas plays a much more limited and vibrant way of playing William Wyler's Detective Story one year later, and Andrews is less than a theater. You can easily see both movies for each other's book comparison and contrast sessions. Detective Dickens can explain why Andrews's moral fight, Detective McLeod, could not get a girlfriend and one of a man she did not have Douglas. Gene Tierney is not simply a cardboard but not a person who wants Dixon to really get married, rather sympathetic, demurring, and ultimately the most ordinary and "beautiful" woman. <br /> <br /> The crime scene is actually the second with a major drama, but it is quite effective in the game and its types and clich√©s. Plant parts are stored in a short time, small details (like a portable crack stall) are beautiful touchs, character actors or gamblers from the Casablanca gambling. But then, Curtis's great movie is even symbolic with its details - it strives to be subtle and realistic and influential, but instead it is sweeping, memorable and inspirational. They are on the opposite side of the war and represent the mutual opportunities for their leaders. Bogart started his job, Dixon and Dixon killed, all set out. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> People destroy their enemies and change their lives , and then, now, now understands the beauty that should be felt.
