I just saw that this movie was showing a press and I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> It was a pleasure to meet Rachel Bilson and Hayden in one place. In the camera, their chemistry images are a result of the separation of the camera. My favorite scene was as much as part of Brett Ratner (very surprising) ... Without going too far, I'll just say that you have a hangover surprise ... <br /> <br /> Older pairs are really a good place and really they had the impression they had spent together for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> Both Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke were hit by similar and similar surprises, similar to the experiences I experienced in the bigger apple. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> It's a great place to have a place on all the movies ... Especially if you love the city itself. <br /> <br />
