This will not be the case with the best comedy of the year, coincidence and field holes several times. However, we are talking about a hit-man and white bread maker's friend that a few vagaries should not come as a surprise. Brosnan went on a par with James Bond (lost role) in this role. If he keeps this quality, he continues to play comedy. Greg Kinnear is also beautiful as the Brosnan straight man. I read some negative comments about Hope Davis, but I thought it was as good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deeper. Brosnan's path is like sleazes and I have a very good giggle as there are a few scenes that have nearly died laugh. When Julian called himself "facilitator," my father (the consultant) lost it. Like a hit-man comedy like Grosse Pointe Blank, humor can be too dark. If you are ready to enjoy yourself.
