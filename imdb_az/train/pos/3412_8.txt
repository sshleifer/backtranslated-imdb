Beginning with Michel Serrault, DOCTEUR PETIOT is a cruel story about a cruel man. In France, under occupation, doctors are not there, despite their ability to pay for the illness. But it is weak among the population. Images and cinematography are superior and this complicated story adds a mixed feeling. He is a perfect psychopath. Attractive and holy, clever and caring, computational and lethal. A movie that will soon be forgotten by an audience. Kudos, according to Mr. Serrault, for his cold painting.
