A good movie with strong performances (especially two results). The film belongs to two American girls captured at Thailand airport with 6 kilos of heroin. Both are thrown out of prison and one of them admits. Bill Pullman plays a lawyer trying to get them out. All they need to do is find a Nick Park that puts drugs in one of the two girls' bags. So far, for a non-original story (there are many similarities with a better return to Paradise). <br /> <br /> The player and Newton Thomas Sigelin's beautiful photo is worth watching this movie. 10 to 7-i.
