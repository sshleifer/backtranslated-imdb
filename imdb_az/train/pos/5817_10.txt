If you want to remember MJ, this is a good place to start. This movie has cute tunes, MJ like a robot and a bare, messed-up area. <br /> <br /> Many nights I go to college with this wonderful art movie, and I think of everyone's surprising sleep that decides to make this ridiculous piece of light green. <br /> <br /> She sings many songs. Many dances. She sings many songs while dancing. MJ will kill you as you expect when it comes to these things. But there's more to this movie. There's Claymation. There are oily children (clay). Michael Jackson has an anthropomorphic rabbit to fight in a dance (clear clay). <br /> <br /> RIP - we love you! There is also Michael Pesci. It's a terrible day for all of us.
