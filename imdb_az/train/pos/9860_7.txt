There was no joy in this movie, mostly just part of a comic book, but there were not any really bad ones. The worst part is Sidin's voice. His impeccable loss was a lot to me. In about 5 minutes, I heard her talk. The movie was good, except for the noise of silence. There were plenty of jokes that make you better if you capture them. This is a good movie for children. It is enough to keep the content of adults and entertain children. If you have children and want to watch a movie with them, this is definitely worth a rent.
