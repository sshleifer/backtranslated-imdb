Lizzie Borden's "Crimes of Love" (1992), Sean Young's strange D.A. play. In Atlanta. <br /> <br /> There is a friend who is known as a famous fashion photographer and has been deeply involved in the work of a person who deceives women (Patrick Bergin), who draws off insulting photos and then leaves. <br /> <br /> Of course, this challenging companion decided to enter the life of a fraudster by breaking her prey, and planning to bring her to justice. It was crazy that they met, love, and the next thing he knew was on his lap. (Note: The Spanking scene is only in the "unreleased" version of this movie, and the R-rated version creates some other scenes to make it clearer and more straightforward. These psychological thieves have many scenes of women's nakedness and disturbing pictures <br /> <br /> Sean Young runs through one of his victims around his room, as he plays a cat and a cat, like a "Love Crimes". Plays with Bergin and seeks to catch him on a criminal charge. Unfortunately, the film does not end, it just stops. True. Director Lizzie Borden could run away from the story to justify the news, but after 92 minutes, we're lending and we're having a condolence "what's happening"? <br /> <br /> The opening of a youth's plan is attracted in the style, but the lack of a sequential end will turn for some viewers. <br /> <br /> Dan (daneldorado @ yahoo.com)
