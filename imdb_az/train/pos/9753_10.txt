... in our house. Like everyone who commented on this movie, my brothers (7 and 4) and I (10) watched this movie again and again. We all loved Star Wars, but because of great songs and adventures, we've always been back to this one. We all love Camel and sing along with his songs on the lungs. There are some slow moments (at the time with King Koo-Koo at the Court) and we ended up to rescue Babbettin from the Knight song (the "Sound Effect" graciously favored you), and all the King Koo-Koo was a little bit horrified, gains advantage, eventually laughs maniacally. I'm still playing "Hooray for me", gay Babe in Paris! Around my friends (I'm 33 years old) looks at me as if I lost my mind; But when I read it, I remember the age of Star Wars and I'm 10 years old.
