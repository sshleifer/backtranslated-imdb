The main reason why Gregory Peckin Douglas MacArthur as the UN General Commander during the Korean War started at the beginning of the Battle of Corregid in the Philippines at the beginning of the Easter War gives all of the above three possibilities. Of course, the most controversial American general of the Second World War (and most probably MacArthur) is presented here as one of the massive contradictions. He claims that he has soldiers for all peace, but he is proud of the obvious battle; he has consistently denied any political ambition, but almost everything is intentionally used to reinforce his candidacy as a presidential candidate; it is clear that soldiers who follow his orders must obey the letter, but deliberately denied orders from the US president; it respects other cultures (in particular the Philippines and Japan) and still retains contact with its own country. All this is balanced throughout this film, and ultimately, the audience remains focused on the man, although MacArthur loves his country, and especially the army, with sincere and passionate love. <br /> <br /> Peck's performance, as I said, was brilliant - in fact, it was the shadow of the film in the film (perhaps it was given to whom it describes). Except for Ed Flanders. He was surprised by Harry Truman's and MacArthur's attitude: despite being angry, hearty (referring to MacArthur repeatedly as "Majesty") he was completely fed with the General and would not just respect his authority as president. Marj Dusay was also dedicated to MacArhurun's marriage to his wife, Jean (who thought he was quite happy with what he called "the General"). I liked this movie very much, although I liked a little more about MacArthur's early life. I always approached MacArthur's reaction to MacArthur's election as president (MacArthur would be a wonderful president as he was surprised to think that he was thinking of the role of the President - he deserved the best curse) for war commander during the war. 8/10
