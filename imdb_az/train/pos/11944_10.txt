I'll give it 8, but because I voted for you better than 6.5 votes, I also increased my contribution. Styx river was clean. Of course, Woody was his long-term work, but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was really cheerful and the rest of the movie was easy to follow. The dialogue was fairly intelligent, and Woody's card tricks on the parties were fun, along with the reaction of the crust. It was better than the criticism of the newspaper critics. And a plus, go with a little magician's lamp. And of course, do you get a little frumpy at Johansen? Charles Dance is always as fun as Hugh Jackman.
