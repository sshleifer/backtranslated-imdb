When I was in the video store I walked in for a dollar rental and came to this small ship. <br /> <br /> There were events in the prison surrounding two girls who survived only one school fire. Alicia, one of the girls, is a teenage pupil, the only witness of the attack, and another survivor, Deanna, survived a bullet wound with a miracle. Students who have been thrown together with the student have begun to act slowly and painfully and in good order. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < What is a performance by Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen? My only complaint is that the DVD is not intense in its specific functions. Oh and some of the shootings in the film were the type of punishment. But all is a good movie.
