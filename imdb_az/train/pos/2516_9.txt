According to Gacktin, Ay Child was in Mallepa's poverty line. In a futuristic timeline, the story followed the lives of two main characters - Kei (HYDE) and Sho (Gackt) and their friends. <br /> <br /> Some events may be over-prepared or perhaps humorous. I believe it's a movie about friendship. <br /> <br /> Unlike most vampire characters, Kei describes a vampire that describes itself as a vampire. Among all the difficulties between each character, he had to kill to survive. A vampire found friendship in the hands of a young man, Sho, who was not afraid of Kei. Regardless of some thoughts, I see Kei, Sho as a father figure. Kei Shaw lived there for the rest of his life, took care of him, and taught him to live in a world where his power was controlled by his power. On the other hand, Sho, who can surely be seen as a young man in an innocent style, grew up to be a person who understood that life was fun and not related to play, death, and loved ones <br /> <br /> Actor Lee Homes I love the first time I see on the screen. The way they really looked was really cool. The Son also played a major role in this film, because he was a Taiwanese and a distinct racial, influenced the subject of friendship in the film. <br /> <br /> In this film, he explained how friendships developed despite background differences. <br /> <br /> As I took into account that every actor thinks this is a great screen movie, he has done a great job. Both HYDE and Gackt acted quite well and created quite convincing characters. Unlike movies that feature musicians and actors, they have acted very well! Moon Child really made an impact on me, gave friendships a new meaning and thought, and we should evaluate each of our friendships in life. Despite all the bad things happening in the film, hope gives a little hope. Life can be cruel, hopefully no longer. It also has a very strong friendship amongst each other, even the Son is an enemy, and Sho had some kind of "fun" in the final battle. Even though they were far from them, they wanted peace at the end of each one. The last scene showed us it.
