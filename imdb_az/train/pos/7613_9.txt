/ Lost thought the first episode I thought, I thought some people would crash and chase it by a giant monster. But it is not so much more than that, because every single episode that Lost sees, no matter what happens, gets better every time. An island with an underground bunker, an island, and a link between people who went through each other before crashing. <br /> <br /> This series of rules and I will not wait to know what really is there, I hope they do not release the last 2 episodes in theaters, this series is from 9 to 10
