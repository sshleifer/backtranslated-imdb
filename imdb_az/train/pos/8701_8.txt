Traditional superhero movie can be an unpleasant surprise to anyone waiting for it. Not a motion picture, but a drama more. <br /> <br /> Because Sasha, as every super hero, accepts his own law and the law. society does not appreciate it. Sasha is a breach of law. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, she also meets a beautiful girl and is exposed to love that is even more difficult for her. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the assassination is really dramatic, but the film does not have dynamics. This is a little reminiscent of the recent films by Ram Gopal Varma. Everything is too slow. But when it's a scene, it's so dynamic that it's over before you realize what's going on. But the director does not want to surprise us with surprising and enthusiasm. What's more important here is the outcome of Sasha's actions, which is particularly striking. The score is too difficult, making it more difficult to pay more attention to the movie. <br /> <br /> Is it worth the movie? It's really hard to answer. I do not think this experience has enriched me, but I'm still thinking about this movie and I feel like watching it again. Basically, because of an intense atmosphere, but Sasha and Katya are not drowning because they are always in the hope. After all this, young people live and have all their lives to live. So no matter how difficult it is, it's always a merry cheerful melody.
