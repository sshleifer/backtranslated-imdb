Of course, Mario Lanza is the "Big Caruso", starring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath in 1951. <br /> <br /> This film is well-known today, the legendary, world-renowned tenor's high heroic artistic translation. <br /> <br /> The film is made voluntarily and includes Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna, Blanche Thebom and other opera stars. If you were an artist, if you see smiling people from Lucia at Sextet, Carousson's wife, Dorothy, will hit you one by one, even if she has only one baby girl. And Caruso's Edgardor in Lucia is not too difficult; The role was very high for him. <br /> <br /> While dropping a dramatic license, the script leaves many dramatic parts of Carousson's life. What is remarkable about it is that he actually played roles in the repertoire today, but this is never mentioned in the film. These roles include Maurizio Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson, "The Girl of the Golden West". Why is that photo? His only shirt was in the laundry. She was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long relationship with Victor Talking-Machine Company (later RCA Victor). <br /> <br /> The story of the MGM is dying mainly on Martha's stage. During the "L'Elisir d'Amore" text, a bleeding was performed and could not complete its performance; only played three times in Meta's last role as Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis. The first role in the Meta was not the Radames in Aida, but the Duke in Rigoletto as shown in the film. That is why this is what the "Dorothy Carousson's wife biography suggests" on the screen. Indeed, Dorothy's father denied him and dropped $ 1 his big property. They also married her daughter Gloria (died on 7/7/2007 at the age of 79). Some people like Lanza's voice look like Caruso, Caruso says only singing in "Match Point" - Carousso's voice is different from Lanza's voice. In fact, he wanted his voice to be read as Carousso Baritone. He thinks that there are some problems with high notes, more evidence of baritone pillations; and his role as Otzelo was when he died, Lanza was a notable dramatic tenor. Lanza's voice is worthy of being compared to another. He has made a rare contribution to the history of filmmaking, popularizing opera music. He reads music in "Great Caruso" with a strong energy; he is really at the peak of a short career here. Its mobility is natural and original. Anne Blyth is just like Dorothy and begins to read herself. <br /> In fact, a movie for lovers of opera and Lanza supporters who are really one and the same.
