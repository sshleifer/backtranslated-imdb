I did not have any problem in the movie, I thought it was very good. This is the actual LAPD crime scene video that disturbs me. Lion's door really thinks he wants to see general audiences beat all people on the planet by killing and bloody. Sorry Leo's Gate, this was an amazing IDEAD! Back to the movie: The cast was excellent, especially as Val Kilmer was like the late Hollywood Holmes. In the life of John Holmes, women (Lisa Kudrow, as Kate Bosworth, his wife) robbed and became hopelessly deeply medicated. His relationship with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral, which also resulted in the spectacular Wonderland murder. How was Holmes involved in crimes? The story (Nash is still alive and free) never knows the truth, but the film is still a pretty good job.
