If you are an admirer of Peter O'Donnell's humble humorous Blaise books since the sixties, you will really enjoy it. You've seen the "Modesty Blaise" in 1966, do not forget! It was a camp. This is a real blunder Blaise. The story and character are also related to Tawba, who knows and loves the love of the book. This is a long way from Joe Losey's 1966 anniversary, and this is our very modesty. Alexandra Staden is partly pretty good and convincing and yes, we see her kick butt. <br /> <br /> This is likely to be the first movie of a series of films, and Modesty serves to get acquainted with Lobby's childhood and his days. <br /> <br /> Peter O 'Donnell was a creative consultant on the film, everything is really sounds right. Even the story tells O'Donnell how he carries the character. When I read all the books, I'm more than happy about the movie. <br /> <br /> Now Miramax keeps filming this movie with Quentin Tarrentino. Now I'm hoping to see more from heart, stories asap. Especially as a beautiful character of Willie Garvey, Modesty's character is truly alive. For this purpose, I hope the film is good in Europe. Miramax intends to distribute DVD in the United States. I suspect that in general, the United States will not be able to do this well. <br /> <br /> In the article, humility is in the 20s of Tanger Louche's casino. The Flashback sequence is very successful and has been modest since the age of 9, from its teens to its current age - about 21-22, I guess. I do not think it's a "perfect actress" for humility. For most of us, for humble fans, he is already a very powerful asset in our imaginations. Alexandra Staden is valid. He is very elegant, delicate and biased. He has a very close proximity. He has a great face - a good idea after the movie is over. According to Romero from Donnell's illustrator, modesty has a fuller picture than Staden, but I do not want to review it. If Staden continues in this role, I think he will grow up with it - just as humility becomes even stronger and more experienced. Staden delivers humor and absolute confidence in humble humor. Go and rent this movie is not like anything else you see, and though it's directed by Scott Spiegel, Tarrentino's touch is full of great sequences of camera actions, lighting and well-behaved.
