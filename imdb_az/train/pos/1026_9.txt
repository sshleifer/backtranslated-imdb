I'm very pleased with this show for two reasons. 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two performers performed with the support of regular and recurring actors. <br /> In the 9-10 seasons, the replacement of the RDA was enough to pull off the show. <br /> <br /> Among all the main characters, chemistry is just great. After stopping the camera, you get the feel of the dress around the actors. <br /> <br /> BDI gives her the identity of her 'O'Neill' character. He knows when to give his wise-hearted person a rest. You explain some of the others' comments with horror. <br /> <br /> One of the political processes is what happened between Carter and O'Neill. They manage to keep the lid, but often only. In the first part of the season, there were some of the best drama in the television series "Solitudes". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Carter and Jackson should often be overwhelmed by many turbulences emerging from O'Neill. However, 'O'Neillin' tactical instincts always sound. She realizes what to do without thinking about the issue. <br /> <br /> In 9 and 10 chapters quality has been reduced. Most of the original story was used and the new villains were never really used. I was interested. Ben Browder was much lower than the BMI when watching the show. He had rare moments with Claudia Black, but that was all. Amanda Tapping sounded in these two seasons. After seeing a baby, you can see its very changed appearance. <br /> <br /> Atlantis has a few minutes of memory, but it's a very weak effort. The main characters do not have the original casting chemistry. Wraiths are as incredible as ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Amanda Tapping can breathe some life into the program or will not continue until the end of the fourth season. <br /> <br /> For me, the problem with the show has always been a problem for me. The presence of Pyramid's predecessors is rarely a rarely created design in Sci-Fi. The use of torches for illumination of these ships is very bad. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to adopt the decorative use of concealing ultra-modern technology from Ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> I was interested in some of the feelings of sustainability in the show. At the opening of the season 2 'Daniel Jackson' was shot and there was a gap in the uniform. It creeps out of a spiral and creates its body and restores its shape, as is the case inside the wardrobe. The episode "Hathor" is a sarcophagus in the hands of the SGC, but it is never again mentioned. This device could be used in several episodes called 'Daniel', 'O'Neill' and 'Dr'. Frasier '.
