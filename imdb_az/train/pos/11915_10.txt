But how can you defeat a baseball team that can not win? George Knox is not easy. When the film opens, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) are biking around the angels stadium. When they returned to their homelands, Roger was glad to visit his father (Dermot Mulroney). Her mother is dead! When he asked his father when he was still a family, his father says, "I say when the angels win the championship." Then Roger and J.P angels play baseball. When the baker George Knox took his broom, his pitcher was naked and entered into a fight with him and soon entered into a fight with Knox's angels team. That night Roger is a prayer to win the championship. When his parents, Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agree that Roger and JP will go to a padball, Roger looks at the field in real angle and helps the left player (Matthew McConaughey) to eat and play - how did Jay O Sanders play? Roger learns that Christopher Lloyd can only see the angles because he is alone in praying for help. <br /> <br /> 10/10
