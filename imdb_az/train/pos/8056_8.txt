In 1935, the picture came face to face with Ocars, the best director, John Ford, actor Viktor McLaglen and Max Seiner. 42-year-old Victor McLaglen, "Call the Seas," has played a remarkable performance as an Irish rebels belonging to a rough and difficult nation, fighting for a reason and at the same time poorer and poorer, than drinking too much. Gypo Nolan made a wrong mistake when he decided to become an informer for his best friend to travel to America and travel a new lifestyle. Preston Foster (Don Gallagher), "Guadalcanal Diary", 43, has played a major role as the leader of the Irish rebellion and was worried about the band's information. Gypo Nolan can escape his betrayal and begins to feel just like a Judas. It's been a great movie for 1935, and McLaglen has done a great job, but it's hard to find everywhere on the film.
