At first glance, this movie does not look like a big one. After all Bette Davis films, only 166 votes and 6.5 ratings on IMDb should be pretty bad. <br /> <br /> <strong> </ font> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> This movie has two main characters performed by Bette Davis and George Brent. They have a movie with most entertaining characters, but the film basically covers two circles. Their character deals with the story of the most severe and intelligent writing, which is also conscious. <br /> <br /> This movie is very interesting (just over an hour), so the story does not waste time unnecessarily. plot lines, development, and symbols. This makes the film very fast, which, in line with today's standards, is a perfect way to watch this movie. Perhaps sometimes it makes the film a little simpler, but it can not go for entertainment or entertainment. <br /> <br /> A delightfully enjoyable simple romantic comedy to be seen more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
