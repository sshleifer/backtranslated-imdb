The man in the moon is turning into a warm and moving drama center around a farm family in the 1950s. The story is endless for a 14-year-old girl (Reese Witherspoon), an 17-year-old neighbor (Jason London), who ended up dying for her elderly sister (Emily Warfield) and how this unexpected tragedy changed the family's dynamics. In the 1950s, here's a love fit, and the scenario gives you the characters you are almost instantly interested in. Witherspoon already begins to show his Oscar winning abilities that he will develop in his early role and makes London a charming leading man. Warfield gives a quiet skill to the role of an effective elderly sister. Kudos to Sam Suston and Tess Harper who played the mom's parents and Gail Strickland who played London's mother. I suddenly transferred this drama to drama, which has a stronger sense of tranquility and impressive drama, which gives a deeper meaning to the word "family relationships."
