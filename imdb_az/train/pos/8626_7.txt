"Der Todesking" is a complete surprise for you? There are seven short episodes of Jörg Buttgereit's second sword monument, actually better than the very sad "Nekromantik"? One for every day of the week? it is becoming suicidal for non-affiliated people. Among the most disturbing episodes, Buttgereit adds a really terrible look to a body of a broken body. Not all episodes are equally strong, but effectively Der Todesking is the top list of all-time craft films. The events on Wednesday are extremely intense and destructive, attracting the attention of a young man who is dead, finding himself in a strange way of describing his sexual excitement on the park and one on Sunday. The added value of this movie or any other shockwave that is similar to it is controversial, and I'm not sure if Battgereit has any message to communicate here. There is an inexhaustible promise by readers to a succeeding chain letter that encourages suicide, but we do not have much knowledge to finish these people's motivation dramatically. Unlike absolutely, "Der Todesking" is a maintenance or repulsively graphic! On the contrary, it would be gentle and thoughtful to describe Buttgereit's suffering. The episode of the Thursday is a perfect example, because it shows a different view of a famous German bridge because the names, ages, and occupations of those who shot shots appear on the screen. Production values ​​are inevitable and regulation is often deprived of professionalism, but it is not really counting such kinemancy. Is the topic strong and makes us feel less glad? as well as indispensable? aspects of life. Use tragic music yet!
