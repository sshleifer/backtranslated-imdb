<br /> <br /> <strong> Ben Chaplin also as a shy, dull state officer. Male (and some women): Miss Kidman looks fantastic and very sympathetic. I forgot how beautiful a woman is. It is not difficult to imagine John's love for him. Unexpected turns in the story are somewhat good. Despite the happy ending, the final part of the film was a surprise to me. <br /> <br /> The result is a good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: huit points.
