The worst day of my life. <br /> <br /> I watched it only for two reasons: VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS: I looked stumbled upon this cute movie, and now I am ready to go out of a streetlamp and kiss. . But there is so much more. The field is actually a very clever and creative touch. Like a gambling comedy, this is all unpleasant misunderstanding. And of course there is ... VERA-ELLEN'S LEGS. <br /> <br /> The only unfortunate feature of this movie, the version I purchased (Mill Creek Entertainment's "100 Family Classics" collection) was the best video quality I've heard and the alpha version. Brightness and contrast are a bit higher, as Vera seems to be worn by many scenes while dancing in white clothes. But I think you can use your TV monitor to compensate for it. I can only imagine how '51 'appears on the big screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <strong> Congrats is not melodramatic, not melodramatic. Only 100% ahhhhhh. Very bad, weak juices, your indestructible life will not be so attractive. Every one of every. Wait, what laugh? My life is as bad as you are. Hell. It's time to watch this movie again.
