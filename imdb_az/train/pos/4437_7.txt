This is not worse than most of the police procedural era, and is less than just a little. Undoubtedly, it follows the steps of "Dragnet" and "Naked City", but it emerges as a good programmer. The best thing about this is an unprecedented appearance that has already become a world of the past ... New York in the 50s of the early 50's. From here to old school tattoos, from all the cheap hotels to oily spoons, it is in all its glory. <br /> <br /> These old-fashioned police films come as short-term trips to anyone who does not love past-day trips and today's sanitary, lifeless city treachery. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is the crime ... in this case, a woman who was beaten was found dead in a car. Our main heroes, Detectives Tobin and Corrigan, should do their legs, but they will not stay anywhere without the intense and neat efforts of "lab guys". Although the technology is not in the same league, the cops here are CS.I. <br /> <br /> You think some reviewers will be directed by Ed Wood as they write about this movie, and you will use their hands in addition to their films. What happened? I'm glad to see John Miles return to Tobin, the former Navy Police ... most of the film's episodes have been a successful, easy approach to the role of a pleasant change from the histrionics of ordinary stones. Patricia Barry is as sweet and delightful as her beloved lover who helps to solve abuse. Walter Kinsella was as excited as the old detective Corrigan. <br /> <br /> This secret is not too deep, it will not give up on the last chase and shooting. Criminal crime will not be among the classics, but soon Tattooed Stranger was more interested in me.
