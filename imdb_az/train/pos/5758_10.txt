This is one of the best action films of the 1970's. It is not a big cast, it is also full of single shots and explosions that are still effective today. The story is about a Vietnamese veteran (Kris Kristofferson), who was hired by his brother Jan-Michael Vincent to help clean up a criminal in a small town and took advantage of his position. Employer offenders to survive since that day. It's good to see you play against the type of chrysanthemum. Bernadette Peeters and Victorian Principles provide great support for the two men's worthy ladies. Jean-Michael shows the real movie star in this movie. I do not think Vigilante Force is on the video, but sometimes it is on television. A great flick for kids who love movies.
