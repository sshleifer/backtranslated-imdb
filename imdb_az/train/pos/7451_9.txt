Each family here will enjoy ... even those who consider themselves to be too old for stories. Shelley Duvall outdided himself with almost all the famous fairy tales about rare, creative childhood tales. Scripts offer new connections to older shadows that we grow up and have a few stars in every episode. "Cinderella" Duvall's standard is no exception, and I think this is one of the first 5 of the series shown by Jennifer Beals (I remember from Flashdance and today is taking a movie in Hollywood today). the roles of Jean Stapleton, the southern accent of the fairy-tale mother and Eve Arden, the embodiment of the evil-minded concept. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller Day Closhed") and Jane Alden are taking a hilarious twin. Matthew Broderick is a friendly Prince Henry. You will all be back to this!
