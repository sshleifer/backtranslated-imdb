The Blob is a fantastic flick of the classic 1950s B-movie. You probably know the story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) see a meteorite crashing on the floor and when they go to look for it, a weird castle that flies to a strange man ... Take it to the doctor's office and then go for it . From there, the block is spread, and everybody eats on its way. Special effects like the story make cheesy cheeses. There is a great deal of touch on the police in another region, like a police chess player. It is not a masterpiece, but a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
