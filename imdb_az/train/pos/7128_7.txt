This controversial John Thaw's best performance is to shake up the features of the Successive Inspector Morse and bring a perfect fit to the TV screen from the Tom's book. <br /> <br /> Along with this, it is a well-prepared product that keeps a family-friendly vibe, despite many adult issues, such as the beginning of the Second World War and physical abuse. But Tom and Young Willie are the heart and soul of this story. <br /> <br /> This is a young boy who is evacuated from London and an esteemed old man who has abandoned him - this is indecent and beautiful to see the relationship with a great father / grandchild. <br /> <br /> Because it's a big budget with a bigger budget, the market is not shown once or twice every afternoon in the afternoon. Taking the right leadership, John Thaw will be celebrating this day in the world and will be rewarded with many awards for his brilliant performance in this film. A great actor and a great role should be honored more than ever before.
