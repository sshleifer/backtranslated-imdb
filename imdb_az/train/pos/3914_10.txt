Personally, I think the movie is very professional, I love choreography and player. The area is grungy and mysterious. The film itself is very emotional, and I really liked that, and then you think. Antonio Gades has completely lived up to its roots and I have to say that this is one of my favorite pictures and Saura is a wonderful director.
