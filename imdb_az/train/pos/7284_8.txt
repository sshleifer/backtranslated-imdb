When I was young, I had very few films. My parents rented all their wisdom. I was scared of what the film was, but I was not even allowed to look at it. I had a brother and a brother, and that made me very angry. What have I done? In the late evening, I dropped the VCR off! He threw the television screen and called the police and informed them about the vandals. After being arrested, he was unable to come out of the TV before I came to the police. I was only talking with a voice and sent home. My parents, of course, justified me and tried to pay my debts for TV and VCR. It broke me, and slave labor really believed in me, but I had to do it. Works around the house. What happened at the end? For my work there is a large screen TV, DVD player and surround sound system. How did I get the money? Easily sold my own films and sold it to Disney! Do you remember to find Neno? Well, I wrote this movie and drew my gold in their fish tanks! Of course, they have re-written this field and have done it at CGI because they are not able to take action in real life as I have seen! Finally, the dying head did not see the movie and the rating I gave was my life rating! This is pretty good!
