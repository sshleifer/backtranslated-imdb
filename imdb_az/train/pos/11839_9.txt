This movie was very entertaining. Soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply amazing and inspirational. Brian Adams composes all the songs in French. <br /> <br /> This film is made of traditional animations with computer-generated pictures. The result is really striking. I watch this movie at least once a week with my kids, and we never miss it. Story is compulsory and good narration. <br /> <br /> I do not understand anyone who rated this movie as low as 7. There is a certain goalkeeper in my house.
