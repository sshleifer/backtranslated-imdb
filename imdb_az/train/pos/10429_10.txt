I'm not usually the admirer of romantic movies, but I've heard it's good. I was surprised. It's the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Stunning. Bright, sweet, funny and hearty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> "Chemistry" is perfect as writing and guidance. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are both natural and sweet. <br /> <br /> Movies shout directly to you and do not leave. You can not view the distant ones or stop listening to them. Even small moments are melting your heart. <br /> <br /> This was one of my favorite beloved ones. A work.
