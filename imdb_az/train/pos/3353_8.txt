This film is a powerful interpretation of the Italian people. The use of mirrors to enhance the mastery of the cartoon is wonderful, and I can not emphasize the beauty and beauty of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love them too. The way of mutual relations is so beautiful and natural that you can question whether the camera really is there. A husband with a small role is beautifully described as a fascist Italian who orders his wife and children, but he is also a loving father. The scenes starting with Hitler in Piazza Venice, all Italians are incredible and truly puts the film in a historic place. I liked the movie and I'm not much more popular, I agree that it's funny.
