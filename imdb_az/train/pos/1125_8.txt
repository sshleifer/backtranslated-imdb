Michael Cacoyannis had a relatively long career, but there are some striking little credits on his behalf, including a series of realistic lies, such as an unfounded cold warrior. Stubbornness is something. Adapted by Cacoyannis from the game by Euripides, this is a superb indicator of the classic tragedy and has recently made its first TV appearance on the Flix Channel of the United States. The film is epic, but it is not simply a "big" movie, but a simple story. It is surprising that Queen Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos) is forced to sacrifice her daughter, Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou), by Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are both striking, and confusing Papamoschou, who brings the most interesting elements, mixes childhood innocence by knowing that he is on a pedestrian street. Recommended for fans of international cinema.
