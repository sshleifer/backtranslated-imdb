Robert Siodmak, Ella Raines, Franchot Tone, and Alan Curtis play an incredible job with this B noir. And I can add that without the help of her male actors, Curtis and Tone. <br /> <br /> Siodman's use of sex, light, shadows and music is for no reason or otherwise in any way a "noir" He is really remarkable when fighting this genre. Shades, lighting effects and camera angles are all effective. But the feature of the movie happens in a nightclub with multiple drum riff, attracted by the very exciting Rains by Elisha Cook. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's financial commitment is only captured by Raines, and he gives a sincere performance as a woman trying to save her. Fran√ßoise Tone called this word. Alan Curtis was sorry that he would die and not be happy. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, many of these films have shown that as the Second World War progressed, the interest in psychiatry was deepening. But frequently, words have been misused in movies like Possessed, Spellbound, and Earth on the Greatest Show. Tone is called paranoid by Thomas Gomez - Tony is likely to have some paranoia in addition to his disorder, but he appears close to a psychopath. <br /> <br /> It could have been brain-like brain tumor, as proved by her husband's headache. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady is not the largest structure, but worth the look.
