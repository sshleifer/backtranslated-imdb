The beginning of this film is somewhat surprised and confused, but sit tight, because you are on the road to your life. The concept is interesting for interesting devices used to describe the general story. Where Phillip Seymour is the best player in Hoffman, there are wonderful performances - there is no surprise. Ethan Hawke also deserves a credit for a very strong performance. Directed by Mr. Lumet Direction. The film has seventy sections despite the risks involved in explaining this story, but unlike most of today's scenes, it's a tension-based relationship that is more sincere than special effects or product jams. This movie will be a great prize for the time spent.
