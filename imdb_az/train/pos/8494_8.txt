I saw this movie as a challenge to the re-management class. In particular they would comment on different management styles and their quality (product). I've been renting eighty-eight times and remembering that it's a good movie. I always liked Michael Keaton's style and delivery. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see some of the low prices for this movie. I give you, yes, the Oscars do not win, but there's a good comedy value. This is not entirely comedy fiction, but rather a gentle comedy. I also found some of those who felt that it was an inaccurate film on cultural and business differences. I differ. Again, you have a lot of general and dramatization, but still Hollywood movie documentary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> According to one of the Azerbaijani scholars, as part of the company. Teamwork highlighted. Perhaps the company has the advantage of everything. The type of labor that is more manageable verses of American workers. The individual was more important than the company. <br /> <br /> Another difference was how to assess the quality and whose responsibility it was. Many Japanese plant defects or problems stabilize when investigated and detected. As a character in the film, he said, "This was a problem with dealers (car dealers)." <br /> <br /> Many of these are likely to be dated, but I am sure that many US car makers are still struggling to meet the Japanese. If you are interested in American, European and Japanese automobile manufacturers, I can offer a book that is more thoroughly researched and in the same period. The book is called "The World Changing Machine" by James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos. There are a lot of car manufacturers at the time and the beginning of this movie. Parts are a little dry, but I think it will support the film very much.
