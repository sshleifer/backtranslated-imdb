The types of professors who were in touch were all figured out. Today's peoples living in Polynesia have moved to Tahiti from the East, the island to the east, east of the Asians, and to thousands of other exotic tropical islands of the South Pacific. However, certain thinking did not fit well with the Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If this explanation is true, how do some of those born and growing in these islands have traditions, art, and physical characteristics mentioned not from Asia but from South America? How can it look like Ecuador, Peru, and Chilean vegetation a few miles away? Islanders point to the sea in the direction of South America and were they not from where their ancestors ruled by Tiki, the same as Ali Adam? In the meantime, how do the Norwegians talk with Scandinavian executives charged with the South American continent, and with some indigenous peoples who are associated with them, go off the sea to the West? There is much to chance for Heyerdahl. Together with a group of crews and incredible amount of money, Moxie is launching an expedition with local knowledge for traditional sophistication. It is like a pseudo-scientific demonstration that says that such a journey is only possible with instruments and seafaring bases until a person's imagination. Oscar's winning documentary can be designated by tonality and Anglo-etnosentric approach, but the space program launched one year resembles the spirit of the best adventure. it is true. Beautiful. Give yourself a blessing and read the first book. This is a perfect piece of movie for an incredible page translator and movie character.
