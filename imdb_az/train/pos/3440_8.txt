Love Rosario Dawson, I think he is one of the best contemporary actresses. <br /> <br /> The direction is more likely to strengthen itself than anything else. It's a consistent part of everything in the movie. Dialog is straight, characters are deliberately weak and unilaterally visible. Only consistency symbolizes self-empowerment and directing Rosario to lose power and return to power. <br /> <br /> It's not right to work as a class of rape, so most of the movies do not rejoice at all. The standard 'rape' audience will not particularly love this movie, and maybe this point? The film requires more questions than answering, and they are opposed to the target audience whether they want it or not. There is an attractive connection between the heroes and the target audiences, and although the film audience does not face a fair trial, it links the viewer with all the wrong reasons. <Desc /> <br /> The landing is a good movie with IMHO's severely low price.
