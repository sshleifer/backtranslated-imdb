I have no idea why this flick can get such a bad reaction by many IMDb users (some say its "worst movie"). Did you ever see any of Cradle 2 The Grave?) The plot is an excuse to totally stupidity and hang all activity segments. Duh! What are you talking about Jet Li? Do you believe that a true human is thinking and then moves with action? Of course not! The Black Mask is awesome, moving from wall to wall all the time of its operation. This is a very unpleasant horror, and we get creative trails, signs, and signs that we have to watch for the bad guys (and some innocent people!). Lien's other martial arts films are children's schools compared to Black Mask; There is no refund for barefoot violence, bloodshed or movement! And that made me a happy camera. Still, if you're into a Jet Li movie waiting for a magnificent dialogue and an exciting plot, you're going for the wrong reasons. The Black Mask is probably my best movie (although it is a great way to avoid horrifying dubbing).
