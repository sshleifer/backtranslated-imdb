A meteorite falls from the sky and for a long time rebuilds a plesiosauru that uses the area around the Crater Lake to fight terrorism. <br /> <br /> There is a man in some countries trying to kill the monster. <br /> <br /> Old horror and science-fiction films, Cadavra and Alien Trespass's Lost Skeletons, and recent films like cryptographic monsters have been featured. These movies look like each other, and they only send those films, it's a real thing. Her film tries to be more entertaining in the cheek and in this regard. This is a movie with a future success, as Star Wars has changed as we look at special effects. The monster is a strange little monster, a seductive, blurry movement and life-size blend. Cinematographers often destroy the monster and his mayhem with pictures. Of course, it's not all fraud, but a movie about postponing küfürü? <br /> <br /> I love this movie in a low budget drive. If you want to look more realistic in the monster movie than a genuine driver. Similar lakes would be perfect for a double or triple feature with monster films (Boggy Creek etc).
