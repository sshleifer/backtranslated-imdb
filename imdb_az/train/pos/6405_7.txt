I thought Carl Brashear was pretty overdramatized for the effects of racism and prejudice Hollywood. I do not believe the US Navy is not an obvious racist. I can not imagine a full Captain, Commander, and I have never told anyone to intentionally close his head. Of course, his life risk. And no one except the WASP as DeNiro's character betrayed any prime minister. As he played, the headless and drunken head would never rise to the Master Chef. Cuba Gooding saved a bad movie in another way.
