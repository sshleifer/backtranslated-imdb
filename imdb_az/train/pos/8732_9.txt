I have recently been watching Tom Hanks movies and old Chaplin films and even some of Rowan Atkinson's first Bean performances, all of which have their own unique impressions of their work. audiences of all ages, just in a way that you feel good. Bug's Life has the same attraction, though they are still talking about real bugs, even if they talk to us because they have a touch with real life that allows us to stop infidelity and speak too much insects. <br /> <br /> This is like a team where the film is a way to bring a child to our minds, and this allows us to think, even imagining the way of a young thought. <br /> <br /> Honey, I was one of my favorite films on Shrunk Kids and for me, A Bug's Life was a breath of animation if it was a more realistic version of this movie, and if this style of story style opens up a lot, opportunities. I do not try to compare anything like Toy Story (still the best computer cartoon I've ever had), because A Bug's Life is not as good as Toy Story, and then it's almost nothing. The important thing is still good entertainment. <br /> <br /> This story relates to a colony of heavy worker insects with a highly developed society, the majority of nourishing locusts, power and general sense, and hopefully enough for bugs to do this throughout the winter leave left. Some visits from strawberries are treated so that the results will be terrible if insects are fed in unhealthy amounts. By chance, the similarities in this challenging level of food production are "Great Throwing!" It is strikingly surprising that Mao Tse-tung is fed from his own people during the period. <br /> <br /> Flik, ​​who is the main character of fun and excitement, is conducting a study to find a bunch of relevant warrior crises to return and defend the colony against locusts. As you can see, the disassembled dishes have been devastating and causing great danger to everyone, so it is responsible, but a group of insect circuits are starting to work. Great for spectators, not so great for clan safety. <br /> <br /> In the late 1990s, many films featured Armageddon and Deep Impact, Independence Day and Arrival, Birg's Life and Antz, Comparisons between Bug's Life and Antz are inevitable, although it seems clear to me that A Bug's Life is a superb film and is not just about screaming from the Woody Allen cortege and its lead role. It's a great family fun!
