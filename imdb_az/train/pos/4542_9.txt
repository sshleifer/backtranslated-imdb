Located in the center and ethics of Detroit, this comedy has found a great comedy duet. 'Noriyuki Pat Morita is a very excited person to be a police officer from Japan in the trap of an industrial secrets stealing the' proto-type 'turbo super charger, the thief who is reluctantly going to the US after being ordered by the commander. Pat's hero often talks with the character of "Jay Leno", but employer-type Detroit police. While passing roads, Japan's glorious 'Ways' all meet the Detroit police investigation 'Ways' old school. It looks like two times and walks around one another, but then prepares a 'rhythm', making it a team of two-storey powered, explosive device. After hitting the head of a stolen "prosperous" city and closing the case, they both refuse to work with each other and to work well with each other. It is a bit worse to wear and needs a vacation that stretches all over them - they are winning. I did appreciate it. 9. The direction of Lewis is 'a perfect comedy'. Entertaining for all ages. I offer it at a high level. (***)
