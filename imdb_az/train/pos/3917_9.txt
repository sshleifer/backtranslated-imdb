I first saw this movie when it was released in 1984 in the United States. What struck me about the film is the inclusion of art in the characters' lives and visas. Throughout the film, they are never interdependent, and sometimes they are not sure whether someone will watch the life of a single character or a scene. It continues until the height of the movie. After all these years, my friends and I love to discuss whether Carmen really has been stabbed. It is open to discussing the reactions from other characters, to stylized crime. The passion for dance, the quality of the actor, the art of love, and the glimmer of performances are combined to create a superior film that mixes and adds the lines between life and art.
