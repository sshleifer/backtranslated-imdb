<br /> <br /> This man leads the medieval safe life of a bank of John (Ben Chaplin). This movie really excited me. Nadia (Nicole Kidman), ordered by email from Russia, comes to life to become a beautiful, naked girl, to die for a little town, John's plan, until she dies. But a breakthrough occurs - Nadia is not a word of Johns. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> What happens next? In truth, the truth of the truth is that the poor John gave a subliminal message in the form of "perhaps acting in the same way" to the audience, turning to a thought-style movement, trembling from the insomnia of a worthy, paid, safe record. <br /> <br /> Kidman, Cassel & Kassovitz have created a great team of Russians, and almost, almost exclusively, thanks to the little emphasis they have in Russian. The words are made to sound correctly. <br /> <br /> Nicole Kidman once again proves her ability to play a completely different character from at least the roles of the cultural roots. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is fast and attractive and, of course, <br /> <br /> Refuse to look at the latest headlines, feel that you are in the middle of the section and leave it with the desire to see it later on. <br /> <br /> Quit my advice and get this movie right away and watch and enjoy. To sum it up, it has an unusual field, excellent performance, and ideas that are under the surface. Like the idea of ​​a "awakening awakening" of the artificial safe life of a single wheel in a society's machine, the life left by the Fight Club members and Pink Floyd's reading machine ("welcome to the car!"), Probably because John was not familiar with him Sophia. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the writers for the great writing, and everyone is a great movie! Please continue! You can show the place and location of the place, because the originality of the place is 99.9999 percent of potential viewers but I'm sure.
