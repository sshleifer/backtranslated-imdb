There is a lot to fall in Aro Tolbukh. En la mente del asesino (in the mind of a killer), it is very difficult to talk about it without warning. Let's say that this movie is a workout in cinema, but really great work has been done. Super 8, black and white boots, 35 millimeters, colors, interviews, flashbacks. Aro Tolbukhin goes on to wonder if you are wondering about the most spectacular view that a documentary or a viceversa did, does he ever really exist? The film follows the next life of a calf after arriving in Guatemala, worked in a religious post, and then killed some people. He was arrested and sentenced to death. The film begins because several French documentary artists are interested in this character, so it is interviewed before death. More and more people are now involved in the investigation of the character. <br /> <br /> We are witnessing this film. <br /> <br /> For the main part of history, we took Aro's mind to a half-slow stage to see what he did. Nevertheless, the most important thing is that cinematographers never give us one-sided thought; we have abandoned the judiciary for all of us, and even as we understand his deeds, we never regard them as justified. Thus, the first half of the data is reminiscent; <br /> <br /> <strong> Aro's childhood is an amazing new power (even harder or weaker). <br /> <br /> I do not want to say and I do not want to spoil one thing; so do not let alone, if you can bring this movie closer, I believe the ride is worth it.
