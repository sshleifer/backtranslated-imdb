This movie was incredible. There was an original concept (a vampire movie was captured by the Yakuza mob movie). It's a fun and very dramatic and tragic movie about friendship, love, immortality, death, happiness, and respect for society. The role of Sho by Gackt Camui was perfectly delivered and HYDE was strikingly surprised by his first film, such as the still humorous vampire Kei, subjected to torture. I also laughed and rejoiced happy, happy, happy, Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I liked every second of this movie, especially funny moments like Cigarette Smoke, martial arts, and most importantly, angry moments.
