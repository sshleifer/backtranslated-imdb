Yes, that's it. In fact, somewhere I have my first 20 favorite movies all the time. No. 15, I think. Anyway, I'm not a name for the columns, but the fields work better on anime and RPG video games (for example, Final Fantasy 7) and movies. But that's something. Vivid images of planets, stars, extremely well written scenarios. It is not really for children, but can watch it, does not include blood, drink and silicone. But I do not think they will understand it.
