This is one of the favorite films of all time. <br /> <br /> If you are a student of a library, like RENT, Parker Posey's character has long been fun and librarianistic motif, BU. Then get the poster and hang on the wall. The soundtrack is highly recommended. I've shown this movie more than any of your library friends - all happy.
