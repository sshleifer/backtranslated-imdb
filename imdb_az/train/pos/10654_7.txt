The Haunting is a really creepy home, with good effects on work and audible work, everything around is a movie that is realistic and a cast that you believe is home. There are scenes in the past that cause things to happen in Hill House, and I found it interesting. There are really creepy moments in the film, and I liked the dreams of the dash, the curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score led to the right atmosphere and the sound design increased the noise around you. The thing I want to do may be a little bit closer to something. He had a PG-13 rating to fight Jan De Bont, and I think he was a little too back. When I saw Poltergeist many years ago, I was scared and still fooled by me. Haunting could use a few pure scenes. The latter was for me, a little anticlimactic. In general, I liked it. Acting is good and there are moments that overcome you. Only they were more afraid of me.
