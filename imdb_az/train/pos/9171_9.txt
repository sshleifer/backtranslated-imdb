I'm Jane Eyre, my darling and a mysterious, and this version is almost full of important details of the book and is depicted when imagining the characters. Jane Eyre is a complex story of great wealth and can not be delivered properly in a feature length format, so you need a TV mini series. Timothy Dalton's Rochester is probably the best. There was much discussion about his age and his age. In the book, Jane describes her as "about 35", not young, yet middle-aged. I think that Timoten Dalton was about 38 years old, so it's right. Also, we just have the idea of ​​whether Jane Rochester is beautiful. He just introduced him and asks him what he thinks clearly. As an inexperienced and humble girl, I can not imagine she said she was beautiful. The actor playing in Rochester should show us the character of man, and it is done for perfection. I love the relationship between the two potentials that are important about this story and the humor of the encounters. Other versions exploded it, but that's right. <br /> <br /> While watching this series, the 2006 version of Toby Stephens (37 years old) continues on BBC1 and is really good, after watching the 2006 version, I decided that it was the best with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark! Charlotte Bronte's dialogue is important and is vital to the story's power. Modernization does not just work - it is a Victorian story and is compatible with archaic poetic words. This version has a great impact - Zelah Clark is small and the height difference between him and Rochester is important; Timothy Dalton has a real presence and an incredible actor. There is no additional scene to navigate from the scene, and scenarios contain all the important scenes, but delivers unnecessary details, allowing it to point and grab it. I advise all the right Jane Eyre fans.
