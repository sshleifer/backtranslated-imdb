I have a lot of time for all Columbo films, but this is particularly well written and finally the solution is very effective. Nevertheless, my main concern is to open a scene between Columbo and the murderer in the middle of the movie (I apologize for not remembering every detail about it). I noticed that Columbo was the most striking look: the appearance of the burning chamber inside the darkness of the wardrobe where the victim was killed and the daylight. Columbo sits on the door (and us), sits on the closet, and sits silently in the light, with great support. No sound. The camera slowly moves from the room and towards it. When he flies slowly upwards in thinking, he deeply meditates on the cigar cigar with a gentle smile. Then the dialogue begins. Perfect.
