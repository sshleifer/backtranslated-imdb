Despite the lack of logic in the storyline, Kill Shot is a high-class film. With a changing performance, Kasper Van Dien brilliantly describes the emotional gap between the awesome awesome father and his inexplicable son. Every member of the party is performing with a solid performance, highlighting the exciting work of a young Asian man who can not remember my name. A shocking catastrophe can endanger a few younger audiences, but an entire Kill Shot really kills one.
