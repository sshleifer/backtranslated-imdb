Kurosawa is preparing a story that is different from any Shakespeare drama, and the player is bound by the story while each story is part of a great fairy tale. Touching on all parts is funny and interesting. Let's remind you that the "Samurai hearts" and those who have been in the dicharous darkness of the 18th and 19th centuries say that the development of character is close, cinematography is vibrant and attractive and the story draws you. Japanese tales are not the best thing about Kurosawa. Perhaps the best, not even the worst, Kurosawa is better than the best. <br /> <br /> This story is timeless, though it has been so far in the past that it is based on raising ordinary people's secular lives during a major change. <br /> to those who will continue to read any movie space and, especially, the novel.
