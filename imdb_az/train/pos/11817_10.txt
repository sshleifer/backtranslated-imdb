When I was too young, I saw Dick Trasy. I did not know who the actors were and I did not know that the film was different than what it was looking at. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Warren Beatty, This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) killed a very powerful man and, after seeing his eyes on Tracy, went out of the city with his girlfriend, Breathless Mahoney (Madonna). It is worse because it is the worst part of the occupation and the worst crime: the offender has no face. He is not very known. Famous villas also returned from the comic books collection. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was colorful and creative. Especially watching as a child was entertaining and entertaining. Warren Beaty played Dick Tracy as James Bond in 1930. The film's ensemble is Charlie Korsmo, Glenn Headly, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, James Caan, Ed O Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Patinkin, Charles Durning. Already more! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a film for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy. Take my word for it.
