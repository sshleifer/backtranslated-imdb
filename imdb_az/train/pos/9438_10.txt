This is one of the biggest films ever made. All the time is classic. Ned Beatty's character is exposed to one of the biggest screen changes ever described. He is a shallow, almost useless, overweight insurance vendor. He is proud of his ignorance and still judges the "back doors" of ignorant ones. An elderly man answers his hat and the old man responds: "You do not know anything", the sound is adjusted. That is right. He really does not know anything. But a rear wood is then a anal rifle, the man is a practical warrior. His generous courageous boldness is a serious decision. The old man, who lives in the forest for a long time, lies in the footsteps of hundreds of feet. And what is our courageous guide to Lewis? Lewis is a philosopher / hunter / warrior and he's on nuts. Burt Reynolds showed himself as an actor in this film in 1972 and completely gave himself up in this wonderful role. To be like a lonely, perplexed danger, who does not want a friend like Lewis, we will be lucky enough to be as happy as we are in the world. This movie tells us a lot. The story is real. It works as a full action / adventure, with a beautiful cinematography, deliberately, immobile pacing. It works as a bit of horror film, "sow" faces threat and neutral reality, facing frustration with Ned Beatty. But at the same time, he works as an art movie using an incredible amount of characters to convey truths that reach truth. I have watched this movie at least fifty times, and every time I have to watch it. You need to watch it several times to understand it. This is a deep film. This is a good movie. This story is hell. I gave him 10 to 10 and put it among my 10 greatest movies, among others, along with Schindler's list, Casablanca, Taxi Driver, and Sling Blade. Thinking films. You should think of the movies you are taking. Movies that use STORY to excite you from trying to promote you. If you know you're about to get rid of it, you will not be able to do it again. This is really good.
