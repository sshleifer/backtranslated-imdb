A perfect movie, a true picture of modern Finland, touching and deep. She became one of the best Finnish films. In a small town in central Finland, the daily life of people's desires and weaknesses, joys and sorrows. The brilliant early autumn sun creates a cool atmosphere for this open-minded examination of people in a welfare society. Lampela is really one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. It shows that it is possible to capture films without machine guns and blood sheds. Her next film, Eila, also wants to see it, though it's not as universal as the Joki's fate in the story of cleaning women who are fighting for their work.
