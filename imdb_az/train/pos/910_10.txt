It is nice to see Suraj Barjatyan looking at the best. A story that touches around a marriage. It's a pleasure to have a movie because there's no scene that you'll never be afraid to watch with your family. The story is simple and does not have any new elements, but you love the movie because of the presentation, performances and really all the treatments. Hats for Syria .. The film is related to the engagement of love. Describing changes in the way you think happens is a great way to deal with it. The director is definitely thinking too much and the actors have done it for perfection. Though the film is slow, you do not object to it, because just because you're dealing with this kind of story, this is a new joy of employment. Like a typical RajShree material, the audience has a very emotional scene that is likely to drown in tears (especially ladies). But when you leave the movie hall, I'm very pleased and I think the price is :-).
