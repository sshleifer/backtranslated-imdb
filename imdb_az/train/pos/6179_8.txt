It's good to see Vintage Film Buff properly classifying the "perfect DVD" as "musical", so this movie is clean and straightforward. As an unofficial amendment, the Murder in the Yel Mine (1949), The Crime Preview, Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael, Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball, Beryl Wallace, Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry, and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is in his hands to give a strong vote to "Cocktails Two". Surely, the most popular song of the movie, at least four times. However, it is not Gertrude Michael, who is demonstrating his strong performance as a girlfriend rejected by her, not just "Sweet Marijauna". As for the rest of the flood, we can do it completely without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen. The only good thing about Oaki's role is to run with Toby Wing, the weakest canvas symbol. In fact, the Unscrupulous Inspector McLaglen can not simply put the murderer to give an idea of ​​how far the rest of the comedy has gone too far and is in a tense situation, but in that case you are the one most suspected. Director Mitch Leisen is a great hijack to invite you to the most terrible member of the movie demonstrators who are killing themselves after coming close to an interesting player.
