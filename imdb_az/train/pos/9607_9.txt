This is a film that can be seen by anyone who is interested in eating disorders, influential or suffering. It describes the incredibly accurate and sensitive description of a teenage girl's bulimia, its causes and symptoms. The girl is performed by one of the brightest young actresses in the cinema today. Later, Alison Lohman, also known as "Where the Truth Lies" I will recommend this movie to all schools because you will not see anything better in this regard. Alison Lohman is absolutely superior, and it is a miracle in the ability of a girl suffering from a compulsive illness. If Barometers show us air pressure, Alison Lohman gives us the same emotional pressure with the same accuracy. His emotional range is so precise that every scene is microscopically measured for trauma transitions, increasing hysteria and desperation reaching intolerable density. Mare Winningham is a perfect choice to play with her mother and doing so with a great sense of humor and a lot of emotion, like Lohman. Together they resonate with each other sensitive emotional oscillators. This film is a truly amazing achievement, and director Katt Shi should be proud of it. The only reason for not seeing this is not interested in people. But if you love the best films of nature, it's after the behavior of all the animals in the sharp edge. Bulimia is an overwhelming version of a painful soul that can destroy its body in the rage of hopelessness. And if we do not get angry with those who suffer from despair, they are dead inside us.
