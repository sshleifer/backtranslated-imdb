For a long time, I will review the latest film for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Metro Manila Film Festival) was replaced for the second time. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> It was accepted that he did not do such a good job at the box office, because MMFF is very family is the season when he goes to the cinema. it is interesting to see a movie that does not appear in English or English. I thought Cesar Montano was doing well as star and director. His great vision and creativity really helped this movie. He was also very influential as a leading star and could express many different feelings needed for the film. She was also a good performing actor, Rebecca Lusterio. He did a great job of describing Brigha, the younger sister of Duroy. It can be seen in more film projects in the future, perhaps in other genres. I really think that this film is in the local dialect really helped. <br /> <br /> Some of the camera shots in the film have done a very good job. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of life, I feel that writers can draw more and more into the lives of smaller characters. movie Of course, we're not confused about the story of this movie.
