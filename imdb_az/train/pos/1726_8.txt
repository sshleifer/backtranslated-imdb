When I was thinking of the "Big Escape", I let my childhood go back to this little ship of a movie. I read my autobiographical novel from 1949 and read it again and when it comes to the only movie in the city that shows "foreign" movies (we've never used that word), my ticket. <br /> <br /> As one of the war-time advocacy and propaganda films during the Second World War, I was interested in investigating the realities of the conflict in the stories and stories of men. Later on, he was willingly made for years to buy any books on this subject, and Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque provided even more sensitivity to reading some of the great novels. <br /> <br /> Black-and-white film was not so good as it was in the Middle Ages. I have never seen the technological version of the war, which is actually seen as the deep bloom of films like The Wooden Horse. <br /> <br /> Let's note that, according to the US embassy in Azerbaijan, in the film. Not even Sir Alec.
