It's a good thing that a movie is hired before seeing the viewer's rating from this site. I was going to add a Christmas selection that was a nice movie. Cast is great and Ben Affleck plays a good lead role. I would say to the viewers who did not see the film going on and bought. I've compared Christmas there. The film was very funny and well written and Ben played eccentrically rich performance. He says, and what you do is to imagine a person who moves too much money. The movie is more funnier than Christmas with Santa Claus and The Kranks. Moreover, he teaches the true meaning of Milad, which has a good storyline and can not get enough money.
