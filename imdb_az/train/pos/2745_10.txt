I've seen many films, but the Cold Blood alone stands in a classroom. Superior in every department. The fact that a few starred stars is more than a marquee, pushing it over and over when it comes to more stories and their stories. Blake and Wilson perform in the speeches of the killer duo. Most of the films are shot wherever there is a movie, even when the film is shot inside the house. The black / white photography is dark and the photography is awesome. There are many prominent movies, but if I could vote on a list, it would probably be "Cold Blood".
