<br /> <br /> Debra Winger is always interested, and although this is the oldest role for her, it's as good as Cissy, the wrong girl <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn An agreement with a previous research, he will be replaced by the city's slicker Madolyn Smith as an opponent, driven by a trailer with Bud (Travolta), used for dryness, thrown into the ant to create confusion; <br /> <br /> Even though I am from the east, most of us are not like "Saturday Night Fires", but the constant stereotypes are far from critical. this is the point. <br /> <br /> Debra Winger is worth seeing; it is still very unpleasant, and today we have been greeted with Hollywood actors for a long time. 7/10
