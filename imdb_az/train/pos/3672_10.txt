A mock documentary about a pair of Canadian manufacturer Bobby Myers (Matthew Modine) and Paul Linder (Saul Rubinek), who is trying to shoot his first movie in the late 1970s. Hollywood North is a comic story of fighting for everything together, although there are many conflicting issues <br /> <br /> Hollywood North, this Spinal Tap (1984) is so good that it works in a way that works well. That is, in some ways, exaggerated, it is very close to the truth, and the truth is the facts behind the scenes, which are very different from the public. In the late 1970's, filming in Canada was not easy, and this could be particularly challenging. The films are dozens or even hundreds of them. Many have dissatisfied wishes, motivations, and personalities. Financiers and screenshots are very important, as the film's filmmaking or stubbornness at any stage of the film's production can be very important, or it may endanger all work that requires complete restructuring or completely abandoned. <Br /> So it's not surprising that Hollywood is focused on such relationships. At the same time, there is also a cheerful and tragic movie. The scenario is flawless and the performances are top-of-the-line. This is a must for any movie maker and everyone who has a great interest in filmmaking. <br /> <br /> For every audience, intelligence model and humor should be more entertaining. <br /> <br /> I'm 10 in my 10's.
