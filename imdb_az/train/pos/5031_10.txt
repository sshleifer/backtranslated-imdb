This movie is beautifully prepared! There is no defect. In the design of the set, no lighting, no sounds, no plot. <br /> <br /> Paxton is the best in this role. His behavior, the infections that are used in the sounds of his voice, are the salvation. Each shot is carefully completed! When the first hour of the movie passes, the surprises are followed by one another. This can not be the best of the year, but a very polished stone. Not for simple thinking.
