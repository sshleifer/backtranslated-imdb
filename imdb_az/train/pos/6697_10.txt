I remember Sabrina for the first time when I was 13/14 on TV in UK TV. I was 24 years old and still love it while watching for the first time. I still stick some of my friends to watch a "kids show", but I do not like it! lol like Caroline Rhea "Hilda" was my personal favorite character and Morgan was also one of my favorite characters. I think that they often spend a lot of time to organize special events in honor of Saberina TV on Nickeleoden UK. I love Mellissa Joan Hart, "Clarrissa All Explains" was also very good, but that's so good. When I decided to finish it, I was closed! Hopefully soon will be released on DVD in UK - I will be in the first place! lol x
