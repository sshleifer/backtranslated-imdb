After seeing the movie, the true magic of Walt Disney films came to me and I realized that I was seeing a real "magic" in a movie long ago. <br /> <br/> Right music, speeches, and magic effects bring your Disney feeling back to your body. <br /> <br /> The effects that you do not know in the film have begun from the place where Disney logo turned into a Cinderella castle. <br /> <br /> I have a magic rule. I download this movie from 10 to 8.
