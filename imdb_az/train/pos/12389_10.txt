This time I saw this Halloween missed with normal, run-of-the-mill staple films to watch, so I hoped again that my horror waters again revolve, "The Sentinel" took a chance. In mind, I just came back to see Dark Castle remake - The House on The Haunted Hill - full and utter shit. Fortunately, "The Sentinel" is a GREAT ME! In a story story about a model moving in a creepy building in Brooklyn High, the movie offered everything I wanted to find in a good movie - Campy and fantastic juicy symbols, exchange and dialogue, Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and Martin Balsam, like a professor who does not give a thought - (2) Terrible Terror! Not a square away, but in this movie there are scenes that pancreas me cool - (3) Fantastic gore, awesome makeup and spectacular (if not very unequal) direction, to make this non-realistic treatment. "Dead Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - if you love it, it will be your favorite queen. To emphasize only my love for this film - I watched for the first time and then jawed it and re-assembled it and watched it again. Now it is one of the favorites of all time. Give yourself a blessing and check it!
