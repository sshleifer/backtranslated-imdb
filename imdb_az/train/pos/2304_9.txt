I thought this movie was very good. From the mid-1950s, everything looked exactly to me. It was good casting and convincing. I do not care too much for such films because they are not just deep, but I've felt that this movie feels like it, and you feel how they feel, you really know them, and you need them to care. It was back in my youth and reminded me of a more sinful time. This movie can be used by both men and women and by all age groups. After the film was over, it consisted of two parts. I would like to know what happened to Dani and his family. This movie should be classic. If you have not seen it, you should try to catch it on television or rent ...
