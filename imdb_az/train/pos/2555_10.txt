The whole movie was great. The book is better. But the film was all bad. It was interesting to say the least. Although I really wanted to say that the site was actually interested in the movie itself, it did not stop enough to watch me. Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are nice enough to follow you :) There are several lovely scenes that they should apply for romants. Generally I would give the movie 7 or 8. It was not bad, only a little plot area was wise.
