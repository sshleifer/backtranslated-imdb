Director Miike Takashi is very good. It is very difficult to put words. Approximately fifteen years ago, the target audience was larger than me, and I was impressed by it from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Movies similar to the 1980s have been reminded that these films were not afraid of being scared - I discovered that there was something very bad about what I found most adverse things at first, but it was not something that I grew up soon after. The film is the design of the 80th child film conventions. As you know, there is a young boy's hero burying himself in another one of his unhappy / unemployed world with mythical and mystical goblins; a quest to save both worlds from an evil power; she has a crush, a beautiful heroine; a sadistic hunter (Go-Go Yubari Kill Bill Vol 1); The victim of the evil of all people in the world can belong to a person. <br /> <br /> One of the reviews of the IDDB is "Where am I when I was a kid in this movie?" He says. and I wholeheartedly agree. When I watched, I did not grow up there; My Childhood Labyrinth is not a part of the Universe Masters, and less of The Neverending Story. <br /> <br /> Poor CGI is a part of movies that are sometimes linked to budget restrictions, but simply as an artistic choice - a desire to present things in a cunning way. Here, CGI largely depends on budget constraints, but there's a wonderful job to do. <br /> <br /> CG effects combine to create a world full of traditional puppets, animatronics and really extraordinary makeup with a character (and characteristic). movies never. <br /> <br /> <strong> Not for children in the Caucasus or more vulnerable. Look for yourself and show them if you think your children can handle it. Grow up as a little bit to grow up in the Great Jay War.
