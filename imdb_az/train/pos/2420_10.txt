If you enjoy the delicate movements and reactions of John Candy, you can not help this movie (the words "full" by Salvatore DiPasquale). A rude (and unrecognized) guard has always seen Åžekeri as a vast actor - a great belt. And sometimes it was ("Strips" and "Splash"). But when it is given, it can be really sharp and extremely subtle. It's just too bad because it's thrown into a lot of roles that just show up in the broader range because we do not see each other more. Oh, yes, the movie. With Caddyshack, you can overcome Berserk Going (I know). Only good. Although the soil is a bit complicated, it is really deep enough for such a Persian. Sweets and always allow you to quit Joe Flaherty and Eugene Levy's Candy ... and they HARD Bounce. An absolute look for anyone who loves other things of SCTV or Candyin.
