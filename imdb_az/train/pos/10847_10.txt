I'm 60 years old, guitarist (lead / rhythm) and have been in four groups for the last forty years, there's everything there, battles, foul-ups, rotten food, worse habits, always traveling, little or no money and everyone drunk or was high. But clubs, admirers and music have valued it! Like strange fruits! Now I'm cursed for it, and the hip and arthritis in the hands does not mean to rock more, it's back to the length of that video and it's all there! Birds, wars and fuss! Again, I'm new! It's just about Billy Connolly's voice, God loves more than 70! Forever On Rock!
