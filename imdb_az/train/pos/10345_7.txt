From this date, re-review of this movie really touches the stars and the film itself. I like to read a lot of user comments, I want to give you an idea of ​​what I can not say about the movie. This is a failure when there are not many commentaries for a particular tile because you can not get an idea of ​​what you are expecting when you are just reviewing and unwittingly kicking and carrying the movie. I watched before watching this title and I do not know where all the poisons are for this movie and stars. Douglas and Blondell were both talented and attractive, even though the material was not the greatest. The film and performance are entertaining and pleasant. It's not one of the greatest classics of all time, it's a very fun and funny sabotage than you can hope in the newest movies. If you are an admirer of these stars, you will not be disappointed.
