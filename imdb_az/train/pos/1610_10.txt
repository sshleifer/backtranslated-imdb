I do not think that many films (especially comedies) created a memorable, valuable dialogue such as MOONSTRUCK. I will not show it - you can see a list of a long list of long-term topics - but any film that can memorize specific topics such as using copper pipes, which is more expensive than rice, for dehydration purposes, is good for me. It is not the only line in our memory. A married bachelors mean a loss of a client because of a regrettable change from a planned marriage proposal to a restaurant waitress? Or is it a beautiful, old dog enthusiast that prompts you to cry every month? Or Perry (John Mahoney) is a young man's word, 'Moonlight in Martini' (my favorite line). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> MOONSTRUCK is a brilliant script, cast the perfect fit ensemble. There are other examples (drama is another example of THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, but one scary one). Cher, Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, Nicholas Cage, John Mahoney, and Danny Aiello are involved in the areas and goals they think of the nature of love and how they are governed. Is it good to be completely in love? Cher and Cage think so at the end, but Dukakis knows that true love manages the individual fraud (and Cage performs that kind of thing out of the house after disputing back to La Leyla) Boheme. People go one way to avoid immortality. Dukakis thinks so, and (quite unusual, though not quite convincing) Aiello. Luck opens the poverty - Dukakis is early to realize that Gardenia's strange behavior is bound to faithfulness, and Cher looks like Gardenia and his girlfriend in the opera (but Gardenia also gives Aiello-a Sherin unique loyalty). <br /> <br /> Fyodor Chaliapin is stumbles about Dukakis who goes with John Mahoney and is in contact with her. <br /> <br /> There are also few moments in the film. Observation of flowers giving flower to one of them. He listened to his drink shop and made a resolution. But following the best of Louis Guss and Julie Bovasson, Cherin's cousin and Ms. Raymond and Rita Cappomaggi and Rita's are some of the coolest and striking comments about Raymond's moonlight effects. <br /> <br /> It is the most favorite moment of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It is close to the perfect movie. Once you have seen it for eleven years, you'll find two points that are not exactly what they should look like. When Cage was in the dining room, Chrissy (Nada Despotovich) recalls how Cage secretly was, but he was afraid to tell him. Previously, Cher was approaching his place frequently. But nothing in this potential competition is seen. At the same time, the film that Sher had forgotten to make his daily business profits, his uncle and his wife, was brought to him in a moment of 7 minutes - but soon fell. Was it possible that there were a number of truncheons, except for one in Sham and Vincent Gardenia, a homeless man's shelter? This is a minor anxiety, but it is based on the desire to see more of this movie because it's very good.
