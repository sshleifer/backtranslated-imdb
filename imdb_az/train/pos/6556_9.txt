I really enjoyed this movie. A single father with my 17 year old daughter, who is smart, athletic and talented. I felt so good to help my daughter solve her problems and help others! For me it's probably PG level Fantasyland. Many Nancy Drew's books have long been read in teenage years. Certainly, this character was played by Emma Roberts, but I remember Nancy Drew. <br /> <br /> Emma is a beloved young man with very good behavior and good taste, self-confident, hardworking and proud. It does not have fashion competitiveness around it. The book does not look like Nancy Drew, and we are trying to figure out what we have for decades (eg CAR). <br /> <br /> I've read IMDb before watching the film and exploring Rachael Leigh Cook from other films. This is not one of his best roles, but I will continue to seek more of his films. <br /> <br /> Rachael was too old to play this device, but she did a great job as a hidden center, with no age. <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed with other reviews written here. Someone is in perfect touch with books, others are more secure or waiting for an adult movie. I bought what I expected! Beautiful fun focuses on young girls, their fathers wanting good kids and good behavior. This is Teen PG movie, not James Bond! What role model do you need for your teenage girl?
