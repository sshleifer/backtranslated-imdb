"Cypher" is a well-thought-out story about industrial espionage in America in a very distant future. Although it's not, of course, complex, it offers different perspectives on individual loyalty, relentlessness and corruption. This film attempts to represent modern organization groups and companies as contract workers are insensitive to the risks involved in their names. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), a moderately inexperienced filmmaker, calls on the digicorp team to work as a secretive operative. After a pre-briefing with the Digicorp Security Chief, Sullivan is given a new personality (Jack Thursby) and sent to the business congress by mentioning the performance of different promoters on different marketing strategies. After successfully completing his first assignment, Sullivan / Thursby is sent to more missions to obtain the same information previously collected. However, one of the "business trips" encountered a woman named Rita Foster, who had met her earlier assignment and was surprised. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Digicorp <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vivid lighting was mainly used in domestic / home environment, and many shadows and dark colors were used for deceptive and coating-related settings. I was very impressed with Jeremy Northam. She often saw her in the lead role and was actually a married man who did not leave the state of Wisconsin. Personally, I think it is one of the many actors used in the industry that has not been given more difficult role. Lucy Liu was also incredible, and gave the film a real trousers and daggers. Additionally, the rest of the supporting players was a great job, but my only complaint could have been to examine some of the more complicated and interconnected characters. For example, I would like to see what happens if Jack Beyshby is closer to his second "spouse." Generally, this is a cleverly developed secret and dagger story that you have been highly estimating about whether you are personally or professionally motivated and that everyone in the film is safe. With a smart and chic soundtrack and great camera work, this movie creates a sense of fear that corporations can operate in the near future. I was surprised to have never seen this "hidden stone" before. This is a brilliant, very extreme spy triller, and therefore I give you 10 to 9.
