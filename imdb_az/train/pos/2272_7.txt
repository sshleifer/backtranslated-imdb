Nick Nolte shows a beautiful performance in the dark tale of Kurt Vonnegut. Noteworthy is Howard W. Campbell, a dual agent working in the field of propaganda during World War II. After the war, rival groups live anonymously until they want to win their past. As in the case of Vonnegut, this is the thought of the war's absurdity and those who use propaganda for their own purposes. Nolte is fantastic - like a young, Campbell, self-confident and confident, and then frustrated and cunning, like the old man who had to be thrown out for the sins of the past. (From 7 to 7)
