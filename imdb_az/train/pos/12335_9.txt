Warning: Includes a spoiler. Rooted plot and in many cases terrible action. Fontaine is great, but others, especially Ivy's husband, Richard Ney, are very trees. Ney dies in bed, arsenic dies without poisoning, with every hair on the ground. But the film is very juicy and suspenseful. More loyal than most of the film's own era. Joan Fontaine was brutally beaten as a poisoner (something that was brutally similar - I'm not happy, children). He's just his usual Joan Fontainey himself. As the murderers are supposed to do, it is dying of "the foremost ground".
