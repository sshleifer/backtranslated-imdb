This is a fun movie with Almodovar's works. But a 10-year-old child has breastfeeded milk, but the style is so playful that I can not understand the readers who break or shatter the disease (but I can not play my 10-year-old son)? It's not so sure!). Spanish cinema is often quite sexy, but very open and healthy, the viewer feels without voyeurism or kink. I think if we have the same position as the Northern European species, we would be better off. <br /> <br /> This liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious "Fartman Maurice" character. She says to her lover: "Many are embarrassed about your farting, and you turn art into a form of art."
