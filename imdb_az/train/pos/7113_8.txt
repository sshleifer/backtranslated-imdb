Located in Philadelphia and showing great interest in local history, this film presents the Philadelphia grapes in the 1940s. There is a city center, a still station that still does not exist, yet still the 30th station station and the scenes in the north-western part of the city. Later, their good shooting of their old roof houses. The film is sometimes a little "talk" - the viewer loses interest in the shortfall ... but the story is solid and very moving. Anyone enjoying this movie should also try to see the "Bright Victory" movie with local views of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA - and scenes from Phoenixville. Army Hospital has become a university campus since. None of these films are in any format, and why I can not imagine it. As I've seen in the TCM in recent years, I also have notes on the VHS home. I invite them to any other historical sites except my own!
