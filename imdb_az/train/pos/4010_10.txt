In my opinion, this is one of the best illustrations on the TV, and remains one of the most loyal to a certain period of time. <br /> <br /> This series also respects the Superman films. The "Superman" series series "reboot" in the early 1980s ("Man of Steel", "Superman Vol 2", "Action Comics", "Superman Adventures" etc.) in the 1980s. The opening account and their names were mixed on the John Williams account based on the updated series for Saturday's action series. Marv Wolfman, one of the key participants for the comic reboot (writer "Superman Adventures") was a perfect choice to attend this animated series. Generally, the series had a much more mature part while still very child friendly. <br /> <br /> Superman was presented in an incredible, powerful and double way. His recurring ghost Lex Luthor was embodied in the megalomaniac / CEO. Daily Planet symbols are well illustrated by Lois, Jimmy and Perry. One of my favorite pictures was Wonder Woman and the story turned around Themyscira's home island ("Paradise Island"). Her design, as well as her mother Hippolyte, coincided with the Wonder Woman comic book series performed at the same time, and could have been prepared for a series of well-done works if it were done the same. <Br / <br /> What's hard to believe is that this DVD / Blu-ray is not broadcast! This is worth it.
