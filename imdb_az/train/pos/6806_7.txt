Ernst Marischka, one of the most esteemed Austrian filmmakers of the then era, has made beautiful scenes, sensitive love and respect for everyone who is valuable in life. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, people associate Marischka with the SISSI trilogy (1955, 1956, 1957) if people should hear about it. However, DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONYGIN made other brilliant films showing Queen's years. Although I'm a little different from SISSI films, I do not see much difference between this movie and the SISSI. <br /> <br /> This movie is almost identical. Style, music, photography. In fact, the crew is almost identical. Anton Profes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> Casting ... Romy Schneider's first major role. This film was a beautiful introduction to Sissi's role as it was made a year before the first part of the trilogy of the Austrian empire. Romy's mother Magda Schneider is a movie starring. But Ernst Marischka is not the first director to play Romy's mother. The first novel of the novel was WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953) and his mother's performance. Therefore, he started his Austrian career on the basis of his mother's fame. Indeed, here's a truth. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, like SISSI, this film shows love very softly. Victoria acquainted Prince Albert with a small dynasty in Dover. Their sympathy is based on pure humor when dancing and delicate smile. And now ...? What would it be like? Only sex ... But is love the only thing to do? <br /> Thanks to Ernst Marischka for these films. He had a spirit and a message. Some people will tell them kitschy, but I will not admire these movies. They are imperative! THE GREATEST, GREAT!
