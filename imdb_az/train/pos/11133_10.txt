I really love this movie, though I can watch it, it's true. So, I left it this evening and ran to my computer bank. I clearly remembered it, but wanted to see if I could find something I did not see at first ........ I did not do it because it was real to me. <br /> <br /> The other "user" should be a summary of the age of the authors. I'm all this! Many people who comment on Midnight Cowboy may not have been born during their release. They say that other films, John Voight and Dustin Hoffman, appear later. And I will destroy: I am 82 years old. If you meet some of my other comments, I know that you are up to 60 professional women impersonators from that year, and you know you're in the movie - even if you meet me, you do not recognize me in my night-club personality. Do you think I know so much about the characters in this movie? <br /> <br /> According to some reports, if you do not run into some of them, this is your loss - but you have a great chance, but it did not. Many mothers, fathers, sons and daughters can surprise you. Not many players / actresses emerged from Midnight Cowboy. Who is the Judge? A few, raised on the horrid streets of many cities, can be called the current BIG-TIME stars and have not suffered less than their time spent there. I do not judge anything because they are human beings, as we all call love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, modesty: attributes are all there, whatever the package. <br /> <br /> Hoffman's "trivia" actually entreats the streets to prove that he can play the role of "Ratzo" - a stone - how do you think he'll handle the car around Los Angeles - its entrance? I can also name a lot of people staring in the streets and watching sticks with money. The night club I worked in for the last 26 years was world-renowned and legitimate, although I can also name some of the great stars who want to move away from our backyards. <br /> <br /> Although Hollywood and other cities have a big and small action, it should not be a surprise today. Wear and smell the scent. <br /> <br /> Some "users" were plundered by "Joe Buck" grandmother. I saw him with a man in his bed, although there was no incident. Believe me that children do not always have their own room - because today it is a must have a little strange in the main line. Whose job? Hoffman could have been begging for change in the streets, but some of his "users" showed that Jon Voight was not a big star in the filming of the Midnight Cowboy - your real salary would surprise you. I think he was robbed! Nobody can doubt the clarity he puts on his role, nor does it form a star for a great job like the Savior. He identified a powerful man who conquered his devils and was better for him: several people were coined in this film. There is no homosexuality between Ratzo and Joe: they could have been one of the first open films in the late 1960s, but the community was always hip. contrary to one another. They found a very clean relationship - a true friendship. If you did not understand this at the end of the movie, you waste your time. "Joe's" was shocked, but unashamed loyalty became clear. Yes, Voight was awarded an Oscar for this role - John Wayne could never go out and he was beautiful in youth. <br /> <br /> Hoffman Hoffman - you are waiting for fireworks. He gave them perfect. Wayne took his Oscars. Every character in this movie has been beautifully defined - if you do not think you're still around, you're wrong. "Party"? <br /> <br /> If you come in, look at the lines of those who want to get into hot clubs - you see all kinds of betrayal. <br /> <br / Brenda Viccaro was some of the frail women in the community that sometimes had to go astray. <br /> <br /> If you are shocked by his brilliant movement, look at "the ladies" on the brink of sin, thinking "it is not real" and praise for it. <br /> <br /> "Joe's cruelty, which the old man stole from, is, unfortunately, a part of life. It is not necessary to wait for it, but it is not very different from any violence. "Joe" purposely called his goal - in this case, I would give faster money than I did not want to. This is one of those scenes that do not watch the movie. I also have a heart failure for both of them ... <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger should be aware of this fear in order to direct this compassionate eye opulence - Waldo Salt has never written the analogy. Anyone who has access to the screen understands that they have history, and should be proud of their honesty. Maybe in "America alone" we can close our eyes to unpleasant situations, and other film artists will not make it public. Even though it is not there, give me the truth every time. Bravo! all ......
