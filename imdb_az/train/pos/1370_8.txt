For the first time, I remember seeing Parker Posey's performance this year ago. The movie was also pretty good. For anyone who spent a little more time in the nightclub / after-hour scene, this movie will be a special attraction for you. It is very serious, not very funny, and Parker Posey is definitely blazes in his talented way with this indie gem. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < And many other films could have taped on how to propagate this movie and impartial responsibilities. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
