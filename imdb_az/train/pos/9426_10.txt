This is one of the funniest series! My sides were divided and laughed. Only if someone is released in America. Region 0 or 1 - Take Non-PAL. <br /> <br /> I know the release in the UK, but there are also Region 2 and PAL! Let's just shake this series. America should know this series. Moffat is a genius. I liked the strange and strange role of Trace Bennett on this subject. Of course, I liked Fiona Gillies! But Traci was a treasure! <br /> <br /> Leave this show in America! or again on PBS stations. I'll laugh and laugh again! Please Please! Please! <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading.
