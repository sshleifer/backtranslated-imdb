"Jared Diamond puts a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world did not have the animals to marry, but the Europeans did it, and why we could invent steel and complex machines." --- It is clear that the person writing this comment does not understand the background behind this documentary or the original book. Please do not destroy this huge piece with your simple thought. The reasons for this are more complicated than just the one you mention. Read the book as it is a great source of information. I really liked it. This book is even taught in some universities as a textbook.
