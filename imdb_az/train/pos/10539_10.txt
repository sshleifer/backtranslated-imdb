It's a good movie, but it's not advisable if you do not like smart movies. There are about two boys who want to get away from the world, and what exactly is it. Acting is great, the latter was unpredictable, and in reality it was a good story, unlike many films these days. People are complaining about a very simple or very boring movie. I must adhere to films such as Toxic Avenger (like B films) or Billy and Mandy's The Grim Adventures. One note: If you notice it, it has the exact same actors of the Cube, except for four actors. Two Signs: Wait after the loans (trust me). Enjoy movie.
