It's been a long time since I've seen this mini-series, and I'm happy to go against the time trial that I remember. <br /> <br /> Most of the components of the "A Perfect Spy", in my opinion, are the top-up of adapting LeCarré's best novel. <br /> <br /> Alec Guinness and Arthur Hopcraft, author of the Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, a musical score and masterpiece he wrote several years ago. <Br /> Actors are very nice, as Alan Howard's Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally's Ricky Pym. Peter Egan is interested in watching, because his face changes with every camera angle. The impact of time and the impact on the characters' physical appearance is very believable. So I was surprised at how strange Peter Egan was during the shooting. The character Magnus Pym will only be transferred from the very hands of a young actor named Benedict Taylor, only in front of Peter Egan, who is fresh from Oxford. <br /> <br /> Egan is convinced that the text is melodrama and that it must emotionally cripple. No actor, except Peggy Wentworth's wonderful Frances Tomelty, has no easy time at this moment. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker is as refreshing as Mary Pym. There is a part of the character under her skin, but often Mary Pym is shown in an amateurish petulance that reduces it as a challenging kukie's diplomatic housewife. Rüdiger Weigang Axel is entertaining, entertaining, ironic and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The British view of the Americans has been shown live in some wild scenes. When it comes to joining Yanklar Bo Brammell (MI6 Head), the American Quintet is an English-language virtue depicted as a buffoons with an empty headline that looks too long words in the dictionary and looks like an American juggernaut and psyche-naked. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness are dark. <br /> <br /> "LeCarré" has a habit of mixing different elements and melancholy of the work of "Hopcraft", but his foolishness shines his original atmosphere. <br /> <br /> A perfect production (what?) LeCarré adaptation so far to get movies or television. <br /> <br /> It is highly recommended to all the spy thugs' lovers, and especially LeCarré fans. DVD available from Acorn.
