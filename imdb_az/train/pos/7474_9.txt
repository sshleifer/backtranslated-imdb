This is one of those films that are hard to overlook without leaving the plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> it is appropriate for its parts: Cruise is like a strange player with all the flaws, then all the losers, Diaz, a charming but lightweight polished lover, Russell as Cruz and father's psychologist as an exotic new girl on the stage. The story covers romantic, moral, murder-mystery, tension and fantasy factors, and is usually a fun journey. <br /> <br /> I need to add that photography is also quite good and various visual metaphors. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong>. <br /> <br /> 9/10
