<br /> <br /> I just wrote an article about The Jane Eyre, 2006 for TheScreamOnline, by Timothy Dalton / Zelah Clarke's "Jane Eyre" in 1983 At first I was angry. In this version, lighting is bad. Everyone / everything is washed in a bright white clue light, in some images, looking at the shadows on the wall behind the characters. <br /> <br /> And the voice is weak. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> The novel. They are very fussy, more than Martha Stewart. Bronte's resembles Martha Stewart's local regulations like Rochester. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Orson Welles's Rochester lives in the darkness of the cave, fitting the novel's Gothic mood. <br /> And still ... with all the protests ... just the best "Jane Eyre" <br /> <br /> This Jane Eyre was the first to hear the feelings despite the technical drawbacks of Jane Eyre times. <br /> <br /> The critics of this production say the book is too close. This version has been credited with the novel Bronte, indeed, its best asset, because it does not need to value our book and at least "spell" or less "Christian" or more sexual intercourse. Bronte wrote a good book. <br /> <br /> For a long time, along with me, the Jane Eyre fan, I was indifferent to Timoten Dalton as Rochester, there was a 150-year-long reason, and there were no other, slicker, sexy, and easy texts. Rochester, not famous, is amazing; Jane and Rochester are the famous ugly pair of literature. <br /> <br /> But Dalton gives Rochester an astonishing performance. He just blew me. I have never seen anything like the artist, the text, the dialogue, and the full commitment of Roche to his love for Jane. According to the official website of the US embassy, ​​Dalton is scared. Welles, "enough!" When he screamed, for example, he bought a scandalous strip. Fontaine then plays a short piano piece. But Dalton scares multiple times. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> According to some reports, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Toby Stephens, who likes the current fan does not even try. Dalton leaves the park. If I had seen Rochester out of a single bar at Timothy Dalton, I would say, "He's in a difficult position, not even looking at him." <br /> <br /> Zelah Clark is not just the best Jane I've ever seen, but one of Janes, who wants to leave the producers like Jane. . No, only those who know Jane Eyre from the 2006 version only describe the Bronte * stately, strong Jane with thin eyebrows and lips. Instead, Charlotte Bronte's Jane is really poor, straight, dark and less, and beautiful. <br /> <br /> Zelah has a small mouth, close eyes and a little nose. He is really "small". It's not a fashionable model. <br /> <br /> Some people describe her as cold or boring. Nay, it is the truth to the Book. Bronte's Jane is not a hot mother of red, but as is here Zelah, the inner passions are young, deprived of a shelter, which occurs only in key moments. If you really want to pour Jeuney into the book, you must be slow, attentive, patient. <br /> <br /> <strong> You have to follow Zelah here to know who Zelah really is. <br /> <br /> I've seen more fire in Zelah on one main stage, but in five hours, though in close proximity to the text, this version, like any other version I've seen, Jane "Eyre. "Christianity is not an unusual subtext in Jane Eyre, it is the center. <br /> <br /> Helen Burns gives Jane instructions in Christianity and allows her to read and transform into a cultural way of life. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Bronte has written an excellent, sophisticated, rich novel, and, in any case, she is a Christian who needs a decent, straightforward, secretive Jane's worth, to live in accord with her ideals and reject her basic marriage proposal. Everyone I've seen has written this adaptation of mine and honor. <br /> <br /> Talking about the events in the Caucasus, Charlotte Bronte, child abuse or but does not want to say about the hypocrisy of a culture that is based on image and money, adapting to a large part of the book will be something that will go ahead for kissing scenes among people. <br /> <br /> Bronte As a novel, this version is a part of Bronte's writing about Jane's experience in Lowood and his connection with St. John, with Jane's relationship with Rochester. explosive and unforgettable.
