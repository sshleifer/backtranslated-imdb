This movie really surprised me. At first I had doubts about it, but the film was better and better for every minute. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is not for those who are looking for a spectator, but a very strange criminal, like a man, a lover and an open portrait of his husband. This is not for you if you are not a fan of bad language or sexual content. <br /> <br /> The story is sometimes difficult to follow, but in the end I think everything is better. The end was unexpected, because they missed the idea that something else would end. <br /> <br /> As for the player, I think it's good. He did not deserve the Oscars for a long time, but at least he caught my eye. Portrait of a prisoner of Gil Bellows is not always perfect, but very entertaining. Shaun Parkes, portrait of Clones portrait of Kellows prison spouse is great and very strong. I think I'm going to put Marki's Esai Morales portrait. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and watch this movie, or you will love it or not!
