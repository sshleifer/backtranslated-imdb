Is anyone really familiar with these most famous stories? a rebellious businessman will visit his wife's ghost on Christmas Eve and continue his warning, will be condemned to the next life in those chains. To avoid the fate of his wife, he visits three souls that present the vision of past, present, and future Christmas holidays, so he will soon see the mistakes of his ways without delay. It is a very difficult reminder, but classic Charles Dickens is also one of the most famous and popular Christmas stories of all time. <br /> <br /> It is a definitive version of Dickens's timeless story. ; I always remember those who are in school, and therefore I really want to be terrified! The dreams of Jacob Marley, the final scene of the disappointment presented by Milad under the bridge, and especially the spirit of Milad, were frightening. How won the "U" certificate in the film? (For UK readers, 'U' is the lowest class, family friend and children greet them, there is nothing to scare them ... Some little children are undoubtedly the last part of the pernicious terrible <br /> <br /> Perhaps, it may be the most loyal to the book, perhaps from many versions of this classic story adapted to this movie, and it is most noteworthy that part of the original film's adaptation of the original text, Scrooge, presently representing Milad, shows that two child (you will never face a scene so far!) <br /> <br /> For me, criticisms are re-traced with more objective and trained eyes, the most important of which is George C. Scrooge's Scott photos it just does not look cold, it laughs too much, Ebeneezer, of course, of course, but I do not want to bump into it, but it seems like a noble old person is not only a good, unkind, cold, and inaccurate person in the book and other films. Patrick Stewart described perfectly in one of the latest versions of the film, and Michael Kain was cool, though, moving along with the Muppets. In addition, the development of the character on the way to the film is about learning more about the mistakes of his ways and increases towards pay, weak and contradictory. <br /> <br /> Let's also note that since the last lesson, it has almost changed since then. <br /> <br /> But this is a great Christmas story, despite being ignorant of his words, yet heartfelt and eventually a heart-warming. Must have Christmas movies. Of course, many London Americans are likely to still imagine that London was gray and horrible at that time! And no snow would ever be so white! very impeccably, even poor people appear to be very dapper. But of course this is a Christmas movie, so what's not all that looks nice? Perfect holiday season; It is a beautiful life, coupled with the 34th Street and Marmara miracle, and everything you need.
