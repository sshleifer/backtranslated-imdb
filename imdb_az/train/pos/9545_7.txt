I do not know if this movie is to be given to "Tetsuo" or to those who do not like it. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily label some things about this movie as a "Tetsuo" rip-off. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> In the case of less eroticism and "linen machine", a small machine called "Nekroborg" (very original) causes a smaller number of aliens to transform a living thing into a machine ("get acquainted"). <br /> <br /> This exceptionally small amount of people from outer space use as a ship for gladiator games they play with each other. They burn the body, pull it to a place that is not visible from one place to another and turn it into a killing machine targeting other Necrobot, and some of it can be pulled to mechanical parts. <br /> <br /> Their goal is to defeat another Jew who is in another Necrobot, to take the corpse and eat. <br /> <br /> Generally, the organization sounds a bit unreasonable and I did not expect much, but as I said before, it is a low budget flicker, but still relatively worthwhile. Most actors do not expect, many are not very good, but can be tolerated. He liked the atmosphere and the body, some strange situations and the directing and editing of the film. Although the story is not very original, there are at least some attraction for me. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7.
