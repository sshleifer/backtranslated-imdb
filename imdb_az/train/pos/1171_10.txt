I think this episode is one of the funniest I've ever seen. The creators of the South Park have seen the best parodies of the Romero movie I've ever seen. They really touched on his substantiated public commentary on each of Romero's films. I want to know what George Romero's idea is in this episode, and I'm sure it's absolutely positive! Full protection of his true vision against his zombie epics! Although Romero is dealing with movies, most spoofs deal with clean gore. I think that if a zombie epidemic occurs, as we mentioned in this episode, we may be worried about our values ​​before our lives!
