Last night, I returned with a brief bath break with both parts of Che, and it was so fast after 4 hours. I was a week ago because I had a "thing" about exploding, directing directors, producers and editors on long-term epics, and generally about a movie of up to 2 to 2.5 hours. So, it seemed to me that the four hours of my tolerance frontier was lying, and I was very suspicious about the whole enterprise. But this is a nice thing I'll bring. Can I say with love? I took the film and saw that I was really glad. Director Steven Soderberg will be congratulated on his vision. <br /> <br /> If there was a man in the world, Ernesto 'Che' Guevara Fidel was an Argentine doctor who helped Castro Fulgencio to break. Batista through the Cuban revolution in 1959. When I was a kid in the 1960s, Che's description was everywhere; bedroom wall posters, t-shirts, magazine covers. O shape should be one of the most exploited. If the famous images were followed, then Che was a very good man, the episode of revolutionary romance. If it were ugly, I was surprised if it was so popular in public imagination. Of course, a young helper dies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Che (as previously described in 2004), especially in South America, has shaped his Marxist policy, seeing endemic poverty, but I do not think that anyone can understand everything from the beginning to the end The two parter is an ambitious project. Hopefully, she pays for Soderberg, but we can only imagine that sudden commercial successes could not be the worst in her mind. <br /> <br /> The first film (The Agentine) shows Checo and Castro in Mexico and follows their travels to Cuba to go to the United Nations in 1964 and then to New York. Intelligent black and white pictures resemble modern movies, but not. The second film (Guerilla) sounds again when it comes to launching a revolutionary movement in Bolivia in 1966. The second film is almost in the woods. I see that he has shot him mainly in Spain, but I still believe that it is quite boring in the filmmaking. <strong> "I do not want to meet with you" <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify; it's more difficult to watch because it is inevitable, because they are winning, the revolution will succeed, Che, in a revolutionary work, in a subordinate element of a peasant, worker, and intelligentsia.The second part is more difficult to watch because of the inevitability of defeat, and recently Valkyrie is a good movie - heroism failure so I felt the same as part of the GuÃ©rilla section.We know at first that he dies, we know that he is unsuccessful, because he is angry because the way of life is explained, rather than the condemnation of the Bolivian revolution it seems early, Che is considered a foreign aggressor and does not associate with the indigenous people and the Cuban people, I felt that he knew he wanted to give up and go to other times. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, he is killing people, exercising it, fighting asthma, and losing after a missing reason he leaves and leaves his wife to bring up children who are not five fathers. <br /> <br /> It's a great workout in a classic movie. A note; Butch reminded Cassidy for the final while watching the Bolivian-made Soldiers, acting as members of a group of Che and a small group of fighters, to join together. I almost said to my husband, but hesitated, thinking that such thoughts would come out of place and place. When we left the theater he turned to me and said, "Did not you think that Butch was like Cassidy?"
