It's just a classic movie about the sound of human voices coming from animals. I do not know if the video is a missing scene, but the dogs never show how it came out of the pit. It also shows animals' healing instinct and tracking ability. The helicopters were the same people. Once an original movie has been upgraded to rebuild, the first sound is removed. Only the use of animals can work in such a film, as it is proven that animals are more interesting than humans, after they have to use human beings to kill people and to justify the story fairly.
