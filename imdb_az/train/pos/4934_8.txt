The film "Panic in the Streets" was produced by Elia Cazan, a film that was a very unrecognizable film, and the classic masterpieces such as "Street by Desire", "On the Water Wave" and "The Wonder of the East." The boiler has already won an Oscar in 1947 before this film, so it is not exactly known. Still, "Panic in the Streets" is a film that runs under the radar. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing about this movie is the Oscar winning script. This is a very good concept and perfect tension movie, a material that has been discovered by elements of crime / film-noir. <br /> <br /> The dialogue in this film is absolutely magnificent and gives the film a sense of reality and reliability. Casting is not very different (especially when released), but still one of the first roles of Zero Mostel and Jack Palance. Particularly, Palance creates an impression of a very powerful, facing, challenging gangster boss. <br /> The film still drags a bit on some points. The film starts very well, but it slows down after the film's launch and does not always make the right decisions and look at it from the point of view. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the Streets is a film that is perfectly watchable, thanks to a convincing film to watch the film, thanks to fiction and strong dialogue. <br /> <br /> 8/10
