This film is better than shelter than the war of the worlds. Tripods look pretty cool, but their walk and death could have been better. Movement scenes were really nice. Walking ... walking ... walking ... picnics! stop my God or stop killing myself. The children's scene in the sky was my favorite sequence because a ship rammed with a triangle band. Good film, I recommend for people who read books. <br /> <br /> <div style = "text-align: justify;" <br /> <br /> < strong> "Tough Violence" Triple and Working Machines <br /> <br /> "Some Cheesy Cheeses in London
