Although a tear is definitely a "good feeling" movie. All actors were perfect, and Will Smith always works and works well as it does. I can go, but I can only pick it up from the "10" rating and they could say it better and better than me. <br /> <br /> Yes, because I have to take part in at least 10 lines to write a comment, I will say that Rosario Dawson is not known to me as a large number of viewers. <br /> <br /> And in this film, Will Smith demonstrates that there is nothing more than an actor's ability.
