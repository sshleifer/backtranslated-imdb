This is my movie. I'm surprised by strange psychological nightmares and this is just a movie. But this is a dark comedy. When I see it as terrible / tense, there will be others who can look like black dramatic comedy. <br /> <br /> But in both ways, this is a matter of madness. The latter has protected me, but what is over! <br /> <br /> Powerful speeches are made to watch this film to watch a tremendous, intricate and full-fledged fantasy and intriguing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's time to watch a few times to take and understand all the delicacies inside. But such a film is not a pleasure and a job to do that.
