I feel that this movie is a rare treasure. Not just the beginning of Shirley Temple's career, but a rare look at how our society has changed. We need to understand that today we see some things we see as sexually and then innocent. For example, in the film, many parenting parents have encouraged their parents and children to see this movie, just like children who imitate adults. Most of the teenagers, except for young adolescents who are in love with teens, have not even considered anyone who is sexually attractive. They were not sexually assaulted. Internet, television, etc. Think of it before ... Most sexual offenses have not been clearly developed. Sometimes there would be a whisper about a child who was "entertaining his uncle." However, this was often the case. Yes it is very sad. But today it is very sad because I see this movie as something innocent and funny besides its intended purpose. Well, when I saw that it looked like it and collected the boy's eye, I was worried. I have to remind myself of this event! These guys did not know what kind of sex they were. Parents knew that both children in the movie and those who watched it. Thinking could not even enter into his mind. In the eyes of middle-aged people, Shirli played a home, but did not have sexual intercourse after that. Today, children will also go to the beauty contest, many of whom are very talented for the three. But the child is just loyal. I do not blame the children who want to act as adults. Or old movies showing it. In all honesty, our media appears to be wrong and incorrect after many things are happening. This may sometimes be good. But I believe this movie is not one of them. It gives a rare appearance of innocent mindset, and we have long lost it.
