Although I can say that in this regard Angels in Outfield was a pretty good movie. I always teach children to believe, and maybe there are miracles, because never give up. Unlike other baseball movies, this special movie was engraved with beautiful sound effects and sounds of good sound, which is very interesting. Although I liked this movie, there were some drawbacks (ie, when Ray Mitchell hits a homer, he does not climb onto the tile, and therefore will not be considered). I really admire the existence and morality of this movie: Just believe, do not give up.
