When I saw this movie, I was surprised that it was just a TV movie. I think this movie should be in theaters. I've seen a lot of videos of rape, but it's different. In addition to films, this film is a very rare reality in cinema today. Today, I tell you a story I'm convinced of for many victims of aggression in small towns, and I find it very convincing (it's hard to find in other rape-focused films). I thought it was awesome in the parts played by Tiffany Theissen and Brian Austin Greene. I'm definitely looking for anyone who has this movie with a bit of a tough reality. I really liked it.
