This is a pleasing surprise for many movie festivals and why it's hard to see. Director Yang Zhang, with the help of some very nice works by three principal actors, his father, Xu Zhu, Master Liu; Quanxin Pu, his eldest son Da Ming; <br /> <br /> His wife, especially Wu Jiang, comes with a tale that will warm up her cold heart, like irrelevant and beloved little son, Er Ming. <br /> <br /> Film, Beijing. She puts money into a nest, opens the door, takes her clothes and puts them on a conveyor belt, cleanses the shower and cleans brush and water with soap and water wash. This will be the symbolic speaking future and the old bath that we will see on the next stage. Agrarian China is leading the Chinese industrial line. <br /> <br /> Pollution? Depending on the cultural revolution? Industrialization blues? In no way. Here is the feast of a man we do here, their kindness and love for one another, the holiday of goodness in the hearts of men. But I am interested in how the Chinese government looks at this movie. On the one hand, the good view of China and its people is explicitly presented. It is harshly non-political, without criticism as the expression or the current regime is concerned. However, there is a small sense that good old roads will be replaced by something that is not good. I think Yang Zhang may have the wisdom to let him in. Tell a story about the old men in the baths, which are reminiscent of tall tales and old days, where to relax and play Chinese chess and scene cricket battles. a clever old boy and his assistant may be delaying or autistic, but doing his job with a glee and entertaining and good willful infection. <br /> <br /> The boy coming back to the stage, Da Ming, is polished, well-groomed and tolerant. He is disturbed by what he sees as his father's and his brother's complicated behavior. It represents the modern China image, its bag, its cell phone, and its education. He came back because he thought of his father's death. When he saw that this was not true, he packed his bag and returned to his wife and career. But then there is a crisis and Da Ming is experiencing this crisis, which is the value of a nation-centered life that both his father and his brother have lived in. That is Yang Zhang, and I will not object to it in a new and even charming way, because his style is very clean and attentive. One of the great things I love for most of my films is the sublime creation in a larger story because the picture is solved before it's finished. Ham Ming's taste finds that he can not play in the public because of the fear of the scene, which he reads as "the sole mio" in a hammam like bath. Near the end of the film loses the fear of the scene and reads some inspiration from the Earth. And because of the losing of a bath on a regular basis ... in a good way, Master Tony tells Liu a fairy tale before confessing the real reason. But Liu understands and repeats before the film ends, but the husband and wife make peace. <br /> <br /> This kind of "happy ending" is nowadays featured in artistic and international films or adults in any movie. Some happy endings are merely embarrassment to their audience, not their own customers. Some people seem to be concerned about the audience. However, the audience was glad. <br /> <br /> What you see for Wu Jiang's comedy performance is that she can get any handicap of her sign.
