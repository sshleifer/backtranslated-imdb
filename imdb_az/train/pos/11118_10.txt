The genre of "gangster" is an obsolete subject, which has already been a lot of parody. In retrospective, the series was one of the previous clich√©s used in this genre, and the writers developed this flaw to create an advanced realism. Sopranos is an epic crime coup that reflects the psychological depth that is characterized by subtle nuance, humor, and weakness. The main protagonist is Tony Soprano's crew as a common danger that he can protect from fear and moral values, but Tony is one of two people, and the latter is facing innocence. By eliminating any inhibition or controversy, I still believe that Sopranos has the latest best-performing player. I think everything I can to make a sophisticated statement on the series, but I will not. There is never a visual vocabulary for images that are vital, complex, unbiased, epic, impatient, and sopranos for these definitions in global consumerism.
