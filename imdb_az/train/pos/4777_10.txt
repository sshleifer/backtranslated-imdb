Perhaps the most personality of David Lynch's works is his accessibility. This is not a mysterious thematic organization that covers or presents a field, or can not represent anything other than real nightmares, Lynch provides a contemporaneous, elegant thought in the universal issues of old age and the family, and both find trust. A simple fact story of a Iowa farm (Richard Farnsworth), who betrays himself with the Wisconsin mower's goat to visit his poor brother, is still unique and original visual dreamscapes (a very bright air shot in some chests, veteran film expert Freddy Francis) the most memorable part of Lynch's effort and characteristic. Farnsworth is a stupid but yet perfect person, allowing stories we have heard in his journey to become part of his life, and Sissy Spacek plays a smaller role than a dearly beautiful daughter, who has been challenging some of her best deeds (painful secret, by John Roach and Mary Sweeney with a soft turn in a sensitive scenario), but the rest of a small remnant of a man is Barbara Robertson's most prominent. Deer is desperate and at the same time sad. But vintage Lynch with his ability to deal with and deal with the best. This is a great place to start if you know those who are not familiar with Lynch or if it is just a bad, disturbing element; For those who know its work, it's one of the best in the repertoire.
