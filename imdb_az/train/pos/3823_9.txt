I've seen this movie in the worst case. When I woke up to an international flight between Sydney and Seoul, I missed 15 minutes. I did not know the audience, I thought it might be a movie of the week, but I was often struck by the performance of a senior actress playing a young woman kidnapped boy. The stage started to bend and I did not see it coming and finally screamed in the flywheel to understand that I just watched my credits. I discovered Do-Yeon Jeon, the best actress in Cannes, without delay. I do not know if the hidden Sunshine is typical of Korean movies but I'm going to my DVD store to find out more.
