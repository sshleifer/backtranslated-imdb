only one and only season was released in Australia and I would think it was absolutely brilliant! love it! all the story lines are good! and today we look at the young and family life in a more realistic way. still keep together strong family values ​​and join together. Their problems were real and really you were taken to the show. The show is primarily about this family and their lives, called "Today". The family consisted of Abby Day (mum), Jack Day, Natalie Day (Coach Day) and Nathan Day (son of a son of a genius). one day of each person's life, interlocutors look at things around him. The show shown to me was just beautiful. He was my favorite character. this has ended with so many things we can do, I really regret that another season is not done. It was a great show I will not miss it.
