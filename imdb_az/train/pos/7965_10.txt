This movie was awesome ... it made me laugh, it's a bawl, and most of these animals are talking about! this movie will be seen by all kinds of people! this is one of my favorite films, and I love it so I have to comment on it! It's a wonderful story that feels heart and forms a great and hearty movie! My favorite character is shadow. Because I think it's the most exciting and attractive. I had a gold retriever like the shadow, so I missed it! He was my best friend, and I knew he would be happier when he died, but I missed him with my heart! this movie is best I love it and everyone needs it! Love the pets, regardless of what they have done, and grant them eternal life!
