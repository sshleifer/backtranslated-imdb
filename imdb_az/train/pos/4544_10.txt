Okay, I know I should not love this movie, but I'm doing it. <br /> <br /> I liked Jay Lenon's hate for a Japanese stereotype from Pat Morita's favorite commentary throughout this movie. Given that this is not the best movie in the world, there is a good mvie. <br /> <br /> My dear Morita speaks to the manager in Tokyo with a second drink nearby.
