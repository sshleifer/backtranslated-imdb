In the first week I saw this movie (exactly when I remember). I thought a movie was good for Stiller. This film is a man with a good sense of humor. Like most of Stiller's jokes, you need to think about them. Or I said I had a good sense of humor. On this site I saw several people that people did not have a good thing to say about it and did not get a very good rating, but I would give more. This movie should have a good and good rating. Maybe this is not a movie for you. I give you another person's opinion.
