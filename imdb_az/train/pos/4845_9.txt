Hello Playmates.I recently watched this movie for the first time, and this is my first experience, Arthur Askey, and I must admit that this movie is very regrettable. Generally, as fans of black and white films, pimlico passport, lavender hill and Tommy Trinder (a distant brother), this film has provided him a good old British humor. I have seen that there are some critics of Asker's speech, but in my opinion, it's a time test as a good example of forty comic gamers, and if anything adds to the picture by creating any characters, it's simply the stereotypes. If you can capture this movie, I think I can hold it, but these films are generally not shown at noon. I also had the opportunity to watch another piece by Arnold Ridley (Private Godfrey in the fatherland army) .I thank you
