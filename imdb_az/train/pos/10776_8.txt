"Radiofrequency" is still a good surprise in Italian cinema. The film is also based on the Italian writer Luciano Ligabue, who directed the film and recorded the music score. <br /> <br /> This movie is in Emilia Romagna region. We are here in 1975, creating one of the first free radios - the movie "Radioraptus". The desire of youth, friendship, love, gender, individual drama and unemployment is among the topics, but the film also deals with drugs - The main character of Froccia is the victim of heroin service. <br /> <br /> And morally, the story runs very well; The actors' spontaneity is strong and the way they are directed. Obviously Luciano's "Liga" Ligabue is neither Fellini nor a film professional, primarily a musician. But it succeeds in creating a good product. Unfortunately, he will not repeat his second film, "Zero diet," but will repeat his success. Radiofrextia actors are generally not very popular, but star Stefano Accorsi is one of the most popular young Italian actors. Watch another Italian writer -Francesco Guccini in a small role, he is a wonderful communist bartender and football coach!
