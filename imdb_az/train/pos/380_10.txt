Steven Spielberg, who escaped from the runner in the early 80's, directed Whoopi Goldberg with Alice Walker's adaptation of The Color Purple, which talked about the existence of an African-American woman in the 1930s. Celie watching the game of Goldberg, the same woman playing in movies like "Sister Act" is incredible. Part of the curriculum on Black Research and Women's Studies is a kind of easy-to-read movie. There is a scene that's the most spectacular editing on the screen (you'll know it when you see it). I do not believe that this single Oscar could not win; Spielberg's second best film behind the Schindler's List (perhaps even related to it). Also included are Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busiya and Laurence Fishburne.
