When I saw it, I did not laugh for the first time. At that time, I was fifteen years old and thought that some of the deep humor was very competent to understand me. A few months ago, when I first saw me, I had the same reaction, and at the beginning of the film Felix suicidal attempted a little. This scene did some things Oscar said and in the film it seemed unnecessary for Felix and was not as entertaining as personality deficiency. If I had not yet known the story, I would be worried that Felix might push for some of Oscars' antiques. It did not laugh or smile like a television show with almost Jack Klugman and Tony Randall. Still, all of this has become one of the great sites in a pretty good movie and television. 10 to 7-i.
