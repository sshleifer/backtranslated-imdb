The Sea follows, originally from the Akira Kurosawa script, and this is really a light and warm movie. Kei Kumai, as a director, is definitely not the oldest but everlasting master (especially at the beginning of the film, massive scenes have some terrible moves), but the overall mood and the decor are very pleasant. Here's something else: Kurosawa has always been able to be more than what the heroes really do and what they do. <br /> <br /> Probably during his shooting he was in his magic; <br /> <br /> Maybe we're offended by the master's eye. <br /> <br /> This is a lovely and sweet movie, but it's no Kurosawa. It may be a good thing to wait ...
