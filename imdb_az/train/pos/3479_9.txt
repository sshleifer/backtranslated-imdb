This show started with great mystery episodes. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. After that, the show began playing a short episode with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy doo. <br /> <br /> I think the 20-minute episodes of Hanna Barbera Productions should be changed to short episodes. Some of the voice actors were inaccessible. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (playing Fred) was inaccessible. <br /> <br /> And Velma's voice changes after the first 12 episodes, as the first voice actress who plays Velma is not available. <br /> <br /> The Network has ordered Hanna Barbera to give more shorts with Shaggy, Scooby Doo. Scrappy doo, because ratings were high. So they were forced to make more shorts. I want them to be as secretive as 15 episodes. Still a good show.
