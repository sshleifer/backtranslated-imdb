It is definitely one of the best comedy independent films to pass through the stones. You have to have a sense of humor to get a full taste. For some reason this film did not receive a loan. First, let everyone begin with a good treasure hunt story line. When a deceased father put letters on a secret treasure, he started a whirlwind adventure, bringing together only two families. Mix a Polish translator, a comedy mother, a shingle head with a shadow syndrome, a twisted homosexual hypnotist, and a dragging queen, and money can turn the family into enemies, not just the world. In this movie, my favorite character should be sister / crack addict with turret syndrome, its sudden explosion will be crying and mimic in a few weeks.
