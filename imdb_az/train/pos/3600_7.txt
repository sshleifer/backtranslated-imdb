At first glance, I was expecting this movie to be unhappy because I thought it would be too feminist. But I made a mistake. Perhaps, as you have previously read in the comments, I do not worry about the feminist part of this film. I did not think that the main character was exaggerating as a woman. Like Guzman, he is presented as a waist, unlike his classmates. So, I was surprised by the story, in fact, I thought it was very good, beyond the expected end. <br /> <br /> In some cases, it's a good idea for me. <br /> <br /> In addition, I would say that Rodriguez is the way he put his character. Why can not I really explain it, but it convinced me especially in the scenes of love. <br /> <br /> That's why it's just boring after just half an hour.
