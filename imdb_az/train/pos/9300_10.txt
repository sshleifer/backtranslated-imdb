I did not know much about Rat Pack and Frank Sinatra always felt very self-conscious for me. So my faves all the time, when I call it, it's nothing with the passion-band mindset. Another researcher says that Mad Dog Hour is not realism but symbolism. The kafkaesque (unfortunately, Kyle MacLachlan is probably a very strong crowd, he was as good as Josef K), stylish, able, sardonic and slick. Jeff Goldblum works around many characters, striving to avoid being drawn and acting cunning, trying to stay away from what he knows and does not belong to others, who can jump and do not know who can not. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (best performing) have a ball and the player that supports it will appear on the spot. Symbolism is not really gangsterism, the parameters (a striking move with steps by Jeff Goldblum, quite strange after the lounge lizard), dialogue (style, not practicality, the command of the day). We have to be entertaining to watch. How many critics are really a mystery ...
