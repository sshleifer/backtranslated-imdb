This movie hit me like a project with a very positive article, but in one place they did not come together. I do not know who did it, but there is a little Disney-esque feeling. Some are incredible (for example, a pre-teenager works for a public job) and hinder the story's serious acceptance, although there is a normal dose of normal dose to be consistent and promising. The player is good. It is strange that the relationship between Frankie and his grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit smaller. Ballet and baseball - it's interesting to see how it works to keep balance between its best friend, grandmother and two passionate. As a baseball player, Frankie was very painful to explain that a boy was trying to keep himself in a group, but he did a good job of showing his fight. It was not really a ballerina somewhere, but the correction of this movie made her dance look beautiful and beautiful, but did a great job. In general, it was a good movie about honesty and passion, but his star Mischa Barton did not achieve enough level of realism we saw with "Pinch Dogs", "Lost and Delirous" and his small, but rather shocking performance Haley Joel Osment "The 6th Sense ".
