I would like to give Kolchak a higher rating, but the show has often been dissatisfied with the scandal and suspenseful. ABC's fault. They were transferred on Friday night at 8:00 on Saturday, and later known as "family hours". First of all, it never happened on Friday. It was the second class in the high school and I loved the early episodes! In NBC, police are the first time against women. ABC had great problems with Friday nights. Barney Miller, Baretta and SWAT, started in January, 75. The arm should have been a hit. Darren McGavin begged for his contract to end the show. The writer did not write much on original TV movies until Richard Matheson. Still McGavin did Kolchak as the actors could do. Think of it as Jackie Gleason Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker. With the capture of hand-held writers and telematics, this INS is nowadays antique and ancient, which is part of the appeal. Simon Oakland's "Vincenzo" was very lucky to surprise the television movie.
