Cinderella is, of course, a beautiful movie with beautiful songs. In fact, this is one of the best films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I describe all the characters in an incredible way. You can see the tyranny of Cinderella's sister and her stepmother, the sweetness of Cinderella. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, all the mice are funny and sweet. <br /> <br /> I think they have changed a bit, but it's good. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie, and I do not think it will be able to resist everyone's depth. <br /> I give it a 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney movie ever. But sure a true classic.
