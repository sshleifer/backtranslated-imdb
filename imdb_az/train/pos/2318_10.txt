I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately depicted the image of Reese Witherspoon, a Dani Trant, a 14 year old tombboon in the Louisiana Village in 1957. He never seen his elder brother Maureen (now rarely) seen in Emily Warfield and felt his place in terms of his conservative Baptist upbringing. His son's close friend Gail Strickland, a seventeen-year-old Foster (Jason London), moves to the next door, Dani is the first victim of the crush, and the Court has his own company and conscience. Dani succeeded in getting his first kiss, but before falling behind Dani before he saw Maureen. The intimate interest of siblings, when Mohammed died as a result of a tragic accident, was deeply violated by deepening competition. <br /> <br /> While Samet Vederson and Tess Harper are trying to balance the individuality of their daughters, they are also perfect as parents of lovers. family together. <br /> <br /> Beautiful filmmaking and amazing soundtrack, which delivers more beautiful time to the beautiful atmosphere of Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more.
