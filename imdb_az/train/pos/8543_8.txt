This was probably one of the films I never would go beyond any transparency, but one day IFC came in and said: Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... Why not? If I were to change the channel, I would have really left a treasure. <br /> <br /> The subject is weak - the young author is in a paralyzed state of a crash at a low-level rehabilitation center. It would be very easy and attractive to manipulate tear. However, this does not occur because it was written by Neal Jimenez before it happened. Here Hollywood does not have the happiness. All the patients in the hut come from a bloody root, but feel the fear of others' sympathy. Stolz is very good as a "single worm" that is forced into embarrassing dependency on her girlfriend Helen Hunt; Wesley Snipes is as beautiful as the old ladies who are separated from their family; but William Forsythe takes it as a tough man to pay someone for taking the cake out of his hand. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie.
