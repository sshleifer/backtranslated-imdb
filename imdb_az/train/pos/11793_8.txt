I watch the sequence as soon as possible. I'm trying to track everything on Star Trek. This month 3 and I stayed at TNG Season 3 and I'm already out of DSX. Star Trek is the largest television phenomenon ever made. <br /> <br /> "Grayscale" is the first recap episode in the TNG series. Just watching the show, these clips were fresh in my mind, but I felt it was shot several times since the movie looked better. <br /> <br /> Season 1 always seemed dark and ugly to me, and the actors were as foolish as they did not adhere to their skin. <br /> <br /> The show is basically the happiest moments in Ricker's life until at this point in Enterprise. Data and Riker scene on Holo deck is a classic moment of new friendship. Ricker was killed when Klinon's second officer, Riker's first officer, broke his power. But the admiral comes to him better than $. Many of the many naked, great things that just started in 2 seasons that are all to remind you of the whole episode, and with more than 5 movies and a few movies! At this point in the series, they start to develop feelings that really connect Ricker to Deanna Troi as Imran. To this point, they talk about the fact, but they have not yet exploited it. Note that ST Wiki - Memory Alpha Imzadi means "first" and tells you that it has intimate relationships with Riker and also remains emotionally deep. <br /> <br /> This episode proves that they have a long-lasting romantic interest in each other. <br /> <br /> Here's an article: http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Imzadi this point of the series places the production value up to speed and the Star Trek TNG, scheduled for exploration and art behemoth. Again, as I look at adults, I see what the Star Trek Universe BIG ACTOR offers. They really need to demonstrate the new ST after all the available demonstrations. The DS9 movie would be great.
