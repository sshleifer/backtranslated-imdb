First, a commentary that made me a great movie. The excitement that I do not know next time will enjoy the movie I've watched for the first time. Good luck (John Duck, Buck and Great Outdoors), good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), imaginary story (all Star Wars episodes - George Lucas THE MAN), and good music (again all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Music Voice ). Do I watch a movie at least six times in the theater and get a DVD or VHS tape? Characters. However, I present Cindy Lou Who and Grinch. Excellent performance by Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. Most of the others were Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski and Josh Ryan Evans. However, each scene with Cindy and Grinch is excellent and very funny and / or heartwarming. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this film and the most complicated cause of the movie being better than a cartoon. Grinch has a strong structure, good conflicts and a very good theme (I can not open another because I do not want to spoil it). Jim Carrey was so laughable as The Grinch - especially when he interacted with Cindy. And music! Amazing! Wow! Excellent music by James Horner. I like the selection of instruments and compositions. Very good work Jim Carrey - I did not know that you did not read. Taylor Momsen! Wow! Your voice is enough to see the movie at least once. Your solo - Where are Christmas? - Does the sound really sound like that? Sounds like F #? An exclusive set of 7-year-olds (the so-called exceptionally best). Great job. This is the best performance of a child ever heard in a movie (Taylor, Von Trapp Children - no small feat!). And now to the actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny and surprisingly sensitive (this actually showed up on the scenes with Taylor Momsen). Taylor Moms' sincere words (one of the best-performing secrets) is very strong - really becomes Cindy Lou Who. <br /> <br /> <strong> Spoilers alert ********************* ***** ********************** **************************** **************** Examples: First, when you see Grinch. This is a classic quote ("You're" and then filled up with the Grinch line, "and then the GRINCH - then throws it to the sorter, and then resumed by Grinch)." <br /> <br /> Cindy Grinchni is my favorite part of the film while inviting Cheermeister to celebrate. This scene is a good interaction and two best players in the best way. When talking to Taylor Momsen, Little Taylor Momsen keeps himself here with Jim Carrey. I hope to see Taylor Momsen in many films. In this film (perhaps with the exception of the feet and nose).
