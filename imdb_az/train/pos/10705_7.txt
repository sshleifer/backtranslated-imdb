The film's novel did not do the movie justice. Although the film did not really want to face the film, the first half of the film was light, romantic, and the second was a more serious, romantic drama, the overall effect was better than I thought. This movie was more of a history movie, but the trailer turned it into a tension that never really happened. Kidman, of course, was biased when it was one of my favorites, but it was light, sensitive, though it was a little more interesting than a dignified film. Three of the four stars. 9/5/02.
