<br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra are Hollywood's two children, Joe and Clarence. They meet a little boy (Dean Stockwell) and take him home, meet Aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls for her. He wants a sound for Jose Iturbi. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < STRONG> Kelly begins to dance with Jerry Mouse. Grayson is reading the heart of Jalousie. Not one of my favorite voices, but it's good. Iturbi's piano work is wonderful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sinatra shows that she is versatile and why the girls jump over her with this great blue eyes and face. For Kelly, this was a great break for MGM. <br /> <br /> Beautiful film, very angry.
