I was really surprised by this movie. Except for a trailer I've been seeing, I've begun to get a secret preview without knowing anything about the movie; I'm awaiting bad sex jokes and farting and ending with a careless character of the lead because it's how movies work. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is full of jokes and jokes, and it's a coincidence. -Lips!, But this is done in the spirit of Bad Santa, not a lot of Sorority Boys. <br /> <br /> All the heroes are likely to be real people, only to close their brother and live their lives. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that I would have the total purple of this movie. <br /> <br /> No, this is so beautiful (c'mon, this is a movie about a 40-year-old virgin!), but it's done in a very clever way. <br /> In the end, you really are afraid for this guy Did you really care about whether or not Ashton Kutcher was in the car because you say a lot about the movie?
