The truth of modern life (not just in Japan, but everywhere) had some great features. <br /> <br /> Dance was a means of saying, "Even if you love what you love, it's the norm." On the contrary, I would say, like Billy Elliot. I also enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> Humor was a good time and the touching moments seemed like a sense of boredom between Sugiyama and her spouse, tantrums in the dance floor. Aoki liked him and sparkled and his extreme on the dance floor made me unhappy! <br /> <br /> All the players did a great job, the story was well written. I looked for a second time and took some small nuances I missed at first glance. Good entertainment!
