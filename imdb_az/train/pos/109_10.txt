This is not a movie for believers of cinema, it is not a fun thing, it is the seventh art. Lars von Trier, Germany after the war after the war, creates a completely charming atmosphere. You will be dropped and you just have to pay for your last loan. The field is definitely the second, but it is still an exciting story facing difficult issues. Just fine.
