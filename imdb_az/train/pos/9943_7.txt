The film claims never to be as spectacular as many films. Movies are fun and enjoyable as a fun time. And that's exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> We will not be able to look at some of the movies. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the carbon copy of another movie. Instead, the pleasure, the remaining 2 "thugs" are on the way to the men themselves. So the movie is entertaining and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Camera work, especially dolly movements, is very well executed. Because of the weakness of the scenario, the characters were not dimmed to 2, but full of life and desire. This movie is not an Oscar winning, nor a sale of any DVDs, but a fun hour and a fun experience.
