Okay, when I saw the cover for Fido, I did not know what to expect, but I found it in my humble video store, but nothing really looked this way. But when I look around Netflix, I would like to advertise as "crazy" if I like "goofy" scary movies. I was so glad that it was a great movie, it was absolutely cheerful and charming to watch. As I said, Pleasantville welcomes the Living Dead Night, there is only one big concept, what happens after a mega zombie attack? In another zombie comedy, as we have seen in the Shadow of the Dead, the zombies were enjoying being "favorable" citizens. This is a very scary horror / comedy movie, I think many people are drowning in the shadow of the dead. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, radiation from space came from an alternative universe to the zombie. This radiation is still damaging to humanity, because all those who die after the original pollution become unconscious. Societies have come together with the help of a management company called Zomcon to maintain a normal life. Zomcon provides alongside remote controlled comrades to control hunger for zombies to use as slaves or servants. A housewife Helen in Willard, a husband of Billy Zombie, gets a zombie despite the zombie fob. Their son Timmy loves the zombie, who called the "Fido". One day, Fidon kills his next neighbor neighbor, who has become a line sequence and a zombie. Timmy "kills his zombised neighbor". A couple charged with Fido and Timmy when accused of missing a local resident. Helen comes and saves Timmy and Fido from the terrible, and they try to forget everything. A few days later, the neighbor's body was found and taken to the murderous Zodon and went to Fidoun. Timmy learns a friend Fido just works at a factory in Zomcon. <br /> <br /> Timmy, hoping to return Fidon, set out to rescue her neighbor with a zombie girlfriend. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see it, I really recommend this movie, it's ridiculous but very funny. Billy Connelly did a great job like Fido and really brought it, nothing was meant to give the character a lot of life. I think that Timmy was the most laughing scene when Fidon was attacked and killed by his fianc√©, and his last words were so funny: "You did not really look good, but you like flowers?" And donated to the garden.Zombi lover was ill, but it's not the same as the classic laugh, and I still like it to Beaver-esquire, but there's still a lot in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see FIDO, Take it away, I promise you good laugh. <br /> <br /> 9/10
