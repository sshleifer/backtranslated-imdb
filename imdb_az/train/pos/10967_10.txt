For the first time I've seen this movie in Tulane and my playwright. This documentary has deceived me because of how beautiful and crisp. A sincere look at the truth that loneliness has not lived. My family is interested, and I thought that little Edie really did. As I mentioned on the one hand, the professor even told me that the film was shot down by one of the Little Edie camera guys. The beauty I see is derived from the nature of the family's dysfunction. The mother and her daughter can not work in society in the relationship, nor desire the Little Edie's restoration to society. Generally, the film is connected with aesthetic quality and this is a portrait of a surprising beauty. Two heads to finger!
