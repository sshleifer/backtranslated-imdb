Every time that happened in the 1960s, I always watched it when it came to television. This is a typical Hollywood history epic, full of dramatic, stylized and inaccuracies, but what is a fun movie and a good-looking movie. Cecil B. DeMille draws this artist from the film shot in 1938 at the end of his life. Anthony Quinn, the supporting role of Beluche in the '38 movie, was the directorial director of his directorial and sword song since he had never been to any film ever and would never be. DeMille has scored a team of 10 finalists to pull it out, including Quinn's longtime DeMille Assistant / Actor Henry Wilcoxon. Filmmakers Jesse Lasky, cinematographer Loyalk Griggs, Assistant Director Francisco Day, 2nd Section Director Arthur Rosson, art directors Walter Tyler and Hal Pereira, Sam Comer and Ray Moyer, costume designer Edith Head, John Jensen and Ralph Costume designs Lester, the Buccaneer's only Oscar nominee. A large cast of DeMille team headed by Yul Brynner, formerly President General Andrew Jackson, as pirate Jean Lafitte and Charloton Heston. In the cast Charles Boyer, E.G. Marshall, Lorne Greene, Claire Bloom and Inger Stevens. For more than two hours, he drags in some places, but creates it with some excellent battle scenes. I would give him 10 to 7.5.
