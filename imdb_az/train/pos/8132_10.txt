I do not remember when I first heard about this movie, but six years ago, I still rented it and still remains one of my favorite comedies. I will admit that if you do not know anything about rap music, it's likely that you will despise this movie. But even if you are a rap artist, you will love internal jokes and references if it is a casual thing. One of the best lines in the film is the difference between b **** and h **; I'm currently using this line and I'm laughing at it. One of the best demonstrations comes from Larry Scott, who plays Nerds Lerar's "Revenge of Nerds". Unfortunately, this movie is really a DVD release.
