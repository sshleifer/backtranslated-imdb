I'm really glad about the movie, but I did not understand that there was a lot of things in Little Richard's life. At first I was not aware of Lucille. There are very few words as women are in close contact with little Richard. Even in the life of today, there is no romantic relationship between women. I am interested in why this part of life is not celebrated. Generally, the movie was great. Leon did not play the role of Little Richard, he was a good actor, but I think he was going to a different player. Sights did not remind me of Little Richard. I did not realize that I was part of a small Richard. The film is described as a sex addict. At the moment she will be advised to add sex. That boat was. I do not want to destroy a film that has never seen a movie, but I have to be a part of the movie, and there are a few things about the movie.
