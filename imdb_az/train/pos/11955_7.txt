Let us relate to a story about a different old school. Scoop is classic Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> Allen's recent museum, Scarlett Johansson (emerged by Allen last year at Match Point), shocked her appealing appeal to her attractive sex cat and a normal-looking student type with Nerdish glasses and outfits. , but still does not believe that Hugh Jackman's characteristic character can hit him by his side (do not worry, there are no spoilers here). There is no big change in the character of Johansson since he is always the same as he says otherwise. <br /> <br /> If there is something in the sequence, there is something that is as clear as the character of his character, which continues to be associated with the heroic killer of his heroism. 70-year-old Allen is everything. His stories continue to be the same in celluloid as it always is; It's a film that's a matter of sincere, straightforward movies. They do not aim for any market; If Allen puts the film alone, it's whether the people love it or not.
