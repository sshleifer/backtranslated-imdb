Why not go to William Shakespeare for the best playwriter if you are going to put a game inside prison walls? And if you choose an artist from many criminals serving long sentences for the most serious crimes, you can be sure that there will be more time for training. Such a brave project in a Kentucky Retirement Prison was carried out with remarkable results. This film shows how all these things are done. Final presentation of the play "Casting", "Rehearsal" and "The Costume" and "The Tempest" by Shakespeare. They did not happen to me before, but there was a similarity between the game and the prison. In the game, sunken symbols are limited to an island that has nothing to do with it. Prison life is similar to that. <br /> <br /> A seascape in the surrounding area draws a straight line painted backpack, a line of spectators who confirm the characters of some of the coolest suits. <br /> <br /> <strong> The Shakespeare was convinced of what they intended, but with their heart and genuine sincerity. <br /> <br /> The game was more interesting than himself. A prisoner saw that the game was a lesson in forgiveness as the price of his sins. Men, as they talked about murder, shooting and strangulation, cleaned their tears. Someone felt that they wanted to wind all hours and to reconsider their cruel actions. But it is past and today is the beginning of a new future. At least, the game has given a temporary comfort to the surprising thoughts of past events. <br /> <br /> Prison authorities should applaud to allow the game to happen. Such an event will put Kentucky map on the map and I hope other prisons can follow their good examples. It seems to me that everyone is using not only the Kentucky Prison but also the prisoners themselves to be self-confident and self-confident and ready for the day they come out in conventional settings.
