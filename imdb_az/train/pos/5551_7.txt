I really like this movie and I do not think I'm very disappointed. To be a teacher of American history, I felt that there was nothing wrong with seeing and watching the history. Of course, here and there were some mistakes (especially timetable - the film lasted only a few months or maybe one year - the actual fight is not more than six years) but the overall spirit of the movie and the sequence of war were excellent. Unfortunately, the ALSO film contained a very subtle subplode about the difficulty of believing romance between a weak patriotic and rich Loyalist. For most of the time, it really seemed to get away from the general plot and simply "frustrated" - just like a realistic romantic rather than a realistic plot. <br /> <br /> Despite this romance, much of the romance is boiling up to the bone, the film is really exciting and inspiring --- plus, in more than a dozen films, PATRIOT appears to be copied from this Griffith movie! Both films watched the exploits of a bad leader who fought for the Englishman and used terrible and bad tactics against civilians - and was intent on using America as a "tramplaza" to start their own country! The only major difference is that this film was set up in the North and PATRIOT was in Carolinas. Mel Gibson and others could have been convinced that D. W. Griffith had accepted his debts for stories. <br /> <br /> I love some of this movie and some of the Griffith films, though it is worth a while to describe all Black slaves in a film that is a white actor for "Burn in Hell"! This is one of Griffith's films - especially a nation's birthday illness. It should be based on it and I should imagine that Blacks were slaves A-OK, and it was far from being "unusual for me" (do not be foolish to me - it's sarcasm).
