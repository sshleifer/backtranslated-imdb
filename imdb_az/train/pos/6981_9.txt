For all the enemies there: after reading the first few pages in which an episode is condemned by a television series, he judges the entire book. They said that I was a big fan of the BSG, and I thought the best television drama in the air was just fantastic. But it ended and the story had to be continued. <br /> <br /> I liked the BSG epilogue as "Plan" but responded to many new questions, so I was looking forward to Caprica and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was pleased that being a different BSG and Caprica was something different and I personally found the story differently, without flaring up special effects in space battles, explosions, and science fiction. (Do not get me wrong) things). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales give tough speeches, and Alessandra was just beautiful. I will not wait until next week.
