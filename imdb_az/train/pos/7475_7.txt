After reading pretty negative reviews for this movie, I was not sure if I would make some money to rent it. But it was a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise, as it seems, gives you a strong performance like unstable David, it convinces me more. smiling on his legs (the third time in his career - the other samples were Magnolia and was born on the fourth day of July). Penelope Cruz is a little lightweight, but like Diaz, it fills in the demands of its role. The only disappointment is the moderate Kurt Russell. Not really a player in the film, the movie. Cameron Crowe seems superior to the director's role, and he / she also enjoys a good change from the ordinary sketch. The growing craze of the film is perfectly performed by Crowe (The cruise is quite effective in the short sequence browsing through an empty Time Square). Sound film (different feature of Crowe movie) is also high. <br /> <br /> You will shock and protest as you watch. Issues that may seem slightly modest, but what has been studied are endlessly discussed. The film is not perfect, but should be a change of vision of a pleasant surprise for those who are removed from the diagnosis of Cruise and Crowe and the Hollywood glow.
