In 1995, when Mel Gibson talked about a great premiere of BRAVEHEART, he saw a very nice but unfounded movie about Scott Roy's Scottish history. Even though there is a very different film, especially the story of a historic era, ROB ROY is also widely spread not only with the beautiful BRAVEHEART, but also with the spirit of epic films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This leads us to the happiness of the Scottish Highlands, which brings us to a place where the rest of the soul is covered with all the glory of nature. The main character is the "Scottish Robin Hood", a true hero (in real epics), struggling to control his people from oppression by the cold-blooded lords. Although he has made his situation worse, he has to make many things, but two things remain unwise: he and his girlfriend are given by Mary MacGregor (Jessica Lange). It leads to unexpected events ... <br /> <br /> With exciting content and talent, the film is full of really stunning images. This factor has to make wardrobe with both sets of films and places. Many memorable moments are in the mind of any viewer who can give thought to the artistic images. The most prominent scene for me was that in Robe Territories when Rob Roy told the boys what honor they were. Then he sends them and gives a beautiful way to the woman. The scene from Marguis Montrose (John Hurt) to the waterfall is also considered as a stunning visual. Of course, for example, there are some graphic violence as in the duel, but I do not think that violence will be as harmful as in many other modern movies. His justification is similar to other epics: blood circulation and the cruelty of that era were really serious, and there would be no point in hiding it. The worst scene for me is the rape of Rob Roy's wife, by the story: Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth). This is really disgusting and children should stay away from it. But everything else is OK. However, this movie has something to show that I really love the performances. <br /> <br /> The entire well works perfectly from the leading Lian Neeson, who is well suited to his tall, brave, strong role. The Scottish man, Brian Cox's player, who describes the bad Killearn as a quiet witness of horrific actions that feels comfortable in the wars of war. Jessica Lange, Mary, is as beautiful as MacGregor and has one of the most beautiful moments in the film. There are chemistry on many scenes between Ms. Lange and Mr. Neeson. One of the best English actors, John Hurt, is doing a great job, as Montrose Marguis, a corrupted man who achieved the desired goal in any way. I love the calmness of his image. But the real villain is played by Tim Roth, who is really sad about his character - Archibald - a man who is disappointed in love, who loves war and finds true lust in aggression and massacre. As in any good epic, it is necessary to find the end of this exception ... <br /> And again, the music account: these memorable and emotional melodies that have been forced to be heard for a long time. The last moment I was tired of not merely reproducing me, but because I combined these happy melodies with the splendor of the places. The Scottish guest remains in the heart of the guest, and this movie reminded me of the constant effects. ROB ROY is a very good movie, very well directed, photographed and acted. Perhaps, BRAVEHEART is a very long film that combines the battlefield with its magnificent sets and gangs, but is a very important feature of the film, which is a very important feature: the stunning entertainment is combined with entertaining training. I really enjoyed this movie, do not hesitate to call it "fun entertainment" and rate it at 9/10
