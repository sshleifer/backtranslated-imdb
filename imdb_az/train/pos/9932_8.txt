If you go to a movie you do not go to this movie, you will be disappointed, as in any movie. This film contains things that are described as Hemmingway's "Ice Age Effect". On the surface, just a front line of random movie clips clasped one to shoot a movie. If it were written in a book, it would be a short story, because the film is very fast paced, and if you are not really trying to capture it, it's good to go behind it (with some fine foreshadowing). Of course you need to see a movie twice to fully evaluate it. Experimental Cinematography only describes this film. The camera work and post production are often added to the overall taste of the movie, and at some points it is fairly artistic and is open to commentary (something in late American films). Although some places may be somewhat modest, terrible, and too heavy for some audiences, the film will never be completely unreal. The only aspect that I've written as "to improve your needs" is the noise selection. No movie is good without a fit soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is quite appropriate, the opening is a bit long and the other rap songs in the movie are really something more appropriate (heavy, grungy rock or psychedelic electronics had made a real trip to this movie). Appearance and overflow of floods ... add color palettes, another "artistic" aspect, and unite with events that occur throughout the film, and you can still miss and still miss any part of this movie. However, this is a more desirable movie for watching, and you will often be bored. 8.5 / 10
