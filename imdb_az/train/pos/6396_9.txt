Do you think you are tough? You need to see this movie. Carl Brashear talks with courage and determination. This man must be inspired for all of us, as we have to go to the navy divers. What's important is that after seeing this movie, I've learned that half of what I've seen is not so! Cuba Gooding, Jr. Brashear is doing its best to date. De Niro is as good as the southern redneck who teaches her as usual. Only the second major feature, George Tillman (after "Soul Food"), made a quantum leap as he filmed it. If you want to move and inspire, you should definitely look at one of them.
