DISCLAIMER, WITHOUT USE OF THE USE OF RELIGION, DISCLOSURE OF WORKS AND PUNISHMENT. Alec Guinness is a scientific genius - but it is an eccentric thing (he has never taken the degree of a university because of an accident at the college lab). He pushes to various industrial laboratories in the textile industry. At the start of the film, he is in the Michael Gough Company and Gough (at a memorable moment) is trying to surprise his father-in-law, Cecil Parker, by showing him a ships company. While dining with Parker and Parker's daughter Joan Greenwood, Gough receives a message from the lab regarding some of the unexpected big budget problems. <br /> <br /> Continues to work at Guinness Parker and repeats the same tricks with Gough - but Parker also knows her. . Greenwood discovered what Guinness was doing and persuaded Parker to continue his experiments (but now legally). Conclusion: Guinness and his assistant, of course, wondered how to prepare an artificial fiber that could constantly alter electronic bonds inside the molecular structure (such as all intentions and purposes) so that the fiber would remain in good condition. <br /> <br /> Guinea is not supported by a female shop owner, but because she is not her head, any textile made of it will never sink, become dirty or wear. She sees her as a rich man. But when they explain what they are doing, they turn against it. If everyone has clothes that will last forever, then there is no need for new clothes! Soon, Parkers' friends are afraid to finish their job by textile artisans (by Gough, by Ernest Theisinger - a fine performance and Howard Marion-Crawford). They are trying to strangle the invention. <br /> <br /> Guinness only tried to convey Guinness's discoveries to the public (even though Parker was sincere). <br /> <br /> In the end Guinness Science,. <br/> <br /> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> Is it evidence of nutrition? At one point, we see the difficulties of knitting (we need to warm the ropes at high temperatures to show that the lubricant does not have anything to show when the lubricant (or oil) is purchased.) Can people just want a garment? What has happened to fashion changes and new styles? And the fabric will only be white (Guinness looks like a white color) <br /> <br /> Of course, it will be added at the beginning of the color dyeing process. <br /> <br /> Will not it affect the chemical reactions that protect the structure of the smile? not a scientific paper, but a film about the futility of labor and capital in the modern industry. It's brilliant, but these questions worry me about the reliability of Guinness's invention suppression
