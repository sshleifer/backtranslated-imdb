This movie is awesome. If you take it very seriously, you will certainly hate it; However, this "dudes" and "right ons" laugh about 15 years ago and bring in delicate memories. I like the ability to just giggle with a joke and calm like me, and I like the ability to watch "Predator Bill and Teddy Perfect Perfection" (1989). If you are looking for a movie full of jokes, and if I have to follow the full humor; But you can do that if you like a cheerful and foolish but clever and attractive movie. I really like these pictures in today's cinemas. And hey, everyone acting on Keanu Reeves behaves like a parody way ... right ... you do not get too good from it :)
