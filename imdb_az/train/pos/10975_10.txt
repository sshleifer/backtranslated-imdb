The girl's words are poetry: "I can not go in one year, I need to go to the hotel room." "I lost my blue wine in the leaves of the sea." "The marble faun is moving ... he gave us a washing machine, it's a contract." "I'm pulverizing at this last point." ".. cacao and cats are a little bit boring for a while." "The little rat's nest, I like the mouse hole better." Mother's words are wisdom: "Yes, my pleasure is all." "This little book will keep me as a flat, flat dye." "Always do something right." "Where did you come from hell?" "... bring my little radio, and I have some professional music." "I am your mother, do you remember me?" The relationship between mother / daughter is captured in this magnificent movie. This is Mother's Day film.
