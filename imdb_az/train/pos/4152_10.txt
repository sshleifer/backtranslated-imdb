Season 1 episodes, starting in 2003-2004, a couple of years, I watched episode of Cold Case. Although it is best, this episode is not only the best, but also has few rivals in the Emmy category. <br /> <br /> I doubt that, despite the content of some of the story's content (that is, men-men's romantic relationships), everyone can watch his soul without any action. <br /> <br /> Based on the story taken from a deadly drug dealer based on the story, she reopened. Two central actors, Sean Coop (aka, Coop, victim of the cold-blooded victim) and his two colleagues Jimmy Bruno in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> In the story, Coop is a veteran veteran of the former Vietnam war veteran. Jimmy, however, is married and has little children. Both are police force partners and are not just friends, but also hidden romantic relationships, and hidden from the deep and obvious homophobic culture spread throughout that period. <br /> <br /> their lives breaking scenes look more black and white, and now a bit of color, then sprinkled. Jimmy's wife, Coop and Jimmy's drink, include glimpses of Jimmy's soft curtains on the yellow curtains inside the bedroom where they fought and then kissed in a spirited condition. It seems to me that only the selected things are painted in flashback scenes with everything in black and white. I have not yet commented on the color scheme and logic. <br /> <br /> The first patrol officers clearly homophobic tensions between the two central actors only increases the intensity of the episode. Coop is a key emotional scene where Jimmy's baby faces after his baptism. At this stage, Coop's father, Sarge, was a respected officer, Coop and Coop talked to Jimmy about the rumors surrounding him. Coop's father's shame and disgrace would make him feel sorry for Coop as he came to Coop - "You will not shame our family ... you are not my son". <br /> <br /> Explains the enemy views of same-sex relationships of this era. <br /> <br /> Coop and Jimmy from the "Coop" and another officer went to the police, there is tension in the locker room with the addition of "Batman and Robin homos." <br /> <br /> As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, Coop wanted more of Jimmy's life. <br /> <br /> Jimmy strain on his wife and children and his commitment to the Church and the faithful still Coopa must choose between loyalty. <br /> In the end, Jimmy Coop away, but he could not Coopu and his family at the same time you know. Unfortunately, Coop was killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop was killed because he knew that drugs had reached a higher level than money and police. <br /> <br /> The most moving scene, Coop, was sitting in the team squad after his armed wounds, his last words on the police radio: "Jimmy ... we were lucky." <br /> <br /> Sound mode The choice was superior throughout the episode. <br /> <br /> I highly appreciate this episode, and though I take this into account, I love the final scene with actor Chad Everett, who is still very old, still playing embarrassing Jimmy. the best. Surely, I've done a good job of writing the best, well-behaved, and all the Cold Case episodes I've seen.
