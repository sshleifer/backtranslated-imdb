You really think that this movie really accepts who you are, how you define, how you fit, play, or release, that has a very well-functioning, great photography and very powerful storyline ... excellent comments on these topics. I would like to comment on the film's official structure. Basically, there are two men in one roof. There is a radio and radio station acting as a place and time union, 2 protagonists and chorus. Many directors have turned Greek tragedies into a film, many directors have contemporarily contrived stories as a Greek tragedy, but no director has managed to approach the cleanness and power of great Greece tragedies, such as Ettore Scola, the story line and the official reception. A work.
