This show is undoubtedly one of the biggest demonstrations on TV. I want to say that the actor is great, there is regression, drama, comedy, everything, and there is such a simple story: an airplane crashed on an island. The characters are great and Evangeline Lilly is hot !!!!!! Matthew Fox once again shows how great Josh Holloway is, Jorge Garcia Hilarious, and I can continue. Also, the unexpected area curls, the hero's back stories, the music at the end of each episode. J.J. Abrahms once again proved to be a perfect writer and producer. That is better than ALIAS and I like ALIAS. Anyone who does not watch this show should consider buying and watching DVDs because they're missing a great deal. This show can be the best show on television history!
