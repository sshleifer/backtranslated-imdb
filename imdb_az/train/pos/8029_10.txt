I'm interested in Beckett's rifle used in the movie, as well as the caliber of the bullet intended to shoot. If it's just based on the sniping of Carlos Hathcock, I guess it's 7 mm. Round. I am also interested in the rifle itself. He also commented on the latest Sniper film about the rifle used by a Vietnamese man. Beckett said he thinks he is the best sniper rifle. I would also like to know which rifle. I know this special rifle was made in World War II or in advance. <br /> <br /> When Mr. Hathcocks killed, his longest weight was 1.47 miles and 93 assassinations were killed and 14 were killed and confirmed. After he had recovered from the burns in Vietnam, he spent the rest of his career teaching the snipers at the USMC and needed skills in this area. His sniping career is still being celebrated for the siblings and siblings that are trained in the USMC. I learned from his former sea friend. Any information would be great.
