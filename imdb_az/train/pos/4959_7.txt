I am a great admirer of Morgan Freeman. "The Shawshank Redemption" takes part in my favorite films of all time. But often, I have to admit that I'm curious about the role I have chosen. Most of his headlines were large-scale budget stereotypes. <br /> <br /> <strong> Freeman </ strong> <strong> Freeman </ b> </ p> <p style = "text -align: justify;) He was present in a grocery store at a grocery store in poor neighborhoods in Los Angeles, after being trapped by his feathered driver, Freeman was set off by his half-patriarch Scarlet (Paz Vega) </ li> <li> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Previously, the movie really consists of two inter-relationships: Freeman Target has not yet reached its destination and has its own phone number and or even the quintessential Hollywood type that does not know the day of the week ... Dalai Lama's "whole world is a scene" mindset, and in a wise way Scarlet calls the job interview "audition." And yet there is a way to people, t sir way. He is a supporter of humanity. They are learning, they are able to be worried about it constantly asks questions, and others. In Scarlet, he sees a stubborn, proud loner in his own self; <br /> <br /> Kyrgyz is a strange pride and sharp language that serves to conceal its own security. Vega plays a role in Freeman's relationship, which, nevertheless, creates a line between his daughter's love and physical appeal, although he plays well and is not as creepy as it is. Although he feels that he is in contact with Freeman, Scarlet is paying attention to the reality of their different worlds and strikes with sharp pragmatism, which Freeman does not want anything to do with Hollywood's bull. <br /> The film is smart, funny, and well-written with a simple but effective dialogue. I've read an IMDb saying that the lines are "stilted", so I think the wrong idea of ​​a real human word. Here are a great soliloquies, deep soul searching moments. Here is a cunning, ordinary, everyday life that people can communicate with each other. And I draw Freeman and Vega in a beautiful way, shaping a bond between the two men in the ocean, shining like a sun, and ethereal and sophisticated. You are already experiencing your memories, maybe what you can do. Okay, it was a bit floral, but I really liked the performances and the movie. I would definitely recommend it.
