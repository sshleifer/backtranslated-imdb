I watched a part of the Cold Case episodes since the premiere, especially when young officers were watching Amazing Race, but one of the best examples of writing and performance I've seen from the house of Bruckheimer), and the script and editing, soundtrack and the player have one episode tur d'power. If I were the producers, this episode would be for Emmy. portrait, Coop and Jimmy's 48-minute episode, they do their best. Hopefully, when this episode is repeated, there is a warning in advance, because I'm sure I did not notice for the first time around.
