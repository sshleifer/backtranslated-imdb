Very addictive series. I have never seen any precise association between drama, movement, tension and science fiction. I'm very sorry for every chapter. The scenario is very clever, I do not know how the creators create these stunning stories, each character has a strange past, difficulties, stormy relationships that help to illustrate the meaning of the human need to create intimate characters. <br /> <br /> The most incredible thing is that all the characters have a relationship: the numbers are familiar to them before they know it, and so on. Others, the mysterious security system and the Darma Initiative are elements that do not allow one chapter to lose. <br /> <br /> JJ Abrams, what did you think to create this wonderful story?
