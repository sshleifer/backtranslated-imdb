Ed Wood fans are primarily thinking of becoming an obsessive bunch, but this film has especially directed me to a fan-level level, which has never been closer to me! One of the most intense emotions of non-core film criticism is at least as far as I'm concerned - the happiness of darkness. As a teenager, I wanted to see Eddie's "Revenge of the Dead" (a "Hero Night") for several decades. Similarly, Doris Wishman's masterpiece of low-budget filming as part of the castle night or the half-star of Jesus Franco! But in recent years, this once viewed useless treasures video and DVD, almost TOO was available - even for us at Atlantic's "wrong" (!). <br /> <br /> And then, Fangoria first before I published the first long press release to strengthen my appetite, I was woken up early in the day of death, a film that was so great to be. Even though a movie that was hard to find in the 1990s would really be worth the hunt: and that is to be sure .... I do not particularly want to add a lot of comments on all these strange aspects. The film is his classic-still kitsch cast, his still quite often halucinogenic visuals, his pure stories in the "pure cinema" (in the French cineastes of the 1920s) and surrealism or his resoundingly memorable soundtrack - because it's all there <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I think that the German video that I hold on a cold day in Cologne is pretty popular for Ed Wood's followers. It is also very common that the film poster was released. But, thank goodness! Firstly, there are some comments from the German Theatrical release - using an attempt to make my students "Woodify," some of my translation classes have been used ..... some of these analyzes are a positive gift of the movie mastery and entertaining value - the most critically acclaimed critics, They were placed in accordance with the traditions of America, as well as the European river. Secondly, Larry Groupe has the account of a person who can be reached - a lot of music leads to a really emotional challenge to the listener, especially if you think about the "vaulted" status of the movie and grow up a bit sad at the same time. Finally - so far - I would like to mention the promo SOUNDTRACK, which Cinequanon has produced in a very limited number. BEG, BORROW, STEAL, KILL or whatever you get when you get one of them !!!!!! Eartha Kitt's ballad, Darcy Clayin's "Jesus I'm Satan" (both versions are from New Zealand CD), 14 pieces of the film, Christina Ricci's dance, and Minty and ZHV (both Billy Z- s very own Techno Band) ..... <br /> <br /> Be Ed - clever - Ed Wood manage your life.
