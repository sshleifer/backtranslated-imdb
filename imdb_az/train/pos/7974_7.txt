I found this movie an ordinary french fringe in front of America. Camera is often in the focus of fat people, slums and rich rural areas. While the storytelling and surprise of small townspeople who are acquainted with the storyteller, cinematography exploits and reduces them. Certainly, there were slim people in Glencoe and neat, organized homes, but Malle chose to show us the worst of what we can see. <br /> <br /> I just hope that some American filmmakers will go to France to reveal the worst elements of the American public. I can introduce you to France as a frequent visitor, there is nothing in it. Foreign immigrants are not easily assimilated, thus creating serious social inequality. But Americans do not want to eradicate the French for their respect and sacrifice to the United States against their own peoples, so it is impossible to see films about the film.
