A Disney movie that dare to do something different will be given at least for the effort. "Holes" do not make the same mistakes as expected from a Disney movie about the young people who are worried about the camp. Events for the first time are not disclosed in detail. Flashback scenes really serve one purpose and offer many adult topics that can surprise viewers. First of all, I downgrade the film's seriousness. But soon I realized that we have to endure to see the beauty of the story. In addition to the story, this movie also raises some of the methods used in correctional institutions. Caveman should have a hole in order to teach her to read as she reads what they are reading because they do not contribute to that). "Holes" is a clever and beautiful movie. We must look at it!
