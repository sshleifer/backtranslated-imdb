I did not see the whole movie last night and we were very excited. At least, every time and after. The killer is not like pop-up slasher movies that are searches for the "common" hero and the "common" relationship. It was one of my favorite pieces in the film, and once I remembered to be on the edge of my seat during a special scene in the movie. It means something exciting. After a while, I can watch my movie again. ..
