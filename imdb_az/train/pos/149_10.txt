<br /> <br /> If you want to learn something about the Spanish Civil War and all the political details and intrigues, tell me, you choose an incorrect movie. <br /> This is a view of the war in Mallorca, a small island in the coast of Spain. If a war like that happens on a small island that holds the position of Hain almost instantaneously, there is no open war. Soldiers are sent to the front to fight on the mainland, and there is another type of war at home on a small island. Neighbors say neighbors to other neighbors, sometimes because their political views are contrary to the new regime, but many are talking about old family fights, or a non-friendly voters introvert "get some points". And these obvious things do not happen. Some judgments were true, but many people were taken to the nearest cemetery in the middle of the night. The corpses were found the next morning, and people knew what was going on, but no one would say or do anything. We do not talk about the killing of a soldier in the lives of soldiers. We are talking about killing our neighbors and, probably, the next day to greet the widow, and even to the funeral of the murdered man. <br /> <br /> I heard stories from this little island and told them what I was saying, and I say that we know each one of them, about one or two thousand villages. the movie upset me, oh yes; but I also found a nice and moving way. Initial violence is not something the director or the writer does, but what happens during this war. A child who knows that his wife is a fascist squad that killed his father's father? Absolutely possible. All subsequent events? Possible. There was TB. Then it turned into a man. People were poor, illiterate, and worked in small farms. There were hard times after the war. <br /> <br /> So, this movie will not have a story of war or at least a war story you are expecting. There are no battlefields, no soldiers, political intrigues. This is the most common type of war that occurs when neighbors are in conflict with their neighbors, when the members of that family are fighting each other when the earth is limited (only the size of the island), and everybody knows everywhere. <br /> <br /> You will find a story about the story of how this war can cause harm to human beings and how this is going to happen. <br /> <br /> A great job is done by all the actors who adapt the novel and who truly want to hear Majorcan. It was noteworthy.
