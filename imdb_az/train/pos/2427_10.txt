This is really a very well-known movie. A beautiful singer without a cliche. This film relied on the talent of the actor, and it was shot. It was even a little comedy, but it was too late. <br /> <br /> Now the actors are falling. Now the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne's career was superior to a minor offender. It's only a shame that he's allowed to show his talent in his movie. Titus Welliver was as spectacular as Fishburne's half brother. Eamonn Walker added a delight to a tasteful movie. Paul Calderon was perfect as liquid monkey / drug lord. I liked the player since "The King of New York". <br /> <br /> Life is once a goalkeeper, but the best actress in this film, Gordon Hines and Michael Paul Chan, joined in perfectly as two Calderon's assistants. ***** 1/2 * out of *****.
