AWARDS AWARD Cuba Gooding Jr., What is the best performance so far? He plays Carl Brashear, a powerful courage and heroic man. He is a poor dirt farmer from the South Sea, who wants to be a wave of sea, but has problems with his race. The racist school by Robert DeNiro is still a racist defiance to Brashear. The film focuses on how Brashear succeeds, not twice, but nearly unresolved reserves. Spectators make this movie special. Goodness is great, and DeNiro, the best actor in film history, is performing the best dramatic work of the years - a powerful performance. Charlze Theron performs a stronger performance as DeNiro's younger wife. The film looks a bit stronger than patriotism (though not close to the level of PATRIOT), and a few characters are just a bit worse (Hal Hill's Mr. Pappy is too bad), but the film is a rare event today. It is refreshing and uncinical. Beautiful movie.
