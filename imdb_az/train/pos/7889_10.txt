The film is like the last nightmare of Freddy's murder, like every other nightmare on Elm Street, a terrible and disturbing thing, yes, it's Comedy itself, all other movies are there, but nobody is likely to see Freddy Krueger if it's dreams of your dreams you would not be even more intimidated by a comic essence of her, because her comedy shows that she does not pay much attention to killing her, she is very laughable, and Freddy also uses funny ways to play his fun comic games, The day the writer Krueger is comic and intimidating is pretty clever, as it is against Jason Vorhees, and is not the mind to really scare his victims, this movie is as good as Freddy's mind and I am with everyone with a sense of humor advice and way for "Sleeping Do not! ".
