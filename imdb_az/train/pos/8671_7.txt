Armageddon PPV. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The show starts with the Inferno game. Kane v. MVP. It was a good match. There is nothing about wrestling here. It was about visuals. In general, this is not bad. Here, Kane had some close up close-ups, but in the end, Kane won the MVP for the first time with a firefighter. <br /> <br /> Nice opener. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Teddy Long, We have to move! <br /> <br /> Both fit: Fatal four-way ladders. It was a massacre. Three of the four teams here would expect chaos. The spots were beautiful. General spot-fest. At one point, Jeff went on the move for Poetry and moved to London, and Jeff hit the ladder! Soon, Jeff was on the top rope with two stairs, as MNM intends to kill Jeff, Matt is saving, and Jeff sees "saw" when Joey hit Mercury! Mercury is frustrated. Her eyes are fast closed and clearly drawn. Mercury is removed from the match and Nitro is still there. He will fight alone for those names! Regal and Taylor then take London and first into the ladder! Jeff struck a riding staircase and a Nitroya rifle, drops in the ladder to climb Jeff! Awesome! In the end, London and Kendrick keep track of team names. <br /> <br /> In some cases, I do not understand why WWE did not announce it so far. This would be great. <br /> <br /> Mercury has broken nose and spots. Now in the hospital. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> Does Boogeyman ever fight? Miz also sucks. After a terrible mass, it kills them. DUD. <br /> <br /> With Chris Benoit Chavo. It was a powerful game. I liked it. Chavo hit a superplex at one point! Benoit suffered a seventieth German suple! Benoit won with a dog shooter. Good things <br /> <br /> Helms - Yang-Cruiserweight titled championship match. It was a good game. Unfortunately, stupid fans are not interested in this. WHY? Helms and Yang were very talented and wrestling. I agree with the JBL. He ran to the meeting. JBL is 100% correct. Learn how to evaluate or quit this. <br /> <br /> Kennedy Mutual Conflict - The Last Ride Game. Not much here. It was a bone festival, with only a few exceptions. At one point, Kennedy threw Taker down from the top of the pitch. The place was good. The reaction was frustrating. The last place in the Taker cemetery, Kennedy won the match by moving to the funeral. Unreal. Kennedy needed this victory. Both workers are difficult. Again, Kennedy needed this victory. The scales must be lost. <br /> <br /> <strong> I love women. It is not. At least Torrie was not here. It is refreshing. From the crowd, Layla won. WWE asked Ashley. Think about this breakdown in our bathroom. Next. <br /> <br /> Main event: Cena & Batista / Finlay & Booker T. This was also a match. Cena v Finlay and Batista v. Booker was in the spotlight. Batista and Booker can not work together well. Finlay works to make Cena look good. The finish was immersed. Finlay shot Batista's knee and did not sell Batista's shot and finished the match. Lame. <br /> <br /> Armageddon generally scored less, but the ladder match was a major event here. It was the price of enough money. Several people were strong. <br /> <br /> Last word: It's a good PPV saver with a ladder. Smackdown is not a bad show, it's not attractive enough. Smackdown must stop Cena tagging. Smackdown over your own two legs. This show proves that Smackdown can be.
