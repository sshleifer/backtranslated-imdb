"The Bourne Ultimatum" is starting to follow in an uncertain environment and Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, completely superior) watches the archives behind the CIA because he has become the perfect killer in the final test. to learn his true identity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> I wish Paul Greengrass to shake his handheld camera for at least a few minutes of unemployment. However, it is said that intimate is a perfect tool to capture the intense, claustrophobic feelings of hand-to-hand combat scenes, and often accompanied by consistently large cars, standing up and running in the scenes of arcades. Part of Bourne's entertainment is a constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that are contrary to the laws of physics and existing opportunities. Bourne films appear in a bizarre hyper-reality of technological-based magic. <br /> <br /> Everyone has no sense at the right time at the right time, but if I do not have an explosion to watch over there, I will be cursed. <br /> <br /> Emotional and Franco Potenza writers are trying to create some emotional relationships between Damon and Stiles, but she is not really an actress who does nothing. Nevertheless, unlike "Identity" and "Superiority," this can be forgiven, this "Ultimatum" shows all and we finally learn the truth about Bourne's past. This is an entertaining and satisfactory outcome for the series, and if it's a good thing in any sense, and Damon desires, it will be a perfect result.
