when I read another comment, I decided to watch this movie <br /> First, especially Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli; good enough ... <br /> <br /> The film is very clever and interesting because there is a special European actor and actress, unlike Turkey and Russia ... <br /> <br /> The second is based on the story and you can guess, but if there is an interesting action, it will be a good game in my opinion ... <br /> Thirdly, the last chapter is not specific or interesting but regular as other action movies. <br /> <br /> Finally , I'm coming to watch this movie ... And I hope you're happy: D
