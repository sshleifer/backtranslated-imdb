The 1984 movie Beat Street, undoubtedly the best of all released breakdancing / hip-hop films released between 1983 and 1986. This story is a DJ, a little dark brother, a graffiti artist and a shawar initiator who is trying to get off by using a "strange" talent through a winter. Acting is not always aligned, and characters are not fully compiled, but they are compensated by dialogue from low to low, a flimsy story, fantastic dance tune and hip hop sound. Note that this movie is featured on breakdancing ("It's Not New York, It's Bronx!"), And is featured by breakdancing, dance troupe Rock Steady Crew and rapper African Bambaata's fathers. The Rock Steady Crew is the best scene in the film when the premiere of the early 80s, when he was in the breakdancing club during a dance battle. Hip hop lovers need to see.
