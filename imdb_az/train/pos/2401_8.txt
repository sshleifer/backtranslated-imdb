Guy Kibbee gives the audience a lot of laugh. As a candidate, he almost does not know anything. Warren Williams, under a very nominal player, is superior to instructions to Kibbee; that is, to give voice to people without saying anything. A campaign that is not based on any commentary is a perfect tool to win the "I'll get under the consultation" and "Maybe yes, but then again, maybe not". Poor, if the number of candidates increases, the chance to win is even greater. After all, the public can get acquainted with such a person. As for the film, it creates many comedies.
