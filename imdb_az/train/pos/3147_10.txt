This show is beautiful. There are some of the best ones I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Dvid Trainer has a brilliant leadership. FOR THIRDY COMPANY, like ROSEANNE and popular COSBY SHOW, will be on TV for a long time. <br /> <br /> From perfectly prepared jokes to great speeches only these dreams will be a wonderful show for people who do not live in the 70s and for those who do not. This show is appealing to young people and young people. Perfect show.
