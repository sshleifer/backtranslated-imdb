I agree with the quote, "This is one of the best films." If you think that Vanilla Sky is just a "repetition", you would not be wrong. This film has a great, musical and emotional depth. <br /> Visual, the film is sometimes soft and sensitive (early scenes with Sofia) and at other times strong and intense (Times Square, post-climactic scenes). <br /> <br /> Music and sounds are perfect for this movie. Without music, the story just said half. Nancy Wilson has created a romantic but eclectic film for a film that can not be more comfortable in the subject of such a ghost (though I have never been released, I managed to get an original $ 60 account). , find a copy of yourself). Crowe's other music choices such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, Monkees, etcetera etcetera are also the perfect fit of the movie (Crowe has earphones for great music). More importantly, the emotional issues in this film (that is, love, sadness, regret) are very strong and have increased ten times with visual and musical experiences, as well as spectacular dialogue; I have acknowledged that the elevator looks back to my eyes and brings tears in terms of time. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie (which could get better) was so cleverly designed that when you see the movie you will get something new - so be closely followed and ready to think! After the first or second hour the theme appears clear, but you can think more about the story. <br /> <br /> This is easily Cameron Crowe's best work, and it's a brilliant job. Most of my cinematic and music inspiration comes from this work. As true art has a tendency, he has honestly touched my life. <br /> <br /> How many people can not appreciate this film, as is Vanilla Sky's own league? (I think that art is a real art).
