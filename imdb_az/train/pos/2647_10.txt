This film can be interpreted at different levels. Do not listen to any other word like the movie and say it's a recurring event, or w / e, and only drugs. It has a very superficial metaphor on drug; The rest of the movie (and why I personally think) is not really about it. Indeed, psychology and society's rudeness are mocking. For the first part, the brother of the main character watches online patient videos. Why? My explanation is to show that all of this strangeness we are facing is easier than mechanics in our profession instead of seeing people like humans. With regard to the logic, the federally mandated 1% of people in the aggressive class are not as mathematical and illogical as life's and macroeconomic levels, as it's exciting and frustrating. You must apply the principle of Heisenberg's uncertainty (along with all other laws and principles of uncertainty), not for physics, but for life, and leave space to change your plans and corridors along the way. One of the best films I've ever seen. It can only pass above your head; It's not for you people who have difficulty struggling with life as a math problem. When trying to critically analyze a movie or write a critical review, first try to read the back cover (written by marketers and parapsychologists)
