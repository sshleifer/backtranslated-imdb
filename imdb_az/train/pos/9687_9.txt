A sounding parrot is not a pretty creative idea for a new movie, but Paulie turns a simple idea into a bright, cheerful film that delights the whole family. During the separation of Marie and Paulie, she tries to bridge the gap between syndicated litter and brutal hardness, and all the events in the film lead to a very satisfying emotional outcome. Animal education is well-implemented - everyone will be affected by Paulie's wings and chests for the first time. Paulie should have a great character and more success, although this movie was not mentioned in 1998, instead of saving Private Ryan. It's half an hour and you will remember one. Paulie's story is a moving, sad, happy and interesting thing - since it was first seen at the moment when it was merged with the original owner, you would enjoy learning friendship and friendship with him and enjoying the great realities of life. way If you have any heart or feeling, you should not let it go. 9/10
