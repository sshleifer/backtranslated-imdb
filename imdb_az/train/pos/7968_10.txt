I first saw this movie at the age of 6 or 7 and I did not think it was really something special. I went to AS time, watched it several times, and after understanding the film's morale, it started to grow up and I would come. For a while, I left this movie alone and did not look for a while. When I was looking for an old classic movie to watch a few weeks ago (now 15 years old), I got the VHS home-related homosexuals. After watching it, I left it to a natural height that I could not really explain. The film really gives you an unexpected joy. The movies come together to find ways to tell the nature of the nature of the three completely different animals really sending a message that you will always find a common foundation, something you all need. It's really extraordinary that the character's personalities are chosen. There's an intelligent, weak, but safe cats with a gentle young American bulldog, but there is an old-fashioned wise gold retriever, who is looking at or enjoying fun. The film goes with these three friends or companions, making it impossible to create a city that begins to believe that it will be possible. <br /> <br /> When I come to the movies, I do not want to sound like a soft tissue grabber, but I'm against you, but the most vulnerable part of this movie is trying to get rid of the shadow, and it's called luck and ugly and painful release it. When both animals return to their beloved owners, the silhouette of the horizon until the shadow of a horse becomes fearful. There is a beautiful line between the heart and the mixed trash, but this movie is truly magic until the age of 15. This film can not be the Lord of the Rings, but it is worth 10/10 in such a way at this age to extract such a fantastic movie using the animals for Disney.
