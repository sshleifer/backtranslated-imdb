**** SPOILERS **** "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploits of legendary US naval player Carlos Gunny Hathcock. Algerian soft speaker Mister Rogers saw that Viet Nam and North Vietnam army, which was the second in two rounds, escaped to more than 300 certified and unreliable accounts .Because of how a deadly and effective trained military sniper <br /> <br / > Tom Berenger is cool in the air and deadly, like Tom Cruise, who works as a US naval star at the end of his career, but then it is pointless to have a life as a civilian in the film. She decided to become an attacker because she had nothing to do with the abilities she learned in the US marinas. <br /> <strong> <strong> </ div> </ em> <br /> <br /> The story of the Sniper film, along with the former sharp silver silver medalist and US government agent Richard Sgt.Beckett Miller, Billy Zane, is sent to the Panamanian jungle deeply. Two sniper rebels, General Miguel Alverazeni, Frederick Miraglittoani and Colombian drug puppy Raul Ochoa, force Carlos Alverazeni to support a planned military offensive in the country. <br /> <br /> We've seen before in Sgt. Beckett has led a rebel leader who has felt his coverage and the best scene of the Sniper. Sgt. Beckett with the help of his spotter Cpt. Papic, Aden Young, is doing his job. A rebel sniper, DeSilva, who is waiting for Beckett and then kills Papier, has a sub-plan drawn in the film about Eward Wiley, and also waits for the army to be taken to a military helicopter. You thought that when the movie ended, you could end up with Sgt. <br /> <br /> The most important part of the film was that Beckett had no difficulty sending DeSilva at the beginning of the film. <br /> <br /> The most harmful thing in the film was the last fifteen minutes, hitting a sniper film like Rambo, ending with Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller, fights with London fog fights with an entire battalion of rebels. <br /> <br /> The Sniper is still in the process of telling a story about a man. Now it's not really glamorous in war movies: a single killer, who dies in a mysterious and mysterious way, with an artist's diamond cutter or neuroscience sensitivity and skills.
