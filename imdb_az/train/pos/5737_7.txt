I'm going to drop the scales somewhere and say that I love it. However, the animated film addresses many absurdist tendencies. <br /> <br /> It is something that many people do not betray. <br /> <br /> This animation is horrible, but that's it. The main character is bad, forced and stupid. no indisputable qualities. his wife is sad and crying, on the contrary, he has the most basic communication skills. <br /> <br /> <strong > <br /> <br /> This is really short, probably for lease.
