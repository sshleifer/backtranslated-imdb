"Midnight Cowboy" is one of the best-selling films for a good reason - this is one of the best films in America. Both are figuratively reliable, but completely accessible and commercial. It was not a great success when it was released at the start. But be aware, it's one of the most strange movies ever. The characters are memorable, well-developed and eventually tragic. Filmmakers have to be applauded by Hollywood for not ending something that is required by the 1980s. Nevertheless, from 1967 to 1977, I am treasured for the American film. Well-designed, innovative and most-drawn movies with great budgets that Hollywood can offer. All this is over when Star Wars is released. <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger's direction is financial. It combines a simple style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other films with these psychedelic effects, the "Midnight Cowboy" has been quite aging. Now it's still strongly released as before. But this is a masterpiece that moves. The background of the characters is never fully disclosed, but the performances are fully developed. Both John Voight and Dustin Hoffman are incredibly memorable and sympathetic (even though they are sometimes guilty). Additionally, when I became an admirer of grape harvesting films, I liked the scenes that were built on the streets of Strong Street, No. 42. "Midnight Cowboy" is near to perfect and turned into one of the most powerful films. (10/10)
