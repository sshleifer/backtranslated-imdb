I rented this movie and watched 20 times before returning it to the store. Bill Paxton launched his first degree talent to create a good tension with some of the fascinates. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton both make good speeches. This story is explained in an interesting way after 20 years back, and then in these places, moving forward and forward. This story style causes a good tension that can not be weakened. Bill Paxton, take more fear movie, you have talent for it!
