I love Sabrina! One of my fave shows it! My favorite episodes; Libby is a geek, a first episode, a true love episode and the first series of the majority of the rest. The college episodes were not as good as secondary school teachers, but they were extremely scared. Valerie was a good character because Jenny was more round, but Jenny was in some bright episodes. Hilda and Zelda were wonderful, and there was no explanation where they left! Libby was also a good character. I never loved Morgan or Rocky, they were not as good as other friends.
