Amazing! Wow! this is a good movie! Acting was not good, but when you look at some moments in the movie, pull back and look again, this genius! At the start of the film, the man meets three shepherds. WOW! I never expected that. Then he puts the cocoon into a suitcase and runs away. And I protest that the smoker was one of the three drug dealers. And genius quotes: '' Beautiful shades, I need a pair '' 'you. .. you can get them ..' '.. Only Glossy! And the battle is the best I've seen in a while. Look at that second boy after hitting the first boy in front of the table. WHAT IS? In the middle of the film, a man hit a single car, then 3 children fell, he was really good at the target. It takes a lot of money to hire people like him. The last was brilliant, James Cahill was thrown up for 5 minutes and down the stairs and I was thrilled to shoot jason peters after entertaining movements. Jason Peters fell down and walk still when he died! I can not say more, how great this movie is!
