Despite the technical aspects of the movie (a series of sequences covering springs), though I'm not using a period camera, I'm going through the sketchy bio-pic of The Notorious Bettie Page. Finally, I do not think the film's innocence and perversion, freedom and control, sacred and secular issues can be applied on time; If they want, they are there to win the audience. <br /> <br /> For a few moments, Gretchen Mol has a beautiful performance like Bettie Page. The truth is that Molin's face looks like something like Bettie, nor built like Bettie (if only one stupid denies this beautiful breasts and no fool!). He even Ms. She does not make a dark, dark handle that hides the most sincere charm of Page, but Mol improves Bettie's soul with all sorts of shapes and shapes. This is a "fuss" from a nagging darkness. I have never seen my wife's page (and will never be), but I burn photos and videos, read all available bios and interviews, bought commercial cards and other pricing and endings, and I want to be honest, for the first time I ask for hairdresser shop and five dime dusty pleasure magazines. What she thinks is a decent job of Oscar, she takes the essence of the woman perfectly as we come to smile. Liv Tyler has never heard Molin's glowing character over a million years, and I'm grateful for the first one to abandon the project. I do not want to see her completely naked, and I do not want to add it, but we can not imagine that her brandy would be the innocent wonder of Betty Page. <br /> <br /> The Notorious Bettie Page is not for everyone, but rather a bondage and discipline. I suspect that the disc is better in theaters; The fans of the page dedicated to the audience and the enthusiasts will see it. <br /> <br /> We only hope that the DVDs will be full of Bettye Extras. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, the end of the hat was a gateway to Bettye's immortality, with a well-supported player, especially Lili Taylor and famous photography, such as Chris Bauer, Paula and Irving Klaw. <br /> <br /> Ms. A last note for a young writer who thinks that Page does not have any effect on his own generation: Review Madonna's theme with brassiere and return to us. The Bettie Page is a true goddess of fetishwear, whether you know it or not. Without him, Madonna and her relatives could never have been.
