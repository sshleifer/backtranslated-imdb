First, let the director use some of the names in his shooting. I really liked them. I really enjoyed this movie, but with Pierce Brosnan I say, Greg Kinear is exhausting. Brosnan flies well into this character, and it is difficult to remember that he is the same person who plays this bonus. It also shows its range and depth as an actor. It was really nice to see an indie flick with kinda films and especially with the main movies that flood the movie at this time of the year. I found that the characters were well prepared. The twist I felt was particularly good. I also liked how the characters were realized. Many times in the film, these cartoons are not really symbols, but stereotypes ... I love the different approaches of this film. When I think of this movie, I think about it, but I think it's a better and generally a better movie ...
