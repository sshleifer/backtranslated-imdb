More television movies should be made this way. When I was 93 for the first time on television, I saw it. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were terrific, giving strange and realistic performances. Weber was particularly good, turned into a very creepy and straightforward performance as a child's heart / killer. This movie really enhanced my respect for Hunt as an actress. The filmmaker also directed Hoosiers, in some form without form and excitement. However, it is directed to both of these works, which is a simple, simple realism that is tempting. If you like TV movies that are not packed with unpredictable and overacting, you can do so. Hunt and Fahey do not enjoy the approach story.
