It was my favorite for the first time in the theater. I've seen so many times since then, and I'm not tired of it. There are many things to do (Colorado know I'm jealous) but the story is original and I liked how a small city like a hero used the mountain people. There was also a movie I could compare with. John Lithgow plays a clever hacker, but I really like how he got out of it - he must follow Tucker around and keep it interesting. This is an action movie at BEST. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> You just do not have to be attractive but strange not something.
