I like these movies very much. Another "Yash Raj" movie you see is good on the screen, all the characters are always beautiful or very beautiful. You know who you know will finally be secretive to be beautiful ... Another hero of the film, Yash Rajab, is the hero or hero of only one or no parent. Think of all the movies. MPK Suman did not have his mother, HMAPK did not have Salman's parents, and could be 90% to see Alok Nath's cry, when you are the final rule ... <br /> <br / Movie is very good. It's a little slow at first, but it keeps you entertained. There is almost no comedy, but it smiles quite often. A small child (her nephew) is well placed and delivers a very good liner. The actress is very nice, but shy that does not happen in real life. this movie does not have a massive happy family living in BIG, so I'm a good idea and you let the movie differ from other films. There will be many women crying at the end of the movie. There is no strong message from the movie, but it's a good hour. If you are married (when marriage is organized), the movie will remind you of the past. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, just a few days ago, Bollywood classics are not very big, such as a mild film, not a lot of space or folds.
