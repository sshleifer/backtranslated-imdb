This place is in England in 1940. Three Orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live in Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). He does not want them, but takes them unwittingly. As you can see, she studies magic at a college with a writing course. (OK - I understand it's a family movie, but come to college college!) Therefore, he can finish it out of college for a fight, and he is the chief professor Browne (David Tomlinson). <br /> <br /> For this reason, children and children move in a bed with the help of a magical beddings. <br /> <br /> When I was 9, I saw it for the first time, and I remember this extraordinary. Not really adults! The story is insane (even for a fantasy), children are terrifying actors, and one of them (Charles) is quite surprising. Also Roddy McDowall is the third billed and only appears on two short stages! There is also a trip to the island of Naboombu, which is run by animated animals. I thought it might be fun, but animation is poor (for Disney) and there is a very fierce and very long football game between animals. Here are some salutations: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just great; songs are unforgettable; The long dance sequence on Portobello Road is colorful and full of energy and the Oscars get special effects yet extremely impressive. A weak story line, weak animation, and challenging kids really are so low. I've heard that the extended version is even worse! I can only give it 7.
