I consider myself a great movie scene. I was ill on the sofa and I fell into this movie. From the open to the end, I watched the fear of these great actors, never saw them, I spoke a great deal. It was nice to shoot a movie. What I needed. I hope this message is heard more than any other bad comment made by others. The director has a heart and hits all actors. Thank you for taking this movie. Only delicate, delicate characters that are just perfect and elegant. Just great. I can not send it without 10 lines, but I just want more from this filmmaker, the filmmaker, and the writer. I did not want it to end. Last
