Yes, in 1968, a musician was awarded the Oscars for the best picture - and this award was his third music for five years, first in 1964, "Fair Lady" and then The Sound in 1965. The difference between My Fair Lady, Music Voice and Oliver! Maybe Oliver! Great! No comparison. The first two films are unusually nourishing noodles compared to Oliver! Acting is great; songs are great; The story is great and the dance is great. This film is dynamic, current, human-related, and unlike New York's ultra-revealing networks! England's 19th century depiction of the poverty in England, which is a cause of betrayal. Oliver Reed was a great player and proved it in Oliver! Other actresses and actresses, especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis, are equally beautiful and offer powerful illustrations of characters that create a caricature-free sympathy and heat.
