The international FIRE was recommended to me by a man who owns two DVD releases and VHS. He claimed that he was one of the funniest and low quality low-budgeters. I'm not watching films that I know to be bad at all, but it made an exception for that ... I'm also very glad. <br /> <br /> Movement (very striking, graphic protection), sleaze (isolated for the main woman's nudity, but it's so cheerful on one stage), and a strange dialogue dialogue <br /> <br /> Ginty, EXTERMINATOR's non -some-looking star (and many other low-budget activity cycles) is fun and it can give you the best performance. Williamson is better than the usual situation, with a unique heart (and it does not come down the middle line). The rest of the rash is fun to watch, especially the villains, a sadistic sexpot speaking with an emphasis on the fact that a person is a Spanish and Italian rumor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < There is a terrible torture sequence that goes on strikes with sparks and no one will soon forget it. Also, when Ginty is drifted by a group of evil men, he is fitted into a suitable chain bar, and all the fans of action and bewitching moments will budge and shake each other. <br /> <br /> Don DO NOT miss the INTERNATIONAL FIRE. It's a rollicking - mind-numbingly stupid - classic of action.
