Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg's scene to go to the mall to revive Sally's spectacular spirits is enough to enjoy this movie, but wait! There is more! It is a good dispatch of daytime television, on the road, (and above) the horrors of film lovers and love. Robert Downey Jr shows his genius light side and Cathy Moriarty is beautiful. Dialogue is clever and physical humor is nevertheless skillful. This is a film that will appeal to those who actually use the actress, directing and writing art.
