When an orphanage director strikes, his father seeks the details of the center and rents the children. When a good off, he made a pair with a nice apartment and the idea to get a great life was prepared for them to adopt this idea. Why do they want to break the trilogy with the carpet creepers that make up their elegant hair? These two people, in no way, need children to make the life beautiful. This movie looks like the real world works in this way, but I am in doubt.
