The film really complicates the personality of your personality and the society we live in. Good and very strong. The filmmakers provide clear information about the world beyond the honest and normative ideological perspective. I believe that a sub-culture that is shaken by the views of the audience is a great idea. It is often shocked and therefore stronger. Some parts were hard to watch as the truth was, but it was not over. When you watch it is good but only for a second or a third time; because you have the chance to consider the issues that you are discussing and the challenges that you are facing.
