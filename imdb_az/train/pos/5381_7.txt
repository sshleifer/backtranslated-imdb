For a low-budget movie, this was really good. I put it on average on the B-film. Sean and Corinne surrendered in this movie, and they were not ashamed of the camera. Pay attention to the communities of Jeanne and Jared. I want the producers to think so, but the entrepreneurs are worth it. <br /> <br /> Sean and Corinne will be more involved in film entertainment industry. Sean's character seemed justified, and the character of sexy Corinne was extremely difficult and at the same time. He has a good connection with the movement schemes and has been fulfilled with confidence. It was an idea that Billy Zane was a clever and clever lover. His charisma on the screen is always pleasant to watch. Chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was very good. The sequence of action was cheesy and seemed to be joining the movie. Of course, there were gaps, but it comes from these areas. <br /> <br /> Generally, it was a good movie, taking into account that it was prepared for the budget and TV. Sean and Corinne think they are newcomers for doing a good job. I hope that the rest of Jeanne, Jared and the Next Action Star will have the chance to join the stars in entertaining success. <br /> <br /> Final decision: *** / ****
