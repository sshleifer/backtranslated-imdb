Silent film, the prize of Clan, played a major role in Mary Peak, would be built on an island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of the outdoor shootings were shot near the Marblehead's Marmolehead Neck, near the geographical areas of several seas and cast at Castle Rock. My initial interest in the film was due to two factors: 1) the location of the Marblehead movie in my hometown; and 2) the "scene of the cliff" where Mary My Pixford was set to work during a few scenes by my grandmother Lizette M. Woodfine. Both women were small in size (5 '), and my dad and grandmother, as part of the shooting of Chiefton film, returned to the camera for their father-in-law. I would only like to link this story with future movie historians and enthusiasts. The film itself (my DVD copy is somewhat weaker) works very well with many moving and expressive players, including many scenes from Miss Pickford, a powerful female character. I really liked it and would like a better copy, though I do not know if I have seen some of the movie sites on the dark because of being in one copy. Very beautiful moving film of a very quiet genre!
