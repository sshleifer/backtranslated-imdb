If you are lucky in video stores, one of the great things about the beautiful Chinese films you can find is the exact definition of real true stories. Farewell, my bridge, Emperor and Assassin and this movie are the perfect examples. Film artists take a real story and work hard to create a movie without paying for dramatic or commercial convenience - the Hollywood feature, and especially the Disney films. <br /> <br /> In this story we are a popular local charming singer named after the mask king in Sichuan Chang Art in the Next Years. Many years ago, she lost her only son, she sought a male partner to pursue her rare and immortal art in a society that prohibits such work. Master Boy Wang is sold by a slave trader. She is glad to leave her art. But eventually it was learned that he was a boy. There, the story is very interesting, with a good performance by Sekuan opera Master Liang - a regional opera style related to Beijing Opera. My Concubine, a fervent admirer, should look at Master Liang's description of a man who plays a role in a Chinese opera. These female role-makers are likely to be helping them to understand that they are homosexual or not, but psychologically, people who are completely unaware of their sexuality.
