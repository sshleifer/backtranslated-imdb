Why is this film so low? I've been watching this movie 25 times, and I know EVERY line. It's obvious that I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creator of the South Park and the new puppet-show Team America) star Joe Cooper and Coop "Airman" Cooper and Doug Remer, or "Sir Swish". Basically, the movie is called Coop and Remer. As the film begins, it reminds the world of money that money has started to pay for, and even go to one called Townsell. This part of the film has to do for a while since the start of a series of sports: "And for a year in New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, Toronto Arganauts, plus the Desert Inn Finally, I'll play in Miami." His agent: "Minnesota." Let's not forget about this important part of the film. So, Coop and Remer are on a merger side and understand that there is nothing in their conversation with their former classmates. Outside they create sports BASEketball after challenge with what they were in secondary school basketball heroes. After about a year, the sport will last for about a year. At this time they are able to manipulate the third team mate Squeak, really a day after they invented the game. As seen in the film, Coop, Remer and Squeak learn that soloist sports heroes remain. The story is rich with blackmail, Milwaukee Beers is full of floriculture, and humor is so absurd that it cries even more. Look, my friend, it's not funny.
