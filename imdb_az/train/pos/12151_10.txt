It's just something made up for a TV movie. My husband and I were in an unhappy Sunday when we were in school. Biscuits are moving. Poor script. Good guys. It's ridiculous but somewhat clear, clich√© and banal premise. Do not slip in the van with your ex-wife corps. <br /> <br /> You get acquainted with the natural symbols: a lady who wants to win gold, a foolish boy who wants to make himself, better-off friends, better-versed, but far-reaching Daddy's son-in-law. And his wife's corpse. Captured. A pick-up. <br /> <br /> Wow: And the name. Several things in our lives have become "Texas tragedies" after following this beauty. Everyone participating in his creation is worthy of a medal.
