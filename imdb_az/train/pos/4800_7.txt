I went to the Straight Story, waiting in a beautiful direction and a sad / happy type of drama. I got them. What I was looking forward to was an alimor of the existence of human existence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Alvin answers the age of the people, the area followed by him, his reactions to humans, his types of discussion (first, pregnancy and one of the last ones about children outside the cemetery). The last path to sliding, especially in this context, shrinks and destroys fear and nervousness. <br /> <br /> The last mechanical failure seems to be death, and with a miraculous revival of its engine, the next life-merger will be achieved. <br /> <br /> I only hope for some of the branded people. The slow-moving melodrama takes time to follow a more holistic look.
