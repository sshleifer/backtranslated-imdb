I love this movie because they showed that they did not kill for fun and save their loved ones! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job describing Ned and Joe. There are a few quick-fit scenes, but there is nothing else. The language is very soft and sometimes it does not know. This film shows that they are military forces because they are brutal killings! I hope people will watch this movie and learn about important dates in this history. There is something that makes me very happy about this film that inspired armor in a book called Ned! And how do they remember people's armor? I hope people watch this movie and are interested in me as well.
