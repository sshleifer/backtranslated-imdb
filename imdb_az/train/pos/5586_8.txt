Eva (Hedy Lamarr) married an elderly man and realized that honey did not want her husband to be her husband. Eva, who disappointed her husband and deprived of love, returns to her father's home in an abandoned farm. While trying to graze in a lake at noon, the horse runs away with its clothes, retrieves a young worker and returns them to Eva. They fall in love with each other and become lovers. Later, she thinks about her husband and tries to return home. Eva refuses and takes the triumph to the same place and ends the job successfully. I have only seen the Extase for the first time and is relatively relatively comparable to the terrible quality of the VHS released by the Brazilian distributor Video Network in Brazil: only 75 minutes in the film, and it seems that different reels of the film have been used. Some parts are completely damaged and other parts are very damaged. Therefore, if you have a chance to find this rare VHS for a rental or sale, the beauty of the images you do not get by the Brazilian viewer. The film is actually a silent film, the story is very dated and there are only a few lines. As a result, characters are poorly developed. However, this film is also very brave for the beautiful standards that Hedy Lamarr is exposed to the beautiful breasts and bare fatty body. Another fantastic point is the use of poetic and metaphorical flowers that symbolize the relationship between Eva and her lover. The way that the scenes lead the author to show Evan's needs and peculiarities is very clear. The unusual for the 1933 film is also unusual. I liked this movie, but I have a chance to see a 87-minute recovery version one day. <br /> <br /> <strong>
