Fred Olen Ray, director of operations, horror, rooted philosophy, shows that he has some capabilities as director. Characteristic actor William Smith is one of the most harsh and bad guys in the industry. He treats the audience with the best of his career. When it comes to Randy Travis, the best Lee Van Cleef gives you the impression. Film is not bad. Smith and Travis. As for the rest of the pour, none of them really differs. Ray had done a great deal of this flick, Smith and Travis were good, I would give this B west one to seven (at its best).
