Earlier warning: I'm sure someone will blame me for playing a race card, but when you see the front view of this movie, "Finally!" I thought. I have never seen a film about popular pop dances (popular hip hop exercises, breaking or strengthening), where the main character is black hero. I noticed that a non-Black woman, who did not know anything about hip hop, was brand new for the hood and that it was a mediocre job (Breakin, Breakin 2, Last Dance, Step Up). There are almost no black women in the film. Hip hop has always bothered me, taking into account the influential African dance, and these special groups have been breaking with Blacks and Latinos, and there has never been any man who played it, so this movie has come a long time. But the race is not moving, and I also wanted to make a convincing plot; dancing fun; <br /> <br /> <strong> I have never seen a major, mainstream movie of all the main characters in Jamaica; There were rare accents; and the company was not stereotypic. Companions, family, friends, and even "murderers" were really smart in trying to survive, live, and survive in a neighborhood where they live by something positive. Although the audience knew that the main character was choosing an alternative lifestyle, he still did not make the field stereotypic. I was satisfied with the way I described it. I took a step; romantic ugly relationships between two cooks; the courts where the parents of the main character conduct; and how he got involved with his old neighbors and engaged in a barrel of Crabs. At the same time, I respected that she was very smart and active, and many other cistas in the film managed to take control of the world. They were as good as all the kids. <br /> <br /> Many political parties will not be involved in this film. <br /> <br /> What is the reason for the vote? but I'm asking if there are realistic demonstration shows. When steppers were ready to play, some hip hop songs would play in the hands of the hands / feet. In a realistic demonstration, there is a zero need for music, besides entertaining the masses among the groups. And when hip-hop songs were played, sometimes the shooting of the song was due to the wheel's arms and legs being beaten. It was inadequate. I'm sorry to hear about Stomp the Yard in this movie because the women at Stomp the Yard, Meagan Good, were strangely represented for a few seconds. some prissy twirl and hair flip and put a few steps (Deltas?) and cut it instantly). Even though there were many small scenes, the ladies burned her in the motorcade and drowned her physical music without all the music. <br /> <br /> I know that I can play music in other parts of the movie "I". <br /> <br /> I'm not an admirer of Keyshia Cole, every time I thought, "Is writing a letter to put her hands on her hands during her speech?" I was bothered by the screen. Instead, I thought they should have a home like Free or Rocsi. Deray Davis was as laugh as ever. And as he learned that the film should be in the ghetto, it did not happen somewhere like escape. Hollywood, as usual. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie five stars, but since the music was killing it, only a few people were ignorant of their neighborhood and missing. for me. When I get out, I'm going to buy it and I hope the bonus scenes will show the actual steps without all songs.
