A threat, a tense, saturated tension is one on B, but not really a great production. The Metro was looking for new films, stars, and directors who competed with the new television as a studio producing it because it is known as an experimental film. Director John Sturges was one of the best years ahead. He has recently begun to shoot a one-level film and has already shown himself as a talented artist. The stars Barbara Stanwyck, Barry Sullivan and Ralph Meeker were in different stages of their career. Stanwyck's glory was in his hands for years, and he still can shoot films as he proves. Barry Sullivan, as his wife, was one of many people who started out in forty films that never succeeded in many successes you hoped for. He was a good, low-key actress, but not at the top, but at the moderate level, making him professional in the role. Ralph Meeker, the only survivor of Sallivan's life-saving conviction (he is trapped under a pier and rises in the pier) is more energy than normal. This perfect actor was unhappy about coming to the movie after Brando and Clift. Both of them were on the way to a good actor, but not careless. Stanwyck and her husband (as in 1953 alone), sold it to the extent that he was involved in the sale, was an interesting premise if it were a different kind of movie, all of which could be raised with all kinds of interesting questions about Stanwyck's character. Meager is more interesting than Sullivan; Stanwyck is more alive on his stage than his wife and son. But this is not a Stendberg game, but Stanwyck's form of a form that it is likely to want to shoot - leaving the issue of her husband's problem short - remains unexplored. In this sense, the coming tide can not be very effective, although the film is a great place to work, beautiful photography, nearly all of which are outdoors and humiliated, Mr. Mr. thanks to the perfect direction, it is intense and highly entertaining. Sturges.
