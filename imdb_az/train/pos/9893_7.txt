The weak geeky Marty (Simon Scuddamore) burned horribly, for the worst mistake of April Fool's day. For decades, Flash has been psyched to an assembly of 10-year school, masquerading race for those who have been in the game for a decade (known as Caroline Monroe, Maniac, Faceless and Horror Films) I knew it was a bad movie because it was a sinful pleasure. It has all the features of one. But there is something about it, which keeps me from time to time (with beer on top). <br /> <br /> I am even ready to look at a strange end (I mean, I hate). I love it, because it has a fun atmosphere and some pretty cool shoots about it. <br /> <br /> <strong> <font color = red> </ span> <br /> < br>> My Price: B- <br /> <br /> Lionsgate DVD Extras: Optional trivia track; trailer for this movie; and Trailers for My Bloody Valentine (1981), Monster Squad, Dirty Dancing
