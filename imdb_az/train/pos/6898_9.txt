This is a language from the beginning of the film, with everything that is fun in France, and then Fanfan La Tulipe brings a very rare but very brave hero. Lollobrigida, a strange young man depicted by the magnificent Gerard Philippe, says in his destiny that he will marry King Louis XV's daughter! The problem is more, La Lollo soon finds something very fond of Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> The film is moving fast with good sword battles, cavalcades and other inspirational segments and very funny moments. This is perhaps the weakest aspect, but the film is so sluggish that it feels so serious that I can not give it a second thought. Look at traditional Christmas Christmas Roquevert in French films that launches La Lollo's stolen, self-destructive, and sophisticated La Lollo's handwriting! And a gem of Marcel Herrand's king-like Louis XV, driven by megalomanous and lustful! Not all of them: Many beautiful women in a movie desires me in France and retreat in 1952! The film may have appeared in that year, but its vervi, cheeks, superb stories, perfect photos and unforgettable Gerard Philip are modern and enjoyable to watch. I will not be afraid to recommend my single grandchildren who love movies and especially those who love swashbucklers! See it!
