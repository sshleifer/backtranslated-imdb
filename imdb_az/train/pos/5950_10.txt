This movie is great. It's quite right for a classic book written already by Mark Twain. The film begins with a scene where Hankin reads a song with a band called "When you hit your foot". This song of Sinatra recalls the high hopes, it is entertaining and inspirational. It's great within music and my most favorite song is played by King, Hank (Bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggy" Sagamore. OVerall is a great family movie or even a great history movie. This is a movie that you can watch over and over again. Rhonda Fleming's princess is spectacular. I love this movie! If you love Danny Kay in the Jester Jester, you will definitely like this movie.
