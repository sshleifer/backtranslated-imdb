Die Nibelungen in Part 1: See also my comment on Siegfried. <br /> <br /> The second part of the joke production produced in the NFA's NFA's UFA studio proceeds in a stylized, symphonic, and emotional aspect of the predecessor. In the first part, despite the indefinite description of individual heroic acts, the second part has a chaotic description of a large-scale bloodshed. <br /> <br /> As in the first part, director Fritz Lang is required by her continuous dynamic rhythm, moving scene and shooting compositions quickly and effectively falling as the tone of each stage. These pictures should only be watched on the Kino DVD, with the remarkable Gottfried Huppertz account. Now, while focusing on mass activities, Langen faces greater challenges in staging. <br /> <strong> <font color = red >> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of us witnessed Siegfried's adventures really without disturbing , the latter represents the war as a destructive tragedy. The absence of flawless contact with the characters in both pictures. For this reason, Lang does not let the camera move, and does not allow us to feel the same (and this is important because it covers the audience, usually the Lang work distinction). <br /> <br /> Despite this, Kriemhild's revenge always deals with his feelings and is actually a real humanist. When Atilla captures the baby for the first time, she is a moment of the nature of her life, and Lang is emphasizing the sensitivity of this scene, like a wild, rugged ride of hunting. Here, Lang does not manipulate us without taking sides, and in this respect, unlike Wagner, this version is more common with the original saga. Climactic slaughters are a battlefield scene. Why then Hitler and colleagues? was it too much to tremble on a fact that was unfair to the reputation of the film? Because the racist ideology of the Nazis automatically saw Nibelungs as good children, even when they killed the baby and betrayed their relatives. <br /> <br /> Hitler, their enemies, will always be a national tragedy, not a human being. <br /> <br /> Non-slip viewers for us, this shaping, is a beautiful sense of beauty and music rhythm. When you see Lang's sophisticated silent photos, he realizes how wasted he is in Hollywood. In addition to throwing her out of the budget with budgeted potatoes, she has to force her to work in one of the swords and sandals epics, unconvincing pictures, and images that should not move emotionally, sweeping us with operative tonalism.
