Mr. Michael Jackson is an art phenomenon. His short films, that is, music videos are simply good. I have to get a fantastic fantasy feature from this guy, but I'm trying to combine some of her bare dance, screaming sounds, cool choreography, and some parts of CGI and animation. There should be a couple of continuous videos. Everything I mentioned here is here. According to Mr. Michael Jackson, the foolish plot and the over-the-top "spatial exhibition" is not a problem. I will always be the last kings of musicians (not the word "pop", but "rus", because "pop" sounds like "donkeys" in Russian and MJ is not necessarily "donkey"). <br /> <br /> My first impression is that "What's This?", "What's This?", "Best Music Videos" (bits of different videos, some of them shot, jumps from one theme to another, any discrepancy plan line there are some kids around, folly, etc.), but as I've watched until the end, there is nothing like this on television today. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < textual align: justify; The best classic videos of other artists can not be too close to the energetic hypertoniation of MJ music. Even though some of the clips have been released earlier, only the "Moonwalker" is "HIStory I", "HIStory II" and "HIStory II", although it's a movie ("Effective Crime", "Paparazzi" and more than a few bizarre coding and twisting) "Moonwalker"). <br /> <br /> I can not be an admirer of MJ, I will not be able to give this as "something like film", 10 to 10 stronger ("Smooth Criminal" The main complaints are: the film's initial segments are the main "MJ anti-drug campaign" aha too much "thunderstormed humanity and stress" and, of course, more "moonwalking") Thank you for your attention.
