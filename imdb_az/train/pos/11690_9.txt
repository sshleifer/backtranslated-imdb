I was dying to see this movie. He still decided to rent it. It was absolutely worth it. This movie made me laugh from beginning to end. Chris Rock, although in a movie, is funny, it should be closer to its greatest. If you have a look at a family movie, ie teens in advance, and then u can not pass anything.
