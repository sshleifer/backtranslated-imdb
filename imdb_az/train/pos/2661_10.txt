... Stanley first distinguished between such genres. In Dr. Strangelove, you have created a comedy about a terrible situation and is actually a terrific scenario that gives you so many funny moments. Slow-burning madness and an attempt to kill a family are certainly not welcome, but the dialogue is well-known ('five months of peace I want to want') and a scary drinking scene <br /> <br /> If you include some kind of spirit, but on the other hand, when you are actually the heartbeat. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with those who say that the hotel has drawn little attention to Jack Torrance. Nicholson presents the audience as an actor, pointing to the potential of madness when the head of the family is aware of alcoholism and is far from his wife and son. In addition, the environment within it draws on these personalities and draws them to consciousness. As the building is sometimes thought to leak into the events that take place there, the hotel is unhappy, but the intelligent person feeds on the frailties and uses the weaknesses, which ultimately leads him back to the point of return. <br /> <br /> Kubrickin's cold and separate approach is a great job for a laughing horror movie, and he is always whipped by Jack Nicholson, an unpredictable force of nature, giggling and frightening your thoughts. Do not be sure how far you can go when it explodes. Together we have made a great team and made us classic with the combination of their talents. If you want a great viewing experience, this is a good and really brilliant example ...
