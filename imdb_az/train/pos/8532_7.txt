Lupine, looking for a legendary treasure, set out for Morocco. His only clue is an interesting miracle given to him by the old man. <br /> <br /> An interesting thing about this movie is that Jigenin has a smaller role than ever before, and is generally different from Lupine. On the one hand, their classic dynamics have been abducted, but this is a change of speed. However, Lupine focuses on women ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko rules. Throughout all of his features, he is deceiving Lupine and our followers. Then Lara is the daughter of this special fairy tale and she is very unpleasant. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong>, as well as some entertaining scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata, of course, is here in a fine condition. <br /> <br /> Indeed, this is a smooth slide with Lupine. The area has medium and some slow spots, but all of this is a real pleasure. Enjoy.
