Did you know that this film is from Anthony Kiedis (Red Hot Chili Peppers) singer. Blackie Dammit is the father of Anthony. After reading Anthony's biography "Scar Tissue," I saw it and saw a picture of his father. I thought, "At the age of eighty, the man I was watching looked at me as something, and then I read and said that his father was a small actor, and I realized that he was his father in the film because I can not remember that he is in this movie anywhere in the movie, maybe his son's father was embarrassed to serve in this flick, but I need it. I think his father, Blackie, did a great job at the show.
