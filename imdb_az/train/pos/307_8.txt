"They are all Laughed" is one of these little movies I would recommend to your friends to look for something ordinary. It gives a deeper place to the past romantic traditions of the past, but it seems more modern. Even the decisive atmosphere in the 80's does not even come to the present. Bogdanovic sheds light on the whole enterprise, and this truth does not fade away. However, this sweet little movie is based on actors to continue this kind of doubt and "TAL" is blessed with a dream that understands such tales. This is a movie that will not remain in memory for a long time if it was not for a moment with a perfect pen: Colleen Camp shouted John Ritter and his dog's orders simultaneously; Blaine Novak opened her hair under her hat; especially Dorothy Stratten falls to John Ritter and says, "Strange ..." This is part of the exhaustion that does not want to put too much on the fear of shaking it, but of course, it leaves a light heart and smile on the face.
