Brilliant! My husband and I joined the sprawling line to see Hollywood in the Edinburgh Film Festival. After seeing the film, I understand why it was so long. Holly is a story related to a possible relationship between two people. She is a young girl, she is outdated western. The film grasped every bone in the body. There is not any graphic scene or anything that is hard to watch - its surrealism that begins in the gut really. The film is beautifully drawn. Among others, we liked the scene where Holly learned to ride a Patrick's little motorcycle. Thuy Ngoyen's rawness (this is not his first performance) and Ron Livingston's performance has been with me for a few days. Be advised.
