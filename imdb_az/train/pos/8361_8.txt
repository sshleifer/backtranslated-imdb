I had a mixed feeling for Les Valseuses (1974). I wrote Bertrand Blier and started watching it, but I liked it. I would not call it vulgar ("horror and iron" vulgar, "the sweetest thing" is the lie, but also stupid fool); I would call it a shock and an attack. I do not understand why many viewers, especially women, do not like and even hate it. The misogyny (or visible) epitome and the way two antiheroes seem to be unspeakable to every woman they want to meet. But I think more and more that this is a little unpleasant little boat that we understand. I love Blierin so far away. The film is very entertaining and very pleasant: well written, everyone's actions are first class, music is sweet and melancholic. In fact, when I thought, two friends did a good thing for the women they met: a woman on the train (cute, intelligent blonde Brigitte Fossey, who began her career with one of her most influential debuts). René Clément's "Forbidden Games" (1952) 6-year-old) for two months to see her husband; Finally, a cold Marie-Ange (Miou-Miou) appeared and found a satisfying castle; young and very talented Isabel Huppert (in one of the early screenings) became clear and educated. His encounter with Jeanne Moreau raised this comedy to the tragic level. In a word, I'm not sure if Gérard Depardieu wanted Jean-Claude and Patrick Dewaere to meet Pierrot and invited them to dinner, but I had a good time watching the film and breathing for two hours - never boring.
