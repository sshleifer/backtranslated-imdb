Silly movie is really funny. Yes, there are dead moments, it can be a bit more clear, in the second half, a little bit backward, and the story is inappropriate, but it laughs so comically. And it's just worth seeing Ed McMahon as the right wing cookie. This film is in the same class as Elvira, Dark Mistress, and also another incredibly comic, free movie.
