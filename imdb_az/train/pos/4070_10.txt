I know anime. It's been a long time since I did not become a national phenomenon; Many people liked the Ranma before Dragonball Z could not do before. And, as far as I know, I'm not proud of what I say: all the animated IQs, the Sky Castle is one of the best. Obviously, people are good at Spirited Away, but I really do not agree. Most people only know the movie because it's an Acedmy Award; It's not an exaggeration - I just showed Sky Mononoke and Sky Sky Castle for people who are seeing the Spirited Away and agree that the latter is superior to two or three. Personally, I would never think of anything that can finally compare Princess Mononoke until I saw the Castle in the sky. I still think that the two previous things are better, but the Castle of Simma is easily with it; The castle has a number of key elements that are missing from Monsoon. Anyway, if you only see Spirited Away and think that Miyazaki is the best film, be prepared to rock your place.
