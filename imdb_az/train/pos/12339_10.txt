Loved Joan. Great performance. He is not good. I watched this movie and later Jane Eyre ... just keeps improving. My heart beat. Great old movie drama. What I want from a classic movie. Facial expressions are worth the whole film. I'm glad I did. I do not know what's more in a movie. Beautiful woman .... wealth ..... longing ..... murder .... detectives ...... a trial ..... <br /> <br /> Costumes are very beautiful. What surprises the budget for this movie? They would still make such films. They only seem to make a cheese movie when they try. Black and white films still hold a certain mystery.
