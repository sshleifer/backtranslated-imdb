It was a very fun movie, and I love it, usually I do not rent movies (ie indie flicks), but I'm attracted to the movie because it's my favorite Jamie Kennedy since Scream trilogy. Film director is a risk (a risky risk) that explains the lives of different people (and many others) and interacts with different interactions. This risk is a good idea because the result is a very good film. <br /> <br /> The film has several MAIN characters; Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) - her relationship with her lover is based on rocks. Wallace Gregory (John Carroll Lynch) is an airplane loader / technician who is in love with all creatures (maybe even meter workers) and despite the good heart, there is a growing amount of failure. Cyr (Brian Cox) - a Chinese restaurant / donut shop owner with a germaphob and the fear of germs puts under pressure Sung - (Alexis Cruz) under pressure to catch his phobia. Ernie (Christopher Bauer) married Olive - Christina Kirk convinced her that she was sure; stop her entertainment, look ridiculous, get crazy and live a normal life. They start with small and almost delusional arguments, and Zea seriously begins to doubt Ernie. Gordon (Grant Heslov) is a man whose life is not going well, because bad things start to add to his life and he decides to take his hand. Mitchel - (Jon Huertas) Gwen - (Alexandra Westcourt) is not sure that her dreams are girls and they are assigned to each other, even though they are no more suspicious. He tries to take every chance and, of course, makes attempts! Johnston - (Michael Hitchcock) is just dismissed and suspects the role of the provider, he gets another job that just does not fit. His wife, Annelle - (Arabella Field) Johnston comforts her with loss of experience as long as she does not know if she is a lover of thought. <br /> <br /> Generally, I strongly recommend this movie! <br /> <br /> - Erica
