Oliver Hardy is bedeviled by the sound of the horn, call, phone, and thrombus, and Dr. Finlayson advises the diet of peace and tranquility and goat's milk. Joint Stan Laurel comes with a great solution in a salty boat, so the air of the saltwater can help you get all the rest you need. <br /> <br /> This is a great value for all the hijinks, since the boat was set up with a goat and the escaped prisoner (Richard Cramer) was on the road. <br /> <br /> I got a kick from the film's entire naked, in the horn testing factory, with the sign "Silent Work". The early story of the boy has many mixed plumbing and device mishaps, and Stan is a banana in a banana flue. There are a few great lines on the Laurel picture. "We should not belong to each other," but a person who is on me is the real law of the self-protection aver- age of the offender on the ship! <br /> <br /> I'm not a great student of Laurel and Hardy, so I know as a child, and today I find them to be entertaining. in my youth. This number provides a good hornofobic entertaining clock for the "Saps At Sea" hornomani.
