I saw and loved 'New York: I love you'! After actually watching "Paris je t'aime", I hope to see it and generally it likes it, perhaps Paris Paris again. I read some of the reviews on NY: ILY and yes, the movie is not error-free. While respecting a city like New York, it can be very aggravated and justly fair to the city ... because without any of the deficiencies of the film, <br /> <br /> From Paris je t'aime In contrast, the short film of each director is properly distributed and titled, NY: Not ILY, and many reviewers have discovered the flawlessness and coincidence of stories. the characters here are sensitive and even blended. I thought otherwise. I like how stories follow each other, and I liked especially the overlapping of characters - it can be cunning because it often happens in movies. But I still loved it because I did not find it hard. <br /> <br /> Some of the films I love are all there. most of it was by Robin Wright Penn and Chris Cooper and Yvan Attal. It worked very well and later appeared - it was written in a way that was not used in the past - it brought me to tears and I cried all along the following segment. I always loved Wright Penn and now is a fan of Chris Cooper. <br /> <br /> This is a valuable start for a few moments, when he is alone outside of the restaurant, before he begins to call - to talk about Cooper's ability to convey a symbol without telling anything. <br /> <br /> This movie covers symbols approaching each other more than once, with the first meeting or the 4-5 syllable symbols they have known for a long time. The stories were different to me (and I could be wrong), but all were trying to go home, and even to take a step back and make people and things we know in a new light in our lives for a long time; <br /> <br /> Some movies are different from what you've met and what you've seen for the first time, with the eyes of a human being and his surroundings. with Carlton Acosta and Taylor Geare, by Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirlby by Brett Ratner, Shekhar Kapoor, Julie Christie, Shia LaBeouf, and John Hurt, and by Yuri Caf√© by Orlando Bloom and Christina Ricci, by Natalie Portman, and by Atan Ethan Hawke and Emilie Ohana . I need to do more for Yvan Attal. <br /> <br /> Generally, watch this movie with an open mind. Read Before Watching! This will not meet your expectations of what a movie about a movie and love is in New York, and I doubt that any movie really conforms to this concept. Watch this movie just for a good music, beautiful landscape cinema, some feelings of life, and a story or two movie just to your hearts.
