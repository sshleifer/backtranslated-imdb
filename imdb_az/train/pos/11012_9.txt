When I watched a documentary, propaganda film or dramatic presentation, I was not sure at first. Hopefully, all of this has been combined with the time of production. <br /> <br /> The intentionally the dramatic plot could have been predicted somewhat. But you thought it would be an interesting scene as the film continued. <br /> <br /> The place where this movie came together for me came to an end. The scenes had a reality that I had never encountered before (at least I understand it). You can place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of young warriors. <br /> <br /> It was mixed with the usual problems of describing wounded Japanese soldiers at a time when real Japanese actors could imagine a little bit. <br /> <br /> The film is as beautiful as the source of the state of the American mentality in 1943 as a war with Japan. Japan has been interested in Japan with the help of Japan in the past years.
