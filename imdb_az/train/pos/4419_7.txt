<br /> <br /> I saw this movie and heard that writer director Juan Gerard spoke at Santa Barbara International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> What do I know about this, for the past 8 years, how the old boy in Cuba's Revolutionary era and his home and his family were affected in 1958? <br /> <br /> His opening scene will be named "Cinema Paradiso". In fact, the film refers to classic films: Roulette Wheel (Casablanca), "Chicken Curling", Reasonable Reason, "Touch of Danger" references; you can find more. Homeless man (Georg Stanford Brown) refers to the Cuban folklore, which often uses a black man as a kind of Greek chorus. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a ghost summary. GÃ©rard has a desire to honor his family and the middle part of the movie he loves. <br /> <br /> This is Juan Gerard's true story, and all people living in it are described as real events. Gerard was actually an architect and engineer (and passionate film lover) but his dream was to make this movie. He and his wife decided to make a dream, and Harvey Keitel became the "angel" of Gerard, who believed in it and agreed to produce it and star. Keitel keeps the screen strongly as a mysterious and secret dad "Che". Brown and Keithel are the only Americans to cast. <br /> <br /> Of course, the first half of the film suffers from the strict delivery of lines, while others are sliding over, but stay with it. The last half is better, the revolutionary events are bittersweet and unite for an honest gathering. This is Juan Gerard's first attempt, but with such sincerity, he is honest and passionate and heartfelt. <br /> <br /> <strong> Rector of Qafqaz University,
