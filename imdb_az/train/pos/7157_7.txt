This movie is an entertaining, entertaining and quality movie. The film follows very well the rules if the book can remain on the line. All actors are favorable and you are part of them. They use some famous actors that have a great influence on the movie. The graphic is somewhat dangerous in some parts, and there are a few bugs along the film. For example, there is no such thing as yellow stained Lizard. The camp is not as terrifying as described in the book, and they tend to refrain from showing books in the camp as a book. His entire band is mentioned in the book, but not in the film. Generally, a great movie for the rainy day
