I've seen this movie in the '80s and saw it again on the TV and it was almost forgotten when I watched it. <br /> <br /> All actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederick Forrest, and many more have seen it. Jason Presson (such as a twelve-year-old boy who is responsible for his brother's accidental shot death) is superior. The film has a very sincere part - a painful, quiet, deep-moving story with a family care. Dialogue is watching, but it says, and non-vale acting is superior. Simple People Like the simple, peer-to-peer version of the psychiatrist, sort as well as the same impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> Stone brings the boy to time and emotional energy.
