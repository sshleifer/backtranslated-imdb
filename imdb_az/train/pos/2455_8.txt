This is a very good movie, but it is very much anticipated. Change Kung Fu to a Pakistani footballer and a Turkish family, and look at the stage scene as Beckham Bend Dog (2002). As Kung Fu master pointed out several times, it is a great feature of the film, which is the development of the war with the mysterious ninja under the road, the painful losses and the gradual struggle to a win against it. Danish life differs from a different level of external appearance: non-native immigrants forming a large proportion of Danish citizenship, graffiti around Copenhagen, immigrant girl begging the film. When you hear the whole Danish word, it reflects a different picture.
