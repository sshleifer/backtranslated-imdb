I just found out that they had captured The Celestial region 3 DVD and the Five Venom DVDs and what they did. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A fantastic digital remastered transfer for the Kung Fu fan and a must have. <br /> <br /> The story is quite straightforward, and it has already been mentioned that I do not go in again. I do not know that many struggle scenes to get the movie and they are not disappointed. The only problem is that they are a little too far away and far above the training. Bruce Lee can take so much and at the same time drink a cup of tea! All the kicks and punches come with all the important "writer" clicks and the "whooshes", which has an extremely entertaining effect on the weather! <br /> <br /> I give this movie B +. Good but not good. I feel a bit better. Golden Swallow, ten years ago by the same filmmaker, had a good story and worked better.
