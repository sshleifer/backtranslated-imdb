I remember and I'm only 18, and I've been and I keep watching old movies because I have a lot of rewards for a long time (but I do not blame me) I'm fond of the 40s and 50s, Anyway, I have to tell the moment when I started watching my movie on the TV. Of course, my favorite character was Grandma Lucile Watson's grandmother. But I liked the picture of Betty Davis and her family. The kids did not behave like the smallest child. But there is a good reason for this to be that the children are hidden and have to use the majority of your life, the children have lost their innocence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul Lucas, , but they also did a great job, so it could have been both ways.Lucas's performance was so beautiful that at the end of the film I was tearing in, I loved this movie and I recommend it to anyone !:-D
