"Adult Movie" is a rare thing today, but Moonstruck does it well and is still better than a very good aging middle-aged movie. Funny moments have a nice specification (Italians in Brooklyn) that are not used to shorten movies, symbols or audiences, although they are less targeted than the rest of it. (for example, the Mobsters are never accidentally seen, it's never strange like my Big Fat Greek Wedding). The second story lines are explained by short scenes that give the economy a break from the main topic. These are the scenes missing in modern movies, where producers and bigwigs can not admire their immediate value. I missed these scenes. It also embraces beautiful older characters. The film itself is a light, quiet way to give its effect. There is no bad writing that is not included in any of the places where some leaders have relaxed the sphincter. Cage and Cher are doing very well. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck calls the old school, ethnic, worker New York as "Marty", less sacred than Moonstruck's path.
