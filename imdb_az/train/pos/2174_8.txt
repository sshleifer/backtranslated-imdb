I love this movie. "Prix de Beaute" was actually a silent film, but later dubbed to the French in 1930. Although dubbing over someone else's voices, this remains a surprising touristic force for Louis Brooks. The fact that his singing voice is dubbed by legendary Edith Piaf, helps us to deflect dubbing-related frauds. <br /> <br /> This is Lulu's story, and we see it for the first time at a resort with her ma√ßo lover Andre (Georges Charlia) and their friends Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu comes in as a pair of legs: we see her in a car changing to a suit. Lulu is too free to extinguish his body and does not sit well with irksome Andre. When Lulu is about to apply for the title of Miss Europe, we know that a happy end will not end at the end of the Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on men who have gathered beautiful women. We see the beauty of the beach and the reactions of men looking at them. But in the center there is a magnificent Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you do not guarantee watching movies from the past, please let us know. Louise Brooks is not a name that most adult movie enthusiasts can easily see, but if you see it, you will be sad and you will want to know more. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the DVD version of the US Movie DVD. I do not know if their projection speed is right. Many scenes will be shown fast. It could have been as they were. I dont know. But since it's the only way to see this movie, a little painful pill is worth it.
