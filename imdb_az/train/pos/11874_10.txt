Arguebly is Al Pacino's best roles. Tony Montana plays, a small time head of Cuba turns into a rich and powerful criminal lord in Miami, and he's doing this with two things in the world, balls and words, and for anyone. For a great time, the Cuban dealer began to work for Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and for a long time with his friend Manny (Steven Bauer), he quickly increased the ladder of the organization. Soon, there is an eye for the boss's sexy wife, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). Frank, after threatening Tony's position, tried to assassinate Tony, but he could not find any chance. Tony is angry and nothing can stop him now. the movie has a great support. F. Murray is a familiar face as Harris Yulin, a jump-hunting gangster, a crooked police officer trying to shake Tony who wants to marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Trisy's younger brother. Loans to Ecxellent scenarios by Oliver Stone. This movie is one of Brian DePalma's most brilliant scores, and you can see that this person is very talented in long and low career. The movie has a nice look. Also, pay attention to two memorable scenes: a fancy restaurant (tell the "good night to a bad man"). on the other hand, Tony still knows how he is attacking his house and how he knows how the 20 assassins who attacked his house know how. This is certainly one of the most impressive endings of a movie I've ever seen. For Al Pacino and for filmmakers, this was a spectacle. It is highly recommended for the rest. 10/10
