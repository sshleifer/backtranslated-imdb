"All this for you, Ed?" "You're gonna play now." On the day my father left my mother, he took this movie to the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood to meet with his new girlfriend. I was 14 years old. <br /> <br /> Ned Beatty will never forget the scene, especially the scene. <br /> <br /> Thirty-six years later, he is still giving me his conscience. <br /> <br /> My father was a great Burt Reynolds admirer, so it took about an hour to lead him to watch for the 'action movie'. Before, I had two films in the dome: "Grand Prix" and "Norwegian Sing". Well this was exactly Mario Andretti or Brady Bunch. After leaving the theater, I was shocked many times. <br /> <br /> Although I was in real age, I appreciated craftsmanship ... after seeing it again, I was still standing up after witnessing it <br /> <br /> Let's also note that it is enough to say that the first girl is a fourteen year old traumatic experience that she does not intend to kiss her. <br /> <br /> I do not blame my father for taking me, but there was more to a child's testimony. <br /> As an adult, I am still very disturbed, but I'm still sorry. Burt Reynolds, as an absolute miracle, just like all the principles ... Billy Redden looks like a strange guitar curiosity, looking at Ronny Cox as a terrible insurer ... everyone is doing a fascinating job . The quality of the sound is up to one of the torn pieces of the birds. <br /> <br /> All the technical features of this charming film are photography, cinematography ... first degree. <br /> <br /> The moral questions raised by the murder of sexually assaulted people until the murder of a man are deeply rooted today when this groundbreaking film is released. The classic sequences that try to live in the desert after such unexpected brutality are changing. The four men, the men of the city, suddenly faced a sudden situation, lifted the bar to the panic. <br /> <br /> This is a classic to be sure. And the phrase "you have a lot of mouth" is celebrated on Saturday night with a discount on off-the-cuff comments around the water cooler, this movie is undoubtedly a major part of our public pop culture ... <br /> <br /> If you What will you do if you see that your friends are attacked by a mountainous boy away from your life? comfortable bed, wife and children in the city? If you take Burt Reynolds measures (and I would do that), whether you're browning under the lake immediately or trying to get your chance? Bottom Line: Provides Firefighting. You can get it in the bank. <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> My favorite part of the movie has survived: Ed did not kill the grave. .. then changes. Life and this unexpected situation can change one person. I guess this movie is about John Voight, especially as Ed has the best performance here. One of the more mature actors in Hollywood's history is up to Midnight Cowboy's Franklin D. Roosevelt in Pearl Harbor, and the player is moving to another level. The stones in the flood are determined to climb, horrify and right. <br /> <br /> I will guarantee that the heart failure will be raised to a new level. <br /> <br /> Briskly is intensely packed, like a paced, tense, tough, and banjo string, which is an ethical game that gives you questions that will not leave you today. <br /> <br /> <strong> Caucasus
