I do not understand the low 5.7 rating in this movie. It is a delight for people who love a strong regression and a dark atmosphere. The night of the night reminds us of the Good and the Devil's Garden (Savannah). The player is strong and I was amazed at the point of Kenneth Branak's southern accent. Famke Jansen is great, Robert Duval is impressive in a small section and Embeth Davitz BOMB. <br /> <br /> His wife is very good, but very good.
