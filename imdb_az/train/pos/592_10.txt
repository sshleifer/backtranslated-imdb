At Arlington Heights, IL, we have never been to any cafeteria at any elementary school (1961), so I used to go from school to bicycle to school and always looked at this game. True, I'm 11, but I thought it was the biggest thing! I make hidden pictures on my board and see my family or friends find it. If our competition took the ultimate secret picture, I remember getting a good car (Pontiac or Oldsmobile). <br /> <br /> I'm surprised how long this game is going on. I was delighted with music and covert pictures - a lemon that was hidden as a part of a bridge over a single garden I could still get. <br /> <br /> Really good memories are associated with Camouflage.
