This surface is one of the most delicate episodes that really look like an excuse for fun. AMA, I appreciate this light hearted approach, and this is one of the best episodes to really see in fun. Think about it - crew members are faced with strange incidents, with white rabbits and Alice's Wonderland, the Bengal tiger, samurai fighters, a riding horseman who killed McCoy, and no other appearance. Until the end, there is no sense. Despite all the dangers, you can not take everything very seriously - it is very entertaining and the whole episode looks very surprising. So, at a completely non-aesthetic level, these are wonderful things.
