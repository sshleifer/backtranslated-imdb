"The Lion King" is undoubtedly the most favorite Disney movie of all time, so I thought the sequels give you a chance and I did. Lion King 1 1/2 was pretty good and was laughing and entertaining with Timon and Pumba. The only problem is that sometimes I do not need any explanation because they can create holes in the field and just want a feeling of your own explanation. Well, I would highly recommend this movie for a night with the lion's royal fans or family. The first is a fun flick with the same laughs and favorite characters. So hopefully you will be the same as the third installment on Lion King. Sit back and imagine Hakata Matata! Does not mean no worries! <br /> <br /> 8/10
