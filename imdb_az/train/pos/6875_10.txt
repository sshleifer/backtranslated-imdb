When I was the chairwoman of our college coffeehouse, one of our work was to look at student activities and groups. One of the best things to do in 1972 was the Groove Tube. The original decision is that Broadway is off-off in theaters where television viewers will be placed on the audience, so everyone has a great place. The goal was to alter Saturday night live on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> I believe you were in Chevy Chase for the first time. While the trees were crying, they watched him naked. Like many reviews at the beginning of the mine, it was Saturday night before there was anything in it. I appreciate this video very much. I will not wait for my 13 year old son to get a copy of Koko's clown!
