As for the erotic genre, I'm lucky enough to look for something in my first 20 minutes to go or watch. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I love you do not touch me) led two very powerful actor Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery in this powerful tension. Kira is convincingly convincing that Doug Jeffery's novel "Kim" is a sweetly-guilty romantic novel on the internet, with a strange charge of "The Man". Kira lost control of the obstacles that hindered her role and could have been a T and A deeper and more convincing than an actress. I still believe he will have the best performance. Julie Davis's leadership is a great gift for eroticism.
