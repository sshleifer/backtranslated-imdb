I'm lucky enough to see this movie in England many years ago. I've seen hundreds of films since then, but I've never forgotten something. Sinatra was an excellent actor while playing a character that he did not like. Many people are really up to their role of "From Here to Eternity", but in my opinion, Conchoda was magnificent. Another role that I raised in my mind was William Conrad. I did not see or hear him before this movie. Conrad plays a great role in this film. I remember his deep and gravel sound and perfectly utilizes a few words that speak of a danger that defines the tone of his character. It also covers Conrad and when it appears. The best movie and my dream was that I had no chance to see it again. It appears to have disappeared from the earth. I see the film in black and white, but when I saw it was full of color, I remember Sinatra's blue form.
