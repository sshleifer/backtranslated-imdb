This is a humorous, comedian comedy in the low budget Brazil. Stage is as familiar as in 1950's Danny Kaye film. ** In a Fourth: A person who has the impression of a famous person as a joke is dragged into reality. <br /> <br /> The contrast between the two potentials is very effective. Raul Julia is a long, cool, dangerous, and Latino-like German-Parador secret police. He is deliberately engaged in a blond paint job. Richard Dreyfus, animated, short, New York is Jewish, funny, and sympathetic. <br /> <br /> There are many references to show business and in-house jokes. <br /> <br /> It is clearly modeled in Paraguay. Paraguay was originally ruled by an undecided military dictator, General Alfredo Stroessner, who had moved from Germany to his eighties until the end of the 1980s. When the writer / director Mazurszky embraced Parador / Paraguay as a Latin American oppressor, he exposes the ignorance of local wealth and faces great differences in wealth and current partisan rebels. Meanwhile, Mazursky's comic Jonathan Winters is actually the American retired as C.I.A. He is the president of the Parador Department and so powerful that he can chew sweat on the president of the country. <br /> <br /> In fact, the United States has little influence in Paraguay, and it is mostly happening in the region without the social and race weaknesses. It has struggled with long and expensive wars against the larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. The men's population was broken nearly twice, but the emerging society was patriotic, racist united and strongly united. <br /> <br /> Another level has a bow for feminism in the form of Madonna character. Madonna, played by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, is an old nightclub dancer with a delicate girl who starts with a movie at the start of the film, but is finally seen as a television presenter - now it is political and cosmetically straightforward, no makeup, hair straight <br /> <br /> once such an event actually took place in Latin America, Argentinean Isabel Peron (a lovely Evita, who never came to work) continued his leadership husband Juan Peron two years after the death of the legendary ** supremo **.
