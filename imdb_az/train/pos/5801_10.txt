This movie is fascinating, courageous, and music is very good. The film coincided with the Moonwalker album Bad (1987). I'm Bad.It's great (*****). On the scene, "Man in Year", Michael shows a date from Jackson's early days to Bad 5. Oh and Badder are also very good (Badraj is a music video parody of music video for a Bad video). Then show Speed ​​Demon video. The song and video are really really good. Leave me alone, then it looks. Then the movie shows Moonwalker.after a few minutes, he plays a smooth cricket in a club like club 30.
