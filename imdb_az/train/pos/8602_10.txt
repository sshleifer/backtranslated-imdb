Someone was more interested in Nathaniel Hawthorne than his successes. I believe that the same note may fit on McDonald-Eddy's pictures. And this is especially true. <br /> <br /> Probably, there are many features of the failed movie: kitsch, scripts, and sounds due to these scenarios? Also, this movie comes to a good end: Good Rodgers-Hart's music ("I'm married to an angel", "Tira tira tira la"), EE Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> Well, if you do not like it, do not forget. This strange movie really creates a very powerful, dreamy, impressive one, and it's likely you'll be able to remember it for days, perhaps a few days later. Why? In the 1930s and early 1940s, films were the same as today's offense - to direct the public to forget about the difficult reality of a dream. <br /> <br /> This is a good way to evaluate the film without watching it. whether it is good or bad. To watch this, as you see a dream.
