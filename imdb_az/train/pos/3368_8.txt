Hitler's visit to Rome is the peak of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the mother and mother of six children staying at the military parade in honor of the whole family, Hitler and Mussolini. The family should stay at home because they can not afford the servant. <br /> <br /> Along with his entire living quarters, he loved going to where he was a dear fan of Il Duce. <br /> <br /> If there is one exception. In the yard, Marcello Mastroian suicides his residence. Reason? He is homosexual and has recently lost his job as a radio worker. When these two people accidentally come across, the film is actually shot. Mastroian needs desperation and a bad friend. Loren, whose self-betraying husband is angry, misinterprets Mastroianni and is skillfully mastered, suggesting his body to be denied to him on a stacked and moving scene on the roof of the building complex. First, after the famine for this man, this anti-fascist is soon subdued to this world, ready to give all that homosexual, self-denying things. <br /> <br /> This beautifully made two movies with the two most advanced players. Loren proves to be a caliber actress when he runs well here. This is a simple, but powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people, and most important of all. Despite the sad ending, a change will occur, and someone understands it.
