Surfing like a popular sport was loved by many people. After watching the documentary, I realized how dangerous it was. In fact, surfers are afraid of great waves. Someone even killed him. But they are still surfing and they are very happy. Only brave people can do it. <br /> <br /> According to the Surfers, we can clearly see what they feel when it comes to the great wave. You have to adjust the best way and avoid direct vacations from the great wave. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A perfect sports documentary. 8/10
