The Stone Boy is a forgotten drama since the 1980s. Whether it's a popular or popular celebrity movie, it's a great thing to see how this movie can look. This is a slow, complicated, but tactile account of a catastrophe that falls within the household. The film is an indictment on the suppression of Midwestern values ​​and emotions. The film will not be all taste, but everyone who can appreciate the real human drama will do it well. <br /> <br /> In the early hours of the film we will cut off two brothers in the early hours of the morning. pick some chick peas and take a duck or two if they are lucky. When the barbed wire comes out of the fence, the pistol accidentally empties and the little boy kills his older brother. These guys have never accepted a hunter's safety course. There may be a way for two people to cross such a fence with a weapon: The first man goes out of way. Secondly, then the weapon flies through. The first person puts the weapon on the floor and on the other is the bar. <br /> <br /> Both arms and trolleys have no hands at all. <br /> In any case, after his brother was killed, 12-year-old Arnold returned to his own world. Even after his brother's shot, he will not help. He simply moves forward and takes the pea and tells his family about the accident. Arnold will not be sorry or sad at any point in the funeral or investigation. His family does not abandon him. Perhaps he is angry even to kill his brother. An ornery emir, played by Frederick Forrest, slipped out with Arnold, despite the death of his older brother, which allowed the child to hit his girlfriend. Arnold's parents do not understand how to deal with their son. They really are not trying to talk to him. The only person who can communicate with him is his grandfather, Wilford Brimley, who plays typical fatherhood skills. After a while, Arnold moves with the old timer. <br /> <br /> Arnold, Reno, will be unable to open up to a strange road trip to Nevada to investigate his uncle's ex-spouse. After meeting her, she begins to leave her shell after moving away from her to marry her in anger. Starting here, the film becomes a quick survey of reconciliation and reconstruction. <br /> <br /> In most cases, the player is inevitable. Robert Duvall and Glenn Close take on the parents of the perfect stoic farm. Forrest is good, but Paul Newman's effort on Hud can be a great deal. Cinematography is also an exception. If you like moody pictures about the general public, this may be for you. Some are also encouraged to bring some tissues. <br /> <br /> Goodbye.
