Jan Harlow and Clark Gable played a great role on the screen, and this could have been their best film together. <br /> <br /> Yes, your friend can be cheerful and predictable, but it's not what I love about the movie. I like to see Harlow and Gable together and they're just wonderful in this movie. <br /> <br /> That's why it's a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> It is a good thing to pay attention to magnificent dialogue, great writing and detail. movie For the first time I liked this movie I saw, and at every single audience I always understood at least one new detail. For me, this is a sign of the big movie. <br /> <br /> Dialogue and script are better than most films (from the beginning of the 1930s). I love classical films, but I admit that most of them are only moderate and do not interest me. <br /> <br /> This is because your Man is a "pre-coded" movie. (Hays code was not executed after one year after capturing it.) This movie could not be done under code. Yes, it would have been, but it would be a completely different event. The good password was not used until 1934. Otherwise, we missed this gem.
