This is the hottest movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Starting with the four criminals sent by their ancestors to the Wienberg Military Academy, a ton of continuous continuing throughout this goofball movie is set and does not take one second. <br /> <br /> To describe this film; humor elements have such a place and look brighter than the first look, nothing but stupid 80's teenage comedy comedy. But oh much more! The MAD magazine, which is fresh from these nations' minds, serves a recurring formulas and style of any of the "funniest" suggestions for a while ago from Hollywood. Basically, the movie is full of infantile mixed materials that you can imagine is that kids writers are a few children of 14 years. See what you love in this movie as "untrained" behaviors. Classic. *****
