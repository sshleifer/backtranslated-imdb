The first film ever prepared. Stream workers from a factory, some bikes, most rides, moving right or left. In addition to Melies, Lumieres is the starting point for both cinematic and entertainment - Melies begin with literary fiction, cinema, fantasy, craftsmanship, spectacle; Clean, inappropriate, observation with Lumieres. The truth. <br /> <br /> There are many intellectuals who regret the Kinoun ossification in the former old formulas of the latter. There is nothing 'objective' about it. The movie is full of action - a static, inhumane scene of life, activity, and excitement, a quiet harmony of the frame, from the back to the right or to the left (but never, of course, the camera). However, the camera still stays in stock, it contains energy, it is subject to change and will. The cinematographer can be a revolutionary invention, but it will be used for conservative purposes - to correct, edit, limit and restrict the world map. <br /> <br /> The film's historical reality is worse. These factory workers are employees of Lumiere. Managers are spying on their employees, and they are invisible eyes with their invisible eyes. Therefore, the film describes two types of imprisonment. The workers behind the doors are limited to workplaces. Opening the door is a view of freedom, a run, but it encounters the fourth wall with another wall and is even further restricted. The first film is also the first example of CCTV observation, an unprecedented look, and all service providers are slaves. Fear, very prophetic film.
