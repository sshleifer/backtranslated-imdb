A few years ago, I ran to the syndicate of this show and fell in love with it. TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor are smiling and smiling after the next episode. Perhaps I do not think so great and I think it's been canceled after a few seasons, but I believe it's a good run and I'll wait for it ... if that's the case.
