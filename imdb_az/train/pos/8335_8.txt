The brilliant chemistry between Ryan and Robbins is an extra addition to the supporting game (including Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning, and Jacobi, Saks and Maher's cheerful trio), although there is reason to see this movie. Matthau lights up like Einstein, perfect as Fry Ryan's clinical fianc√©, and Shalub's Einstein's gonads line is one of the key moments of the film. Rhyming is the poetry of poetry that says that Robbins first appeared in public. Kudos to the writers to manage this foam with reason and grace. I thought Keene Curtis was as beautiful as Eisenhower. It can be regarded as a chicken movie, but everyone thinks it will take a shot. Eight solid solid points.
