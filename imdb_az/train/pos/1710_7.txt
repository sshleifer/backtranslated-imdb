This movie is a full version of the doordarshan TV series, the Indian television channel, which has been broadcasted at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre", which meant balloons. Each episode was a new story. The story is excellent and original, very sweet and "convincing" Abhay Doel is a good job, but it does not fit the role of "normal" and "third class" children (it also calls itself to the film itself). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Available. It is the same story that begins with the friends' mother and with the initial acquaintance. Television actors' actions were better than these "stars." <br /> <br /> Only a half hour (or 45 minutes) of the movie is a 2+ hour film. So you need to get draggy. <br /> <br /> These movies are lazy on Sunday afternoon and really refresh if you do not watch the original TV series. The scenario and the end of the array were better. <br /> <br /> ##### ######### ##### #### SPOILERS AHEAD ######## ###### CLAIMS AHEAD # ######## ######### ######### ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ######### THE hero feels that he is ready to marry, the ending of the original array was much stronger. He knows and does not want to "give it back" and says that he never helped. The director or script could not capture the original end of a movie in a written way. The original end would have taken the tears to the eyes of the girls and would have assumed that the children would agree. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> The director / writer should not be given a credit. The story is beautiful and is one of the most famous novel-writers known as PRemchand munshi. I am not convinced that this is a prestigious storytelling, but many of the other short stories are similar to stories from several premieres and other Indian writers.
