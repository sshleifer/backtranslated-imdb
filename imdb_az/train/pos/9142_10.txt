Purple Rain ... What else can I say, the hood speaks for itself. But I think all actors are well chosen. There was a great story in the film. I loved it! I watched this movie for eighty years since I watched and I'm only 13! My favorite part of the movie was when her father died and when he collected all his musical pieces, Apollo was sitting in his jewelery with his hands. Critics say it's a drama, but romanticism is much more preoccupied. Murphy Brown did a great job in the movie, and he really acted as himself. I'm glad to see this movie. Beautifully played Purple Rain, the song was so heartfelt. I cried more than once.
