This is the three most loved films for me. Once again I liked all the songs. But a big problem is contrary to the original of this story, as we have already noted. Recalling the first film, the bears introduced the "merciless" that they never knew. Certainly, they have taken away their bellies after proving how much they care for our brothers. In this story, however, a cousin grows up with care bearing and usually has abdominal characters. That's not a bad movie as long as you keep separate from each other. I thought the Darkheart character was the worst then Nicholas first. But at the same time, I felt that it adds some kind of balance to the sweetness of the mood. Although I know other people have mixed feelings about this scene, I also liked that we finally felt anxiety. And of course, I liked the songs. My love is growing and the future is young. Care movies always have good songs. Ten stars for a very good movie.
