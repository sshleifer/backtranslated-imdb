I liked this movie very much, but firstly the gray graphics seemed strange with grain pictures, but soon I got into it. Thousands of hours have to be filmed and I'm really amazed at the work done to cut it. If you are shocked by drug or violence, this can not be a movie for you, but there are some great characters (and some real tossers). Technically, I liked that they did not use a new de-interlacing algorithm, or maybe the images seemed so dark, but I did not worry about the ordinary workings in the video for the transfer in the movie. (Open Water has dumped me, mostly cheap, progressive cameras, and I do not see an excuse despite going to the screen in the movie). We're sorry, I'm a little fool. If I have nothing to do with music, I strongly recommend this movie, there are some tragic moments, but many of them are unpleasant, others can be accused of laughing happily, but this is a classic piece.
