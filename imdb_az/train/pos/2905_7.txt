An entertaining movie that is easy to watch, almost always entertains you. The director's job is recognized and the type of humor is his trademark. The film is typically a history of police officers like a deadly weapon, but the jokes and comedy are Argentine varieties. One of them is a psychologist who plays Peretti, and while helping her (when Diaz has difficulty cheating on her husband), she has to go through the task of Detective Diaz (Luque). Some dialog boxes are not fun in the world: they are understandable and laughable everywhere. In general, it is very good, it deserves 8, but it was rated at 7 because I was somewhat in the end. Of course, I would like to point out that "bravo" for Argentine filmmakers is that little good comes lately.
