"Der Todesking" is the second full-length feature film of Jorg Buttgereit (the first, "Nekromantik"), not the central character or symbol, but rather the thematic sustainability of suicide. They are divided into days of the week, and each has a set of things that completely destroys the stranger. That is, the production values ​​are less and worry, but Der Todesking is very effective in many respects. more important than pure entertainment. Unlike other Buttgereit's works, this is not a strange one, but in the episode of Tuesday, there are some unpleasant images, such as the casting area, in a curved body and in various acts of suicide. The last (Sunday) episode is very surprising and painful! - If you like my ideas, look incredibly 10 to 10 of this post-modernism shock!
