This perfect drama drove me all the time. I could not take my eyes off the screen for a moment, because every piece of speech had made this striking crime. It really touched me, because this film showed how sad and tough life could be. I really cried at the end (I do not want to!) In addition, I understand how cruel and heartwarming people can be when it comes to murder. <br /> <br /> The cast was also very good. The actress who played Anne Marie was just a bad player. The actress did a great job, but there was no director. I say this because Anne Marie Fahey found someone like her.
