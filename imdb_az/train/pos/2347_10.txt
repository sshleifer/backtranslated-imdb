I was a fan of Pushing Daisies since the beginning. <br /> <br /> There are some of the most remarkable ideas for this show. <br /> <br /> Television's creative, like Daisies, who needs the original show, is striking. This is a great relief to see a show, that is, if you compare it to some new shows, such as Scrubs and House, you will see similarities and awake moments. <br /> <br /> In every episode with a magnificent cast, beautiful writing and festivity, Daisies Pushing is one of the most striking shows on television.
