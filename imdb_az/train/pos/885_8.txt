Before I watch this, I have to admit that I have doubts about this film. The main reason for this is the comparison with Hitchcock. I have watched a few films that inspired Hitchcock or could be made by the 'Suspense Master', but I have never seen any of this movie ever since. time. In my opinion, Hitchcock has become a home for promoting some cheap money, but I have to admit that I'm interested in having this European movie. Normally, these are the major Hollywood studios who want to abuse Hitchcock's name, if it is to increase revenue. But this film was adopted in one of the most chovenic European countries and I'm sure most of the films were killed rather than acknowledging that the movies were inspired by the British. <br /> <br /> I decided to try this movie and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> A story about a young secretary called "Sur mes l√®vres" or "reading my lips" named Carla. He is a hardworking and loyal employee, but he has not been highly appreciated by his colleagues. There is much to it that he suffers from a hearing impairment that hinders the company's hierarchical ladder. However, these changes are estimated when a trainee can work for him. Paul Angeli is 25 years old and totally unscrupulous. Man is a thief, but Carla gives him a chance and, if necessary, covers him. <br /> <br /> I believe Hitchcock is often used because it hopes to teach you how to look at a regular life, but also drags it along with it ... <br /> <br /> describes a very good tension I will not compare anything between this film and the director of Hitchcock and Jacques Audiard. Actually, the guy did a really good job with this movie. I have never heard of it before, but it is true that it knows how to set back and how to be interested in starting from the beginning. Of course, there is much to do with the beautiful and original story. I have no doubt in Hollywood that she has never met a woman who has a defective woman in a strong role. Instead, the main subject of a humiliating husband (you know, the story of a typical television movie). <br /> <br /> Also, he is in this movie. Vincent Cassel is quite famous, but Emmanuel Devos was a complete mystery to me. There is nothing strange about their role, but both of them have done excellent things with their characters, and they felt very convincing and realistic. Paul could be a moderate heavyweight prisoner, and Carla was generally a desperate woman, but thanks to her performance, both of them believe that there are two very powerful people who have a lot of bad luck but the best way to get them <br /> <br /> All of this is a powerful movie with a beautiful script and some great action. Despite these doubts, I soon became one of his greatest lovers. I give this movie 8/10. Do not hesitate to give it a try.
