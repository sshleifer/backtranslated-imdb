We can say that if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie then you are not human! After being watched for the first time, I was hooked. Imagination is a staggering experience, but I'm sure other fans will approve it. After watching this, you will cry to think that these two beautiful ladies are not with us anymore. At least we have Gray Gardens to remember them! I think it's been a long time for us to get strangely independent of these two ladies. Although I always admire Jackie Onassis Kennedy, it does not seem like Big and Small Edie in your heart. Knowing such people is a rare treat; I just want it!
