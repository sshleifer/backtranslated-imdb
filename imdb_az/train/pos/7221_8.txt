Every time you think that you have a handle on Deaththrap, another branch twist comes. It's best to just sit in a good place and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Marked for screen kissing between Sydney Bruhl (Michael Caine), Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (which, unfortunately, I've cut the television version I've seen), there's so much more in this movie. <br /> <br /> Sidney Bruhl is a very happy person. Once a successful playwright, the last few Broadway players flopped. His wife, Myra (Dyan Cannon), is just about money and emotionally exciting, but it does little to make Sidney feel better. To add insult to injury, a young playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), sent a game to look at Sydney. It can be seen that Anderson is the first and Sydney young talent writer. He jokes to invite his wife Anderson to kill him and present his game as himself. She first laughs at her, but when she invites Anderson to really eat Sidney, she's really worried about bringing her scheme. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <STRONG> There are conflicts and turn into the whole field and faster and more strange when you approach the end. It's the kind of art that's on the edge of the chair and keeps it all the time. <br /> <br /> It is a great work and a work of mystery. Caine gives us a wonderful performance and she demonstrates a skill that is culturally, elegant and intelligent men play. Reeve, as you can see, is a good-looking man with a wide-eyed or innocent man. Cannon's longing is good for Myra. <br /> <br /> This is a never ending movie, and repeating traces help you get things that you have previously missed. views. Unfortunately, it is only a classic, which was once called for a scene that caused some sensitivity - and this is a real shame.
