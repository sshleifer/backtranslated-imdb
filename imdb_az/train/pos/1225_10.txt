Does anyone know where and how anyone can get this movie? !! Looking for a long way, someone helps! My girlfriends in 1997 and I was add on this Long Island movie based, and we really did not see it anymore. :( <br /> <br /> I was hoping to find a copy, so I can finally check it out and share it with the girls! Can I stop controlling myself as well (although in VHS format, it's not important for me to be frozen. ) You or anyone you know has a copy of this movie, and I'm ready to pay for a good copy!
