We do not see kinship in the Indian cinema kinda kinship or any other language or cinema. These relationships have many aspects that have not been exploited in movies or novels. Typically, a brother is described as a handful and can be used for the sacrifice. This film looks totally different on the subject. <br /> <br /> This is inspired by George Eliot's novel "Floss on Mill". My brother is a very good, very good, beautiful boy and a blue-eyed boy loved by his mother. The sister respects romantic, wild and unwritten rules of society. <br /> <br /> This film tells about the love of the two brothers who are separated from their childhood and are about to revive the same feelings when they talk about a year later. . <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that film and novel have been separated in two distant countries in three separate centuries, his brother is still alive and is still true.
