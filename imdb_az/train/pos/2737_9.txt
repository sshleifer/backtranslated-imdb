The film's b / w photography from the heart of the American heart tree was striking. When we return to Greater Canaan, then Mexico and America, we feel we are with them. Near the end of the film, the rain reflects on Robert Blake, the small shades and the tears rolling over it. Finally, we're watching your ladder at the last moment. <br /> <br /> Both criminals who played like Robert Blake and Scott Wilson by Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could have appeared on every street of any city. Hickock, a hero boy and Smith, is a man with a star on the wrong side of the city. This point is made in the film and it always doubts that the appearance of the criminals is no different to everyone. Evil, even worse, is part of the human condition. These two delusional men kill the whole family to search for a non-existent security. <br /> <br /> Several times, authorities have begun to write poor checks for the punishment. <br /> <br /> There are very good supporting actors. I love John Forsyth's case detective, Alvin Dewey. Also, Will Geer shines as a procedural lawyer in a short, but fine scene. <br /> <br /> I often wanted to see this movie all the way, but we kept it with short songs; Finally, I bought a DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this beautiful movie. For me, it's a big movie.
