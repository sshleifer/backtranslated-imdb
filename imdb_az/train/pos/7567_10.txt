Great film depicting cross-flows in a multinational mix of so ordinary people in the West Pacific Northwest. Writing along with the impeccable directing and beautiful performance demonstrated by Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film has been produced since the same year with the highly successful Crash, written and directed by Paul Haggis. The speed of the action may not be as strange as the city in Los Angeles, and the characters may seem to be closer to each other than "other than" but the personal relationships between characters are flawed and disturbing, and their resonance as any of the "Crash" . Those who appreciate "Crash" should see a movie. Also, fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes love this movie.
