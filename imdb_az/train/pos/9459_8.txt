I look at romantic comedies with some of the romantic comedies and romantic comedies have old clich√©s that make the movie unimportant. In a romantic comedy there is usually a girl and a boy, both of whom fall in love, then experience difficulties and then get tired of getting married. But this movie is a different story, really different from the Romantic Comedies I've seen lately. <br /> <br /> There is a mad son (Dan), a girl (Marie). Dan talks to Mari in a bookshop and sometimes talks to Marie after leaving. Dan develops something for him, and when something becomes meaningful, we get a twist. Marie is her brother's girlfriend. The inevitable situation, Dan plays with Marie and understands that he loves her, even though Marie loves her, but their love is not just possible. How is it possible that it is the rest of the story? <br /> <br /> Steve Carell is a good performer, Juliette Binoche is as good as Marie. And everything else is well done. Watch a good movie.
