I remember watching the Disney version, and now I think it's a magic touch that's been followed. After many other renditions, Ever aside, Cinderella has, in fact, lost themselves over the years. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Kathleen Turner as a bad stepmother, performing with flawless performance, and blown up with the disappointment of this fantasy story that I have been thrown from since childhood. <br /> <br /> We all know that Cinderella wants to go to the ball for the story of a young girl who is dying of her father and her nephew's mother and her son and for the ultimate freedom. But this plot line differs from the classic tale (whose name is Zizola and his family is called only Cinderella), losing himself for a dominant spouse whose father (now alive) slowly manipulates his love with his spouse and girlfriends he is trying to poison himself. Thus, Zizola goes out to rescue his father by breaking down the kidnapper and breaking the discovery. There, the bored Prince Valiant has a heartbreaking change from her dull life and is in love with a mysterious lady (held by a puppy named Mab) in strange clothes. <br /> <br /> The most attractive feature of this film is that the old Fairy Talee, which can not be compared to anyone, was original. Most Cinderella stories are not a false web site, but Cinderella does not see any reason why they want to join the ball, nor does the Disney version show the shallow side of the Prince. Instead, Cinderella's selfless heart is more than any production, and the artwork is simply stunning! All of the suits are beautifully prepared for Zizola's sapphire blue balloon, especially with Marcella Plunkettin's fantastic beauty and gentle sound. <br /> <br /> I will offer this movie to anyone interested in a sequence of classic fairy tales with an interesting twist. My only problem is that the producer and director do not have a complete collection of other Fairy Tales with the same element and the release of the movie.
