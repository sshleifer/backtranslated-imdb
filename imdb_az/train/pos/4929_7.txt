I condemn the fact that the film did not work. <br /> <br /> This film has a rare element, but it's in a single category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with this piece, and noir elements are unsuccessful. Of course, illness can be considered bad, but there are hard times to see. The film pointed to a darker side: Blackie can be trafficked, New Orleans police are keen on the arrest of the journalist, the story of all the people in the film, which is being pushed ... <br /> <br /> Ridini's motivation is with Marlowe or Spade there is no attempt to bring together, nor does Blackie attempt to bring the human body. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> Good work has been done ... but I repeat this movie again There's nothing wrong with turning back. Do not remember years ago, and then wait one time if you are away.
