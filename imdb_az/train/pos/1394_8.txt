Recently watched the watcher watch. I've seen it many times and I'm not tired of it. It is strange that I have been watching him lately every time, and for the first time I see him, he takes me back. This period includes. It's a mystery and "What's going on here?" <br /> <br /> It's probably strange that part of the story I have always felt unpleasant for me, this time really greatly affected me - Ruth. Gerald Fried had a lot of money. The real masterpiece! The romantic section was re-used - in a wider way - PARADISIN THIS SIDE. Of course it was released here. I get the impression that Kirk knew for years that he could be the "most beloved". <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> When together with music, I can feel the pain I feel when I can not stay with him. Ruth had to be aging for 15 years, even though she was older than her. Which is thinking of me ... MAYBE was one of the teachers at that academy. There was a relationship with a Kirk old woman! <br /> <br /> Reading is reviewing others about the ST: "Probably not older women". If you compare anyone to one day, MY GIRLS CAN NOT CULTIVATE, DO NOT MEET WITH ANY DECISION, DO NOT REMOVE, but what these "people" would be androids and "The Caretaker" for "old" in the previous episode? No matter who, ST appears to be one of the RARE events, unlike just one thought, there is a "superior" race. <br /> <br /> Yeoman Barrows resembles that of Yeoman Rand. Given how much Dr. McCoy's saturated, there is only one more nerve specimen that appears once and then never seen as a potential good character. / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was something missing for the first time several times, and I shouted here, Spokes a smile, and I saw him. This is not always "dipped in water" inside. He said, "Relax, sir." When you approached from the beginning, you just could see that he did not apply to a senior officer, but to a friend. And in the end, when I say unnecessarily "absolutely illogical," I can not help but think of putting forward the reaction. He can not be smiling or laughing, but I think the crew members around him love to see happy.
