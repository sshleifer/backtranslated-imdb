Obsession comes with many flavors and consists of various reasons; In some cases, there is nothing but a compulsive disease, but it can be a means of healing for others. The lack of education can force even the enthusiasm to embrace the enthusiasm that ensures the individual comfort zone, along with the inability to discuss even the simplest needs of everyday life or basic social requirements. And in extreme cases, the purpose of this satisfaction can turn into a personal accusatory speculation until it begins as a means of aggression and, as we have discovered in his "Luzin Defence," Marleen Qorris will not provide a satisfactory solution for a high-level intelligence problem, in fact, the situation can be further deepened. Obsession, apparently, has no prejudice or superiority; <br /> <br /> The winner of the chess tournament in the Italian resort of the 1920s, Alexander Turin, is the world champion. Lucie is the Master of the game, but he has been cautious for a long time so that the chess could get him out of the game; but on the contrary, it is something that he has discovered in a childhood he sees, even though he has never seemed to be his wife, and is able to pay the fine expenses of his close family. Thus, Luzin is a genius with a Axilles pie, perhaps a flaw that only one person knows and understands and understands that this tournament can be exploited for personal gain. <br /> <br /> This man, Lyuisine's former teacher Valentinov (Stuart Wilson), suddenly appeared a few years later and introduced himself to Lujin. Valentinov is not a merger with Luzin, it is a dangerous situation, and once again life is in danger. He will not be facing Turati (Fabio Sartor), a leading opponent of the tournament, who is opposed to his encounter in the previous match fourteen hours later, but he tries to solve a new element in his life - he just feels his feelings for a young woman in the resort , Natalia (Emily Watson). <br /> <br /> Perhaps, even though he is a genius, the dark clouds above are gathered, so he can enlarge Luzin's curse of life as well as the obsession with saving grace. Gary, who describes Lucy's story, uses flashbacks to gradually uncover elements of a fast-moving childhood chess decision. Since the background is set up, the audience provides insights that enable Lucee to figure out who she is and how she has reached that point in her life. For his childhood scenes, Gorris corrects them with a mysterious sense of foreboding, which incorporates and guides a dark atmosphere and victim into a present, more idyllic space. Together with the past, the ducks are beautifully processed, and with the Grires tempo, a well-functioning whistle blows yet undisputed presentation. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Besides, Luzin's tragedy, which reflects the threats of Valentinov's drama, drama attention, and then enhances the overall effect of the movie, is more convincing and the only thing that can keep this movie in mind is John Turturo's influence. Lujin should be completely convincing for the operation of this film; a fake or a feigned moment would have been a catastrophe because the audience immediately pulled out of the story. But that does not happen and the movie works because Luzin Turturro's creativity is a perfectly honest and real life. It captures the horror of Luzi as well as its inadequacies and explicitly explains its character and is very real. This is an equal performance to avoid the depiction of David Helfgott in Geoffrey Rush's Shine. When comparing his work with other symbols, from Sid Lidz to Unstrung Heroes, to Pete, "Where are you Brother?" Created in the form. <br /> <br /> Like Natalia, Emily Watson is also very good, like Natalia, at a good time, she turns into a fairly distinctive performance that develops and delivers a pretty good character. Although it relates to Luzin, Watson performs this in an introspective way. Most importantly, due to the details leading to his performance, he builds a convincing relationship with Lujin and provides the story's overall credibility. Wait to see if Watson's feelings are real in her eyes. Geraldine James (Vera), Christopher Thompson (Stassard), Peter Blythe (Ilya), Orla Brady (Anna), Mark Tandy (Luzinin's father), Kelly Hunter (Luji's mother), Alexander Hunting (Young Lucie Petrucci (Santucci). Well-prepared and delivered "Luzin Defense" is a sensuous film and is presented with limited compassion, which impresses the feeling of sorrow and humanity's intolerance towards humanity. Of course, we do not need a film that is cruel in the world; but we should not forget that when we recall one thing, we are well-served by the cinema environment, because we are able to create a difference in the lives of all around us that can affect the positive change. I appreciate it 9/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
