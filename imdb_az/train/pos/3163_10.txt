It's a regular day at Place Point at Point ... <br /> <br /> Firstly, Red is a lazy father of a Forman family and a WWII veteran, sitting at the kitchen table and reading his newspaper, his beloved wife Kitty serves breakfast. Then their elder son Eric arrives, he sits at the table and begins to scream at his father every day, usually if he has to put his foot behind Ericin (here's the reason). <br /> <br /> So far (painful) ritual once, once, has ended, Eric runs to the basement, all his friends are already dependent. When Erik and her red tomboy boyfriend, the neighbor and childhood friend Donna Pinciotti are the simplest people around. Steven Hyde is a composite theory that hates discotheque and does not care about those around you when it's no fun to watch; Michael Kelso is a kind of person who thinks his life will only grow with his appearance and the trees of trees; Jackie Burkhardt, a boy who is self-critical, like a beautiful girl in the vicinity, and of course a boy; and Fez, a loveless, but oversexed alien who can not keep the mystery of candy. The first is simply to talk and talk with Kelso just to stay, but then they all sit in a circle and start having fun ... before doing something to be regretted. <br /> <br /> She goes to the red red and meets Donna's weird parents with Bob and Midge. He is rude, but they do not cry, as they think of jokes. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Leo, an old hippie. Of course, most "klichel" appear, but the show takes the clich√© to a new level. Now sit in one of the worst storylines that sitcom can offer and enjoy one of the best TV shows. Compared to many sitcoms that have never done the same thing twice and have a "comical lover", they are completely heartfelt. If you scratch, leave this show. Burn on the fork, and again, you can see the human sitcom genre from a new perspective.
