"A Wind Written" is a Douglas Sirkin melodrama. Douglas Circus, "Cahiers du Cinema", Fassbinder and others. Re-created by. His perception of him as a master-maker - his conscious color images and beautiful decorations - suggests that his cinematography is "written on the wind." . But I'm asking myself: Is it enough to carry the movie? In the "Over the Wind" action, weakness changes to justice (except for Robert Stack - it's convincing to the poor and spoiled playboy). Normally, a powerful situation on the screen, Lauren Bacall is wrong in this movie. Dorothy Malone is a charming, faded "femme fatale" complete, but it's a lack of power for the role. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is efficient, but vapid. <br /> <br /> His wife has very interesting ingredients. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < ) <br /> <br /> Lucy (Lauren Bacall) - the principles woman, former secretary and now married to Kyle. Mitch (Rock Hudson), along with Kyle and loved by the patriarch. <br /> <br /> When I read a story summary on the back cover of the DVD, the outer secrets of the door, a triangle of love, frustration, laughter, laughter, and so on. treat. My calendar! Why? I will explain: "The wind is written" takes seriously and tries to explain a dramatic story. As I said before surgery, it is generally not good enough - no intensity. There are very powerful scenes in the story, but the actors are simply doing a good job. I think these scenes would be fully explored with Italian or Spanish actors - they would end up in a laugh or tear gas (for us). <br /> <br /> Douglas's beautiful cinematography is in Circus. That's not enough for me. If you want to get a good melodrama, see "Aventurera".
