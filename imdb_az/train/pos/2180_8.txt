Louise Brooks delivers a beautiful performance in this well-designed French melodrama. Although he is in love with a man called Andre, he plays a typist named Lucienne, stands higher than his position in life. Miss sees an opportunity for a beauty contest in Europe, but when he sees that he is entered, he gets angry and then demands his retirement. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <strong> <br /> This is love, passionate end. Film director Augusto Genina and filmmakers Rudolf Mate and Louis Nee are very energetic. The style of the film is more than modern Hollywood films of the 30s and shows the different styles used by the Europeans. Often there is a great speed and vigorous shooting with great skill and verve. The high energy of the first third of the film is slightly lower in the middle, but is re-collected in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The audience enjoyed very well by all the authors, but Louise Brooks is particularly memorable. Louise looks silently on screen skill, but her silent style is just as stunning as modern, as it feels, makes a good connection to conversations. It was very striking that the early stage in the exhibition, especially Louise, was exploited in a life he wanted to use, with a very expressive eye for growing magic and laughter. <br /> <br /> The film is the best finale, solid, strong and stylish structure. This is really one of the best things in the movie's early days. And the tragic story only highlights the larger tragedy that Louise Brooks plays for her. She looked fantastic on a swimsuit, not just a beautiful beauty, she was the main actor talent she basically threw her all. <br /> <br /> This film is directed by German director G.W. less known. Pabst, but I think it's a better thing. I think that this squad is better than Pabst, and it's easier to watch, though it's deprived of the deep moral complexity of the Prix de Beaute Pabst films, and it's generally a well-developed, focused work piece. <br /> <br /> His wife, including Edis Piaf, can not hurt Louise's readings. <br /> <br /> The down line is a valuable classic Louise Brooks film.
