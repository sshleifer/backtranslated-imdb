I'll keep it a little short. I believe that this is an unusual movie. When I write bad, I see other reviewers who imagine that they are not badly damaged, a terrible noise, and worse, that is not realistic in this life's description. Okay, so it can not be quite convincing for the entire length, but this movie has a message of hope that some have missed. It is not too late to save people from the horrors of many life. Gangland violence is real, right? True, is not it? This film contains an important social message that the kinis did not like but still had to be betrayed. I have to save this movie at least eight times, with the same taste every time and every time I feel the world can be better and better (by the year 2008). For me it's 10 to 9. In my opinion, this is perfect. JMV
