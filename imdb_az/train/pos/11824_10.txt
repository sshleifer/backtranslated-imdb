Dick Tracy is a film based on the best comic book ever made. The film is the same as a comic book, loyal to the color scheme. Batman series, climbed, dropped, re-clashed and dropped again. Dick Tracy is something that both adults and children can use. Good guys are exposed to evil, from bloodshed and from sight. Al Pacino's Big Boy Caprice and Madonna are doing a wonderful job of their own adaptation, making it as memorable as the breath. But the best thing to do is just Warren Beatty who episodes Dick Tracy just like Clyde Barrows. I will not wait until April 2, 2002 on DVD, my poems are slim.
