The big problem is that the movie will start from the point where you need your attention in the next two hours and you will not miss a few minutes to get a coke. Because there is a danger that can not be followed. But there is a good pause key. Bruce Willis must travel to a timemachine in 1996 to find some antivirus for a virus-driven animal-borne world. Thanks to some errors, he first ends in 1990, and then knows how to get involved in World War I and all of this. Terry Gilliam should never be one of the most intelligent texts. This old Monty Phyton man proves to be more like becoming a Schwarzenegger-wanna, as Brad Pitt (his performance in his shelter is memorable) and super Bruce Willis know how the genius should be said as SF-stories and casting his choice can not be better. Once you see that the scenario is very strange and complicated (and you can still pursue it), you can always see what else surprises are all about. One of my great favorites.
