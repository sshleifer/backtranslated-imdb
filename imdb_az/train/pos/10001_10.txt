Lesley is perfectly understood by Ann Warren. The best dramatic hobo I've ever seen, the scenes that are loved in the dressing room are not the second to anyone. The corn in my vine is classic, as well as everything in Blazing Saddles. Lawyers are also outstanding. After accusing him of being a translator, he sells his manager and says, "I am a lawyer," neglecting Pepto Bolt's lawyer. Three comic words. Jeffrey Tambor is also a fantastic acquaintance of Larry Sanders' show and a crazy millionaire who wants to crush Getto here. His character is worse than usual. The scenes of the hospital scene and the desolation of the homeless are the classics of all time. Fight the legs and two big smugglers (one bleeding). It's better to watch this movie (often).
