This anime must be one-of-a-kind for Evangelion fans. Anno Hideaki's previous work, but his lack, dramatic style, is in great demand. Also, those who do not love Evangelion can feel this freedom a bit tasteful. Gunbuster is truly unique for fantastic anime that is based on real science. In fact, a few small "Science Lessons" show on physics behind some of the events in the film. One of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time near the light. It's a great job to come up with a ground-breaking experience on a six-month mission that's moving back to a place where the serial is moving closer to the speed of light and ten years later. The main character stays throughout the series all at the age of 17 or 18, with almost all the other characters. Be aware, this show is sometimes heavier than sap. There are also the fewest reads I've ever seen. The majority of the series is very good but may want to be so far away from the silence-tolerant audience as it's easy to see the exclusive form and boo-hoo scenes. An interesting note, Gainax, as always, was able to earn money in the last few episodes. Nevertheless, they used black and white films and still used sketches to make a good resolution. The latter is a bit of foolishness, but I had a good feeling in my intestines, but I could not help but loved it. Gunbuster, in my opinion, is one of the best parts around.
