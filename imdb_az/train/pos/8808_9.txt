First, I have to give it to people who bring this thing together. 9/11, such a sensitive issue, requires a great deal of controversy to shoot a controversial film about it. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that the film is banned in the US, though it's not shameful. <br /> So, I think the film is superior to a few weak points. The film begins with the Iranian segment, which is reminiscent of Majid Majidi's work (completely beautiful "children of paradise" and "paradise color"). Like these two films, the clip shows what happened to the innocent eyes of a class of Afghan refugees. Absolutely beautiful clip. Sean Penn's clip is the same. But if some of the clips are fortunate, others are completely brutal. Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu sees the Mexican clips and the "Amores Perros" as he sees as brutal as he seizes his intestine. The majority of the clip is a black screen with several voices in the background. These sounds, the second plane, called newspapers and journalists crashed, called their homes from burning towers and left messages to their families, angry ... and combines it with people who leap from the towers. . <br /> <br /> Some clips could be hard to follow Americans so some of the clips might be interpreted as "you are not." <br /> <br /> In some cases, US clips in Egypt and Britain say not only that they are turning their tables but also telling them how much the United States suffers. <br /> <br /> And I also say that the Bosnian- Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (though this may not seem like the last one). <br /> <br /> But all the clips are not good, and a special word on the clip is from Israel, which I think is very weak. (a reporter on the scene of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, but his story may have been due to the events in New York and may be related to many people living in war countries), the clip is just like some entertainment reporter, above all, a person who says he is a witness and hopes he can go on TV and just because "shouting" is a soldier and paramedics <br /> <br /> If you do not catch a drama of such a situation <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see it, then you have to be as conservative as you could betray stay well. But if not, you can find out that most of us outside of the US live in 9/11.
