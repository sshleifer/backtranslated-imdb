In my opinion, this is one of the biggest films in America and deserves every award it has earned and is listed on the AFI Top 100 list (although this is just below the IMDB's # 183 list). If you enjoy the highest level of performance (Voight and Hoffman's perfect match), well-descriptive characterization and ingenuity, editing and cinematography, I love it as much as I do. Schleinger at the end of the 1960s has a lively, reliable picture on New York City's scene, and many victims struggle to overcome personal demons and remain alive amidst the amorality, poverty and despair of New York City's 42nd Street. <br /> <br /> The filmmaking techniques here make the underground New York movie movement (and the city) gentle, and it's not obvious. Many of the other directors have stolen their ideas (including fires, noise spells, drug / road segments, and cartoonist demolitions and incitement to terrorism). <br /> <br /> Relationships between Joe and Ratso are used to be seen as an extraordinarily strong friendship or to have homosexuality. I believe that the director worked so sophisticated to focus on the importance of strong human relationships, not on the censorship of time, but on the contrary, whether sex or not. <br /> <MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave, moving movie that has not lost any effect over the years, so if you have not seen it, you really miss a true American classic. I would recommend this movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 10.
