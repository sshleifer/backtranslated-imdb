It's not fair to say that I'm the "Christopher Reeve Generation" but still the best actor to play Superman, but it does not stop me from enjoying other actors in this role, and George Reeves is a very good one Chris, . It does not bother me enjoying this movie, there's so much to do. All this needs a film, a start, a middle and a final plot, all of which is cleverly written. The film is full of actors, as well as in the story, film, but in the film. The story is both interesting and meaningful - this is a film that is not very promotional. I was amazed at the celebrated Hollywood days during 12 days, when we were not forced to wait 5 years to see the movie's falling into hell ... The film was polished and well-prepared, Lee's Roll'em was directed by Sholem, the best of efficiency. Technology never limits its limitations, in fact, there are a number of creative work created to create a flight effect, including a truck to put a truck on a truck and to see it as a high and fast travel, as well as in the Superman view, and a long glimpse of the animated film Submarine. <br /> <br /> This is now available on DVD as an additional feature of the first season of the George Reeves Television series. <br /> <br /> As a filmmaker, he owns a DVD that is icing over the cake. <br /> <br /> Give God the Law Blood today!
