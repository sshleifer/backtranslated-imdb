My observations: Postwar hilariity. Two years later, Tom Drake and Dad, on behalf of "Getting to Know Me". Donna Reed is charming and cute. Margaret Hamilton is always as good; The smallest part is smaller than the "Oz Wizard". Spring Byington is also beautiful with a small nose, which is not limited by Hamilton. The old guy was finally upset with the door next to the tent scene. <br /> <br /> As a two-year veteran of army tents, I looked pretty young and inexperienced when I looked at her eyes. <br /> <br /> I was working in a store and it was so elegant. Unfortunately, it was disappointing and invisible. <br /> <br /> Therefore, we are aware of these great show windows used to attract shoppers to buy this beautiful store. <br /> <br /> 10/10
