Thanks to the Warner Archive, I can see once again the diversity of this mammoth show that throws everything out of the kitchen. (Button is available only.) This movie gives the screen time to everyone who contracts with Warners at the same time. As it turned out, some of the artists were silent on the silent days, and most of them were faced with the popularity of conversations. There are some really striking artists from the Vaudeville era. You'll be most impressed with Winnie Lightner, which takes place in two pieces. There is also a French star, Irene Bordoni, who croons a love song in a sexual way. Perhaps one of the biggest issues is the two-lane Technicolor "Chinese Fantasy", which was rebuilt for this version. It's really nice and stars of Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is a mass of "Lady Luck" lasting about an hour and a half. This is really epic of the Early Talk era. Any old movie buff will love it.
