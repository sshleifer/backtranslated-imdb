I'm a great admirer of Vonnegut's work, and I love this movie, but I can not say that it's the "Mom Night" movie I've read. When people say that Vonnegut can not remember, two things come to my mind. First, though some of his accusations against him because he chose relatively "easy" targets for his satire, his many subjects are very close to a knife or taboo. This means less than every day away as filmability. The directors are eager to break the taboo today, and I have great expectations for the release of the Bluebeard. If the innocent piece of Vonnegut's "Titan sirens" was probably printed in the '50s, it would be equivalent to R, because of violence, language, and sexual and thematic content. The tragedy that no one has ever faced with a scenario that has not been filmed. In the current economic environment, I also think that a director who looks closely to Jailbird, Galapagos, and Hocus Pocus is looking forward. <br /> <br /> The other thing is its amazing style. mocked with irony but still making hilariously funny. It seems impossible to objectuate itself, and it seems to be the biggest obstacle to making great novels bigger films, because the answer we have to the readers is very little. "Vonnegut is a writer / author who does not lose himself as an author "The Champions Breakfast" (film) tried to keep the comedy, and one piece of sowing was released, and another Slapstick from a Vonnegut novel was made in a more spectacular way. <br /> <br / > However, there is nothing to give us the subjective commentary of Vonnegut's director, and as the "Moment of the Night" looks like, it is a good example of how a good director can add visual poetry to such a source, but it's a great loss of humor, is not really the novel I read. If it were, I would probably liken it to some of the ridiculous ghosts, and for a novelist in Rome, I guess at last giggles. The end of the movie is really striking, and one of the film's successes is that you feel that you are watching the edge of a really good and evil thing, and the jury is still missing. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing yourself and yourself. There are some small, but noticeable mistakes, especially in terms of sustainability, especially in the sustainability of the technician, and often appear to be cheerful and theatrical, but in most cases it is noticeable and sometimes imagined and capable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> It remains in a good condition to come back with Slaughter-5 and it's really there. There was a much better "good" film, Vonnegut, and many of his short stories - "Harrison Bergeron", "Who Am I This Time?" and, of course, some of his other funny, but one-on-one, such as the surprise movie version of the movie "Happy Birthday Wanda." In the 1970s, Vonnegut, "Between Time and Timbuktu," had seen an interesting piece of work that he did not like very much, despite having been involved in his production, because he had misinterpreted him in general. <br /> <br /> HG Wells's tale reminded him of the strange surgical experiments performed at Dr. Moreau Island, but served as a perfect introduction to many people for his work. <br /> <br /> Movies do not want to go to the top source material, do not do their job. <br /> <br /> As the man said, more or less, the big show is your head.
