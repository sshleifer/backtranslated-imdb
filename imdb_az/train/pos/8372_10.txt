What a masterpiece. Take on a cold war and move on to the future. This movie is a high-level satiric. In my humble thought, Dr. It differs from Strangelove. <br /> <br /> Clever nomination of two super powers, such as the Confederation and the Market. Trade and Market, West! outstanding. Gen Joxs's intelligent use was premature. We only see the dangers of our genetic engineering. Robot was raised in 1989. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie can show how a modest person can meet the demands of companionship and government. <br /> <br /> These movies shout, YOU DO NOT EVER DIE. <br /> AWARD 10/10
