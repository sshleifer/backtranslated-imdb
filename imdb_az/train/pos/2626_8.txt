"Lion King 1 1/2" is Disney's most non-theater freedom. After seeing for many years, I saw this movie again. <br /> <br /> Is it better than Simba's dignity? "That's what I remembered for the first time, and I was not surprised by a well-watched and entertaining movie." Simba's dignity is not bad, though. <br /> <br /> Timon and Pumba's personalities again blossom in us as they love us (or me); <br /> <br /> "Simba's pride" was totally uncomfortable, and I did not like the "Timon and Pumbaa" series. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily have been foolish, but fortunately filmmakers were wrong and instead of making this movie extremely enjoyable, there are some jokes that adults can use by themselves, and the score is very good. There are two new songs unfortunate from Uncle Max's mother, Timon's mother (well-known by Marge Simpsons' Julie Kavner). The friendship between Timon and Pumbaa is described as touching. Emotional scenes were well-integrated with comic stories and did not feel the place where they could easily (especially in comedies) realize. <br /> <br /> But is there anything that can be avoided by getting this picture out of 10? sounds from me? Yes I have. Despite the happiness, I will note: 1. Many scenes from the first film are used in this way. Personally, it was strange to see old scenes that were integrated with the new ones. <br /> <br /> 2. Some jokes in the attention are bare. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lifestyle is a story of Timo, and although filmmakers try to combine her tale with Simba, the scenarios feel a bit fled. <br /> But hey, this information does not affect this fun movie. It's just a really acceptable Disney continuation to be in every movie collection.
