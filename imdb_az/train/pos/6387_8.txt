I thought this movie was a very good place. The voice-overs were also great. I loved how they overcome their conflicts and reached their goals. I'd recommend this movie to anyone. It took time and money to watch it. There are some funny scenes that make me laugh at Atlantis. Other scenes saddened me. Others made me happy. A movie that can use at any age. Until Milo bare "profesor" or crew for a fantastic trip under the sea. After watching the movie, I read a book. It was good, but the movie puts better pictures in your mind. It's like this book. But go ahead and watch this movie!
