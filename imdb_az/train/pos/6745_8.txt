In a film in New York City in the '50s Noon is a Turkish bath series, a sign of something! What is famous is that no one in the previous comments, but I think that I need the concept of this movie <br /> <br /> Turkish baths are massaged at night back street, sleazy sauna and a balcony on Skalise, a balcony. Steve, a masseur young rough boxer (Beefcake!) And another boy, a knight? decorate. Dixon instantly hates what he's seeing and gets rid of it immediately. We know that the suspects have a reputational reputation. Good cop but easy to get out of control. Why so much hate? <br /> <br /> Can he hate himself? Was this part inherited from his father? Will the darkness go on the eighth eighth place? Was this dark side hidden in the "cover"? Remember: when Dixon Scalise (3 times) faces a man lying in a bed and only men around him (the wall of the "Girls" plaque near the iron bed!). /> <br /> Scalise is funny motion: Impressive behavior, her neck arrogant, tolerant, involves her inhaler (poppers) into her nose every time she talks with her Dixon. Dixon tries to shut down Scalise, who does not understand with a revenge: "I have never seen a man like you, and I can only tell you the way you came after me." It was as if someone was special! Why? <br /> <br /> The waterfall is really a special person: he is the direct heir of Dixon's father: "Your father loved me", "Your father put you on me." Dixon knows very well: "Who killed him (Paine) ? Are you or your friend of the game? "Retirees pay attention to what they are facing every time, Dixon holds Scalise in his hand: he pulls his book out of his pocket, smashes his face and punches him. Saliz:" I warn you not to touch me! Dixson's homophobia is clear or distinct: his brutal homosexuality.Dikhan's son Dixon is the son of a thief, and decided to be a policeman by reacting, but there is a good thing He is a dark copper, a killer, a liar. does not marry, the place of familiar cooking is now and then anywhere, but nothing else. The waitress says that she does not know how to love a woman; Dixon is deeply guilty and hates herself. Blood is a savior, like a hood and an old man. Finally, Dixon decides to offer himself a sacrifice: if he has been scalified for his death, he will release himself from guilt and release his daughter and father. <br /> <br /> The end of the film brings us to the opening sequence: Scalise pushes the tale, and Dixon gives the right to go to the sidewalk and earns the love of the breed. <br /> <br /> For a person who wants to live in a woman's love (Jean Douchet) to cover his tension, she has a very good attitude.
