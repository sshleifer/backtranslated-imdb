It was the first regular Columbo film episode but was released for the second time after Steven Spilberger's film, Columbo: Murder by the Book. <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kowalski was a great creative director! Later, he wanted to focus on three more Columbo films. The film has genuine creative and innovative shooting sequences, and the film as a whole is also prepared with detailed styles, passion and eye. Each shooting is combined and this is an average looking looking for a better and better television movie. <br /> <br /> For a number of reasons, this is better focused on the Columbo movie. Murder was much more or less crushing and a turning point. So the killer has no time to plan ahead of his "perfect crime" and to cleanse his scars and not split his body. In this film, the killer is not just a person who committed a crime, but rather a person who helped the Lieutenant Colonel, who had more criminal training. This character makes it even more interesting and worthwhile and helps Columbo to deal with all the killings, as it seems more interesting. Of course, Columbo begins to doubt it too early and, as always, appears to be sensitive to himself and, of course, more strange than the truth and winning the confidence of the killer. This is not a clear spoiler because every Columbo movie is a way of making it. I like the story of the movie and how it develops. <br /> <br /> It also helps the movie to have such a beautiful game. During this film, Peter Falk really made the character of Columbo, and the similar character has been fully developed. Robert Culp is really great as a short tempered Brimmer. One miracle, then in the three different Columbo films and one "Ms. Columbo" episode, will only play completely different roles. He even played a killer in several films. Incidentally, this is not the only actor who does this in other Columbo films. And Ray Ray Milland gives a look in this movie, as the victim's husband. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, the real early Columbo movie and the ones that are far better than long-running movies 9/10
