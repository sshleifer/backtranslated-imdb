I'm standing in front of TV watching Casomai now. It is a variable, id developer or better ... devolve. It starts with a courius wedding with two heroes where their love story is. After that, everything changes, a child is born, and all the others are in several places. This is not a special movie because it speaks of a normal couple and normality is the center of this film. It does not want to show us anything special, there is nothing new, a regular story of love, a story of a couple, and normal is different from those. It is also a soundtrack, everything is short, every scene is a few seconds. This information is given, and many things are known because friends and parents are talking about it and their thoughts are centered, ideas create a story and destroy it. As I said, a couple is a simple story, but it's not boring, just to show a pair, everything must be known, but I am sure that each of you wants to know what's going on, so do not forget to watch the end!
