To see Hal Hartley, I'm one of those who want to slip through a broken glass. It's nothing more than the TRUST and IRIS HENRY FOOL and Hartley's likes, Hal's unique brands are a taste. It seems to be a forte to commit mystery / spy on equal parts with intelligent comedy. The comedy is not always on your face, and it works on the whole scene before it often occurs. Fey Grim, Fri Grim, Henry Fool and Parker Posey stars, Henry's only son Ned, who left her mother. Fay, one day, lives a calm life until he gets home to find a CIA agent. His name is Fulbright (MANELEMENT MANIE Jeff Goldblum) and Henry's notebooks. There are many Henry Fool notebooks, and all of them thought it was nothing else. There is more to them than it seems. Secrets of weapons research or terrorist paths? Who knows, Henry. Agent Fulbright tells Fay that his wife is dead, but is often used (and works but thinking) to extract Fey from his home and search for Henry. <br /> <br /> Fay fights with many spy shots to collect Henry's laptops and look for it. He also signed a CIA deal with his brother Simon (James Urbaniak) to escape from prison (Henry would help his original Henry Fool film flee to the country). Many overlapping events occur fast in sequence: <br /> <br /> Dear Mr. Henry, when discovering that a jihadist was held in "safety", Fay released his brother, but without knowingly threatening his son's life and causing the CIA to endanger the danger earnings. <br /> <br /> Hal Hartley really likes to play with Themes. And that is so extreme. Even the character names (Grim, Fool, Fulbright, Fogg) have very meaningful meanings. <br /> <br /> <br /> Now that I praise this creativity, Parker Posey Fay Grim's extreme description of the film is the best I will tell you that part. Take into account how much time you spend on this movie. I knew this was Mr. Hartley's wish: a woman without extreme hand gestures in Italy. <br /> <br /> Even these fans will eat Fay Grim and beg the more. Although this is not my favorite Hal Hartley movie, I know I'm ready.
