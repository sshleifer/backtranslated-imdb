Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams star, this action, written and directed by Wes Craven in this movement / tension maker. The entire film is starting with a problem in the Lux Atlantic, a hotel in Miami. The problem is settled by the hotel manager Lisa Reisert. Then he goes to the airport and where all the difficulties begin. He talks to Jack Ripper, Jack, who does not want to be called Jack, if you know him and want to say. Then they got on the plane and were crazy enough, Rippner and Reisert sat beside each other. For the next half an hour Lisa is scared by terrorism, suffering, and Rippner. I will not give you anything. Then we went to the place where we were in Lisa airport. Then, going to Lisa's house, Rippner is already there to see if his father is good. The whole scene has about twelve minutes of violence and intense intensity. A total of 25 minutes of intense activity ends. <br /> <br /> The film was just dense, but it had a large area. As I said, I will not give anything, because it is very shocking and exciting and somewhat worrying. And in the film, all those moving from each character, even those with no lines, were perfectly matched. That was incredible. Everything was awesome in this movie! Acting, music, effects, makeup, leadership, editing, writing, everything was beautiful! Wes Craven is definitely the Suspense Master. The Red Eye is definitely worth seeing and definitely worth your money. <br /> <br /> We can watch this movie again and again and never want to dump it. <br /> <br /> With red eyes, I can say that 10 out of 10 stars is better. Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Violence and some strong segments of language <br /> <br /> My MPAA rating: PG-13: Some very intensive violence and language <br /> < br /> Canada rating: 14A: Violence, scary scenes, disturbing content
