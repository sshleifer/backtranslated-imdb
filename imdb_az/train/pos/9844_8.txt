There are so few movies that are so funny. I'm lucky to watch this movie in a "protected" theater for movies like me, because my bone was completely painful and my shirt sleeves laugh after dropping my eyes. Sometimes the story was a little "slow", but it's probably the best - a little rest between the landscapes (I nearly fell asleep ...) was the most welcome.
