<br /> <br /> This movie shot 30+ years ago, but I recently found it on DVD - it was not cheap, or it's a specialized catalog of war movies. We watched last night for the first time. The sound was good, but it was drilled and was a trailer between the rollers. Nevertheless, it was better than I remembered. <br /> <br /> The catalog is somewhere close here. If you are sincere in doing so, give me a fire hazard and I see that I can get the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
