I love Ashley Judd and think that all his films are great. Ruby is the best in heaven. This is a very simple movie that really needs to be approached to appreciate it. A woman who wants to give her a fit to make her life a story that wants to do so. Movies like Kiss and Girls and Kill would be good for silver and video rentals. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong>
