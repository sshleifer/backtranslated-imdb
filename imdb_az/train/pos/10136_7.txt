I think Mick Garris is a problem with women, MOH is one of the best episodes of the second season ... He's killing them all, often they are victims (Vida Solution, Pro-Life, Valerie, Argentine's episode in the first season, and s, of course, Imprint). I think women have burned, tortured, injured, and I do not know. At least "the right to die" is one of the best, with the best of the best queue and graphic scenes and inactivity (in particular, mobile scene pictures, beautiful). The player is like the whole series, I can be as bad as "Pro-Life" or "Crying for ice cream" on a regular basis. And I think this movie can be prepared for a movie, not for an episode. The ideology of the series is terrible, it kills and kills women and destroys the animals ... the first season is "Cigarrette Burns", "Homecoming" is the most funny), "Imprint" (really shocking).
