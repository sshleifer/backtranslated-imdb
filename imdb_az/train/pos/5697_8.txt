May 2004, Wonderland is quite new to the UK. The brilliant film of the painful story. If you know LA since the 80's, you will appreciate how you miss it. The use of elements that make up a strange cinematic style is original, enhances experience and brings the audience to reality. The use of the 'Pulp Fiction' style sheet lets you investigate the uncertainty about what really happened; I'm sure for an Oscar if I give it to them.
