Guys and Dolls are a unique game based on characters. Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) is a high-class gambler who wager with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) for a thousand dollars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Brother Brown (Jean Simmons), who was in charge of any girl's missionary, was not.

Marlon <br /> <br /> Brando has no sound, and they may have named it, but it was not really important. He played a wonderful player (obviously as Brando) and played his character very well. I have seen several films with Jan Simmons, and I thought this movie was the weakest, and she could not do it. However, reading is made by Frank Sinatra, Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye. Vivien Blaine and Stubby Kaye were also original Broadway production Guys and Dolls. Vivien Blaine had a great sound and was perfectly Adelaide. If you like music or even not, I advise you to watch it.
