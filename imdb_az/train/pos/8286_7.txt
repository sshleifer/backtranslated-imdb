Larry Fessenden was beaten by most of the comments on this forum. Yes, the worst mistake is, of course, the marketing of the movie and the targeting of the DVD. No doubt, this is not a real fears movie, at least, people will not expect something cowardly and instantly agreeable. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is actually a young film from the mind of young Milan. Things that can not be understood by children tend to remain in their young minds, and ultimately dominate their fears and uncertainty. It seems that her mother is a psychologist, but she does not know what's happening in her son's mind. This is a story of alienation. According to the father, George is a distant figure, perhaps a worker who seems to live in another world. <br /> <br /> Milesin's fears come to an end in the country over the weekend. The winter landscape of the New York state provokes the imagination of the little boy with nutrition trees. It does not help the city to meet a strange figure, but it creates more doubts in the young mind. Miles's world becomes ineffective for him, and he can not do anything, even evacuating the spirit of Wendigo. <br /> <br /> The film is well-paced and moving. Patricia Clarkson is perfect, regardless of where it is. Jake Weber is ideal as a remote father, who has the ability to approach a boy he does not understand. Eric Per Sullivan, like Miles, delivers inward confusion. I thought the whole film was very effective because Miles took the events around him. Finally, John Spredakos is perfect as Otis, who has turned his back on the world for opposing the world. <br /> <br /> Instead of putting this movie down, future viewers should be open-minded.
