This movie was completely BRILLIANT! Every performance in this movie is perfect, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It seems that Mr. Gyllenhaal will have a great movie career, and that's something to go on. I thought Joe Johnston was a strange choice as a director, because he usually associates with the big budget blockbuster (Jumanji, I'm pushing my kids out). Each stage draws a transparent class. My favorite scene is going down Homer mineshaft and looking at the sky, it was all dreams, it was wonderful. Joe Johnston should also direct these greatly-acting movies, as well as the big budget blockbuster. KUDOS !! to all those involved in this work!
