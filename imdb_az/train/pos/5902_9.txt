As a Westerner watching the appearance of some cultures and the tradition of marriages, it is a wonderful and pleasing thing to marry me. The idea of ​​getting a strange marriage through parenting is especially challenging in this modern era. But this is the case with the Indian film. We talked about humor and a new perspective, and we learn Abhay and Ritika, who are only familiar with the traditional five-day honeymoon. Naturally, it is difficult to believe that a cell phone is rich in age, as an archaic situation, such as organized marriage, is still going on. We do not see how these young couples feel the way they came together on the first night and did not recognize each other, but how they tried to build a bond. We see the different views of the marriage and commitment offered by the other couples, and are still uncertain about not giving marriage commitment to others for several decades. There is a song, intelligent dialogue, surprise moments, confusion and comparison of the new way and tradition. By watching the movie with subtitles, it definitely loses some of the story's realities, but it's still a pleasure to watch. Some trickery is a bit strange and the bus event is a little drawn and shot down; but it was necessary to watch the general film.
