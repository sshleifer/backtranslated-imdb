Ghost Story (TV movie - 1972) was a pilot for the NBC series. The film was well-written and well-behaved, and after the start of the 1972-73 season, the NBC has a winner if the television series is half as good as the movie. (I wish this movie to be on the video!) The series was a big disappointment - even with William Castle as an excel. producer. However, if you have a chance to see the original TV movie, Ghost Story, check it out. You will not be disappointed.
