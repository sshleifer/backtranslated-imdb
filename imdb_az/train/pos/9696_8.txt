I'm not a fan of new films, but it's great to watch. Adults and children can watch it together - how unusual! Aunt also liked me. There was laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors and talking parrot. It reminded me of the lovely, The Wizard of Oz. Hero, Paulie, a clever parrot, separates from your home and your family, and goes through many adventures, attraction, and disappointment, always takes the friend's decision to find Marie. Be advised.
