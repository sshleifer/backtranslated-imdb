The original DeMille movie was made by Frederic March in 1938. A very good movie. Hollywood's remakes love brings us to a very interesting film by Yul Brynner. He was, of course, always as bright as his films. Charlton Heston, like Andrew Jackson, was a genius. However, the film tended to be a little longer in the places. The 1938 version does not move fast. It is still a fun movie to be seen at least once.
