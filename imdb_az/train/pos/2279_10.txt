Before that, the defective "Mezbahali Five" was the best. However, this screen adaptation of the "Mother's Night" depends heavily on the book and retains the intention of comedy, mystery and tragedy. Fortunately, this was not Hollywood or the nickname "Champions Breakfast". One of the better things about this movie is that you do not have to get to know your book (I think it's Mezbahali Fifth). Undoubtedly, the Champions Breakfast also applies, but they did such a bad thing that you are better than just reading and watching the movie! Nick Nolte did an excellent job in this film.
