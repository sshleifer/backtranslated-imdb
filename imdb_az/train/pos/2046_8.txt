While the soundtrack is a bit dated, this story is no longer the case in the US ever more important. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss, a steelworker who has been working for 35 years, is not just blue work, but everyone's work is transferred by US companies. Emily is best described by her husband, Pamela Reed, trying to support her family with two children when her job was lost. The supply was closed under the pretext of poor management, but there is also a salary and a cheap salary for one month, outsourcing, for which Strauss / Emory is forced to pay. <br /> <br /> These individuals are all good loyalists who have the values ​​and choose the best for their family. <br /> <br /> John Gudman, Gary Cole (like Strauss's brother) and a few other workers are also affected. It is very uncomfortable and realistic. Some scenes move between Emory and his father. <br /> <br /> Emory's brother, Lee, still writes on the wall. Emory hopes the local community may reopen the mills. There is nothing left on the pavement (Ohio) and they must move. But where can the US move? <br /> <br /> Emory and his crew have a winning place where they load the loading dock with steel products. <br /> <br /> The fear allows them to do this as a lasting gesture. <br /> <br /> In general, a good message about the difficult days in America. Something that is less careful to care for personally. 8/10.
