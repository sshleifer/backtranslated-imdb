If you did not experience drama in your life, or if you or your loved ones walk through the pain stages of this family (but I think easily could be a human being), it is very real. This is a movie that you will not be able to cope with without knowing what to do to help you avoid it. No doubt, it is also a movie about what you did not know how to help your loved ones suffer. This is a film that understands everyone's suffering. Someone can push someone on the edge ... a difficult movie as a recommendation. It's a movie that someone can see, especially someone, but for me it's a perspective that's a real pain, and so it's important to be alive. You know, hey, if you live with the pain of a family you or your family, hey, you have nothing to worry about now.
