A meteorite falls into the country of a small city, bringing a gel leaf. An old farmer is attacked by a stranger in his hands, and young people are taking Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor carefully attaches to the blister and wanted to explore the place where Steve found the old man. When Steve returns, he sees the physician killing the doctor. Steve and Jane are trying to warn the police and the residents, but no one believes them, and most of the block is bigger and bigger. <br /> <br /> Blob is a cult and a classic science. Most actors and actresses (with the exception of Steve McQueen) have a terrific effect, but also a very enjoyable and very funny, low-budget movie. I've seen this classic first (I saw remake with Kevin Dillon in 1988) and I really recommend it to the fans of Steve McQueen and the 50's of fantastic B films. The number of my reviews could not have been better with 1400 movie themes. <br /> <br /> Brazil: Bolha (The Blob)
