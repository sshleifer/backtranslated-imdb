I recently bought this movie and, therefore, it is no regrettable, in fact I would like to add this movie to our collection. Filmmakers Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay have spent less than a month filming and spent about 1m euros to produce this great movie. <br /> <br /> This shows that large-scale production does not create great movies. <br /> <br /> The name of this movie is perfectly compatible. Software bug in computer language is a bug in computer function. Our reactions can cause these adverse side effects as well as beautiful moments. The events that occur in this movie begin with a death of a BUG. A man witnesses a "crime" on the other side of the road ... Everything gets complicated ... <br /> I'm John Carrol Lynch (Fargo), Wallece, a man who does not do anything.
