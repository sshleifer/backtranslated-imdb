The UFO puts aside the "thing". This was the best document I ever saw. The actual report by Neil and Buzz ... needs to see one. The majority of interviews and reports are anonymized because they were sealed in 1969 and were sealed only in 2006. For a short 47 minutes, no documentary has so far been detailed or accurate ... FACTS will keep you away and will be separated from the fear of the dangers first taken in the moon ... Neil and Buzz, perhaps, are the greatest hero of our time. Do not you see anyone other than his own life? Do not bet. Neil just lifts his life away from his death. Amazing to watch. A travesty of all the details related to the month of the month and men's courage when they face a certain death, a failed computer ... 10 stars!
