This movie is one of Tom Cruise's best films. He captures the views of the audience with the role of David Aames. His character applies to us in any way. The story line is very clever and keeps viewers away from the whole movie. I really watched the movies of the crusade, but after seeing it, she showed me her real talent. My favorite part in the film is the sound that has come to a great conclusion and the truth. If you have not seen this, you have to give it a try. One of these movies will continue to think or think about it until you've started watching it, and you'll regret it. In my opinion, it should not just buy it and throw a risk on everything I do and become one of the most favorite films of all time. A 10/10 I promise to follow him, he will stay with you and you will love forever.
