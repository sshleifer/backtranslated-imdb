I'm lucky enough to see Zero Day yesterday. A beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> In short, Zero Day can be compared with The Blair Witch Project. This is complete with handheld cameras. This is about 2 children. Only middle children. Andre and Calvin. They launched a campaign against the "Army 2" High School. <br /> <br /> The whole story is given in Video Agenda, from 2 children. There is a relationship between the parents there and other people, which shows that we have normal children, like people we know or go in. We know that the last 2 missions of the army are on Zero Day. <br /> <br /> <strong> They strongly emphasize that the media does not affect them, and there is no reason to do so there is no. As I said, all of them are given in the form of Video Logs and then stored in a cash box that can be seen after Zero Day. <br /> <br /> The actual shooting is shown at school by Survillens cameras. I'm really cold. The film is very cold. You just have to see what some say, how they plan. I remember that Calvin was only for a while. According to him, "Andre thought he would do it to many schools in the country with a few runs, but I'm in a single black plastic bag I'm leaving school." I did not give you the right idea of ​​this movie. You really need to see yourself. <br /> <br /> A +.
