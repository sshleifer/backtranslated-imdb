The problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones has been very closely modeled as Alan Quartermain (or at least Alan Quartermain's TYPE character), the director of the '85 made a mistake to plunder IJ movies for many lessons for dialogue and story. What you get as a finished product, Alan Quartermain, was an inexpensive hodge podge, a cheaply imitated IJ saga (with a touch of Austin Powers-esquire cheese here and there). <br /> <br /> It was labeled "great parody" or "unusual comedy" by many critics. Of course it is the word. This film never meant to be joking; smart, yes, but not humorous. <br /> <br /> With this new M4TV mini-series, more stories, characteristic development of the device, strong portraits and a nice, even funny mess. This story is a little too long; Longer than their predecessors, but this version is a real story, not just Action and Eye Shakes. While working on both the action and the Eye Shape, he made mistakes in 1985, forgetting about the IJ and returning to the welding materials for the AQ, a beautiful, well-thought-out area and some nice complementary subfields. <br /> <br /> Now this attempt from Indiana Jones is not all-will-extravaganza. This is a bad attempt. This is a beautiful scene of the vehicle area and character management and AQ / KSM epic. <br /> <br /> Audience viewers in South Africa offer amazing performances (SAA), SA aboriginal cultures and some beautiful live footage. <br /> <br /> Steve Boyum surprised me With her, I have never joined her vision. In fact, I did not like most of my leadership as director. I hope this is a new talent and looks less puffy. <br /> <br /> This version is at the level of 9.8 / 10 on the TV scale. <br /> <br /> Open:.
