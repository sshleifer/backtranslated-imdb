I think it's still the best routine. Others like "Pain" Rock, and Allen's "Men's Pigs", cheerful; At Damon Waynes's last stand, it's funny to laugh - but there's nothing wrong with this diary. All jokes are funny and 70 minutes are limited. Long enough to last for 20 years. I love watching the audience and allowing them to limit themselves. I'm an admirer of classics and Jim Carrey, watching more back-to-back comedy, is cool enough for a guy watching a lot. Do not put a category with Ellen and Newhart, but you can watch something if you're inflated. Thanks Eddie, God bless.
