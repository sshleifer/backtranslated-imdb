The superstar quality of Gerard Philip, a very young wife, is similar to the sword fencing and antiquity in this sad, funny, complicated swashbuckling comedy. In an attractive way, it's impossible to resist 'writing his story. Sweet romantic comedy with very young Gina Lollobrigida as love interest. A movie will remember with joy.
