This show has come so far. First of all, everyone from Eric to Fez was new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and looked at what they did. They stuck with the show and succeeded. One of the best demonstrations and the most entertaining sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad because it ends, but when this show ends, serial philosophy comes out with one of the biggest bombs every season finishes. It's bothering me that they have all the fuel for the last part of the season. Lower your conversation, hit the final blow. The show is worthy of it, fans deserve it, and if it goes, let everyone know that they will end up as Friends, and that's great at the finals. I told Donna and Erik to marry, I'm fighting Hyde and Kelso, and again I'm going to be a friend, I say Fez and Jackie have an interesting event because Fez has worked for too long, but of course he will not work for him. <br /> <br /> The 70th Show will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, if I were your friend as your children. <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
