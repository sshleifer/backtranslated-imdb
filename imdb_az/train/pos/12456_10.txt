This movie, of course, is one of my favorite films. Interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is to unite the code of affection and charity between thieves and police. Some movies, such as duties, guilt, words, manipulation, and trust, are unsettling, and unfortunately, since the death of the "police" in the 70's, there is nothing I can remember. Sequence-based, nothing is happening and directs viewers to a superior field and misleading viewers without the need for spectators and spectacular scenes that are not needed in little samples of the genre to keep awake. There is no scene or need. The evidence is honest to the audience; Significant presence of a genre often encountered by the audience's deception. No, this Marmara is not missed ... Not a note of congratulations for music, not just to watch, watch every minute and a sincere movie.
