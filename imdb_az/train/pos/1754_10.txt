This film begins with a joyful talk about 15 seconds and continues throughout the film. I can not remember a scene that has not turned its back on those who are not laughing with me. <br /> <br /> This comedy was bigger than seeing large or non-popular actors. People like this movie are now rated at 7.9 degrees on the IMDb. I should be in 250. I do not think that this film is funny after the American cake or the original vacation. See if you want a laugh. I will give this movie the highest fingers I have ever given since I learned from IMDb, the great movie site.
