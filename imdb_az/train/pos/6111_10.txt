When I surfed the TV once or two years, I accidentally came across a 'friend of mine'. Before, I had not watched any Korean movie in my life, so MTF was the first Korean movie I've ever seen. And what a pleasant surprise! I was thoroughly enjoying it from beginning to end and for a while laughing. His comic style is distinguished by pure air breathing into Hong Kong funny movies (I was used to all life and, consequently, also tired of my humdrum film viewing experience). <br /> <br /> Just a few days ago, I watched the MTF for the second time, and watched it once, and the MTF has many scenes and tricks that are pretty fun, smart and original. was surprised / funny for me. However, my idea is not negative. Instead, something else came out of nowhere - I was taken away - two young men threw in their "enemies" with a totally inappropriate appearance and gradually deciphered their differences and began to care for each other without feeling their feelings. They remind themselves of longevity high school days. For me, Su Wan and Ji Hoon really fit because both of them have a pure and original thing, separating them from what people say is Ji Ho's cheeky girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Split into two parts - the first part deals with "war" between Su Wan and Ji Hoon and is swiftly fierce and fast. Ji Hoon takes a final test and begins to change after Su Wan (in Ji Hoon's opinion) dance a provocative dance. The speed slows down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly takes care of more than you can imagine for Water Wan. Thus, Section 2 deals with the development of their mutual feelings, of course, with the head of the network reaching a happy end accompanied by the final show. <br /> <br /> Just a recent comment. I think it's a bit unbelievable. The 21-year-old self-proclaimed "bad boy" is ashamed of being almost naked in front of the girl who accused her of losing her "cool". was alone. Ji Hyun shows that he is a pure boy in his heart and that his appearance is not really visible. Btw, Kwong San Woo (Ji Hoon) is a sexy body and a perfect figure! ;-) <br /> MTF is definitely in my list of the top 10 movies of all time.
