Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and beautiful drifter coming to a bar. He meets with the young, beautiful and unpleasant spouse Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her older and older brother, Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa). She sells her mechanical skills with some dining and lodging and has a relationship with Giovanna. They both beat an accident and decided to kill Giuseppe. Their relationship is affected by guilt and police investigation. This work ends tragically. Luchino Visconti's Noir and Neo-Realist film is outstanding. This is the first time I've watched this version of The Postman Always Rings Twice. I liked the 1946 version with Lana Turner, and the 1981 version of Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange, one of the hottest sex scenes in film history, but this is of course the best. My voice is ten.
