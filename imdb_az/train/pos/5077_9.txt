The Indian cinema points to two broad categories of police: they are honest or bad guys. <br /> <br /> This film breaks these simple formulas and gives them a refreshing look. police and their lives. The movement looks at the life of a young, ambitious police. This music is of interest and editing is a pitch for the progress of Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The film is sometimes slow and when it comes to Maya, the dilemma facing Anbu is sometimes extreme. However, as I still have a lot of credits, I'll give it to 9/10.
