Why is such a compact, entertaining mystery impossible in the new century? It guess the viewer and guess all the ways. Casting is a great ensemble. William Powell demonstrates the true star quality. Who knows - perhaps Nick Charles was training for the future. She is happy to watch. We can see why Eugene Pallette can see more than 200 films. She is entertaining to watch with the great supporting actor and her excellent chemistry, Powell. Mary Astor plays a very fleshy role over average work. All other hands, the chip to make this a pleasant way to spend 73 minutes. I doubt that there is a ball in the management of Michael Curtis. Bravo!
