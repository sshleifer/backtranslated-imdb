Hidden Frontier has talked and informed several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and the example of Gene Roddenberry's mission. Homosexuality, depression, war, and the adoption of different races give their attention to the other Trek series and films. The production cost was small and small, but improved in 7 seasons of production, stories are more complicated, and visual graphics are smoother and more effective. In Chapter 6 of the season, there are one of the biggest gaps in the Battle events, Trek history. Ships are well developed and effective in cosmic battles. Realistic shooting on the frontier is not ships and backgrounds, but the interaction and development of people and their heroes. There are also other places that we know and symbols of the other Trek series and films. I recommend you to take action against any Trek fan and you'll be hooked!
