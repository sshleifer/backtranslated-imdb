Imagine that a bureaucracy spent eight years in a man's life and that he had a mental disorder that actually tried to solve the mass murder case! Criminal technique is clear, but let's destroy the lives of a monster with a government that does not want to accept the truth. When I think that my job is stressful, I just remember the real story behind this wonderful nudity. Loyalty to the main character is skillfully described by Rea. The comic (and sometimes activist) relationship between Rea and Sutherland has become one of my favorite films in the last 5 years. The arrest of one of the worst mass killers in history was at the edge of my seat. Approximately, it was scattered even though it was advertised as "Lamb's silence". Buy this movie today or buy it!
