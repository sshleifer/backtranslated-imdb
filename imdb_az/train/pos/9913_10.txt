In addition to being a very entertaining movie, I can add that the suits and decor are beautiful. This kind of fun loving woman had earned a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two daughters who were worried about getting their hands out of their hands. This woman was alone since her husband's death. He offered him a theater to be demolished. He bought it to avoid it. They were afraid of throwing their "own" money and decided to move. The character actors of this film were a great plus. I would almost give everything to get a copy of this movie in my video library, but it has never been released yet. Sad.
