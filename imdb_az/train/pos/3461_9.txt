This Columbo episode is likely to be one of the earliest films for director Steven Spielberg. He should consider the role of Jack Cassidi as a killer who killed his writer to save his life. Jack Cassidy appears later in Columbus. For all of this, Columbo meets Jack Cassidy's character. It is a mystery to strive for the perfect murder. After the first murder, his next victim is a fierce general store that blackmails him for money. Instead of losing more money, it kills her. As always, watching Cassidy and Falk is great fun. Falk's acquaintance with Columbo can be watched and watched for many years over this episode. Television today forgets the success of the years that people will want to watch again if they like the characters. This is not about getting acquainted with the likability of who, how and why, with Columbo and his audience like me, which is very high.
