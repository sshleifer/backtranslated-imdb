He describes the difficulties of a woman before the Kaabee and during the Second World War, and raised her only child after her husband was arrested for "thought crime." This movie was directed by Yamada Youji and the atmosphere of this film is really good as expected. <br /> <br /> The history of some scenes, especially the beach scene, is undoubtedly. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely incredible to act in this movie. I was amazed at how the 2008 movie could capture this star movie. Yoshinaga Sayuri, the most admired actress in Japan, will surely win individual prizes for his performance in this film. The supporting role of Shoufukutei Tsurube was also really nice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> delivered the impressive performance, said it was in a state of tough character praising its perfect appearance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, there was no left-wing nonsense as Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni, and investigated the controversial and sensitive issues of the government's persecution and brainwashing in Japan. The excellent film is highly recommended for all viewers.
