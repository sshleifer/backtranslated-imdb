I'm in the movie, but in fact I do not know if they actually put this scene. When we set off from a school (2005) when we were in the same movie at a service station, and we wanted to escape and shout at us (all of us)! Free bird! We were 10 years old, can anyone seeing the movie say that the film is really stored or not? I remember that the film never came out because it was 2 years and a half years before it was released. All your comments are good, so I think it's a very successful movie, I can buy it, but I'd like to know if it's me first! : Thank you D
