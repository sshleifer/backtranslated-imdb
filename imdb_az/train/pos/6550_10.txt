Look, I'm interested in Nancy Drew's book, what I'm going to do is buy a book and read it. I do not. I remember reading the people who did not read books because they were not like books. We're sorry - we can not watch movies in flip books at digital age, but I'm sure you can still find a few short silent films in the form of books. When the Lord of the Rings came out, people complained. When he won a third Oscar - "The Book Was Better". When Kill looked to kill a Mockingbird, "The book was better." Nancy Drew is not like a book because now a bunch of people are concerned. I do not say that Nancy Drew can not win any Oscars - if this happens to be one of the Nickelodeon Blimps or Kids Choice Awards. I'm telling a movie break. Not a film, not a paper. As a movie, I enjoyed Nancy Drew very much - from Bruce Willis and Adam Goldberg (The Hebrew Hammer) and Tate Donovan (Jimmy Cooper in O.C.) and Rachel Leigh Cook (O All That). For the first time I've ever seen Emma Roberts in a movie, and frankly, I'm delighted to have Julia and Eric work the most; his character remains consistent throughout the film and reacts well with the conflict. <br /> <br /> In the spirit of Mr. Harriet Spy, a sophisticated film is now beautiful again. <br /> <br /> I am giving you ten stars because I enjoyed the movie, I would like to see it again, and maybe let it DVD.
