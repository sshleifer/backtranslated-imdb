I just saw "My Sweetheart" and it was the best movie I've ever seen. Unlike the subsequent tendency of the 90th horror, this film is worrying more than being moody. For those who love "Scream," this movie does not refer to the "fearsome rules" (although the old slasher film rules apply here). <br /> <br /> This is a perfect blend of the horrors of the 80s and 90s. You get the 90s film style, cinematography and 90s of the movies and the crazy of pushing the 80s. Finally, in 2001, I think fans of fear will give them the kind of movies they want. This is definitely a move in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Denise Richards is an entertaining character here. You can say that you love his role and it distinguishes it. I loved her in this movie.
