The film has the humorous / lyrical point of view for its limitless immorality (any horrible and rude) - the comic side of its misadventures, and even the most thuggish (like female terrorism on the train) never disappears (Dewaere a breastfeeds like a baby). Blier departs from the scene where Depardieu can be harassed by Dewaere, so we're never sure how to read the obvious homoerotic aspect of any of our relationships - in any event, the event is the beginning of their relative humanization, of course, gay-gay it can be read, though it will be read as you like). Film sex has many scenes of excitement and attractive points, and it is likely that it is a common cartoon on the foci of both sexes, frustrating sensibility and honesty, shooting enough shots, and some of them are forced to shoot.
