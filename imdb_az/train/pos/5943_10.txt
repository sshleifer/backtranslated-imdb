This movie is really beautiful. everything resembles that of a comic book. sets, suits and plot are great. Clark Bartram is still our favorite botman. He looked a little bit better in the dead, but still brings it out. The superman is very large. flying effects are good. but we do not expect his fan film to be the biggest of them. The superman who held the car believed in a hit. it was cool. This is a movie that I will definitely see if it is real. it has everything you want in a batman / superman movie. In spite of an exception, I would throw a joker instead of 2 ..... generally I give this movie because I gave you one of the 10 movies.
