I saw this movie with my husband and we did not stop laughing! So there was nothing scary about this movie! Freddie was laughing at all the lines he was cunning! In my opinion, they did a new nightmare and only Freddy Vs. jason Some parts were gross (like a blow to the head). and sucked any science street movie from 1-5. it was the best with the number 1. If you want a good horror, I will not give this movie. But if you did not have anything else to rent, you would have been too laughing. I want the Texas chain to see the massacre, so it's scary. Freddy's Dead Final Nightmare General Class: B-
