This is the second entry on a regular Columbo series and it is good today. Now I'm very sorry about the management of Bernard L. Kowalski (the numerous television episodes along with the wonderful MACHO CALLAHAN leadership) when I look closely at the DVD and how it is set up. After the killer's killing, the action is shown in the split-screen effect of the two glasses, seeing the assault in the assembly mode, see the corpse point of view. And the jingleman Gil Mellein's unified and impressive avant-garde musician was incredible and helped to create the atmosphere. Brett Halsey's supportive performance as golf pro was very nice - so ten times ten times in a dimensional fragmentation, so subtle and complex. When this episode is taken, the "formula" has not been defined yet, and there are still some surprises in the Columbo methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are the highest quality actors and they are happy to see them - all men are aware of many other roles, but here they lose their characters. All this is in the Columbo series - and many others - have been prepared as a very good feature film.
