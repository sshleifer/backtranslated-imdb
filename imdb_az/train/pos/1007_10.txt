Okay, that's clear. I'm not really a fantastic thing, but for some reason I love Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil holds the SG-1 through Stargate. A round device that creates a worm worm. This allows you to travel to the distant world. It may sound like the usual fantastic series, but that's not it! The area today is not just a few minutes away as many other fantastic series. Magnificent. It gives you events, events, and things that can happen to you, and you can jump to the series at any time without learning many new terms and names of all gadgets. They have, of course, but thanks to O'Neil, who wants to keep simple terminology. <br /> <br /> The series has a great mix of action, humor and drama. If you enjoy the burden of special effects, you will not find it here. They do not use very badly, but they have a limited amount of good effect.
