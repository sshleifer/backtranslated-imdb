Why did this movie get R rating for my life? Though it's related to zombies that are fed, we believe, or indeed, a really good family-friendly movie - at least when your children are 10 or older. Unlike traditional zombie films, it's a bit wrapped, but with traditional values ​​as well as humor! Language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity, and film styles are definitely directed to children (like the old television show "Eerie, Indiana") - still slipped some knucklehead R rating! Believe me that the majority of children seem to be foolish to think that this is just an adult movie, when they see the worse violence and watch the audience. <br /> The story is set in a parallel world. Fashions, cars and mores appeared in 1953, but in this strange world, the "zombie war" and an extremely last zombie penalty that led to massive changes in everyday life. At school, children have been trained in an armed fight, and in a film that a father gives his son a pistol, he has a delayed favorite scene and says he should just "keep it in his backpack!" People are just as strange as to live outside the school, as they already know that zombies are not so bad! <br /> <br /> This movie was finally purchased by the first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally) the area deals with a special family. My mother was excited and her son slowly became a zombie friend. On the other hand, the father was forced to kill himself for zombie killing his father for many years and still did not do that. Funny, irreverent and unique - this movie can be seen by a wider audience.
