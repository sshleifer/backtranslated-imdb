I've seen this movie 100 times in total ... it's full of fun! Powers Boothe gives you a great performance. As William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981) actors, as Boothe-i Jim Jones, the actor is "intensity" like "Shatner" and "Liebmann"! As far as I'm concerned, Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones ... this movie takes its best performance!
