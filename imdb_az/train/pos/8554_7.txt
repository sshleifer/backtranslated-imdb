Wow, this is not as good as the group camp, it's not the best spin of the original American cake, but definitely a very good bare mile. Dwight and Eric Stewart lead this comedy, but in fact I ask for the advantage over the naked shaft of this dialogue. The scenario is much better written and the comedy goes more efficiently, but most comedies come from sex, but it's good, so are we watching these movies anyway? <br /> <br /> Small Rock was a really good community, considering the strength of her bare feet, and the scene with the stiffer was awesome and she laughed when she saw me. /> <br /> The film, in my opinion, was a certain improvement compared with the barefoot, if you like the previous American Pie movies, if you love the beta-house, all American pie spin-offs money.
