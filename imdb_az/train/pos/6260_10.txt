It was heartbreaking! I am Iranian and living in the 21st century did not know that such great tribes lived in such a condition during my dad's time <br /> <br /> You see that today, even in 1925, one lady or baby on one side of the world it could serve for itself or for its cleanliness and needs, but here more than 80 years ago people were more likely to go somewhere with the grass. <br /> <br /> I highly appreciate the Americans who are loyal to these Persians, as the Bakhtiari people were in a difficult situation. .
