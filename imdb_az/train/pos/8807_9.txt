This is a documentary document that consists of artists in the last 11 minutes and 9 seconds. Documentary films are different and deal with every kind of concept, while something shared is 9/11 (in some cases too small). Some segments are weak, others are very strong; some are political, and some are not; some are just like 9/11, some use only 9/11 as a theme to touch universal sensations, feelings and tragedies; some are fundamental, some are wise and artistic). <br /> <br /> This movie is very good and good. <br /> <br /> This is a very controversial film especially for conservative Americans. I think that the two segments really have their right wings (a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber spirits from Egypt, on the other hand, from the UK to the Chilean side of the United States on September 11, 1973, 50,000 deaths and terrible oppression). <br /> <br /> The Mexican segment was the strongest, explaining the fall of the towers, and eventually death was a lively fashion (you have to believe it). <br /> <br /> Although the final product is uneven, although some segments are almost "trivial," I still recommend it. It is difficult to rate this movie because the segments change everywhere (some are weak, some are very strong); I just rank 10 out of 9 just because there are issues with censorship (Mexican segment, UK segment, Japan segment, Egyptian segment) and censorship.
