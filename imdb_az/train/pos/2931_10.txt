Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly the most interesting thing I've ever seen in my life. When I first saw them two years ago, I was stitched a few weeks after them. So far I've seen 17 times and still laugh at my donkey every time. Eddie Murphy was a brilliant stand for the comedian before the Hollywood superstar. Unlike Eddie Murphy Raw, released in 1987, there is no point in this horrible piece. If you are not a person who is unable to blaspheme, you will not be advised to look at it as you would every 5-10 seconds. I gave her 10 to 10 because she shows her best comic genius.
