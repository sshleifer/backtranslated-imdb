When there is a danger of a little calm, at first glance, I have to keep me alive with the Shadow of the Dead. Now, considering Simon Peggy as an undisputed comedy genius, I see it as a great claim. <br /> <br /> Fido may be a good indicator of whether it will appeal to you. <br /> <br /> Comedy is selected where we left Shaun. The stereotypical mid-1950's small town in the original era dropped its life. Zombie wars are over and the zombies themselves are better organized and become useful members of society. This is because, as we have been told from the beginning, a great game of romantic comedy - thanks to the scientific progress made by good people in Zomkom? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie lies in the imagery of a dead horse in a neighborhood, while creating a place for the zombie and protecting its essential values, along with the special threats that they create. This attractiveness and balance are so flawless. <strong> <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <br /> <br /> <strong> > A story has been explained with a heartfelt heart and a vast glamor that animates a live versatile cast of the film. This is one of the works that shows that it actually fights with everyone's participation. <br /> <br /> As you know, Billy Connelly is also entertaining, imagining what his script is learning ... <br /> So if your father does not try to eat you, you'll appreciate the humor of this movie.
