First of all, let me tell you that The Rock did not love the fact that it was very gay. Later, I think that Regal should take Europe's title, Jeff Hardy is an unhappy champion. Rob Van Dam, long ago received the Intercontinental title, Brock won it. I'm glad that the storm and champions are Christians, and the best match was Booker T and Big Show.
