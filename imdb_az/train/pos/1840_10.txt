Great scenarios and some of the world's best players. Montand gives a new intensity dimension and, most importantly, a concept of validity of the "monster" police detective. <br /> <br /> Hollywood is a typical Hollywood protagonist who has lost his family, friends, and animals to kill. But when the sixty seconds are over, he brings himself together, binds his armor, and shoots his enemies in one shot. <br /> <br /> Montand's Marc Ferrot is really damaged - of course, he had another lover. He does not have the revenge in his confusion and anger, but the fingerprints must continue to find the true offender of a crime scene. Thus, all actions are inevitably illogical. This is the main reason why this film does not make us sit but only definetely.
