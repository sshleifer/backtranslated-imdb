Everything should be a musical comedy. Gene Kelly (like Joe Brady) does not miss one step and Frank Sinatra (Clarence Doolittle) misses a note. Together with them, scenes are very good, how much talent can add to a somewhat uneven plot. Sinatra's "I'm very lover of love" is an indication of his future and future. Kelly's "Mexican Hats Dance" delights with a young Mexican girl. Kelly has, of course, been nominated as the best actor. And, indeed, there are some funny lines: "Do you take a dip into the deck?"; "Do you think anyone is a sailor lying in bed?"; and "We got a little difficulty, we got a little child." A thoroughly enjoyable movie is just one thing to shake the dust of the recent World War II era.
