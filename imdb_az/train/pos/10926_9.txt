If you love Kung Fu movies and have not seen this movie, you have deceived yourself. This film is one of the only kung fu fairs that can be recommended for fans of all movies. Normally, it takes a genre of heroic genres to see something in these films, but that's all! The story was well completed and completed. Struggle scenes are great, and almost as close to the end before they are squandered (unlike Crouching Tiger). Throw a little mystery and torture and yourself have a movie heck. Look at all this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
