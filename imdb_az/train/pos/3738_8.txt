Tigerland / (2000) *** 1/2 (from four) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < new and innovative methods describing soldiers. Joel Schumacher ("8MM", "Killing Time"), one of the most-risky directors currently running, resembled the "The Thin Red Line" when he went to the new drama "Tigerland" for individual soldier shoes. Written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, this film has more courage and humor than the "The Thin Red Line" or even "Private Ryan-Save". The dramatic effect of the film has diminished somewhat due to the perversion of the present material, although it is a new perspective on the youth's military education. <br /> <br /> I would like to know the experience of Joel Schumacher in the army. Are these men and those who accuse them? I'm convinced that there are some of them, but the film sees its inconvenient world through the eyes of a young man called Roland Bozz, who rebelled against war ideas. His identity fights immediately with a few other characters: his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis) and Wilson (Russell Richardson), the flaming mood of Bozzun, is quick to rush to tackle the idea of ​​going to the battle. The war described in this production is not in the field of battle, but in the training of the fears and concepts of the soldiers in the training at the training camp of the Louisiana instructional camp. This movie is about war preparation, nothing less. When the soldiers finally go to war, they are disappointed after witnessing the moving characters. <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher, who has been on the ground for about 28 days, using a 16-month fund and minuscule budget, is eager to see a flawed, perverted, brutal and embarrassing atmosphere, using a hand-held movie theater, unique lighting techniques and direct noise. Schumacher's mouth and blown-out images are a feature of a documentary. This unusual cinematography style is quite a bit unsettling, perhaps less concerned, in the difficult realistic realization of the film, the use of a strange language. Four letters of words shock the audience, while others are shocked by what they hear. <br /> <br /> If anything, Tigerland will appreciate us how much our soldiers have passed. at the beginning of the battle. There must be such courage that knows the difficulties and risks involved in the army during the war. Such thoughtful ideas are possible with the performances of young aspirants describing different cadets. This film should not be for all viewers, but young people should consider themselves in the army prior to listing ... and adults should appreciate it for such courage. <br /> <br />
