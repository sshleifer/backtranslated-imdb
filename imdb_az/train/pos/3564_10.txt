<br /> <br /> This is always one of my favorite music and movie tracks! (Other Gwen Verdon, Damn Hundon, and Damn Yankees with Ray Walston) As we know, sometimes the glow from the show (not to mention the songs) is lost in the transition from the scene to the screen. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, this is not really here. <br /> <br /> These sets are divine, bright and colorful, symbols are bigger than life, and you can not help them, but you love them, Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning. (They are glad to know that they are using the original Broadway choreography). <br /> <br /> All actors have "jumped to the ball" (ie, unbeatable chemistry) in this movie. Frank and Marlon are absolutely convincing, as the owner of the most sweeping swimming game in New York City, and at least the most expensive players are the most expensive players - for example fire 104 penicillin. Sweet, fresh-facing Jan Simmons is perfect for Sarah's role (though his truth is, his singing tube is not as outstanding as Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - a hearty hearted mission doll and all healing. Finally, Miss Vivian Blaine, repeating the role of Broadway, as Miss Adelaide, a talented hero and dancer who wants to finish his 14th wedding with Nathan for marriage, <br /> Firstly, Stubby Kaye and BS. Pulley released Broadway as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. <br /> <br /> Breno is in the ordinary position, and if you do not have Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher's voice, you will forget it - in this sense, it's the decision to make everything that can be done in the role of Sky Masterson. Every time I see "Luck A Lady" nicknamed me. <br /> <br /> Simmons is a charming and pleasing thing to fit his appearance, voice, and how to behave. It's been a long time just to get to Sky (or to eventually believe in it), not to win gambling, drinking, and other sins, and to live a life with God. <br /> <br /> "Sinatra is a man," he says. She is perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit, where she sings the unwitting part of the Broadway film, Sam Leveney (terrifying actor, but left-tone snow ... go figure). I really enjoyed adding the "Adelaide" song ... I would like some people to read it for me. Frankie's cool, slikin behavior limits the boundaries of this movie. But most importantly, we want her to marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> And speaking of Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is simply a perfection in this role. Instead, like Adelaide's Lament, it's just terrible. And it's my favorite part of the whole film. He really feels for Adelaide ... especially when it sounds before and after "Sue Me". I still do not decide if Pet Me Poppa is better than Bushel and Peck ... Maybe I treat them equally. Either way, it's also "Get Your Mink Take." (I do not apologize for leaving the movie "hollanderize"). <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> About this movie their lingo. A mixture of high grade and street chains. They never use "This", "I" or "It". Always "This", "I'll Do" and "This". In general, Guys & Dolls are one of my favorite movies and music, and each time it comes time to watch. My only complaint? "Do not marry today." It's a good song now.
