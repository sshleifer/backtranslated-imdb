With stunning cinematography and undoubtedly a caption of Kafkaesk, this movie was on my simple but interesting opening scene. The film plays as a dream and I hate why people like it or not. Cartoons are laid on the surface and the story itself is light and maybe a little nonsensical. But the lack of this film is a conscious choice. The film does not want to work as a history, but rather the decoration of war films of the 1940s. <br /> <br /> I claim that the film is a very real substance, but the film is a completely swept kinematic miracle. This is one of the most beautiful films and there is a wild idea in its style. I can fully understand why people hate it, but I give it 9/10.
