It's a very well-prepared movie, carefully directed, and sometimes with a great deal of immersive character - for example, loyal to the scene, but with inexperienced sidekick police and spouse. The site is convincing and interesting. The character of the gangster is particularly interesting and plays a metaphysical role in the hero's life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br police and justice system, which has undermined the uncertainty of police symbols protected up to this point. Also, I find the character of a leading woman a bit weaker: there is nothing less than a catalyst for the hero's salvation, as it seems, difficult guys cry and cry as they fight.
