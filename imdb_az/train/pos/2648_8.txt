Indeed, the tale of two brutal brothers and their falling from grace (with drug addiction) and later payment. A brother of James Franco, a self-proclaimed genius, is your typically sensitive, but clever guy. Another brother is a hard-working future physician, who is less inclined to catch self-esteem when faced with the expectations of both children in the family. They do not want to have a pretty realistic summary of the dynamics of the family that they have problems with drugs. I advise everyone who is interested in this kind of character research and I praise James Franco for his efforts in a daring love labor.
