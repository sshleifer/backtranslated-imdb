This Wrestlemania did not just do it for me. Some things, such as involvement of the king of war and celebrities, were a good shot for good old days, so it seemed to be a big deal in "Your Home" than anything else to talk about. Even though the tag was worth the match for a few matches, like the tag title, it was noteworthy that the title change was the next night when it was worth the celebration.
