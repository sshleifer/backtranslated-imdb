<br /> <br /> I've never seen a man's land (1987) - IMDB link http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and he's done it. The movie is about a man who just stole Porsches. It comes 13 years after six seconds and does not add anything. In fact, there are many scenes that are worthless. <br /> <br /> Sphinx has a magnetic screen that needs to be used better ...
