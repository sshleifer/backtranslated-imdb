Jake Speed ​​(1986) was an entertaining parody of Indiana Jones and other adventurous films popular for over eighties. Wayne Crawford, like Jake Speed, is an adventurer who is always on the go. With his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher) they are looking for a movement (and some worthy story lines) globe trot. A young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins), who was abducted by her brother, a bad network merchant merchant (John Hurt). <br /> <br /> Can Jake and Desmond find out and help her to help Desmond rescue his brother? <br /> <br /> It's a sweetheart and a cheerless movie that's never seen as something. I have to give you a recommendation. <br /> <br /> Of course, you enjoy the entertaining movies and those who do not value everything. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
