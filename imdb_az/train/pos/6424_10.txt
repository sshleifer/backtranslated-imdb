Like a child, I remember the ninth or it and love this movie. It was the whole Bollywood action / comedy movie. This is an imitation of Bad Boys! All change identities, but the arrival of twin twins causes everything from the window to come and then dance and read the colorful villain! The action scenes in the film are not revolutionary, but still beautiful scenes. The movie was really funny and Amitabh Bachan was a great turning point. Govinda is a gem as always, and this is perhaps the best thing to do, and offers the best comedy scenes in the side kick nd Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> Songs are also funny and attractive .............. proves your laugh when you least expect ... Amitabh Bachan is very funny in a surprising way and 'Bade Miah 'laughs ... body language ..... bright ... <br /> <br />' Assi chutki naab re daal 'is the best song ............ .. You.
