I watched the film together with a homophobic friend, my husband and his fiancee. So, I had ideas in all aspects. Basically, the movie made me laugh, there was really no sexual tension and only attention was drawn to the actors Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, though he did not fit the scenario, he played a good role. There were good Romanian actors around, not just a complex role. I welcome Puya to enter the film business. <br /> <br /> My husband loves me, but I think he's a good guy and I hope he's a good player. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If the film tried to present unusual sexual behavior in today's Romania and its results, then it failed. There were no results. Just imagine that girls are actually a girl and a girl, and the same story can be just a dull, unkind trick. <br /> <br /> I do not know why the BAFTA prizes are all deceived. In my book, "The Best Success Another Time" was to get the award. (bafta = success in Romania).
