Sarah Silverman's idea of ​​having her show was initially anxious. His films are not funny and his humor is a bit smaller. However, this comedy was very surprised to see its true colors shine on the central gem. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <strong> Supporting cast. His sister's character is good; Sometimes in Hell, but ultimately not to steal Sarah's show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm glad that the Comedy Center gave Sarah a chance to show her self and bare self and humor.
