Not only is a good Korean film about Taekwondo, but as a combatant in a good way, it is impossible to beat Taekwondo's son in sports because there is life and school and the sixth of this film. <br /> <br /> The film's art is not good, but it's unpleasant and pleasant. Friends, minds and hearts were mocking at once to achieve something. <br /> <br /> This film is not meant to be a serious slapstick, but it also has a message. <br /> <br /> A good movie from Korea.
