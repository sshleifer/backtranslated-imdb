There is much talk about "Psychological Wests", but this is really one of the few in this genre. There are very well-known star names, but it's a director who made a good movie. Stewart Granger loses the English safari hunter stereotype to play retired buffalo hunter, one of the most respected in the West. Robert Taylor plays Taylor's middle-aged, unlike the usual younger starter who enjoys Granger to work with him and work with the buffalo. They employ Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn's other two major actors. Granger regrets the murdered buffalos, because if they know they are dead, Native American lifestyle will suffer. Taylor soon reveals a sadistic side, but it is realism, unlike one-dimensional sadists of the modern film created by nerds and dorks. She is insecure and needs communication with people. Still, it can not stop the murder. This is a surprising result, the last one throws out twice against each other. Their psychological effects are well illustrated.
