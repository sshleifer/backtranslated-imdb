A beautiful movie to watch with amazing scenes and talented actors like Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono. After 15 minutes, your eyes are locked on the screen and you breathe in the atmosphere of the movie you expect to bring fate to symbols. This movie lets you leave your position as a standard audience, takes you, is part of the story ... Costume and settings are brilliant; Especially the town of okiyazÄ±z is built magnificently. Certainly not so much Akira Kurosawa, but still a lot of things from the master, especially in a stylistic story, we are somewhere different from the Hollywood flamboyance in a fairly distant movie scene.
