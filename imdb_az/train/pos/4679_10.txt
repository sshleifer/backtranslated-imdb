Give a chance to eat - a horrible film with a little slow start. Story is based on curiosity and complexity. Characters and story lines make the expectations and clich√©s at all the right moments. The location of the perfect New York city - a strange, realistic - "City Sex" is a fantastic antidote to the trading terms - in fact, the entire film is a antidote to the HBO / Hollywood concept of New York City, sex and relationships. It is a rare film that accepts the characters very honestly and with compassion. LOVED IT! Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson and his love interests (forgot his name!
