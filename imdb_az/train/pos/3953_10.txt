When I left this movie on television I did not see it again. While checking Roy Thinne's film credits, I could not remember the title for my life and likened it to it. An excellent, dark, and frightening TV fright film of the same class as Crowhaven Farm; Do not be afraid of the darkness; and "The Devil's School for Girls," all of Satan's classics lost. I also think Clint Eastwood is very parallel to the classic "High Plains Drifter". Why not leave these great little movies, especially when you count the last trash that fills the discount DVD at Wal-Mart? Most of these ore trees have cults, so selling is not a problem.
