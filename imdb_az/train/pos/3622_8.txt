At first glance, I knew I'd see it. Dennis Quaid has been a cause, but the issue of keeping your dreams speaks to me. People are talking about this subject as a movie for children, but I think that a film for the baby bumors coming from aging, deceiving parents, our own death, our children are growing and leaving us, and all other things we do not think will happen for us. <br /> <br /> Film does not fall into the tragedy; explains what your dreams mean when you are in real life. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Camera case slow and sweet. When they put this movie together, they left something that was not necessary. Very nice.
