There are many words I want to use to describe this movie, but can not I do that? This movie is a movie just to sit, laugh, cry, and then watch if you want to pee. I'm serious. Do not watch this movie if you hate it easily for blasphemy, sex, nudity, homosexuality, and anything related to nature. Being a woman can not even be a factor, I can watch this movie again and again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all other debut, Baseketball is a winner. Now I'm laughing at thinking of some stupid things in the movie. Watch the movie! Here is what I will say. It is difficult for me to abandon this comment, because as I am one of these people, almost every one of us is cursed by Ozzy Osbourne. That's why I'm professional. The best film. Heck yeah !!
