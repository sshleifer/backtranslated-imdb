It's gratifying! In October I saw Inside Import inside my kids with Philly. We all enjoyed seeing our parents for the second time. I have not heard similar things for years! For the first time, I remember seeing a movie that my parents and children loved. It's really sweet and we can not wait to get out of the DVD. You need to shoot more movies like Inner Import. It is updated to go to a movie that can be used by (and not ashamed) three different generations. I have not seen this sweet movie from the Big Fat Greek Knot. I like Mindy Sterling as a mother. He was also Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is in that position and he is not hilarious. I remember her from the BKID.
