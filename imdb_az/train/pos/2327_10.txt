A 14-year-old girl develops the first serious line to a 17-year-old boy who lives close to her and tries to tackle her inadequate feelings about her older brother. This is a simple work of director Robert Mulligan's beautiful, poetic aging film. Mulligan was previously known for his "42th edition" in 1971, and in 1962, "The 196th birthday of the 1960s: Reese Witherspoon, 14-year-old girl, Emily Warfield, like a brother; Jason London is a 17-year-old boy, Reese Witherspoon, surprisingly good at the start of a film that reflects a 14-year-old girl's experience of a young girl's love and hurt feelings that can be fatal to any misinterpretation. The film describes the thoughts or feelings of each individual with love, with excessive sensitivity, without even passing through to the kudos. Kudos to the autobiographical scenario from Jenny Wingfield, a young man with an emotionally dishonest or senseless, honest and consistent tone There are very few films about lovers n one. Music is a nice simple, tone and sentiment of the highlights of the scene from the stage, but never could interfere. The beautiful cinematography, shot in the 70s, the famous horror director Freddie Francis. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston, for 1957, have sexually explicit, emotional, and parenting parents. Gail Strickland is as good as the boy's mother. Emotional wall-cutter, this sweet-tempered movie, has the characteristic of characterizing, learning lessons and experiencing truths. So far Robert Mulligan's latest film. This is one of the best films of 1991. **** 4 stars.
