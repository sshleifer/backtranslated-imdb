Jim Thompson's novel, the perfect interpretation of these neo-noy thrillers, has all the necessary elements - an old old boxer drifter, an alcoholic widow, an evil widow with bad intentions, an old police bumper, and a stealing plot intended for resurrection. But the film never goes to a clich√© country but is fresh and interesting. Spectacles, especially Bruce Derne's, are as bad as the dark, uncle Bud. There is a strenuous uncertainty about the film's movement that is intentional or unusual, and is added to the processes in the heart. Be advised.
