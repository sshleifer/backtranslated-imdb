I thought the movie was actually pretty good. I'm glad the player and it's good. The director really understood the story he wanted to say. I had to see the huge budget today, so there was much more to throw, but it had to wait long. If you see such a movie for a small budget, we have to consider it when viewing it. There were some things that could be better, but most are related to the budget. The player was pretty good, the F / X and the stunts were good. There were several standout cameras. and the boy playing the boy. These films continued to work on LA and it turned out OK.
