Turn it on! Japan is a really entertaining show and I love it so much! It was shown in our country only at Hero TV and ABS-CBN at 5:30. About Azuma Kazuma, who is trying to fulfill the desire to make Japanese bread representing her country. He works in the South Toyo department of Pantas and also helps his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) to defeat St. Pierre and manage Pantasia, other bakers (like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru). Many other countries are struggling with skilled bakers, and they just do not learn to learn different types of bread, but also learn to cook other dishes. It's a really funny and unique anime because they imitate the characters from other popular anime (like Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and popular people in real life. This is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and is really for people of different ages.
