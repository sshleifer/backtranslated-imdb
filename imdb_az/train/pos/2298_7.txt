I love the secret fears and was able to do more in the Horror field than the great English Hammer Studios, which delivered one of its biggest films, "The Devil Rides Out" (1968). The Hammer's House of Horror (1980) and the 10th episode "Abyss of Guardian" by Hammer's short-range television series are really a creepy introduction to the series. Former director Don Sharp and "Fu Machu", who later played with Christopher Lee, "The Vampire Kiss" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966), undoubtedly, better among HHH directors well-known names and also here. Antique seller Michael (Ray Lonnen) stumbles on a mysterious old brushing bottle. Suddenly, the glass is something that a devout worshiper wishes. When Michael took refuge in a beautiful young girl called Allison (Rosalyn Landor), who was to be sacrificed by the cult, Michael went into a deeper problem with the cult and troubled leader (John Carson) ... This is not necessarily my "Hammer House of Horror" one of the brightest seventh episodes, "The Silent Scream") is very creepy and atmospheric. The site has several interesting twists and remains suspenseful and uncanny throughout the film. Ray Lonnen is a good lead, young Rosalayn Landor is convincing of innocent beauty and is really creepy as John Carson is the leader of Satanists. In general, the "Abyss Guardians" should not miss an exciting and creepy HHH tale and my fellow Hammer fans.
