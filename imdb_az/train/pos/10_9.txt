I'm not a woman in the movies, but it's really a good story. I do not have a personal love for Jane Fonda, but DeNiro is a great personality, a hell of a wonderful job. Everything was done very well: acting, directing, visual, setting, photography, casting. You can make a story of a true man and true love - this is a victory.
