I think that most people do not get the right idea about the film, at least my opinion. I do not believe there is a film about drug abuse; on the contrary, a film about the genius brothers' thinking, drug side effects, is something marginal. Again, it's not a commercial movie that you see every day, and if the author wants you to do so, most people consider it to be one of many drug-related films. And I think of something else. Like many other films featuring different cultures, audiences usually see movies that reflect their culture, in other words, what they grew up and understood. This film is to show that this "genius" often thinks of people and what problems they face. The reason why they behave like this is their reason for enjoying their minds). They must get to know people who are doing mediocre things and who start their day in the cosmos. They have started a very difficult job and will never succeed. They feel like - I went to work, did nothing, when they were on their projects, twice as good as my children around me, and now what should I do with my spare time? And what is even more elegant? When you begin to anticipate behavior because you're a psychologist, just because you see this example in the past. Thus, on the one hand, it is not a difficult task, but sometimes quite boring, and the other one begins to determine the behavior of people. Great is a prescription for great boredom. And the most luxurious things are usually done to get out of this situation. In the past, the biggest problem is that those who say that life is logic (describes mathematical logic), that those who say that life is really unreasonable is absolutely true.
