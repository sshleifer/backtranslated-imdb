Freebird is a perfect marriage in a beautiful film, on the roadside comedy, gang racer, "stoner" and in English movie. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant lead that separates the film from other films in this genre. The stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have a great chemistry and make their characters pretty likable and realistic. The main story is the adventures and clashes around the road trips from London to Wales. This little movie also has a great heart - not just for bicycle lovers, because it stays in relationships with each other and regrets Fred's longing for Gary Stretch's remaining family. Ancient cinematography is also beautiful - a letter of love to the Welsh village, as well as the strangeness on the streets of London and typical pubs in the cities of Wales. <br /> <br /> I recommend Freebird in a Heartbeat - Stylish, slick, fantastic soundtrack, likable characters and funny storyline!
