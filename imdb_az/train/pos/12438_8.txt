The film was a long time waiting for me. I did not wait for this because I was a little disappointed. When I look back, it's really pretty good to say. First of all, it does not match the original date (of course, totally) and is just like the film's right. The model has been shown as a child of the model, and it is very accurate to the original. Acting is perhaps the best around, and the plot is somewhat subtle, but it does not try to be a music when compared to Vitti in 1966, because it's a better way. In general, this is only recommended to anyone who wants Modesty Blaise fans or the TV.
