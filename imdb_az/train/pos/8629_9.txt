At the beginning of the nineteenth century I read a small advertisement in some fears magazine about the Liebe des Totes (love of the dead) or something similar. This, of course, awakened my curiosity. That's why the Order of Nekromantik 1 & 2 and Der Todesking (Death King). Nekromantic films Ok, even an interesting and unique theme, Necrophilia (although it is quite funny to have terrific opera entries that are meant to be afraid of the fear of explicit viewers). <BR> <br /> <br /> INTERVIEW, on the other hand, in my opinion, has become one of the best films. It consists of several scenes that reflect many scenes. Death as an enemy; Death, as a rescue of the body as a physical breakdown. The film is a metaphor for life. It shows how fragile life and how short our lives are. We reduce our viewers to the children they are. We do not know the nature of death, and therefore the process of death is the main message of the film. This is the most realistic film. Buttgereit does not try to conceal the death of white flowers or anything else. Regardless of moral norms, death is inevitable and is not a science faster, but your truth. It belongs to your esteemed reader, which is the film's audience. <br /> <br /> Some young writers do not understand this, they are completely pardoned, because they will live forever ... <br /> <br /> This is not an exploit film. Why? Because death does not expel humans. Gives us a product. We grow up seven days later, and then brought to the state of the state of Copenhagen before birth, that is, Death. Buttgereit gives us the oldest tale version. Whether you should consider this to be "optimistic" or "pessimistic" depends on you. At first glance, it might seem too dark. Although something else should die for survival. "Who wants to live forever?" <br /> <br /> I believe that Buttgereit is a body that is exhausted, it shows not just decomposition, but the whole of the new life. <br /> <br /> Is it better to die than to live as one of the most loved pets in nature, to live on the leaves and then to the birds? <br /> <br /> <strong> Der Todesking sees it in the right context. <br /> <br /> Sieben Tage hat die Woche, siebenmal letzte Stunden. <br /> <br /> Days of the seventh week (weak, fatal!), Seven times last hour. <br /> <br /> Do not be afraid of Reaper, Buttgereit tells us because Reaper is just what it is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
