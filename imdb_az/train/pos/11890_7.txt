This is a very elegant film. Especially when Depardieu is in a realistic performance with realist performances like a cad and a bad guy with mood and art-house concepts in realistic places, the director fails to comment on any position, stand or criticism. One of my passionate and regular partners in France's Depardieu films is that Pialat will not engage with me because I believe they have brought them together. Women seem to have an impression of why women are falling for bad guys, and they will be hurt when there is a good friend and good husband. Isabelle Hupert, who plays philosophy with an opaque difference, answers like "I do not know"; "I love his weapons"; "I love her and love her," she asks, trying to get her husband out of the house, but palliates and looking again ... Because I love her. So, what does he do, and what does he hope for? He will wake up one day and come to his senses. Such things are not answered in the documentary-drama style with long-term performances and longer scenes of Piazza. I know you will not add your answers but just a stand. Jules and Jim, this is not it. The only film we watch just like a cold film is just the most forgiving headache and headache.
