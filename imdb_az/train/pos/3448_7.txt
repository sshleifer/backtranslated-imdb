In short, a documentary damaging the word ... never ... <br /> <br /> Suppose that the hadith is more than a statement, let's make a comment on the Japanese society. And as soon as this movie comes as an absurdist documentary, the continuous word goes fast and is so poorly translated - it is still quite pleasing, as it is seen in Copenhagen Kinematek tonight. <br /> <br /> Because I'm patient and just really sick and open minded, I'm talking to you with Jim Jarmusch fans with a relue of Add, I believe this is a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Some of the films are different, and quite experienced. Static 2D in 3D world. All this is fun for those who want to see a Japanese movie that breaks Japanese culture of cooking. A grill if you're in mood for something totally different.
