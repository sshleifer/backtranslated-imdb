I just came back from the pre-emptive view of this legendary movie. This style is totally unique and well-designed. It was made with actual actors, but it has become an unpleasant black and white comic style style. It's a step further than Sin City and it does well. A successful combination of French comic and film cultures. The story and story reminds Blade Runner and you resemble it. This story is smart, it's never elegant, and it's a bit nicely twisted. This movie should be seen for any cinephile, except perhaps those who do not like science or b-w.
