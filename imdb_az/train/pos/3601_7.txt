Michelle Rodriguez is an actress who describes himself as a charismatic actor to watch for other actresses. He has the courage to put himself in the hard-earned role of a very early career in his career (and draw it), which is a matter of recognition. Despite his subsequent wrestling films, this film was prepared for his firmness. <br /> <br /> His character is a romantic student / warrior / lover, struggling to overcome his own unwanted projects. The film has a bit of regret ... but it's not a girl. <br /> <br /> This aspect of this film is not very original, but heated relations with this girl's fever, she saw an actress taking such an aggressive position in filmmaking and I'm delighted to have Hollywood's original twist. Because of the shared story of the ghetto youth, this movie has taken me 7 people, but there is such a great actress who portrays a rare role in a minimal budget movie. Great job.
