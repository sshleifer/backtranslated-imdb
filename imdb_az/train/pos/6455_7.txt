When I saw the front of the Oscill Night front, I took the movie. When I read about Kay Pollak I was hooked. <br /> <br /> This film was a great controversy in Sweden. As a multi-state American, I can only speculate about the cause. Perhaps, Lena is a provocative joke in the film's head and in other social commentaries, perhaps in this sense a central message that has every imaginable idea in rich societies. <br /> <br /> This movie is the same for me as the Titanic. Life is a short man, and we all know what we really know. It can be removed at any time. Because we are afraid of suffering, do not we regret that we spend a lot of time behind other people's walls? Throwing walls is painful, but on the other side of these terrible walls feels a lively pole. The feeling of alive is worth the risk. Giving and receiving. So NOW lives. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this film for lack of character and other shortcomings. I say that all of you are lying. <br /> <br /> So those who are less fortunate than you, who provide a guarantee to help you join a chorus or a group or build a house or eat it. Distribute some joys and create a better place for the world when you come and talk to your friend. It's not enough to write a check. In this way, we have some sort of social. <br /> <br /> Author: Mammad Ahmadzadeh: "In some cases it is an accident"
