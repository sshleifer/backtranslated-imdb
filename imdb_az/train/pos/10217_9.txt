The panic of butterfly wings in the Atlantic can occur in a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (in some way I'm not fully convinced of the connection with the Chaos theory), the smaller or weaker each action, the chain reaction that will lead to great events will begin. This small pearl of the film shows us some symbols that do not resemble one another. Most of these activities in Paris will affect each other's lives. (The Six Degrees of Separation Theory can also be applied.) Each story is a facet of the jeweler in this movie. The player perfectly regulates and nuances (Audrey Tautou is illuminated), the stories mesh plausibly, the humor is just right and the audience has begun to agree with the theater.
