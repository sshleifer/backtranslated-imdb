Agniezska This third feature of a filmmaker, such as Zentropa, in North America, was a shocking, inspirational, or shocked shock of any third-party filmmaker in North America to avoid confusion with the Holocaust movie Europa Europa, after a strange, nostalgic, short-lived, after World War II. Leo's America does not fully understand what he's doing there. He has come to take part in determining the country, as he thinks that Germany has been given a little benefit. Whatever it sounds, he is not a speaker sympathetic or, in particular, a joke. Leo, who works on the railroad, becomes a helmet worker in a car when he sleeps, and he grew in 1945 in a hostage of German horror and complexity. <br /> <br /> This progression, Leo, was very memorable by the calm, yet still uncomfortable actor Jean-Marc Barr, Barbara Sukowa, an actress with a foolishness on the surface, but met with a heartfelt train on the inner-power train. He drives him and then takes him home to meet his family, the owner of the train company. There were precision trains that killed Jews during the war, but now they put an agenda on the agenda and Kessler, a woman's uncle, is just one of the good things she does. <br /> <br /> Another guest in the house, Eddie Constantine, is a quiet actor. </ P> <p style = "text-align: justify" is a powerful American intelligence worker who can confirm that Kess's uncle is a war crime, though he is completely surprised by Leo. For decades, Americans have been characterized as flawless bones from their own elements, but Leo has become less complicated compared to Leo, who has gradually returned to his death career. <br /> <br /> The stories are less complicated than those of Leo's filmmaking and cinematography the film is portrayed by the Danish director Lars Von Trier, who is black-and-white and colorful, uses dual effects, optical effects, and cunning photography, actors interact with the images reflected in the back, with a rich shaded into a visceral world, so decorate n insects <br /> <br /> This Grand Jury award-winning surrealist business is allegorical but may be a different tone to every audience. I'm describing it as a film about the ethical accountability of Americans and others who are late to rescue the last legs of the train, the martyrs of these trains, and the camps they spread to their condemned ships. Those who are so important for the film and the Nazi era and train are dead but avoid reflexes like closed chickens. <br /> <br /> Heroes, music, dialogue, and plot are intentionally soft and neutral conventions have almost been satirically taken. The most attractive points in the film are completely cinematic. Two trains were standing at the front and the end, and Barr and Sukowa in another. An underwater shot of the bloody blood. An unusual expression that should be done to drown. And the most metaphysical, an anesthetic stroke of the train paths, the voice of Max von Sydow, brings us back to Europe and limits us to our own restrictions.
