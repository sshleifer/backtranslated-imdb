The director was in the same position: explain love stories in Paris. Of course, some of them were better than others, but all the mosaics were quite attractive - though all of them had the same love vision, would not they dig up? <br /> <br /> In Quartier Part 1, Quartier Latin by Gérard Depardieu, One of the greatest French actors has directed my favorite segment and has always been confused by Gena Rowlands and Ben Gaza. Attractive and delicious. <br /> <br /> "Tour Eiffel" by Sylvain Chomet <br /> <br /> A small child story, which is a favorite, visually impaired (thanks to the director of "Belleville Triplets") mimes <br /> <br /> 3. "Tuileries" by Ethan and Joel Coen Coen Brothers + Steve Buscemi = Cheerful 4. "Parc Monceau", Alfonso Cuarón ("Y Tu Mamá También "," Kids Men ") feat. Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier (comic) 5. "Place des Fêtes" by feat Oliver Schmitz. Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga (touching) <br /> <br /> 6. The 14th Arrondissement, Alexander Payne ("The Election", "Schmidt") is a wonderful manifestation of the painful side of life. <br /> <br /> At age 7, Marco Martindale (Hilary Swank's Million Dollar Baby), an actress known as an elderly, middle-aged American woman; "Faubourg Saint-Denis", Tom Tykwer's ("Run Lola Run") works in a crazy style, a young actress (Natalie Portman) and a blind guy (Melchior Beslon) who is in love; <br /> <br /> "Père-Lachaise" by Wes Craven feat. Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell (Interesting by Alexander Payne, Oscar Wilde!); <br /> <br /> 9. "Loin du 16ème" by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas (animated story from Catalina Sandino Moreno, a simple but talented Brazilian filmmaker). "Quartier des Enfants Rouges "by Olivier Assayas (" Clean "), a sad story feat. always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal; <br /> 11. "Le Marais" feat by Gus Van Sant. Gaspard Ulliel, Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful (simple, but funny); <br /> <br /> 12. "Quartier de la Madeleine" by feat Vincenzo Natali. Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko; <br /> <br /> 13. "Quais de Seine" by Gurinder Chadha; <br /> <br /> 14. "Place des Victoires", feat by Nobuhiro Suwa. Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; <br /> <br /> 15. Bastille, Isabel Coixet ("Strange Life of My Life" movie) Miranda Richardson, Sergio Castellitto, Javier Cámara and Leonor Watling; <br /> <br /> 16. "Pigalle" by feat Richard LaGravenese. Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant; <br /> <br /> 17. Montmartre, along with Bruno Podalydes; 18. "Porte de Choisy" by Christopher Doyle, Barbet Schroeder (mainly known as "Barfly", "Restoration of Fortune" and "Holy White Woman"). <br /> <br /> I can classify some segments as bright and others at the moderate level (even slightly boring), but one is not straightforward.In general, I give the name "Paris, Je T'Aime" 8.5 / 10, and why I advise: a beautiful mosaic of love and other things.
