I saw this independent film in Philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise. I left the theater with a smile on my face. One of those funny things was based on a real story - funny! There are some great actors in this. Mindy Sterling is in this position and is very good. I loved her at Austin Powers. Howard Hesseman is terrific. I remember the class leader. I'm tired of the movies I presented. It is entertaining and bright, so I can watch it with your family and not be embarrassed. When I leave the DVD, I control it. I will definitely buy it.
