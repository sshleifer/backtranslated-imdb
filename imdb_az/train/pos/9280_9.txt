Women in Iran are officially banned from the sporting events of men. In June 2005, the Iranian national football team had an important game against Bahrain at the Azadi Stadium for the qualification of the World Cup. <br /> <br /> <strong> Fenerbahce and Flamengo teams, beaches and films are my greatest passions; So I liked this little ship about a group of girls and their passion for football. The film "The White Balloon", "The Mirror" and "The Circle" directed by Jafar Panahi hit this movie on the day he defeated Iran with Bahrain and won the World Cup in Germany. This dramatic and funny adventure of Iranian girls is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;">
