It's a really fun movie. Sit up and sit in mindlessly as Sabbah is more bent; more funny. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher, Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr ... All this is known as quality actors, soap opera stars / producers. As you consider a soap opera and think, "How did the earth come out with THIS idea?", THIS IS LOVE this movie. I have seen it several times; and every time I watch him, I value humor more and understand better how well he is acting. Do not expect the Oscars quality. This is not an entertaining film for fun, but rather some attempts to find "the inner man". Sit back, relax and laugh.
