Peter O'Toole is a cure for watching roles that are well-lineed and offers a chance to catch his drunken stupor. Favorite Susannah York presents a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence. <br /> <br /> The film touches the incest, without an open-air scene, but can entertain the audience in a social commentary. . Although not great for any account, it will be remembered for entertaining performances. <br /> <br /> Mr. York, in the end, to sign a document, a treat to watch, quietly reveals the tragedy. The weakness here is the direction Thompson draws. But the film is fraught with actors and scripts. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie twice for 20 years - twice as "Brother Love". "Country Dance" is a pretty farcical and inappropriate title for this movie.
