It was a magnificent and unforgettable, striking atmosphere and a brilliant way. <br /> <br /> I really do not understand how it turned the masterpiece and made the sound superior as 8 (and nine!) <br /> <br /> This is John Ford's biggest film, along with the Grape Grapes . <br /> <br /> <strong> Long Voyage Home is almost back in the next time. <br /> <br /> 10.
