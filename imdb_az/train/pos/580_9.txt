When I first saw this movie, I was with my dad. He encouraged me to watch this movie because he was one of his favorites. After watching the movie, he immediately became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> One tea works with two brothers who have a different way of life in each one's life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is one of the two siblings, and he's being trained. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is a rebellious young brother who goes on a road full of obstacles. <br /> <br /> These characters are watching in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film has no negative side. You will have fun all along the way. Operations, management, and scenarios are all perfect. The two exceptions are kinematography and account. Both of you are inclined to the world, Robert Redford creates for you. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie that is meant to be classic. That's in my book. If you have not seen this movie, you can definitely watch it as soon as it remains forever with you.
