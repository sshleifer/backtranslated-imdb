Bellocchio is primarily a political film, a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy, but it seems to be more metaphor than truth. Almost everything looks like a metaphor in the film. The revolutionaries we have seen and little learned can also be mafia. Psychoanalist Andrea Papa's traditional traditional bourgeois values ​​are morally right, ineffective, clean, and fresh, thoroughly ritualized. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Revolutionary girlfriend Giullia represents what may be a human being who needs a very bad cause, but can not provide a kind of loyalty that demands such a commitment. (Here I guess.) Andrea, an adolescent boy, looks like the only man in the film, and is not "upatz" in any way. He respects his father, but he is disobedient. He loves Giuliani, or is not that old, though he has been taught how to manage his reflexes optimally, but he leaves for school to complete his final exams. The path between these contradictory lifestyle can be described as "media." <br /> <br /> Let's note that, according to the US Embassy in Azerbaijan, - I declare that I have no way of knowing that Antigone, Marushka Detmars, who contradicts the traditional position of the gods. He remembers New Yorker cartoons a few years ago. Two hippo teaches deep in the river, looking at a gazelle from the bank, and a hippo tells another: "I hate him." He's a good actress. (Take me out of this way). Everyone is in the film. She communicates with her in her exquisite grace, in her speech and style. And all comes from the actress, not the directing aid. Detmars is not a hazelnut as Catherine DeNeuve's "Cake" nuts. The walls are not converted into rubber and their hands are not grown. Instead, we see animation - sometimes a TOO animation. <br /> <br /> A critic has described it sadly, but he is probably not the word he has sought. It is brilliantly brown-haired, with white black-and-white ready-to-use, sparkling sparkle. His eyes look like the eyes on the walls of the ancient Egyptian tombs. Hot parts are pretty erotic, not so much because one of them is open, but we've got to know the heroes. (It is more interesting to spy on honey more than go to a skin flick) There is not much sex in fact. Artificial lines have only one scene, but the director can play in real-time. At least real-time for a 18-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> Andrea is a teenager playing a very important thing because the film is entirely connected to him and Giulia. They have to do it, and they do it. If it were not for their performance, I do not believe that it would be like an exciting or astonishing snap. <br /> <br /> Therefore,
