Walter Pidgeon, civil claimant Braley Maston, who was involved in The Unknown Man, starring Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle, and Richard Anderson in 1951. Pidgeon, a great miracle of justice, admits Rudi Walchek (Braselle), an accusatory pro bono, charged with the murder of a young man. Shortly afterwards, he realizes that he is a sinner and that he saves money from his victim and other tradesman in the neighborhood. It is recommended by DA (Sullivan) that Rudi is a minor change, it is recommended to eradicate organized crime, and should find one. The "Unknown Man" is a small, black and white movie that lets you control the audience's interests with different landscapes. is drawn up a little. It really tells a good man that he is ready for his god, justice and what he can do to get it. And this is the most-shot part. OJ, Menendez Brothers and others when they believe in justice and advocacy integrity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Head of the Caucasian Muslims Office, Pidgeo had a great career for 60 years, but he really rose to the superstardom. He was a strong player who could and could play on something. Perhaps, when he did, he was good at the thirtieth year and missed the matinee idol; or there may be something missing; or a giant woman like Greer Garson was written early as a second thought. It is difficult to say. It gives honest and touching performance here. <br /> <br /> Good performances are a very good movie.
