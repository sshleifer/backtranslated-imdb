This is a very strange movie by the director / animator Richard Williams. <br /> <br /> Everyone who knows William's job knows that this is a bit of an outsider, but it takes a sack. <br /> <br /> There are two horrific ragdolls that save the owner from damaging the new French puppet. pirate toys and along the way find themselves in the mercy of some strange characters. In this film the force is mostly esthetic; its strange character designs, its powerful animation, and the sweet and scary striking contrast. Williams' brilliant animation, Raggedy Ann and Andy, described not only simple cartoon versions of babies that made them more convincing, but real dyes, floppy and darned (at least in a visual sense). The animation brings us two different personalities who control both sides, followed by a silent film with Sir Leonard Looney, and, of course, the shameless Knees with Camel, who goes with greedy. <br /> <br /> The heroic animation is perhaps the most subtle psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There is something about this animation, which ensures the jaw drops - and every second is something new. Living in a place called "Taffy Pit" is an open, living massive swallow and eats desserts strongly. <br /> <br /> She reads a poem for me, but I can not help but have felt some sexual weakness, and then Raggedy Annnies is trying to kill her candy. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint about this movie. There is a constant shutdown of the movie, with six of them. There are about six good songs (I have only one), including "I'm looking at what I see?", "No girl's toys" and "blue"), "I'll never do it", "I love you" and maybe " I am home. " <br /> <br /> This is a strange movie weird weird, but if it's what you are looking for, you will not find it better.
