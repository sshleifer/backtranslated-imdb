I participated in this movie, because there was a novel series that was not released from Blockbuster and it was necessary to have something to do as soon as the store was ready to shut down. The flat white cover and hood interest me. I'm a (relatively speaking) "old" lady and my son's 30-year-old. I like movies that featured interviews with Sixth Sense, Vampire, Harry Potter and Beetlejuice. My son, on the other hand, is a film graduate and has very special foreign films, such as those directed by Bergman or Hertzog. We generally hate each other's movie selection, but we both watched and did not love the movie! It was different from any movie we've seen before. We are both kinical and critical personality types, and we usually deliver them to movies while watching them - but in the end, we laughed at the movie and enjoyed it. In our opinion, if this film was nominated and featured in major US theater theaters, it would have done very well.
