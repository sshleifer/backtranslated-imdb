<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> About this movie really is not much to say .... but not fun. <br /> <br /> Project description (from IMDB) _____________________________________ <br /> </ b> Two losers from Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone), using baseball rules for basketball invented a new game playing. The game is a great success, with the help of billionaires, the Professional Baseketball League, where everyone has the same share and can not change cities. Coop & Remer team, Milwaukee Beers, Dallas Felons (Vaughn) is the only team that is on track for major rule changes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although I'm not a big fan of Southpark, Parker and Stone are doing a very good job in their first real movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny moments in this movie that I can not approach the name of everyone. This actually does nothing, and they are not trying to put a lot of strange drama to make it even more serious. <br /> <br /> My favorite side of this movie: The Soundtrack. GREAT. Especially like "Take me on" and "Beer" by Reel Big Fish. <br /> <br /> Generally, a raw but very funny movie. 10/10 <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
