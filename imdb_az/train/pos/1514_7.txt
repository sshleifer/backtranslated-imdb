This highly effective part of the British horror, coupled with all the Hammer's stars, is around a house, and history stories are in search of an abusive actor by telling the story to a Scottish detective. <br /> <br /> Probably one of the four worst-hit stories, a writer and spouse dealing only with home, and horror novels that are planning to stay in a short time. He creates a demented character called Dominic, which is a very creepy-looking messenger, and he's crazy when he's starting to see a man looking at it everywhere soon. After agreeing to seek out psychiatric help, a sub-plan, clearly presented, did not really work for me. <br /> <br /> The next story (in my opinion best) star has been moved home to Peter Cushing's scholarship year and is soon recognized as Philip Grayson. Its a way to find a wax figure that looks like a woman from the past is very close to a museum of a candle (which deals with macabre). In the following period, an old friend (who has a history with that woman) falls to see and work in the city. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of her husband's friends, Story, one of my favorites, is three years ... Christopher Lee, After returning home with her own daughter, Jane, the employer's daughter-in-law, Reid, is very suspicious of burying her daughter. He would say if Lee knew what he was doing, he would have understood. <br /> <br /> The last story was a very light hearted vampire with John Pertwee and Ingrid Pittin stars. After buying a mysterious merchant, actor Paul Henderson sees that he has become a very active person in his career several times. <br /> <br /> In general, the pacing and the direction were very good, the performances as well as the most. There was a nice Gothic touches and there was an impressive score that complement the air. It comes from a goalkeeper and a high yield.
