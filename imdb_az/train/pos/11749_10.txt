Finally, we get a television series to see the actor's ability! One of the episodes was excellent! The screenplay gave us a little more, yes, again, "I'm not your father, my father and my son deceived me!" but the script has enabled actors to feel and experience true feelings. <br /> <br /> The camera job also gave us a little extra, there were no dull shots from the recurring angles over the clock, yet unnecessary 'artistic' shadows in the shooting to capture an image required us and some beautiful scenery <br /> <br /> Nothing was really dramatic or melodramatic real people in a real place dealing with real situations, nothing was really dramatic in the drama, it was a real actor and a very realistic Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, the channel's ten and all cast and crew work fine! Your efforts are highly appreciated and do not go unnoticed, and it's a relief to let our country see how talented our act is when given a real opportunity! !!
