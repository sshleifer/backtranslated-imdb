When I got to video, I saw Grace Saving. It has been one of my favorite ever since! The field is not particularly intricate, but it does not go away from entertainment. This comedy is full of moments and it has a very pleasing quality. Cartoons make the film very good. Each of them has their own quirky attributes that add to humor, the two-year-old lady, starring Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law, goes to bed. The perfect move was all done, especially by Brenda Blythe. He and Craig Ferguson were somewhere in the same place pulling out some funnier moments. If you are looking for a good comedy, I would definitely recommend this movie!
