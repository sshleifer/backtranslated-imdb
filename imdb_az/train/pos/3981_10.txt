This is my third-fourth Joe McDoakes short I've seen and so far the most funny one. However, Joe receives sound from a note that recognizes Charles Boyer and Ronald Colman. It's Warner Bros. When he went to his studio (a company that was behind this row), he asked Jack Carson to get directions from both of them. He then faces with George O'Hanlon (also McDoakes), who is no longer far from his next Geroge Jetson and speaks with his normal voice, where he is automatically dispatched to the director's anger. I'll stop there and say just how funny it is, and I am amazed by the movie star's enthusiasts near the end. The last scene, especially in the note, was such a note that if you want to be at Picutres, let's go to YouTube!
