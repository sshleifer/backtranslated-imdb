Cheech and Chong are a typical evidence of drugs, singing, more medicine, cars and driving, more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, petrol, laundry, comedy, surprisingly more medicines and the fact that it faces SPACE COKE! It's not as convenient or acceptable as the Dumanda Up, but it's still incredibly funny, as strangely as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes that include the opening scene where they give some gas to their car and drill works. Also the Czech song (Mexican Americans) and Chongun's follow-up song are funny. Another important scene is the Jones (human noise driving) and the Police Academy series and the old laughing man. In general, this is a major pursuit of the Dumas and is sober or inadequate. <br /> <br /> - Celluloid Rehab
