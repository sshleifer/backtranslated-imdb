"Cut" is a full-fledged parody of the slasher genre and basically does it. Most of the standard slasher clicks are available; <br /> <br /> Sexually explicit house, forest, anonymous unmanaged serial killer, fishing boats and, of course, couples who are sexually active (this is not a spoiler). <br /> <br /> It's the essence: the film-school bases set out to complete the "masterpiece" of the unfinished slasher, which has not yet ended with a few murders of the castle. This is also neat - okay, messily - the loss of Kylie Minogue on the first reel. The original film, starring Molly Ringwald, totally stuck to one of the survivors, because they all get good lines. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> The film is so fast It's very little time to try to figure out who the killer is for acting. Perhaps there is a low budget view, including some unusual adjustments deliberately thought out. There is also a good soundtrack. If this movie is difficult, it will decide whether or not this film is sent to the slasher genre. Probably a bit of both.
