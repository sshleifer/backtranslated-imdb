I'm a great classic movie buff, but I'm in silent movies. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines are just wonderful in this way. <br /> <br /> Davies are one of the biggest stars of the Silent period, because the students are returning to one of the small town girls with a tower approaching one another. The film immediately drew my attention, and in fact I forgot that it was a silent movie. <br /> <br /> A perfect introduction to silent films is to show people. <br /> <br /> People say that it's a perfect introduction to silent films. One of the best stars in the silent era is a fast, exciting movie. Add and show on Hollywood's line All classic movies should be on the 'must-do' list.
