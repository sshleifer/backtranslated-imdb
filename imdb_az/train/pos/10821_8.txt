I also saw it after being released in '56 and I was shot in the last scene since then. If this is the answer to 'High Noon', it will be appropriate and will respond. Starting this string, the concept of "City is coming together" is a message that is stronger than the "Noon High's Noone" heroism. In this regard, "Concho" is a pioneer of the phenomenon of "The Seven Legends", which is one of my other all-time friends. Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing speeches, especially turning Sinatra's kidnapped children into urban transformation. I just hope that all the friends and family who have given me my love for this film for many years will be able to live for themselves.
