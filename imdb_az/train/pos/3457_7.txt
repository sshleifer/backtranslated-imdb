This is Columbo, which began in the early days of Steven Spilberger's career. It's not a thing without this scenario, but in this movie there may be many good things to come to Spielberg. The film is basically the same as Spierlberg's more than 70 movies and television creations. So, some symbols show some strangeness and not just talk about the character of Columbo. Perhaps the best in the 1975 Spilberg movie is the characteristic kind of greed that can be seen in the "Jaws" movie. However, in addition to some of the typical early Spilberg elements, this is a great example of a rising filmmaker. <br /> <br /> This movie started in a really good and very encouraging way, but after a nice opening, the film was slower than ever, and it was boring to watch. <br /> <br /> This crime itself was quite capable and, according to his own understanding, most of the book, which does not have real memorable moments, is Columbo. a criminal-minded writer has shown some great and exciting potential by killing a writer. The story really did not investigate all the possibilities. At least this movie has left me. <br /> <br /> The film is still a good movie thanks to the character Jack Cassidey, who is thinking of Columbus for his mystery / murder, and he tries to give him all the possible instructions. Of course Columbo knows well and is the first to suspect the first, but it plays as usual. <br /> <br /> The film has a good style and uses some nice camera position and editing. <br /> <br /> It is great to see Spielberg's subsequent works, especially with some camera angles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Beautiful,
