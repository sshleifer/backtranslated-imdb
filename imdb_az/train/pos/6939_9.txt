I was very impressed with this movie. I have to consider it as one of the better classical eras. I say that for everything: an active, mature dialogue, an unsatisfactory story and a perfect movie. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann, a filmmaker who has shot several good pictures around this period, is like the West. It has the same movie-noir look. Mann and Jimmy Stewart worked in many western times during this period. . If you love this movie, I recommend Mann-Stewart to "The Blood of the River". <br /> <br /> In summary, this story is "Lin McAdam" (Stewart) prestigious Winchester 73 rifle, a fair and square-winning weapon in a contest. After the kidnapping, he goes through desperation. <br /> <br /> This interesting story of Stewart is Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. All are entertaining to watch. But Rock Hudson stretched out to see playing a Hindu ("Young Bull"), but not everything.
