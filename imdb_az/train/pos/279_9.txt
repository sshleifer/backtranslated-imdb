I love playing this game as if you could leap from your seat. When hit, you need to remember that the screen's leap and turn-off method is also very realistic, and it's just a game and it's not really there. Sound effects and sounds are fine. There are many weapons and various spells to carry, and you can choose which spells to be even stronger. You get to this stone you can beat enemies while rebuilding mana to blow up enemies with more spells. The best part is to fear that all the time you are playing really splashes and can be hidden behind the next corner or behind. If you want to get the full experience, you can play with headphones.
