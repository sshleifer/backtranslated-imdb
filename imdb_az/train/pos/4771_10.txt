Two brilliant career zeniti. David Lynch, well-known for less accessible materials, prepares an elegant and delicate story in the most difficult moment. A man travels to see his brother outside. If you do not use other vehicles, you will take it for six weeks at a lawn mower when traveling. Richard Farnsworth presents his striking, seductive and nuanced performance in his latest film. The little things are awesome in a terrific way, with Straight Story, a classic cinema that should not be missed. Sissy Spacek, like Farnsworth's daughter, draws the attention of a middle-aged woman who lives with her children's disappearance.
