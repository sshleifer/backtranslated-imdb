NB: Spoiler inside. This great movie is a great many things that successfully accomplish: science travel, unstable psychology, dystopia, what is real syndrome, gradual destruction of faith systems, world bio-terrorism and newborn love story <br /> /> The impact of the story's twisted line of timeline increases the burden of hot discussions - this site testifies to the debate; or extreme degree, check the dissertation at www.mjyoung.net/time/monkeys.html. I dont know! Such a temporal emphasis is largely a shrewd one, not of the great writer David and Janet Peoples, but of the inspiration of Chris Marker's La Jetee. No doubt, this story is one of the most successful, attractive time travel movies. But there are many other levels that speak here. <br /> <br /> The true genius of the movie is to focus on the bad side effects of James Cole (Bruce Willis, the best work of his career) in his mind's journey. Does his trip go from a gung-ho vaccine-hunting warrior to an untrained frog? and return again. The story is another large broom James and Dr. Kathryn emphasizes more personal tale between Railly (beautiful Madeleine Stowe). I love the ideas of these two characters at the same time changing / opposite. Everything that happens to me stands in the room. According to this point, James? once with a steady decline? now gives rise to doubts about his own reality; Dr. Railly? cool and rational scientist? Finally, after winning James's testimony, he was terrified with his terrible predictions. <br /> <br /> Gilliam cares about these heroes, especially through the krescendo that embodies their lives. Emotionally roller-coaster balancing between the fantastic puzzle / thriller making the assembly is delicate. And at the airport, lies are heart-poundingly tight because we see it clear through James's sleep. Is the community here after deciding to quit all confusion? and his arguments more and more often than ever? he step back up to the tile and do what is necessary for humanity. Jose and see the gun? (Previously, Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and references to personality disorders are shining.) This is a film that will be raised among the people who think; it requires them, not recurring ideas. <br /> <br /> "Twelve Monkeys" is intelligent, provocative, strange, funny and durable. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt, stealing all the scenes and showing great flexibility as Jeffery Goine, but can not be saved. And David Peters (like David Navse's as Christopher Plummer and Dr Goines are excited about leaving his bad motivation just to watch the movie). However, the biggest charges belong to Terry Gilliam - it's just his famous "Brazil". (Many parallels, of course, are the only warrior who wants to get rid of his arrogant environment, in particular: lunacy, without lunacy.) Each frame of this film has its unique stamp and tone. <br /> <br /> This is one of the greatest achievements of the 90s, and I'm sure it's a real favorite for a long time.
