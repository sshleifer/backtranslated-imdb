For the first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was first of all to me. I'm expected to have a gore fest, but instead have a cold soundtrack with my head (I have a call right now: P) to watch a highly intelligent killer mixed. When I killed, I could not predict and disappeared in my book. The horror films I learned were overwhelmed by me. Now, I know that storyline is some sort of discrepancies, but if you're one of them, you'll be witnessing a movie that's going to take a long time before the end of the movie and when you're sleeping on the bed. Finally, as I have noted, the soundtrack is endless. This is one of my favorite theater scores all the time, so Rob Zombie does not resemble him. Talking about reconstruction, I read a multilateral paper about it, and now I know that Mr. Zombie respects John Carpenter, and he has great hopes for this classic world. This movie has a desire for a spinal heart failure at any given time, but it's the perfect addition, opening, finale, for all Hallow Eve movie marathons. :)
