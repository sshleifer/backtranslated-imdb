An excellent film showing the grief of the old lady in two buds. Together, they did not differ. Regularly, sometimes at the same time, covered the past and re-covered it; and what happens when it comes to woulda. I sometimes laughed at myself, but I have long seen how these two women were so sad and abandoned. See it.
