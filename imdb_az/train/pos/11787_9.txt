It's just a short movie from David Lynch, but it's all about "Lynchian Items" for just 8 minutes! It is mysterious, dark, impartial, heartfelt and strange; and there is such a little scary before you start talking to the blonde girl! Soundtrack is exclusively for creating a strange atmosphere, because it is bad and dirty? <br /> <br /> There were no "traditional" red curtains on the setting itself, but placed purple-painted walls, which ensures the equal effect of eeriness. <br /> <br /> She was in contact with a girl locked in a dark room and cried for help; then comes another girl who begins to talk mysteriously, saying that she is there because of her guilt? Do not know what happens or what happens next? a good Lynch movie ended, unresolved and surprisingly ended! <br /> <br /> Despite some amateur players, this is a great short. Girls are professional actresses, but I think their player would be better in this short time.
