Robert Taylor, the most characteristic bumper buffalo hunter in this film, is like Charlie Gilson. From the beginning, I was thinking about getting out of Charlie's The Searcher or James Stewart, like John Wayne at The Naked Spur. However, as the film goes with Gilson, it feels more gloomy than it ever understands that there is no hope for it. Stewart Granger, Sandy McKenzie, who was about to stop hunting, understood that the buffalos were going very soon and were surprised by the killing. Gilson is a natural murderer who does not make any difference between animals or humans. Debra Paget, as an Indian girl, is strikingly taking into account the censorship it has applied to at that time. He hates Gilson, even though he wants Gilson. The frozen Gilson's last scene is unforgettable.
