Amicus is approaching more than half of these horrific anthologies in the 70s, and this is one of the best efforts by leading fear writer Robert Bloch. There are four stories, both of which are valuable, but two - "Sweets for Sweets" and "Methods for Murder" - distinguish themselves as frightening journeys. <br /> <br /> Candy, Christopher Lee's lovely lady (Chloe Franks) plays an impatient widow who is due to her indifference and intolerance, so she plays a voodoo puppet with her horrors. Franks is a very bad bad guy, and in The Innocents, Martin Stephens presents one of the biggest children's performances in a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The "killing method" is linked to a fear novelist (Denholm Elliott), one of his creators, creepy Dominic. This episode draws attention with its simplicity and dark terror. Dominic can or can not be real, so director Peter Duffell plays with our expectations. <br /> <br /> Dominik's short pictures of a pond, and a ghostly fantasy, are really exciting. <br /> <br /> The original poster art that reflects the skeleton figure covering a tray that holds Peter Cushing's slaughtered head is a great deal of effort for points that are scary.
