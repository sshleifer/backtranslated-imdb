Tintin and I recently had PBS P.O.V. I performed as an episode. series. From 1971, one of the creators of Tetin, Georges Remi a.k. Herge discusses his famous character, first of all the various experiences he has published in the Catholic newspaper, and then in his comic books. Terrific images of various comic pages and surreal copies of Herge's dreams. When I read the secrets of Unicorn in the first local school library, I met Tintin at the Digest Digest pages. My mother bought a subscription CD and read Red Rackham's Treasure in 1978 every month. I remember seeing Tintin's comic books later in a local bookstore, but for some reason I was thinking of leaving 12 and I was leaving them. Six years after Heggin's death, he has a book written and compiled by J. Daniels in 1989. You have not read it yet. This film also covers the artist's personal life, since his first spouse left after his relationship with a painting (later married). His name is Fanny and he meets here. If you love Tintin and his creator, this movie is definitely worth a look. Update: 9/4/07 - Now I'm reading Free Breaking Free. Tintin and Captain are the only regular characters appearing here, and these are in line with Mr. Daniels' Tintin's ideas of capitalism, which are described as a whistle-blowing chip in his shoulder, but remain with him. The Captain here is just trying to meet a girl and a girl who loves her. A worker employee of his spouse and other construction workers promises to strike after the accident as a result of an accident. The whole job is broken by a cockney accent on the working class in England. Herge is not something, but you can still read an interesting one. Oh, yes, the dog Snowy looks just over the top left corner of the Tintin running on the police and covering page.
