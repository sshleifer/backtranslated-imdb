Yes, this is a B-class horror. But at least manufacturers, directors and stones are the flicker of man from the sky. The area is dark, a psychotic serial killer in the path of execution, splashes with genetic acid that makes a snowman. Snowman a. Jack Frost continues to murder to find the little town sheriff who has finally arrested him. With a limited budget, the crew was forced to give limited special effects, most of the money was spent on the snowman's suit. Particullary is driven by difficult shoots, cartooning or shooting shots (shutter that moves to hide camera camera details). <br /> <br /> This is not a child's movie and should not be mixed with the same Disney movie. If your kids do not let their kids watch the pg-13 movies alone to prevent their children from watching this movie. This film has two fame. 1. Famous Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) played the first big role. Jack Frost's attacks Shannon Elizabeth has to watch for a couple of times. 2. This movie has the worst snowman joke. This joke is so bad that directors can get their credits to the credit list.
