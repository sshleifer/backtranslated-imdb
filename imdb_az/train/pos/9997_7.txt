Life Stinks (1991) was another step below Mel Brooks's other production. He meets with stars as a rich man who earns a bare bet with his "friends". Brooks claims that she lives like a homeless person for a month. His shocking and entertaining friends take on this unusual game. While staying at Bowery, he responds to a number of homeless people, one of whom holds his own dream (Lesley-Ann Warren). While living on the street, he learns a great deal of advice when he teaches him. Does Mary Brooks live on her own without luxury delights? Will it make an unusual bet? Who are his true friends? <br /> <br /> This film is unfairly charged. Of course, it's not as classic as its previous movies, it's still fun. I loved that Mel Brooks respects Charles Chaplin in this film. If you watch Chapel's previous silent movies, you will also get humor. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
