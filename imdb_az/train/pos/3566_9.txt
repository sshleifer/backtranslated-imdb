In 1954 Marlon Brando Streetcar was a hot actor after Named Desire and The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra had not yet invented himself on the silver screen. However, as described by Sinatra's former Nathan Detroit, he helped restore Sinatra with his fans. <br /> <br /> A great screen version of a great game and the choice of potential and support players is terrific. Think of a movie that Brando read? As Sky Masterson describes, this was one of his only plays. Moreover, women's leaders, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (repeating the role of Nathan's long-drawn lover Adelade), have made their preference. With a special mention of all the great Stubby Kaye (like Nicely Nicely) and Eric Clapton, Rockin 'The Boat no version comes close to Stubby's. The Danny Thomas Show and Shelton Leonard, BSPulley, hard-working and rude speaking "Great Julie", and even Regis Toomey's "Brother Arvide", which can be credited as television producers as Miracle at Harry At The Horse, as well as Dick Van Dyke's show suggest. <br /> <br /> One of the good comedy and entertaining music you see is Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck Make a Lady Tonight" and brother ... "It's a dice"
