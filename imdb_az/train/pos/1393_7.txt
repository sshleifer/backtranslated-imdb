Perhaps the most strange installments of the first season, 'Shore Leave' have a downhill decline; some parts are dragged too long and others are cut off, but they can not duplicate everything, but they dump the father's kitchen to make this fun episode. Kirk and the crew are resting, relaxing, and so on when the term of office is extended. It seems to have found a perfect planet for seafaring after leaving it to anyone in need. Looks like there is a perfect place for all intentions and goals, a beautiful scenery and an ideal climate. It is the first indication that everything can be a little hesitant. When Makko leads the lead team, he gets a stain after a big tree lick wearing a vest of Alice (Wonderland). Kirk is fluttering down and tells others that they are facing unique events and encounters. All this is a common thing that every crew thinks about the person / place he / she has discovered before discovering. It does not immediately sink to Kirk or anyone else. More strangers, Don Juan, Siberian tiger, WW2 fighter jet, and so on. Kirk gets acquainted with Ruth, a beautiful old girlfriend (of course) and Finnegan from the Academy days. The exploration / fight scene with Finnegan is very long, at the same time, McCoy passes through a hill with a horseman and appears to have been killed. Finally, an old man looks and explains what happened. The planet is a future 'amusement park' to conceive of something in the future. Nothing is permanent; McCoy is not really dead. After explaining this, Kirk decides to give the beach permission for everyone. Despite a "dream of life", Shore Leave holds an episode of the first degree of Star Trek's first season.
