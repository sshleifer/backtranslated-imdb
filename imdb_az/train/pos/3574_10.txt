Sometimes it is difficult to say how effective a movie is. From the moment I came across Stone Boy for the first time, something said I would be a big movie. Nevertheless, it seemed very difficult for me to really have the opportunity to see myself. One day, when I was watching the online catalog of my local public library, they bought the DVD version of this movie. <br /> <br /> Cinematographers are extremely pleased that cinematography has a stunning depth and quality that can never repeat an ancient VHS copy. <br /> <br /> The most striking aspect of this film, when talking about cinematography. I am strongly convinced that, as a photographer who follows a very clear visual style shown in "The Stone Boy," I can strongly believe that the great cinematographer can hold the film alone. Here is a very talented player and a guide who understands the story perfectly. But behind every camera is Juan Ruiz Anchia makes every scene a thing of beauty. And almost never. Most movies will not wait for such a thing. <br /> <br /> Christopher Gain has a long and interesting career. As far as I can find, this movie is not so much. However, sometimes there is a real subtle spell that will be found to capture a director near the beginning of his career before all the big budgets and focus on the focus. Cain takes a step back in this movie, everything is a life and then it happens. Like the early John Sayles films, it takes time to breathe and talk with characters. Side stories happen for what they do and how life is. <br /> <br /> In this film, Cain demonstrates the remarkable, raw, and even painful insight of human nature. <br /> <br /> Most of this story works. When people talk, they act as real people when they are in this movie and play the remaining characters. Gina Berriurtsin's author, Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Frederic Forrest, lends itself to loyal and esteemed actors, just as much as possible. <br /> <br /> When looking at a great soundtrack from past gamers or a James Horner, do they mean little or no significance? it seems strange that such a movie is forgotten. Perhaps, what does "The Stone Boy" do? It's a shocking fact that in the 1970's, my childhood was deeply remembered. People are talking about 80s in terms of modern styles and music, but they are not 80 or 80 years old. The appearance of the images, the simplicity of the actor, and the general outcome of the actor should be in the skin of any person raised in North America during this period or approaching. I see myself in this regard. How did I see the world? "Black Ayyol" (1979), "Black Ayyash" (1979), "Never Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercies (1983), New Testament (1983), Heart (1984), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), Miss Daisy (1989), Roan Inish's Secret (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008)
