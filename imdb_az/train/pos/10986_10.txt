On Sunday we slammed into the "Gray Gardens" documentary on Sunday and "we're asking" without warning. Everyone entering the room, on the television and Edith and Edie's naked ghostly shelter, practically living in a room, eating ice-cream and corn dumplings (cooked in this bedroom) - cats, edith beds and his incredible words, I'm fine on him.
