John Van Druten Broadway hit is a star of a modern witch who has created a successful Manhattan publisher, in this romantic fantasy, with the greatest star power. James Stewart can get the best billing, but Kim Novak, who stole the show, is one of the most attractive witches to show the movie. In fact, pairing is actually one of the weaknesses of the film: it's a little old for gray hair Stewart, and it's easy to see why it is difficult for Nova, but it's hard to understand what it's all about, because it's not their temper and outlook. Stivart-Novak's pairing will create more heat at Vertigo, which left the film in the same year, but it could also benefit from the management of Alfred Hitchcock, as in the film, Vertigo. <br /> <br /> Many of the comic moments of the film are like a well-known writer, Jack Lemmon (as his brother's linen brother), Elsa Lanchester (their ditzy aunt) and Ernie Kovacs (!). Hermione Gingold even shows you as a charming hell in a charming congregation. This film has a lot of love - mind, romance and a great cast - probably you will get from Miss Novak, who is very fond of you. I've seen the movie a few times and I can never do it.
