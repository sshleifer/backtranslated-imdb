This supernatural Peter Weir thriller is one of the most haunting and exciting films ever seen. Richard Chamberlain is accused of murdering a group of young Aborigins who see his best performance here as an Australian lawyer. As he approaches the case, the main suspect is more about Kris and more about himself. Chris says he is a Mulkurul, a supernatural creature race in Australia thousands of years ago. <br /> <br /> The above-mentioned high rain has confirmed the Aboriginal prophecy of the LAST DAVER that will sow the world. <br /> <br /> The imagination and the supernatural effect of this film further enhance this movie and this is a great experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil support roles, as well as Charlie, left with a challenging title playing an ancient Aboriginal, which can turn into an owl. Walking and ending is not the opposite of many other exciting thrillers that fall after a promising hour. But this can not be called a pure tension. It also speaks about a drama and spirituality and moral personalities in the modern world. A masterpiece developed by the visual stunning drama master Peter Weir.
