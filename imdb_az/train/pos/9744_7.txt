"Yes, Georgio" is a lightweight and enjoyable movie / comedy featuring beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie that I've been seeing repeatedly. While some reviewers wished to get acquainted with Pavarotti, they would probably be better served by an opera DVD. Although the opera Pavarotti's operative talent is better represented, it sometimes demands opera suits and has stories that completely hide the appearance and nature of man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> After many attempts, the story was incredible; I agree. Gorgeous talented people can be both self-styled and attractive - attractive to attract smart and beautiful people. In addition, people who are very different from each other often get insights on themselves and grow up in a positive way from interacting with those who are extending or leading them to areas they have not chosen. Both Georgio and Pamela are more open to areas that are not investigated where they are not in contact with others. <br /> <br /> Let yourself be relaxed and at Pavarotti's vocal talent and get to the award-winning film. Only Puccini's scenes ending with Turandot are the time to go there.
