I saw this movie in Turner yesterday and could not guess how long it would take, though it did not begin to be watched. Farrell was great in his role and everyone did a super job. Some had to extend the boundaries, but I loved all this! If you have a chance to see it, please do so! I really cried on a few scenes, but you're the mother. Loretta was very nice and, no matter what my mother was, I was just as surprised that she was premature. I say, if you know, do not listen to criticisms. They laughed like we said, we cried! I loved her thoroughly!
