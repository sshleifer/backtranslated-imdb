I discover that ABC has abandoned another show that has a chance to become a real winner. This show is very good, the story and story was great, it was a true original idea for a show instead of another dull reality show. Casting was awesome! Not just the characters and actors, it's a very talented actor group. The concept and the idea are a really new and cool idea for a TV show, many of us share the idea of ​​"contact." I love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But I do not want to be honest about this show, even a few episodes (eg Sheri Appleby). The actor and characters are very easy and very talented !!. I wish ABC did more than this show and did not cut half of the show, as well as enough ads. Truthlessly unfair! to everyone!!. This show has a great promise. I know for somebody how the ABC feels and how it will continue to send me emails to keep it alive. Please join me and I know I can do it. Jerico worked for it. (By the way, has 13 episodes? I like the latest show!). Please support this support and email ABC, we can do that! This is worth the show!
