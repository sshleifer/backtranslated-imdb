The magic works in a mysterious way. The film about four detainees captured prior to captivity was a very secretive tension, written by another captive, a striking end and many tension a century ago. Though something is a theater play (almost everything happens in the cell), it never drill and it was moving very well. According to the Cube tradition, you have been trapped with characters and even criminals, but some have felt some sympathy but change their minds because you repeat your story. Some events took you from the guard and always touched a madness in the air. It was absolutely intense and fun, and as I did not expect (a friend hired), it was a pleasant surprise!
