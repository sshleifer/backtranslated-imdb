Everyone will see and hear one of the best music concerts. I grew up when My All My Lovin was new, and it was the power of Sir P Mc to save any crowd at any age to hear him again by the original artist today. This doco goes behind the scenes to guide us to the paths of everyone, not just to the group. I saw this guy living in Aussie in 1935, and we can do less than what he did about the DVD about 30 years ago. I have a great 5.1 surround sound system that performs this justice, and I especially recommend a Beatles fan. This is the closest place to the Beatles concert today. Singer, Songwriter, lead / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, pure genius. There is little entertainment that can stand alone and hold the masses in one tool. If you want the perfect music, buy a studio written CD. If you want to hear raw music talent and spontaneously from the crowd, this DVD is for you with all the excitement and emotions of the crowd.
