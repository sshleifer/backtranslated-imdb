"Match Point" and now "Scoop" also denied me that Woody Allen did not do the right thing in England to correct movies (Scarlett Johansson, a member of the right cast), but proven by what I know: attention to neurotic rich New Yorkers. In this case, Johansson plays a student journalist Sondra Pransky. The magician met with his murdered reporter, Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), in Sid Vitoren (Allen), telling him that the dragged serial crime was committed by millioneer Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). So, he knows it and ... well, I can not tell you without giving it up. But we can say that this is probably the funniest movie of Allen in years. <br /> <br /> So, you've been convinced that you love this movie. If nothing else, this will make you laugh with London. But basically, it's not very damn funny. Even if you do not like Woody Allen, you should love it.
