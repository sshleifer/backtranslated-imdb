After seeing this movie for the third time, I think it is almost the man's worst movie PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS POOR. Dickie is so funny when the boat is thrown (hair <br /> Adam Sandler fans </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie has no depth and a decent storyline and deserves to be under the 100s.
