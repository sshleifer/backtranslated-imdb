The car is pulled from the windshield, someone plays the last songs, someone else does not react, for noise. I just wondered how it was done. There were so many scenes I wondered how this camera would be. If the scenes that the Warhols entered in the BJM post-party were true, then that was the indispensable exploitation of the maximum, or was it an illogical thing to do, but if that were the point? Because of this film, I was interested in how it draws images. It's a ghastly portrait of a terrible gem of money, all of us believe in ourselves.
