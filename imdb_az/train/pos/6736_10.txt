The Riding Giants are a brilliant documentary that deepens into one of the world's most valued sports and brings more people and emotionally to just the surface of Stacy Peralta. Everything, from the structure to the footage of a beautiful outfit, even enhanced the beauty and power behind the sporting style of the film. All the surf movies I have seen (Infinite Summer, Billabong Odyssey and Lycia Asan) were consistent and relevant. Starting from an early age of surfing (a short history lesson), which goes on a ridiculous trip to Lairdin, the Riding Giants are more concerned with the soul, spirit and spirit of sport than other documentary films. How does it do it? <br /> <br /> For the beginning of this film was a structured votemaker. In other films I've seen about surfing, you sometimes find yourself jumping from new people to new people, wave waves, event events, why and without someone you know? Riding Giants, we have very small boilers and beginners. This really allows each one to go deeper into the idea. Additionally, instead of being dragged into waves, we have compared more history and more personal outlook beforehand. It really attracts me to this movie. Instead of showing all these great waves (because he is a great wave film), we listen to the stories and see what these surfers have gained to achieve these waves. I liked the information about the "beach bums" or the horse surfing. I still have Greg Noll and her early adventures inclining deep blue with incredible tales. Then he added more fuel to the fire, telling him what had happened in the eyes of the person who saw him. The simple structure that Peralta will follow has allowed me to watch and walk more closely with more sports than previous movies. <br /> <br /> Peralta is very emotionally and passionate about what these courageous people are and do not be surprised by where the sport is going. <br /> <br /> A strong and creative cinematography will be added to a clean structure. they came to a perfect cinema. Using the latest techniques I've seen in Kid, it remains in the picture, the Giants feel like they skip the Figures screensaver. Even though you do not have a 3D, you have a flat feeling that you get when you put two pictures on one another. He worked in this movie. He created the depths of the scenes and was not really shocked (human beings are bigger) and added to the dangers facing these children. If these were wrecked or maneuvered differently, these waves would have killed them. Some of them died, but did not stop the sport. He made more excitement and more passion for doing better. <br /> <br /> This is the love of the ocean and sport that leads to my last point. <br /> Human element. Many of my previous adventures in the world of surfing have left me with beautiful waves, but very few people. Films knew that people were watching for waves, so a wave of waves and possibly a few minutes would go. This film was directly opposed. Peralta still gave us the waves and created this masterpiece, but paid more attention to the immortal question that surfers and so on. Those who flee from their minds, those who force them to go further, and the bonds that form there on wild blue sideways. After watching this movie, I just did not know much about the great wave surfing, and I thought about the emotional side of the sport. <br /> <br /> This is an unsustainable element in other films, and has brought the Riding Giants to a new level of personality. <br /> <br /> In general, this film was brilliant. I have always had a passionate, loyalty and love affair with a sticky film. From start to finish, I was amazed. <br /> <br /> This film won the Oscars for the best documentary and would be happy to see a new revival in the world of surfing and to open more doors for these nature movies.
