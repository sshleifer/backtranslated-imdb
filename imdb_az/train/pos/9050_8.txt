This is something that is intended for everything, a true part of America. If you have been programmed to stand up for "exciting" stories, just stay away from it and leave the rest of the world to the taste. And the frost on the cake is really exquisite, based on the true truth, there is no need to change the details to make a compact story based on a rich story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest live actors and the main father he describes is also a complicated, self-confident, low-lane goodness can only be successfully eradicated by someone with skill and thought. Simple thoughtful interpretations, perhaps, perhaps may be that he may not be able to go out and not accept the father who is trying to break the law, and not the writer or the actor, but the restriction of the commentator. This is not gentle and simple.
