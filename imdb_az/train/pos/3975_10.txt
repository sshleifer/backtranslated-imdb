If you lived in the 60's, this movie is sometimes painful and may be quite happy at other times. It's all there, but small print on opposite civilization tables, which are contrary to the majority. These are the roots of a social revolution that still plays: "Do not talk too soon for the wheel does not rot, because they change." Although the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and has been broadcast at that time, it is a great legend that contributes to intellectual development, engineers, scientists, and hyper-hyperactivity of computer-related activities. A greeting from a craftsman there - you've had a better time than I've ever seen before.
