Call me a teenager, but I really think it's a great team. If you do not have the opportunity to experience some of the latest episodes of the latest Star Trek series, I have to follow this one. Probably more attractive than the Voyager's Caretaker, which began with the Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are totally different, but we get strangely acquainted ... Music is very attractive. No real Sci-fi fan can ever come up with at least one Star Trek episode - these installments are worth the wait.
