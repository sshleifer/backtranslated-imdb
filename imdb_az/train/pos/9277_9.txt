"The movie is dead, live for a long time!" Peter Greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors in the Tuna Delta, received the third edition of the Romanian Anonimul Film Festival last year. This year, Cafar Panahi's "Ofsayt" team was directed. I have not seen this evening in Bucharest at the retrospective of the festival. The movie is dead, but still very lively. Panahi's film explicitly explains how the Iranian society looks. Digitally filmed, "Offside" Panahi's daughter is an event inspired by a real-life event: When she decided to join a soccer match, she took the risk and anxiety. It is banned in Iran as we are informed. Transforming Panahi into a few tools, probably, is to provide a great deal of work, intelligence, and magnificent culture in a society that puts women at a different level. The absurdity of the law is funny. The film has a happy ending, as the Iranian team goes to the World Cup. The most important thing was the concept behind this movie. And I would also like to see other Panah's ban on Iran. I think he can think of an activist director.
