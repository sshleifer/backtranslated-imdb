Spoilers! <br /> <br /> I wanted to see this from the moment I saw this movie at a glance with a local movie critic 10:00 news. I do not remember whose identity, or the review of the local Omaha broadcasting, the critic thought it was too sleazy to go to church church Nebraska. They showed a piece from the place where John Glover was missing from Ann-Margret when swimming in the pool. Glover's character, using the many words that are necessary to edit the local municipality, is so beautiful and so is his body. I was hooked. Although there was a problem. At that time, I was only 13 years old and had to wait one year until the cable came out. Let's say it was worth the wait! <br /> <br /> If that's my fault, this is the movie. It would be a great understatement to call this movie sleazy. The film stands around a successful businessman who blackmailed at least three times after a job with a small woman. As usual, Roy Scheider plays a poor man who wants only a little bump and now gets into the mercy of the three terrible cunning. John Glover's character is one of the most memorable pigeons of all time. She is often on the edge of doing something ridiculous, sometimes crazy. After that, Robert Trebor (a beautiful name, by the way!) Characterized Leo with his blackmail scheme. She is a coward, sweating, coward who runs a peep show place with live naked models. Then you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy, a baby boy who is all afraid of good reason. <br /> <br /> Who will forget the call to Vanity with the giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After dealing with the first shock he understood to be opposed to Sheikh, Sheer turns the tables on these reptiles and the situation, that is, after Glover's spouse! The clash struck nearly all shooting, raped or brutally played, as it had been blown up. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I like this movie very much. It really should make me drag, but not. Perhaps these characters are all interesting and most of the story has many chances to see today. For adults the movie industry is probably scared to think that there are more than just a few characters flying around Laura Glover. Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me jumble. <br /> <br /> This film shoots, cool cars, great dialogues (like my opening statement) and decent moves. Real life comes abundantly by the porn stars. Ron Jeremy, shouting at a party scene at Glover on a hot wind with two chickens. <br /> <br /> I need to add another thing: how hot are women in this movie? Amazing! Wow! Travolta deservedly won Kelly Preston's marriage. Yum! Before we become a Christian, we see that Vanity has been naked for a while. And Ann-Margret. What else can you say about him? <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> So Hound says. <br /> <br /> February 14, 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
