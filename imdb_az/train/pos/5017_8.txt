I was 15 years old when this movie was released on television. As I grew up in Texas, I understood the boredom and monotony of teenage life. This film touched my young impression, and I am glad that I have been in the last 12 years. Recently, we looked at LOVE channel 2, 3 and 4 times. I still cry, because the film reaches and touches my inner youth.
