Jerome Crabbe plays a leading role in this film. I've seen this movie six times and still do not get tired of it. This movie looks like Flesh + Ghana in some ways. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. Written by Paul Verhoeven in Dutch films. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I saw all the films except Showgirls. My mother does not like her very much, but I do not agree. I think all of his films are walking, especially for the Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith would never die. The Dutch films are different but still pleasant.
