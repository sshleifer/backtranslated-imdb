Carter Wong plays a noble hero to look for a healing book that wants to revenge her! Pacing is good in this movie and there are many struggling scenes to continue the film. Flying guillotine looks bad, and the main villain has no problem with using them. Although the story is strong, the action is entertaining and draws you to the end (I felt as if I could continue). <br /> <br /> Campy and dark, it's great ol skool kung fu !!
