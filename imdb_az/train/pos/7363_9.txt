<br /> <br /> The summary of this movie would be "Excellent". <br /> <br /> Perhaps you will not go to a public film watching community? <br /> <br /> It's a movie that makes you join. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ strong> Blair Witch Project can be compared with the overall layout style of the film (Subject / Topic) and possibly comparable. But this movie is unique to both. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> plays an effective role in this movie. <br /> <br /> Acting is raw, dangerous, and completely convincing. <br /> <br /> Film about friendship; the name really goes away from the game. <br /> <strong> </ div> <div style = "text-align: justify;">
