Finally! A good British comedy, which is not around some mockney bank robbers or is removed from the television series. John Ivay's film is a psychoactive discovery decorated with biker gear. The three heroes are subtle foolish with a misfortune of a turning point in life and a misfortune for each failure, giving sensory, emotional trio of subfields to build together a strange comedy. The chemistry of three amigos is a palpable and cheerful dialogue and a friendship associated with some classic comedy moments. This is part of the Forward and I part of London, part of American Werewolf and part of Quadraphenia (but only bicycle gangs and Phil Daniels). In fact, Phil Daniels's lover remembers Danny and Forward the dealer and his scientific approach and his commitment to drugs. This is a great film, especially for those who dabbled psychoactive substances in the past in many aspects of the film. A personal favorite is a bright area in the Welsh corner shop, buying munchies while opening shrooms. This gentle comedy will wash your heart and laugh out loud. And even if you do not ride a bicycle, you do not even have to enjoy it. But if you do, I'll add. Brilliant.
