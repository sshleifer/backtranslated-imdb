Or, I love stopping any kind of plot in this movie. I have repeatedly visited and always stayed. For some, it is stylized, but any opera laughs to its lover that she likes it. Canadian Norman Jewison has great chances with its films and shots, and it's nearly as always paid in the center and some delicious cinemas. When I often chose to reduce this part of her life or could not get enough good enough to chew on, Cher was curious about the difficulty of playing roles. I have found a great actress who can turn it into a role as a role, or as a masculine, bold and fierce roles. I often found comedy strokes (a hair salon called "Cinderella"), but it was the intention of the writer and director. Nicolas Page plays at a point where she needs a knife to cut her throat, playing the tenor of the opera, and all the gigantic gestures. Brooklyn's scenes are magical, this is under the mirror, a romantic and dramatic opera like Brooklyn. Everyone was very pleased with the film, with a long shot, not for everyone, but for the end, everyone liked it as a chore of Greece, with all its subtle nuances and mixes with others, leaving the camera down the hall and leaving the players talking. 10 to 8.
