This is a great, heartwarming film. It's the best of Latin American experiences ... the kidnapping, corruption, brutal and greedy police officials, and the brutality against innocent victims. Denzel Washinton, in my opinion, gives the most moving performance in his career. Dakota Fanning is an incredible young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fan was beautifully written and illustrated, I believe every minute. The cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke is always as great as it is. Walken illuminates the screen for me as another actor. I would like to see both of them more. Original places are noteworthy. The camera work is interesting and different. In Latin America, which is even more interesting for people who are familiar with the film, there are many Latin actors. I love this movie.
