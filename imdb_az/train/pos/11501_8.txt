I remember my show a bit, but I remembered it very well! My biggest brother recently recalled the show and I saw an advertisement coming out of D.VD support. The network was bent to pull from the air to put it somewhere else? Must be at least 3 seasons. Why not? Sometimes I think network leaders are "gods" of the entertainment world. But they do not miss the opportunity to place a good show from time to time. Let's say they have more flops than the hits. It was one of the poorest decisions to cut off the line. Anyway, I'm taking it for my collection.
