Remember that any movie about any truth (no documentary) creates an incorrect and proportional cynicism amount, since nothing is meaningless than any suggestion or truth seeker, Psychology masters, film and soul captains , undoubtedly, will not find this movie unnecessary because you know everything you know. Congratulations. I found the "Perverts Guide to Cinmea" for those who are like me .... it is mostly brilliant and worth the money for those interested in cinema, psychology and modern philosophy. Many Scott Mclouds' s "Understanding Comics", Sophie Fiennes, brings together a series of films and debates about Slovenian philosopher, psychologist and public critic Slavoj Zizek. Cover "Birds" (Zizek takes a boat to rebuild shooting.) <br /> <br /> Lacanian psychosexuality, do not necessarily scream, a great entertaining evening ... but that's it! If you love movies ... Lacanian is primarily a bit loose, helping with some knowledge of psychoanalysis (Simvolik, Real and Imaginary), but the scenes that Zizeke has chosen and analyzed are quite clear to me, what was always a very abstract subject. <br /> <br /> Do not forget that this is not a movie, because she is better acquainted with the movies she has shot in the film. <br /> <br /> "Lacan chooses great movies to analyze or reveal great truths, but shows a very practical and clever way to meet with film and psychology (and philosophy philosophy)." fascist, why not just "Short Cuts" than just class and alienation, Birds attack in "Birds", Solaris, "Solaris" <br /> <br /> "Psycho" and " Marx Brothers have a relationship with each other, and what is the hell of David Linch's film after the movie? Zizek also has some ideas. <br /> <br /> The role of voice in the "The Excorcist" and "Star Wars: The Sith Revenge" may be surprising to me when I engage in sexual intercourse with the most powerful and clearest object. At the point Zizek feels that flowers are some kind of vintage dentate, they are disgusting and hidden from children (with jokes, it seems ...). <br /> Anyway, this is not an interesting documentary that should try to see anyone who thinks it's a movie and thinking more than thought. <br /> <br /> And anyone interested is Slavoj Zizek, which is less dry than the "virtual reality" and more than "Zizek!", Two other words, more dry than the "modern-day Elvis" criticism <br /> Duplication in English-speaking world. </ p> <p> The Movie Theater Perverts Guide is not about gender roles. Zizek claims that the cinema is the most distorted art, because "it does not want to be desired or desirable" and is the only modern art form that can give expression to these wishes. This is not a movie about finding the reality in cinema, but in fact, finding movies and how important it is and how exciting it is. It was hard to find and for a while, but it was worth it, and I lived in one of the most "stimulating" films.
