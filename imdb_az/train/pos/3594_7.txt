Michelle Rodriguez, for the first time in this film, was prepared when he saw him fast and angry. You could say that she was a difficult woman. With this film, he just acted in his, but no fear, and it is not as difficult as it should be in this movie. She's a worse girl, and that's what I love about her. This film is packed with a difficult girl, living as a lifetime child and experiencing anxiety over school and family. As he is training his brothers to become a boxer, he decides to go to war after his love and asks his brothers to train. <br /> <br /> I think it's a bit slow at the end of this movie, but I've done a good job. People can do so even if they do not think you have the potential. I advise you to see this.
