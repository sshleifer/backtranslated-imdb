I have seen the trailer for this movie several times and say that Ned Kelly looks like it will be a wonderful movie. When I looked for a trailer for the first time, I could not pull my eyes off (I was convinced of my point). Heath Ledger keeps track of what he knows and what he is doing for him. Split second looks fantastic for Orlando Bloom not to celebrate. I think this movie will be a hit and will see many people.
