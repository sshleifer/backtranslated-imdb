For the first time, I've seen this movie as a teenager, and it's about age when kids start thinking about their identity. I was deeply impressed by the scene of the children and the children they raised. One of the biggest children's mother is a prostitute, and none of her brothers resemble the same biological father (Kurosawa understands that they have children who do not resemble each other). He is still the only one whom his son trusted. <strong> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <br/> This is the largest Kurosawa even if it is not a movie, a great movie.
