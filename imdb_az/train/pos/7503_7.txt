The film was completely entertaining. The player was pretty good and the second part of my comment before me - Glenn Quinn was superb and just enough to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> There are many songs performed by Beyond Gravity in this movie, but this is actually a production of VH1, which is not considered as a surprise. <br /> <br /> A poor rock / pop music can not be liked by anybody, or it may lead to those scenes. <br /> <br /> A group of coaches trying to overtake the coast in LA, many obstacles on the road are not very original, but are quite entertaining, with some stunning plot here and there.
