As I turn into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Sacred Days, I am trying to win the most from the history of the new religion. I was invited to screen this movie with my sons, other young men and women, as well as to our families' families. <br /> <br /> We went to a historic village in Kirtland, Ohio where there was a beautiful summer evening. We made reservations for viewing this movie at Vistor Center. I was also interested in the fact that my filmmaking was restricted to a few documentary films. <br /> <br /> The church I saw was only "My Best Two Years" and "My Best Two Years" at "full-length motion pictures", but I also thought it was very well written and prepared. a missionary commentator, touched a few people expressing deep roots in this film. I thought, "OK ... but I need a lot to drown in tears." Think of my surprise when I scream at myself! <br /> <br /> The Prophet Joseph Smith is a very moving and inspirational explanation. <br /> <br /> Look and believe in his powerful message!
