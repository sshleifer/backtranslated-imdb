This 1939 film is directed by John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti, a young lawyer of Abraham Lincoln, a court case (in its full sense) and a fictional story. This scenario is a thoroughly designed, yet challenging film. Henry Fonda's Staying Like Lincoln seems to be a mistake because the actor has a fairly good feature for his part, even though it's pretty good for a few inch makeup and even the right nozzle for Abe. This is a good attempt in the background, but if it is not sincere, there is nothing, but its erroneous release of the whole film. Of course, the supporting castle is very good and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. However, Ford is highly regarded in the treatment of Lincol, which is presented only as a sacred shy, and overtures the movie on the final stage.
