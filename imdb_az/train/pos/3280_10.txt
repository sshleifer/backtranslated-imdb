I just saw this movie about ten years ago. I bought a DVD two days ago and after watching it, I think it was better than I remembered. <br /> <br /> The paper house is more than just a horror. There was such an incredible level of emotion and the great characteristic he worked through. Especially here, I thought Charlotte Burke was really good. Unfortunately, he did nothing because he was a great actress. Interestingly, though Marc died, he knew he would be good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " an excellent and very moving movie.
