I have not read the Kurt Vonnegut book yet, but I know its other things and it's interesting to see how it will translate it to the screen. In general, this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. This is about the story of an American in Germany, employed as a spy on the United States. His task is to compare himself to a high ranking Nazi and send secret messages to America through his weekly radio show. But when the war ended, he was condemned as a criminal, but fled to New York. <br /> <br /> If you have a Moment Night problem, it's time to be less censored. But for the majority of the film schmaltz is kept at least, and it is carried out with very bizarre plot skill and aplomb. And there are some spectacular moments in the black comedy that have three right wing Christian fundamentalists and a very high ranked Nazi in a prison cell. Very Recommended.
