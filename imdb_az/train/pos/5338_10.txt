If I watch a porn movie, I prefer it to be a kind of assassination and a descent dialogue. The door behind the bedroom is one of the few people I've encountered. <br /> <br /> The new girl is fooling her neighbor's human nature and weaknesses. Chelsea Blue (Brooke LaVelle) is an actress chosen to play a charming part of blackmail and plays a magnificent part. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and very beautiful actress. There are a total of 10 pieces because of being in the movie. In the movie her partner Monique Alexander is a certain cutie. Together, we must work together. In this film, though, Monique playing Gigi does not have much to say or say. This is very bad. It seems to be more talented than shared. I also (probably) love the daughter of DA's wife. I forgot his name, but he is not a bad actress, he looks very good. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to figure out some people are so excited. Some of them have earned money. Which is good, but it's done? Sorry, but come! I'm afraid it would reduce its performance several times here, with no exception, except Chelsea's talent and beauty. Generally, this movie is good.
