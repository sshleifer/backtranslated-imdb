I'm not a lot of actor or other movie maker, but this movie has deepened me. I do not think we will ever forget it. Particularly a landscape (I think everyone who is watching the film) will be buried in my brain. <br /> <br /> I also watched a similar movie on Lilja 4 (by the previous commentator). It was very moving, but it's not as straightforward as the brute. <br /> <br /> This is a very sensitive issue, but I believe it's a success rather than focusing on the film. <br /> <br /> More people need to see this movie !!!!!!
