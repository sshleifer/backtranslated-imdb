An excellent example of the magnificent Busby Berkeley music produced in the early 1930's. The audience was surprised to see James Cagney on such a vehicle. 2 years ago, a different difference from the "People's Enemy". Cagney adds a story and plot to a regular fatigue rather than sparks and interest. But the purpose of the film is to produce 3 ready-made production numbers. After closing the conservative "Honeymoon Hotel", after watching the sequel "Shallalah" with a shocking look, the closing of the "Shanghai Lil" series, Cagney continues to dive in just one end with counter Ruby Keeler. The number "Shanghai Lil" with Cagney is very good, but in a more exciting and incredible way, "a waterfall" is a comedown and a bit anti-climactic after fear of choreography. If I was the director, I would have the "Shanghai Lil" number in the middle and closer to each other with the "Waterfall" and the other two from the water, in my opinion, the best of three. 3 production numbers are icing and cake decorations are added to James Cagney's performance. Outstanding music achievement, 4 star movie, latest music, well worth watching, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
