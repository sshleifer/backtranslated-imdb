WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Richmond Coliseum, Richmond, VA <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the fourth WWE daring match of the Kane and MVP, and this is surprising to what Kane vs MVP (the first match of the card). I just looked at the ends of Kane MVP's donkeys at the apron, and then fled around the arena when the MVP was shouting? Finally, the fire extinguished the reflexes fire extinguisher because the MVP spread around the entrance ramp. Fun and funny ending. 7/10 <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: It was supposed to be a regular label match by William Regal and Dave Taylor and Brian Kendrick & Paul London (c). However, GM Teddy Long announces the ring and declares it will be a Fatal 4-way tag team ladder match. MNM and Hardys are discarded and all chaos. A word to describe this eye-catcher? Amazing! Wow. I do not remember how many people are stupid in this match, and words can not really justify it. Hardys created a backdrop in a vision position and jumped from the top rope when Jeff kept the MNM to kill Jeff, and especially WHAM! Nitro drowned Mercury's appearance and bleeding like hell on his face. Nitro continued the match again. As Jeff went somewhere else, Jeff attacked London when he was away from the stairs. There were many other high-flying breathing spots to remember. London unbuckles belts to finally win this rave show-stealer. 8.5 / 10 Boogeyman and Miz: Two people Boogeyman exploded a seating power bomb for victory and then drools the mammary worms on the mouth and then dropped and floats around the ring. <br /> <br /> US Champion: Chris Benoit (c) is facing another typical Guerrero match with Chavo Guerrero. Some good spots were superplexed from Chawo's top rope and Benoit's unusually long chain of German sucks. Vicki comes Guerrero, a ring with a strap for nails for Benoit, but Benoit scares him and decides whether or not he is putting a Sharpshooter for a long time. This allows Chawo to go for a roll-up, but Benoit corrects it again and locks in Chavo Sharpshooter. Game over. Even though it is sometimes slow, though it is a very difficult battle. 7/10 <br /> WWE Cruiserweight Championship: For Jimmy Wang Yang for Gregory Helms (c), a moderately paced match. There were some good high flying points in the match? originally from Helms' top rope? but when they witnessed the ladder, they did not appear to the public, and the fire should go up more and more. Helms won the match after blowing the fire with a face spoon on the knee. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> In the last Ride match against Mr. Kennedy: After a series of two matches, this time the Last Ride game has to remove the opponent from the arena in the square. It is very good for these two suggestions. Kennedy manhandled with a good job of Taker, and even refused a shock to throw down 15 feet below Armageddon; and thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would be cruel. After leaving Tarker inside the funeral, Kennedy won (I liked the camera scene in the funeral). Later, Taker pulled a pipe out of Kennedy and broke the funeral window, but later he opened Kennedy with a chair and followed up with his wife, consistent shock and Tombstone on the roof. Kennedy lost his frustration, and Taker pulled out the arena to win. I really have shown that these children are ready to give and give real patient shots. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;"> Many children in the crowd and then the "lingerie competition" happens in my ears. Break time. <br /> <br /> Batista & John Cena vs Finlay & King Booker: talk about charisma vs. technics. This match was actually a pretty good moment, with momentary strength from one strong team to another and a good endurance. Finlay even had some good laws for his opponents at this time (I questioned his power against champagne), and did not make him and Booker basically fraudulent? Booker, pointing to Jane's throat, apart from one point. Batista hit the bomber at Booker for victory, went to see F-U; Cena made her 5th Buffle all the same, and I also made the STFU. <br /> <br /> It was the best technical match of the night, and the participants really did their best without stairs up to 7.5 / 10. <br /> <br /> Armageddon was covered with numerous eye-catchers and the ladder eventually swallowed half of the show; The Last Ride game presented some fair nerve compression spots and the main event was very good for its category. All other matches were up to Boogeyman and Miz bout and always invoicing, except for the useless lingerie competition. In general, Armageddon was a very unpleasant charge, and despite some major difficulties in the PPV chronology, Armageddon wishes to bless this year. PPV rating: 8/10.
