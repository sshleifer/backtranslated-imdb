In the 1950s or 1960s, I watched this movie on television after Saturday afternoon. It was well presented, but I remembered that for the unexpected freedom there was a message of hopefulness from the transmitters, which had been put into the lamps at one of the last manicured executions. <br /> <br /> The film is still well finished. <br /> <br /> The High Command in Germany says that the Russians are moving forward to Fredrix's Stress. <br /> <br /> My impression is that this movie is about the Last Days of Hitler, with a theme similar to that of the English historian Trevor-Roper. I was surprised to see Trevor-Roper no credit. <br /> <br /> The latest German film on DOWNFALL was also classic. <br /> <br /> <strong> The US budget was a bit flat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < However, it is interesting that none of Hitler's two-volume films or books tells the story of John Toland's magnificent history. <br /> <br /> Was Gibs?
