Paul Reiser goes away from the standup comedy lamp to record a warm and soft story about the family - what we see and what we do not see, what we look forward to, and what surprises us. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> > <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < Sometimes his wife, Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) pushed back. One day, Muriel writes that one year after she gets married, she leaves! Her daughters, along with Benjamin's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately begin to search for her place, making a mockery and damage, and doing something on the way to Sami's son. It's time for a ride to find out about the two men and each and every one of them, like their father and son, and their family members. Sam is relieved for the first time in his life and presents the employer Ben to the tastes and entertainment of life. The trip ends with a phone call from Muriel's whereabouts and why he left and the reunion of his family to a hot end. Falk and Reiser play each other as processes, but in many cases the movie reminds us that Olympia Dukakis is one of the strongest matriarchs in the film. It's worth seeing. Grady Harp
