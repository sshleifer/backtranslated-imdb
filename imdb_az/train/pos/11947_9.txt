It's simply well written, directed and operated ... Woody is the best in 2000 if it's not the best since the 80's! Hugh Jackman was a perfect choice for his roll. Scarlett Johansson's joke with Woody proves how much he has captured an actress. <br /> <br /> Leader lays on the screen because she is not romantic on the screen. <br /> <br /> There are several comments that have intrigued this movie. Let them not stop you from seeing the magnificent movie. The people in my audience were laughing louder at some of the lines that I missed the next line. If you love Woody Allen movies in the 70s, you're sorry to lose it. <br /> <br /> If you go to watch this movie with an open mind, you go smiling.
