This movie is just funny. stupid, but funny. To fully enjoy this movie, you will not be able to have a movie about how this movie went through and about all the side jokes and tricks associated with the movie. When I say, "I like a beer ........ cock", I still smile at the start. funny things. Although the film is decent, it is not difficult to create a serious spin in the film, but many comedies only try to have serious aspects that you do not believe. But this is different and just fun to be fun. Yasmin bleet is not a terrible thing in the movie, but it does not add anything, but it's funny to watch 3 mothers, coop, remer and rag and watch the movie
