In general, it is very difficult for me to get very upset with the appearance of Loretta Young and find it to be very lonely in all the wrong ways. But this is lyrical Frank Borzage romanticism, and he is direct and honest and irresistible, even though he is playing a little self-esteem patsy who is totally frightened by Paramour Spencer Tracy. This is a strange weird film about depression in Hooverville, one of the most important romantic and ideally focused single rooms. Tracy, by today's standards, is a terrible chauvinist and plays a difficult role in making a "simple man" to get into the violence, mitigating the difficulty of his character, and almost making him attractive. Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (not so far) have a good supportive job, and Jo Swerling's scenario is modest and productive. But the real heroes Borzage, always the true love dramatization of the lyrical approach and Young. If you want to tune it up and make sense of its character, it is very good for this man, but he is very gratifying and convincing, and you, too, gladly tell your story to a nasty conclusion.
