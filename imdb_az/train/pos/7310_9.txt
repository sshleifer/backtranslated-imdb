There is no doubt that Halloween is one of the best films ever in the genre but also outside. All films love a creepy atmosphere. The situation can happen here. What would you do if you were in this situation. This is a movie that especially enjoys watching especially at Halloween. John Carpenter loves my other movies, but no doubt that the best movie is Halloween.Oh and if you are thinking about watching Rob Zombie remake, this is a pure choke and a true Halloween fan like the John Carpenter version of 1978. Michael Myers is one of the best quality slasher killers in any film and is a very good acquaintance. So look at this work that really likes it.
