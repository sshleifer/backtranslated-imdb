I am convinced that this is not a show, but a person's acquaintance and good thinking. then Baywatch is almost close to Hawaii. Casting, space, style and its presentation style? women on the beach and all that shows. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> After deciding to watch the show, there really is more to come, really a juicy story and conflict, to watch and become quite exciting? addictive <br /> <br /> Hotel worker, manager, owner and their complicated love story. Guests of the hotel, who are also challenging, and those who want to enter the hotel are the strongest person. <br /> <br /> It has become one of several countries. <br /> <br /> The story is not such a sequence, it's good enough. Soundtrack is quite appropriate with the scenario and is always moving. <br /> <br /> Recommend: I really enjoy watching it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong>
