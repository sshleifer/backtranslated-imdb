I love doodlebags. My son is watching them for more than a year. Last year we went to the Doodlebops concert and yesterday to a concert (Connecticut). He loves them. Doodlebops teach the alphabet or numbers, but who cares? are you serious TV does not mean to teach your children about numbers or alphabet. parents should be. Get him out of here. Doodlebops can really read. Deedee has a beautiful voice, and you can sing 3 sounds in your concert and do not lie to read. Imagine, they dance, jump around, and win. They have talent, even children enjoy watching the show. This show was the best show on television for kids. And a rock band for kids. How beautiful is this? Why the chad says (rooney) gay? Where did you hear that? He is surprised if he or she is! Leave him alone. It promotes homosexuality to our children, not to him or to anyone else!
