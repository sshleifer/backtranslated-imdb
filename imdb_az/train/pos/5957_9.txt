<br /> <br /> I'm not a movie critic and I'm not going to act like Snobbies who comment on this movie. Undoubtedly, this movie has a budget of $ 1 million, but the plot is well developed, the player was strange and the cinematography was great! This movie has a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I voted for 10 out of 9 because the sound is stronger than just one channel. But I think it would be a mistake to register DVDs. <br /> <br /> I will definitely check out other movies produced by Brain Damage Films! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, cast and crew, thank you!
