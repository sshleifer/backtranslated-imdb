I thought the guys in the movie were great. I'm dealing with children in the age group and I think their behavior is very convincing. I had a problem with reference to the 5-year-old individual section. I did not think the comment was necessary, and in fact I downloaded my ideas about the movie. <br /> <br /> I think Luke Benward is the upcoming star. I would like to see more on his big screen. I really liked their reaction to the situations they found. Often children of this age group are doing things without thinking about it. <br /> <br /> I also think that films with this age group should be investigated more often. <br /> <br /> Today, schools are a big problem. <br /> <br /> The end was extremely unexpected. His thoughts on Billy's failure to win or win was surprising. How did he handle this situation? Very often today children are not ready for compromise. The actors of this film are an essential part of compromise.
