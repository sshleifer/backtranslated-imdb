A great movie about the hippy movement of the 60s in the late 60s (I've seen it all overnight). <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is Michael Jackson, a political activist in the United States. In other words, the first five years of the 60s are not really important in this film. Vietnam War. There he faces his girlfriend, Sarah. Michael's brother, Brian, goes to Vietnam for a fight (a surprise!). He comes back from battle and "Tom Cruise on the fourth day of July" is a Hippy.His grandfather is a Vietnam War type (what a surprise!). Michael's sister, Kate, is pregnant from a Rock & Roll artist and escapes from home and goes to the city of San Francisco in the summer of love. The latter is very weak (father is liberal and everyone is happy), but I'm silent at this sound (the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> Players' performances are pretty good, and the film's soundtrack is absolutely brilliant. The main events of the sixties are the great hippie protests, love, and the Woodstock publication, such as the murders of the film, JFK and Martin Luther King! Look closely at Wavy's "Woodstock Speaker" Gravy (Taking into account that we have breakfast for over 400,000!) As a first aid worker at the Woodstock festival! <br /> <br /> In the end 60 beautiful movie about a decade! 10/10
