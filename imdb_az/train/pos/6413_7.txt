Robert De Niro, Cuban Gooding Jr., Hal Holbrook and all actresses and actresses who took part in the "Honorary Names" united to make this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Author: was forced to make a promise to ignore them and sit down to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> The story of Carl Brashear, the hero of life, is inspirational enough to last a lifetime. Search the Internet ... The whole story is more beautiful than the movie, as the Director admitted in his comments. There were only three African-American divers in the United States in World War II. However, none of them has reached the US Navy Master Diver status. Carl Brashear was the first African-American US Navy Master Diver. And he was the first amputee diver certified or re-approved in the US Navy. <br /> <br /> At the disadvantage of filmmaking: Do you just tell one of many "empty" spaces? Yes, I will mark this comment as "Spoiler" and I'll do it ... The early beer scene where the helicopter hit the radio maker and puts it in the sea: They will never fit exactly. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Once, too dramatization, I The "Honorable Men" is perfectly reduced from 10 to 7. Hollywood EVER realizes that this deceptive truth is better than a dramatic approach based on stories? I do not doubt. Very bad!
