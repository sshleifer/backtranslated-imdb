I do not have to write a review for a normal movie, but the only explanation of this film is still unfair, so I need to share my opinion. <br /> <br /> Matrisi, a Latvian archiver, is watching "Krisana" (or "Fallen" in the theater I'm seeing), because he tries to give information about a woman who is jumping off a bridge. This is definitely a plot, but this film is not about a story that reflects the guilt of a person who has not acted. <br /> <br /> According to reports, as a detective investigating the incident, they say that we will not care about the anonymous face we face every day after we die. <br /> <br /> Michaelango Antonioni and his "Blowup" are probably more than any study you've read about "Krisana." The influence of Antonio's philosophical and strange style and the story "Blowup" are clear, and in fact, writer / director Fred Kelemen clearly refers to this movie on the stage where Matissin attempts to recognize a woman abandoned. bridge or at least who thinks. <br /> <br /> The only person who shares his views in the film is to reduce the look and feel of the movie "college movie class". It is likely that an existing Latvian film is considering the existing British constraints, but the atmospheric black-and-white cinematography and ambient sound will be at the artistic level to describe Matiss's inaccuracy. The wind sounds and the noise of street noises give a clever aura and recalls a Fellini film, whether Kelemen's intention or not. Cinematographers, of course, have little money, but this restriction is used for the film's superiority. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" succeeds as a character with a humorous character thrown away to not feel serious. It could easily have reached the peak of a mystery story, but it denied and became a clever film of loneliness and guilt. If you are worried more about cunning, this movie and its end can make you angry. Otherwise, take time to do business. I wish to look for something good.
