I just watched this movie again and got rid of only the number of kinks that were just dismissed as New Age paws. A great movie takes time to grow, continues to come closer, but no results, and ultimately, a meditatif, exciting, and realistic life that most people can deny by chance the "coincidences". The Prince of Tides and Bugsy (though I love the latter) this year for the best picture (won "The Lamb's Silence"), and this was completely ignored. except for one candidate for the best scenario. After review, date supports our first reaction!
