Oh, clichés, clichés, clichés; They are the main part of various horror films. It's one, many of them. Stefan King is still one of the best horror masters. This movie was really good, only TOO predictable. And what about foolish people in the film of fear? It is simply packed with the delayed offerings just to get their lives. I found a little creepy with pet origin. The way of everything was really terrifying, but not scared. In most cases, the player believes SOMEWHAT, the tension was not a decline, but it placed a great deal of entertainment levels; My eyes are practically adhered to the screen. All Stephen King fans have to watch this movie, but for everyone, we expect an OKAY trilogy.
