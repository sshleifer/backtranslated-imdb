The bartender is getting worse by focusing on any path, like reading a dEUS song. Anarchy prefers the logical and general manner of ideas. The story behind this movie is just about any wind blows. And that will be refreshed if you're really ready and willing to go. Followers who say that there are nothing to keep the story lines together are accurate. What is hell, is Windman anyway? Still, I enjoyed this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, noisy, happening place, and in any way it feels. It also maintains violence, racism, bureaucracy, weaknesses, and undesirable violence in a visible friendly city. The movie is entertaining, funny and a little calm. Barman's debut on the screen will not have a heavy impact on his music debut. Someone may be disappointed in this light. But then, the "worst case scenario" would be a subtle subtitle for any wind blow.
