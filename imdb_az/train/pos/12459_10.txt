This movie, of course, is one of my favorite films. The relationship between honorable and morally undesirable symbols constitutes an arcane and accusation code between thieves and police. Some movies, such as duties, guilt, words, manipulation, and trust, are unsettling, and unfortunately, since the death of the "police" in the 70's, there is nothing I can remember. Sequence-based, nothing is happening and directs viewers to a superior field and misleading viewers without the need for spectators and spectacular scenes that are not needed in little samples of the genre to keep awake. There is no scene or need. The evidence is foolish and honest to the audience, and, at least, is an important asset in a genre that is acquired by the audience's sorrow. No, this Marmara is not missed ... Not a note of congratulations for music, not just to watch, watch every minute and a sincere movie.
