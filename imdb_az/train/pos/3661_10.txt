Snobs and lying experts consider De Sica's best-known screams. Those who suffer from a serious lack of homicide will find this problem a challenge. De Sica spoke too much. His Italians do not have self-control with modern Italian film directors or Pietro Germin's bitter self-parody, Mario Monicelli's sharp pain, Visconti triumph or Antonioni's cold-blooded observation. De Sika told us stories like a father sitting on a bedside table before we went to sleep. There are no attempts to intellect. Miracolo A Milano and to a lesser extent the Il Giudizio Universale realist fairy tales, or today we say magic realism. The film is a gem from beginning to end, and Toto is a character you open heartily, but naturally, your heart needs it. Cinema in the cleanest way. Magnificent.
