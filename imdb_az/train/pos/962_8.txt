I just finished watching this movie and I'm sorry for that. Everything was great about it. The characters make the story interesting. A courageous, growing stubborn child is always ready to help others. Her mother should be proud. He could not get my eyes on this movie to be afraid of losing something. This pardon is prefect story / tale with cute and scary sprites and "monsters", but probably a hearty nation. A child is exposed to harassment at the school that has become heroes. The local village festival and Brian Froud were chosen as a traveler who traveled to the Goblin Mountain, where he found Yokai, a beautiful piece of work. And bad Kato and his off sider are definitely a hug. These bad guys capture Yokai and throw them into a red pit with unwanted things like motorcycles and other mechanical things, and make it a violent robotic monster with anger to kill a single job. Takashi is an American, if they are a toy for America, if they are one of the youngest guys, one with a red men / dragon and one with a tea princess, along with a cute little vigor, they were transformed into a toy toy and sold In all good toy stores . The lines are good, especially those that are at home and other stones that give a smile to your lips do not try it. Stop faith and enjoy it with your child or yourself and enjoy it! You must understand that it was the last dream. And definitely not. Betrayal
