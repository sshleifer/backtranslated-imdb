The movie shocked me. Personally I was a worse buzz. Finally, after I had DVDs, I was putting on a sleepless night. although the film was drifted, for the purpose of additional footage it was used with severity, and it would be even more realistic if the rest of the game was to leave any scene. The best thing about the movie is the relationship. There were no innocent or threatening relationships. I would like to say that the fate of the girl that she has met with her boyfriend has a few wonderful definitions, history, what we see, break something and then return in the last five minutes of the film. but this movie did not follow this pattern. We really encountered our relationships and their flaws, and the heroes had anti-love moments, though they did not have dramatic stops and mounted on every 15th and then again fell in love with each other. did not feel that the film could be predicted as the rest of the romantic movies. The story is unique and real to the reality, as I believe these people in the film are the most convincing I have ever seen in a romantic film from modern times. And all the baseball games did not hurt the fact and they have a fate somewhat until the actual world series. This is not "My fair lady", but it's a brave and honest movie. I just say I love it.
