First of all, let me tell you that for the first time, it delights the audience. Perhaps the events in the Middle East are for people "I came for a comedy and will use it by George." but for whatever reason, everyone seemed to be really comedy. The last few times Woody tried to make a straight comedy (Little Time Crooks, Jade Scorpion Curse, Hollywood's End Victory). I felt like a liner, tense and somewhat quaint. At one point I remember thinking: "It would be funny in the beginnings of the sixties". So when I went to this movie, I was scared to have Woody's voice, but it made perfectly his comic sensitivity. Of course, there were AARP cards with my friends on screening, but there were more than 20 and more than 30 there, all of them suddenly, and occasionally abandoned a large number of snowflakes. Heroes, cutlets and the like. <br /> <br /> In many cases, shooting rattled people as loud as they missed the next lines. <br /> <br /> The theatrical Vudey looked at the familiar place. When I suspected the trader, there was a lot of Manhattan Murder Mystery in this movie, but later, Oedipus Wrecks (New York stories) was more than a smidgen, Alice and Broadway were a bit dear to Danny Rose. Even with Woody in the film, Like Sondra, Scarlett was sometimes Woody-proxy, but his character was far from Nebbish, Ferrell would give Melinda and Melinda or Kenneth Branaugh Celebrity to us. Instead of archetypal ticks and quirks, Sondra's nerdnessness comes directly from the family history, and it's an early part. In many cases, "family business" leads it to the malaptopisms we have acquired as an audience, and the characters on the screen can be regarded as non-contradictory. Because we are joking, we can help, but we should laugh. But laughs do not accept Woody's nebbism, but really the character. Unlike Farrell, Branaugh, Cusack, or even Mia Farrow, Scarlett is not required to use Woody to make Woody play a role. <br /> <br /> Just because Vudin's voice suddenly comes from someone else, we do not get ourselves. <br /> <br /> My dude interprets the way out, he is a helper, but I'm at the center stage, I'm going. But this time, Woody appears to have written a character that is really in line with his current identity. In contrast to Ed Dobel's siblings, Hollywood's late afternoon blind director, and this time the character is a comfortable situation. Perhaps more importantly, this time the character works on the story. In high circles, they find themselves, and they are more fish-water than Scarlett, and it is used for the great comedy effect. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, what do you say about McShane in Ian (Swearengen) a few years ago in the United States? I liked them as much as I used them in that section. I particularly liked McShane's short but effective types. Jackman is attractive with the convenience of "Old Money", which is often described in movies 50 years ago. <br /> So what did I think? The short answer, perhaps, is the best comedy from Bullets on Broadway since 1994. Stylized less than Mighty Aphrodite. It is less austere from Harry's refusal. The Little Time is less than Crooks or Hollywood. Woody finally found a comic sound that worked in the 21st century.
