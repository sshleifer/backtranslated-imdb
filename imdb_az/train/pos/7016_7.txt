Although I could understand some of the bad things about this movie, I still found it to be absolutely fine. This will touch you and it will be worth seeing if critics do not thoroughly investigate the defects and flaws of each film or just touch something. There is nothing you can expect from a movie waiting for it, a texture tissue and an open mind. Beautiful and brilliant in the actress. I know that Will Smith is still incredible, playing another sectarian person. Because we are a good actor, you can actually imagine the feelings and emotions we have about the worst / best practices and experience something to you. And that's exactly what this movie is. Give me a chance.
