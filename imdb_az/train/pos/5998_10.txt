Cure is an amazing movie ... So suspenseful and just so real! I am lucky to have the screen of the "The Cure" in NYC's premiere and completely removed me! I also heard a special prize from the festival and I absolutely deserved it. The first thing I was thrown into was cinematography. Eric Giovon did an incredible job. The shooting style of the love area, which is more than half the movie, was beautiful. There was a love story in this movie, and Jafri came to the point, but kept the scene tastefully. Giovon and Jafri are perfect creative groups and must work together with the future projects. Judy Mayer's story was very surreal, at the same time he had a heart attack, and he felt that I was the main character. I've been a very hard critic, but I'm saying Cure is one of my favorite movies .. LOVE OUR! If you have not yet seen it, check it out!
