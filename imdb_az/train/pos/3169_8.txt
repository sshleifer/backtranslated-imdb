I rented a few years ago, the video was just VHS at the store. The video has been edited (you know, the color and the color of the successful films are used in the places where the box is covered) .I did not know what to expect except what I was pressing. What was wrong with watching the first thing I was watching? - Obviously, there was no dialogue dubbing. The words were echoed, so you have to stop the munching on everything I need to be more careful, there is no Shakespeare here, just simple discussions. Story is fairly straightforward, the girl faces the boy, etc.). Because of me being humorous and heartfelt, people in the film did not appear to be the storytelling cartoons, but rather the non-actors temporarily shattered their true job (s). Despite all this, you begin to understand what happens after filming, then you have no attempts at cheap humor (people can hurt their individuality, it could not break the marketing, and there was something honest about it). If they had a larger budget, they would have been better, but I'm sure they would think every day, but they went ahead and did it. "Indy" is thrown around like a genre .. Yes! .. It's funny!
