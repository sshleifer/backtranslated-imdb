Shrek, everyone? Well, imagine Shrek in the ice age. Remember the end of Shrek? Why are you doing this? Imagine that Shrek turns into a person and the princess is the same. Get it?

Strong liners, some of the social commentaries that children will not understand, earn good guys. Something more: Scrat. By the way, everyone's name is Skrat? 7/10
