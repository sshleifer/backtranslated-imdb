Looking at Quo Valley in my local video store, I found an interesting 1985 version. Amazing! Wow! It was beautiful! Too often, Ken Rassel is a cinema type, fancy, stylized, very artistic and, of course, "different". Nero was not presented as a dangerous thing, but rather like an irrational, unlucky emperor who wants to build a circus career. Perhaps he wondered how an empire was placed on the "leading" position in the world - it was very entertaining and fun. Klause Maria Bandaur began to spend a lot of time in this role and appreciated all that. Yes, Nero followed the Christians with revenge; Many who do this. At one point, he told one of his obedient: "No one understands that we can protect ourselves". He was right.
