The game Bell, Book and Mum was a favorite type of adult actresses going on and on the go. A famous story told by Harold K. Kennedy, Ginger Roger, argues that William Marshall, who is not her husband, has nothing to compare with her. Marshall wore a toupee and grabbed a toupee with a nail while passing through a door and behind the door behind the signal. <br /> <br /> The game is beautifully adapted by Kim Novak, James Stewart, Jack Lemmon, Elsa Lanchester, Hermoine Gingold, Ernie Kovacs and Janice Rule. It is a light entertainment about the normal looking family of these charming (Nova, Lemmon and Lanchester) and their publisher, Stewart. They want to be the most experienced man, Nilli, soft-spoken Gillian. <br /> <br /> One night in Stewart's apartment, using his piercing cat Pyewacket, he puts a magic on him and he is in love with him. <br /> <br /> "Bell Book and Damascus" has been shot on a glamorous crowd repeating New York. The movie is fun. Jack Lemmon, Gillian's brother, is a laughable actor in a supporting role of Zodiac Club, a magician musician and soldier. He uses his powers to turn off and turn off street lamps and occasionally open the women. Janice Rule is now perfectly as Gillian's snobby ex-colleague opponent with Stewart, and Ernie Kovacs has a great turn as an eccentric writer with a definitive book on witches. Lanchester and Gingold, of course, are always beautiful, like Lanchester Gillian's Daft Aunt and Gingoldu Queen's Queen. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak is a good choice for Gillian, giving a character to a witch. , showing the emotions that fit and this magic with, of course, magic, with spectacular face and spectacular wardrobe. Stewart, as a romantic lead, finishes with Novat as Vertigo and makes an effective team. It provides heat, it provides coolness and sparks together in one place. This is certainly more elegant than Vertigo. A charming movie is good on Sunday afternoon, well around Christmas (as part of it, it's happening at Christmastime) and you feel like smiling.
