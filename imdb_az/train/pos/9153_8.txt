Finally, after hearing about great things about it, I was forced to see it. It really exceeded my expectations. Given this budget, it was a surprisingly well-authorized and well-prepared movie. The lack of finance actually helped the film in a number of ways, in particular the plot. Like the Blair Witch project, this movie was better for filming instead of the movie. Another bonus: At least budget horror films (even the best ones) are subject to a hysterical player, without the need for mediocre casino, this movie really has a talent shooting (one or two characters), especially with two results. The only thing missing from the movie was an original story. This is a great way to avoid films that are well-known as "Rescue" and "Turn Back", but when you are like me, the films of this nature will not be scary. Moreover, the director is interested in everything. I would be very excited to see what the director will do with a bigger budget, and we have a sense of just being a matter of time before we figure out ...
