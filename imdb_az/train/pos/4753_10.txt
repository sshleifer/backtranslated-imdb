In some shades full of spectacular episodes, this is one of my favorites. This is not the deepest episode, it does not have a great meaning or message. <br /> <br /> But for me, it's really something different, because of my knowledge only * Twilight Zone episode * ending the double snapper. The region is really famous for a great surprise at the end of a story. But this time you get a surprise and you think, but another surprise is waiting. I really like it, it's probably one of my two favorite episodes (the other is deeper, more message-oriented).
