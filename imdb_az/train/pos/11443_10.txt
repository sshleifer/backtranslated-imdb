This film surprises with its beauty and creativity. An artist's profound vision, the intuitive nature of his natural source, brings us an inspiring Housewife to blend us with woods, creativity, white water that is involved in rocks, fields and rainfall ... Andy Goldsworthy likes watching the live creature, warns us of all the glorious vineyards prepared. He does not save us from random frustration, but we see the miracle of joining nature with nature in general. Of course, film director Thomas Riedelsheimer is also film-directed, photographed, and made the movie with incredible sensitivity and perfect timing. <br /> <br /> If you have any feelings for beauty, nature and art ... Do not miss this fantastic movie!
