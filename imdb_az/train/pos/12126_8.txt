In 1934, Bette Davis was transformed into a cool, entertaining performance like Mildred Rogers. The film appears to be more dated in 2003. It is necessary to watch movie enthusiasts and Bette Davis admirers, but today it may not be very attractive for mid-guards. It was surprising to see how Davis looked at this action. The actor basically reflects the speeches and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard played well as Philip Carey, a medical student in the club's legs. This is a movie that has a strong message about what we love and why we chose. However, "Human Care" did not have a strong mental or emotional impact on me. After watching the movie, I was a little indifferent and felt. The headman's reaction is that there is an intuition. <br /> <br /> You are the judge! <br /> <br />
