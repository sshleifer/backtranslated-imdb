Honorary men have many advantages. Good activity segments, plenty of "good feeling" scenes, a good musical score, but really a great part of the movie making part. Most by Robert Deniro. Honorary Names Focused on Carl Brashear, played by Cuba Gooding Jr, who first wanted to become the deepest African divers in the fleet in the navy. It is a poor farmer who takes a deeper struggle to enter the diving school and takes it even deeper. This is a good story, but it has been done many times as before. A person will not give up on all probabilities until a few years before reaching the goals set out for some sincere reasons. It may be, but in the film many struggles with Brashear, C.O. dance school's final test. But Robert Deniro finally gets into the stage when she's in the movie. Deniro plays Mater's Bazaar, a teacher at the Brashear dive school. When Deniro arrives, she can protect from excessive arrogance that you can not hate as long as there is no incredible exterior power. Before the movie ended, Deniro was so cool that she was so cool, but you were surprised that you worked hard. At the end you should doubt some aspects of the film, but if you admit it, you will postpone it for the first twenty minutes if it is true.
