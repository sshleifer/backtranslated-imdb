I watched this movie together with my kids. <br /> <br /> When Billy went to a new school, the fifth grade student started with him, causing the worms to eat. <br /> <br /> One bet is made and Billy only has 10 or more worms to eat. <br /> <br /> Since today, bully and his comrades try to make bets to come up with bad ways to cook, fry or cook worms to buy and get sick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a good family movie, If you love it, you will be like that. <br /> PS Let me add that this movie is not just for boys but all my daughters, and they really like it.
