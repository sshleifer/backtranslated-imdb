Ooverall, the movie was pretty good, it was a good motion area with fair amount of explosions and fighting scenes, but Chuck Norris did not do anything difficult, except for the bombing and taking on several characters. The film was very similar to the events of September 11. Bin Laden, a terrorist president (Urich) sends a video and threatens to blow it up. Judson Mills Rashid's complicated and different hit-butt roles had some outstanding job roles, but Chuck Norris had a shortage. Judson abandoned Josh (chuck) with Que on his computer and took most of the action. But in general, it was real, and there was no movement, but it was part of Mr Norris. She gave the movie 7/10.
