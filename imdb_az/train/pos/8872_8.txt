This is the first movie I saw in John Singleton and he is a pretty good director. The film begins with a few newcomers and shows what many of them are. Omer Epps plays part of a way with a partial scholarship and lives in difficult moments with his works. He is friends with Ice Cube and people who are familiar with Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a rich girlfriend who has been a friend of Jennifer Connelly, who has been raped and lesbian in the past, and is not sure of the way to go. Michael Rapaport is a kid of Idaho who falls with a group of Neo-Nazis and their leader, Cole Hauser. These are three main characters and a professor of political science who are trying to help Laurence Fishburne. It's a big movie, and the studio's failed to appear on the movie several times.
