I found a nice, elegant and rich film because I did not know about this movie before seeing Rialto Channel. <br /> <br /> Casting was very nice. I liked all the characters, they exaggerated the places, but this is a movie. The main character we look at and start with joy has become so bad that it can make real life. Yes, Andy MacDowell thought it was great. <br /> <br /> I was especially interested in watching this movie after it started, because people are often shocked about their mobility skills (I see this idea very well because in my opinion always a solid actress). <br /> <br /> Andy's character "sometimes feels you never felt here," and so on. (in person I can identify), then a beautiful classic piece of "Nocturne" <br /> <br /> I think Chopin thought it was a great way to end (at the end, a light comedy Turn it on, it's probably unnecessary). <br /> <br /> I'm saying "good" to filmmakers - I'm 1000 worse movies!
