Although Louis B. Mayer was not interested in signing a contract with young Greta Garbo, this first American and MGM movie was great for the actress. Because of the excellent shades and mastery you can hope for from the best pictures in the filmmaking, there are a few wonderful talents for drawing the film and making matt pictures. <br /> <br /> Garbo seems to be different, like many other early American films. Although familiar, his makeup is even less lighter than a year later - to look less harder and to give it a softness does not just appear in the next films. I wish you some kind of wishful thinking, but given the popularity of the brand, who am I? The film tells about Garbo and that he and his family have forced the land of an unfair landowner. The host, a very respected Do√±a Bernarda, claimed that the bank demanded a payment because it fell to his son Garbo and to get him out of the streets a better way to get rid of! Beautiful lady, huh? Years passed and so far Garbo has become a world-famous new story. When he returned to his hometown, his elderly companion (HAD promises to marry, but his mother, Berna, refuses to allow him) sees him. The new love of another lady is already tested - will she be forced to marry the heir to the heir of a great pig or will he want an old flame? And even more importantly, will Garbo be able to get it back even after being so flexible? Meanwhile, a great rainstorm stops. Land begins to flood and soon houses are washed out of the soil. Cortez and a friend break down dams like muddy holes! At a stage where they clearly show their boat on a stream without a boundary, they carry it out, and Garbo takes it home. He welcomes them and stays with them until the storm passes through them. Then she still admits her love and drowned the storm to make sure she was safe. She says to lose her! After that, you see Ricardo on his second choice to marry the daughter of the pig king. There is no doubt that you have little enthusiasm for it, and you feel betrayed by the lady, because she did not do anything wrong. Soon, Cortez will be running away to Garbo's home - she's like love and needs her. At this stage, Garbo was brilliant and could not tell her not to leave her solved in her arms. <br /> <br /> After being informed about this, Martha Bernard is not satisfied. Certainly, a Pig Queen is a better attitude than an internationally renowned singer. Due to the interference of this dark lady, Garbo leaves do not want to come between the mother and her surprised son. But Cortez is running away - he must announce his presence and stay as his wife. After the announcement, he talks to a family-friendly Cortez and enthusiasts to improve his career and reputation. So, "there is no rest for his wife", huh? Cortez could not bring himself to hate himself for any reason. So she marries the Pig Queen and lives a very boring life. A few years later, Garbo meets Cortez again, he is a middle-aged man with a dark eye. <br /> <br /> Garbo was not a star in the US when he made this movie, and it was Cortez. So it's a strange thing to give Cortez a tough character. Instead of his role as a regular Valentino, he was a sad mud here - the world was overwhelmed. And from here, his career was slowly down the spiral. <br /> <br /> According to filmmaking, the main purpose of the film is to be in the focus of the film, it was a pleasant one, though a little strike. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < And I can think about it several times, I have no complaints in this excellent movie.
