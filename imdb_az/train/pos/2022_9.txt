The only complaint about this adaptation is its sexual cohesion. Only the novel things are shown on the screen for a number of strange reasons. Would they be too stupid to understand that the audience is not everything right? In addition, this is a very good quality. All actors are doing amazing things that bring their characters to life. For whitewashed women, at least Toby Stephens is worth seeing as Gilbert's most attractive thing. <br /> <br /> If I'm still a Hellennier, I would not have forgotten easily that I was still married, then when I looked into my eyes ... <br /> <br /> The sequence of a spoiler is a funny recycling of what happened in the last scene .
