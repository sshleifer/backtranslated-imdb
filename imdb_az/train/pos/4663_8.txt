I saw a film on the TCM and left it for me just as Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, so I was really surprised to find that I really liked the movie and found it very special. Of course, this is a serious history, but as part of a period, it is worth the effort to look at life and lifestyle almost forty years ago. Now, the only problem I try to find on DVD is that I can look at it more often. I also liked the performances of Smith and Ustinov, and speeches by Carl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
