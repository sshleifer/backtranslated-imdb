SPECIALIZED AND Ugly, beautiful STARM COUNTRY is a daughter of a fishermen in the land of a rich man. <br /> <br /> Maryam Pickford is absolutely charming. <br /> <br /> Maryam Pickford is absolutely charming. in this outstanding, heart-wrenching film. He thinks that Tessin is a favorite, and fills it with all the joy and excitement that he has enjoyed for years as the world's most famous movie star. This story has all the essential elements for a modern fairy tale, a spectacular, dangerous heroin facing all kinds of dangerous and stressful situations. Atmospheric, first of all, provides a good idea of ​​the open fishing village. <br /> <br /> In support, Jan Hersholt appears to be a bad treacher forcing Pickford to marry. <br /> <br /> Hersholt shrugs off a very subtle spirit, and manages a brilliant way to describe his character's complete moral corruption. <br /> <br /> This is actually the second time Pickford TESS drew. The 1914 version was one of its first major films, but its production values ​​were somewhat curtailed in the 1920s (for example, no close distances), and in line with the standards of Mary, she wanted a movie that produced her films and was strong enough until 1922, just decided to re-make a movie. The result, of course, was in line with his expectations. Both films were very popular at the box office. <br /> <br /> An interesting study for some future film researchers is the influence of Christianity in the life of Mary Peakford; of course, silent films produced by him as a gold thread. Romanticism, which is inherent in the nature of silent cinema, can cause these spiritual emotions to be so difficult to date, even though we have to accept them as conscious thoughts by repeatedly repeating Mary's sincere beliefs. A great scene in TESS is particularly relevant in this regard: Pickford teaches herself to read the Bible. He shows Lloyd Hughes (his lover playing) does not understand a word at the back of the book. <br /> <br /> Mary's face is a loser. <br /> <br /> A new orchestra for celebrities, TESS Jeffrey Mark Silverman, perfectly emphasizes the beauty and beauty of this beautiful movie.
