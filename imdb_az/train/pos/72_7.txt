Recently, I watched the 1954 film starring Vincent Price for the first time in the Turner Classic Movies. Price portraits Don Gallico is a magician who is killing a boss when he stole most of the boss's magic inventions (and also his wife, whom he describes briefly by his beloved Eva Gabor). <br /> <br /> <strong> Even though he was a killer, in fact I rooted for myself, he is a sympathetic character who is saddened by the greedy people around him. <br /> <br /> Despite this film, some of his famous roles ("My Lovely", "Mum House") have some "fears", yet it is enough to keep track of the audience's interests. <br /> <br /> This is important for Vincent Price supporters.
