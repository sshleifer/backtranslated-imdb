I liked this movie. Great story and actors and good movie sets. He explained this story in a way that I can easily explain and without thinking about sleep. I would like to know where to get the soundtrack. I can not find anywhere. If you know where I can get the soundtrack please email me. In addition to finding the movie, I thought the film was interesting. Swayze did a great job. I think it's the best thing to do. His past films were good, but he really explained a story for a change. It will fall into history as one of the best television films in history. I would like to congratulate producers and writers of such a great work.
