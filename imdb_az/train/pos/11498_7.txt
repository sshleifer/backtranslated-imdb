"Kolchak: Night Stalker" is a very interesting television series with a repetitive, sarcastic, and forty-one correspondent repeating a fatal fight with supernatural (and sometimes foreign) forces. Based on a very popular pair of Armchic television films, this series has resulted in rapid deaths in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but has maintained a strong cult today. But will an average contemporary viewer win by knocking Kolchak and his weekly confrontations? <br /> <br /> This is a really difficult question to answer fairly. Detectors of this series claim that it is a formulacious and hopeless agenda. On the other hand, fans claim that they are clever, well-behaved, and sometimes really frustrating. And me? Both camps have one foot. <br /> <br /> For the first time I will answer the question of Kolchak as the source of the formula. <br /> <br /> I am very pleased to see Kolchak's 20th episode recently on DVD. Now I think that most television shows are formulas - for example, each episode of Columbus, for example, opens for the same pattern. Repetition itself is not a bad thing; In fact, critics are often enjoying the audience and finding it active, recreational entertainment. However, Kolchak's problem is that his formula is simply tough - even for the most generous standards. <br /> <br /> Kolchak investigates a murder in almost every episode, and this is by some kind of monster. He is trying to publish a story about this monster, but his editor, Vincenzo, always blocked him because he did not have enough evidence to support Colcheck's claims of extraordinary forces. And, of course, Kolchak obstructs the police. Thus, Kolchak conducts a series of independent investigations on the monster, how to kill him, and then kill him. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <span style = "color: red;" > I know Vincenzo is particularly mystical - Armchik is always confused about the monsters and Vincenzo never believes in him ... Why does Vincenzo do not fire or follow Kolchak? Any normal boss will do it. But the series goes away from this kind of realism and protects it as funny antagonists in Vincenzo and Kolch. <br /> <br /> Armchairs have the ability to compare the best episodes to the limitations of this formula, but usually include them. a kind of unexpected twist. These selection episodes are good enough that they are not touched by the typical criticism of the array. Some of my favorites are: <br /> <br /> Horror on the hills - an episode that is terrifying, inventive and socially aware. Kolchak's dialogue has an unusually sharp and charming edge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although the Devil's Platform - The Devil's Platform - Omen is different from this episode for me, because a very bad boy, Tom Skerritt, brings Kolchak with a happy satanic agreement (and thereby tells much about the character of the reporter) it turns out). Firefall - this episode seems to have a bad reputation among admirers, but I'm very glad because there's a huge red sweater and really creepy, almost impenetrable monster. <br /> <br /> "I repeat that to describe these three episodes, I would say that most of the stories are at least fun, in the 20th episode there are only two full Indian poodles for my money: Primal Scream, this is the monkey-men Sentry, the most subtle-looking monster make-up in the history of entertainment <br /> <br /> Because of this, it's a good queue, with a little repeating, a little cheese, but elements of greatness, even Darren McGaven's caustic, tired, endlessly funny, such as Kolchak, really does not work out, for example, Sarah Michelle Gellar has never ruled out Buffy McGavin was a great character and this series is worth seeing alone.
