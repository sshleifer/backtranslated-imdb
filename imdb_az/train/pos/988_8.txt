I liked this movie. If a boy in the $ 40 million gold dying in the bank, his assault partner uses them as a "Dish" to bring them to a high-tech bleeding partner (with an unmistakable monitoring apparatus implanted in the jaw). This is a spy-type movie with enough comic scenes to capture light. He recalled the enemy of this state. Well done and good enough area.
