I watched this movie ten years ago. and we've looked at this video once at average once. Topics are universal because stories and conversations are very personal. this is one of the few films that captures you from the framework of a loan, although it is really only two (very attractive) characters. it owes much to deal with the hawke and the delpy who want to believe that we are actually jesse and celine. This is the first movie I have ever seen on TV, and the phenomenon is now expanding! I love you, because you're fond of this movie, and that you think your girlfriend is one of those characters. That's what I wanted to get around the train in Europe! I have not met anyone who is not related to this movie. Maybe you talk about myself, my friends, or the horror of this movie.
