In the opening scenes of this film, a man shot arrows from the hotel room to another person's bathroom and put out all the lights. It has been a lot since 1936, but since there was nothing to do with the movie, it did not look as though I had seen and Robin Hood did. However, Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), "The Whales of August", 87, was very young and attractive and performed one of the best roles in Hollywood's long career. Daisey, George Brent (Johnny Jones), "The Spiral Staircase", 46 'Daisey even offered a wedding party at Johnny's Ferris Wheel, and even had black eyes. Davis and Brent made a very big pair, one too rich and the other a very weak correspondent. At the off stage, Davis and Brent had a genuine love affair. That's why these sparks have emerged in these two films. For Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the movie for you!
