Many people have commented that this film is not close to anywhere. Yes, maybe not you. But how does your child react? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Historical disney films are sometimes a little bit for little children may be harsh. <br /> <br /> Some of the movies have caused Bambi's mother to shoot. <br /> <br /> This movie was really great for my sensitive little daughter who loves humor and happy endings. <br /> <br /> Skip the movie, based on Disney's standards. <br /> <br /> If you are a sweet little girl or a soft-hearted guy, you really want to get this movie and treat your little ones. This movie is as big as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of dreams. I'm happy with a movie that loves my kid and parents do not always have to regret it.
