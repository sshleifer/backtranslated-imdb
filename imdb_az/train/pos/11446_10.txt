Now watching this movie for the second time (television), and for the second time I've been watching the nature of Goldsworthy for an hour or two (this time I saw it twice more), the nature is changing, and it's really beautiful. All this film gives you a warm feeling, playing with the world around you with this love. Or just touch your hands and cover it with dirty and broken nails, it will touch you.
