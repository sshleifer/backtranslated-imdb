Guys and Dolls are a healing film for a remake. It was forty eight years ago. His two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds. Despite the update, now with the big stars, the box would succeed and could not capture the magic of this version. <br /> <br /> Marlon Brando (watching over the last 409 lbs), watching a great wide screen, a great entertaining movie, can not regain its boundless energy, nor can it have a happy joy. the last time I heard) Sky Masterson plays, is one of the greatest gamblers in New York. Frank Sinatra Nathan Detroit is famous for his frequent as-he-can-find-a-speakeasy-for-crap game in his city. However, while charging $ 1,000 in a place reserved for capture, Detroit needs fast money. <br /> <br /> Masterson plays a $ 1,000 bet, so she can not go to Havana with her missionary Sarah Brown (Jan Simmons) the next day. <br /> <br /> Children and puppets are actually non-existent Add to the fun as it is here. It's clear how it happened on Broadway music: there were not many sets and scenes were long. If I were to complain about something, the song is uneven. Sometimes there were two songs on the stage; At other times, it went without thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 Not rated.
