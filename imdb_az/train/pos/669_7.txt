The people in the film look like this when their royal tongues descend from a light blue sky. In fact, the weather remains pretty bad all along the regression of the atmosphere, and only responds to the lawyer Chamberlain. <br /> <br /> But he is very European rationalist and I collect only through sleep, that he is in contact with the inner person. <br /> <br /> The author-writer Peter Weir has a strange original mystery in metaphysics. He has already proved his ability to flirt with Hanging Rock at the picnic in 1975. Here, the arcade of Australian aborigines is opposed to the intricate world of dominant networks. There is something strange in the Aboriginal community that they kill one of their number for no reason. Yuppie Lawyer Circular had to defend them in a white man's court. But he looks at things more and more mysterious things, and a strange old man is more interested in him. <br /> <br /> Good structured scenarios deepen all interests. One reason for the film is the fund rate of Chamberlain's wife and daughters. The listeners can easily identify them. When the little world goes beyond the ordinary framework, the norm begins to wobble and we begin to face the worlds. Chemberlen thinks that, in particular, underground exploration, he shows that he is increasingly conscious. After all, it picks up the mask that I hold on the puzzle (I believe), but the reaction does not really mean the unit. <br /> <br /> Of course, after 30 years, the surprising nature of nature has some resonance. In the film, the idea is wrapped in a lot of fun hocus-pocus, but the subject itself explains. One way to get a central ironry in the film is the symbol of the opening scene. A large white SUV barrel has left a local family, leaving behind a historical dust. The area resembles the protection of an internal tribe, which does not pay special attention to the shore avenues of the industry. In addition, this is a region that can be saved from something like a destructive last wave. Perhaps there is something to think about past and future here. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is really a good movie that will stay with you.
