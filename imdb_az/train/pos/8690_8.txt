Alain Resnais movies are actually unusual because they are not edited for sustainability, but instead a shot ends up in the memory. Death love is sometimes a quiet existence drama and a charming creative magic realist movie, or in any way the viewer treats a new side of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or maybe Agape / Thanatos <br /> <br /> Starts a strange surrealist horror movie. A woman runs around a man's bed while lying in bed. - He killed him, or what happened? Soon after a tension came from a doctor and it was canceled as soon as she was killed, a strange drama begins: a man wakes up and falls in love with the real tragic consequences of a woman and a man. <br /> <br /> At the same time, friends of both priests look at and discuss the nature of love, faith, and loyalty. <br /> <br /> Resnais has always had some devices to carry out such literature, and some good things about his films are always the use of those devices. In this case, Resnais breaks the scenes with the snow shooting falling on the orchestra score, and runs to the subsequent shooting that continues the story. The film, which was sacked from time to time, is developing a rhythm in contrast to epic poetry, and I'm strangely unusual in Dante's Divine Comedy, even though it's not a direct reference to the film. Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker, but it has become something that only intensifies introspection in the audience, allowing him to memorize the cinepoem structure alone. <br /> <br /> <strong> "PolarisDiB"
