Otto Preminger, completing a noir period at Twentieth Century Fox, combined his "Laura" with this strange, bizarre detective drama. Dana Andrews re-classified the police, but this time she was tougher, not brutal, and accused of police brutality - "You do not hate headlines, I want to beat them!". Mark Dickson (Andrews) was as criminals as his ancestor was humiliating the offender. <br /> <br /> When investigating a crime one night, an unknown suspect Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) is as hard as killing him. Shattered Dixson intends to build a scammer thief, Scalise (Gary Merrill). However, Paini's father-in-law Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), his daughter, divorced model Morgan Taylor (Tierney), leaves her husband but goes on gambling schemes. Paine slapped her husband, irritated her father-in-law's father, but Dixon did not leave her body. Without better suspects, Jiggs is arrested and charged. <br /> <br /> Mark Morgan, who has been convicted, offers money for his lawyer. He decides to take Scalise anyway, but confesses everything and leaves a letter to the department in case of death. As a result, she does not live with what she knows and lets her read her letter and Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan accepted his love for Mark and waited for him. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to find this movie on DVD after confusion with a large number of television. Noir historian Eddie Mueller commented on and did a good job, but claiming that Laura was six years ahead of the audience did not hold the significance of these two outcomes. In this regard, because they appear on The Iron Curtain two years before WTSE, the movie is wrong because they are on the stage. <br /> <br /> Andrews and Tierney are fantastic to each other, Ruth Donnelly <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <Strong> Gary Merrill passed away with Dixon's father ("Your father loved me," Mark Mark). Carl Malden and the young Neville Brand are terrific. And Tom Tully touches and is funny as he shows Morgan as a fairly blamed pop. <br /> <br /> A film that can be watched with fantastic casting is shot.
