This was the best film I've ever seen about Bulimia. It's not always about Bulimia really hit the exact location and how slim and diet it is. Bulimian people have shown that they tend to think like life, friends, and thoughts about themselves. The part that reflects the truth of the problem with the best line and Bulimia, Beth says, "This is not yours!" This line has shown a lot about the character and others who are facing the same problem. Bulldog people have shown that this problem is not something that does not belong to others. It belongs to them and only to them. It is time to talk about a person who has a problem instead of putting his attention on everyone. Beth showed that she needed the attention and she understood that she was the most interested.
