I was watching it during Christmas, I did not know why, but Christmas reminds me, so I watched it, so it is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Arthur is a film that tracks all my ways with a great merry smile and a mixture of special demonstrations, great jolly music, and elegance and charm that creates it. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is a character that can easily hate it (selfish, rich, lazy drunk) but turns it into one of your favorite ones. Liza Minelli is great as a queens waitress, Linda Morolla, who steals Artura in a harsh / soft way, postpones her world. John Gielgood takes all the juicy lines and tastes them delicious. <br /> <br /> I can watch Arthur again and always feel good, check him out if he needs a nice movie.
