Twelve years ago, I first saw Rob Roy. For fun, I leased my hobby and watched a winter night's thirst. The movie I wanted was gone, I rented it for that, I did not expect much, and I was very surprised how good it was. I just watched it just a while ago and loved everything as it was for the first time. For those who are not familiar with the story, Scottish smuggling Robert Roy MacGregor is a stubborn and popular hero. Freedoms from human beings, which I know about Adam and his story, are based on facts, but not movies, but textbooks can give pretext. Basically, the film's structure is that Rob Roy receives money from Montrose Marquis, and then gets a big profit and intends to earn a great harvest. However, when his friend's money was stolen from cash and wood, his plan was broken. Our hero finds himself solved after Marquis has solved the problem, and his wife Mary is exposed to sadistic aggression in the hands of Archibald Cunningham, a bare Englishman with no spirit. Rob is awakening Archibald as a Christmas man, until the intentions have reached a very satisfactory conclusion. <br /> <br /> There are many great speeches in this movie, but it gives us a bit of a touch. Liam Neeson, as usual, is a fantastic thing. Honestly, this man is like ice cream: it's good if it's bad. Rob Roy is a glorious man who struggles to provide those who are dependent on him, how well he knows. Jessica Lange, like Mary, gives this woman a violent change from a gentle, dull movie woman. You just know that Rob or anybody else will not take it. Tim Roth coincides with the description of the evil Archibald, still working in some way. All posturing and preening in combination with some of the worst dialogue results in one of the most memorable film villains in the last memory. Combine all of them and work perfectly with other supporting players, with the Scottish scene and really a really cool movie. If you have not seen this, I strongly recommend it.
