<br /> <br /> <strong> Yes, before you decide to file a legal breach, the FBI will always be there. At least this is a confrontation, but a bit of a spectacular crime drama, followed by the story of the FBI and the feeling you received. Explains the roots of the organization from a small office to one of the world's most modern devices (in 1959), talking to Chip Hardesty, one of its agents. <br /> <br /> The chip has been with the FBI from one day and is happy with everywhere in the world, and sometimes even delights her family. The FBI Story follows his life by describing his actions as an agent and how his personal life is affected. The film is doing a great job to show how the FBI operates and how it operates. The audience is hiding to see Kip Klux Klan's rebellions, tackle an Indian murder / property scandal, detain fugitives, rescue hostages, and help fight the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Stewart can be a little bit more (as usual) as a little neurological agent who works with an uncertain complex performance. One of the best part about this movie is to see the internal affairs of the Chip family's life and work. We are witnessing to him by the death of his best friend and then his son. We also observe that his wife is down and that his marriage is royal. Almost all his personal problems are his love for his work. Vera Miles gives a neat performance, but very convincing, not less. He was never a brilliant actress, but there was always something attractive and attractive about him. Maybe this is just me? Unfortunately, none of the other performances is worth mentioning, but the highlighted story is a very interesting event. <br /> <br /> The movie's cinematography was especially scenic in South America. All of the colors were a tissue that determined the atmosphere of the film. Perhaps the biggest part of this film is the magnificent direction of Mervyn Leroy. Each stage was such a fluid, and it rolled somewhere to explain a bright story. <br /> <br /> In general, the FBI Story is a spectacular, but disappointing film. After two and a half hours, some viewers may be intimidating, but if you have the chance, I'm skipping this job. I was delighted with Jimmy Stewart's spectacular performance and seductive story.
