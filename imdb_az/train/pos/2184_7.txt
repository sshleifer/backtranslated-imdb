Although it was a pleasant music about me, it was an unexpected comedy chemistry between composer Basil Rathbone and his assistant Oscar Levant. Rathbone's character plays a torn, funny type of scene (or more sorry than most dangerous roles like dangerous villains or cool logical Sherlock Holmes) that appears to be unable to get out of bed without help. And this is done with Starbuck, the ordinary droll humor made by Oscar Levant. After taking Crosby as a dream poet, Rathbone introduced him to Starbuck, saying Levant responded, "He does all my thoughts for me." "Oh, it's just half a day." Of course, this past (or more) Rathbone has gone through a very busy day for the next hit song. After another review, it was said that anyone who knows Rathbone could be so laughable! Too bad he had more opportunities to show his comedic talent.
