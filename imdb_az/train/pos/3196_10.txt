This movie is good for several reasons. Harris draws a very unbiased documentary and translates it into a social commentary. Groovin 'Gary, a small town child who liked a lot of modesty. When she decides to play Olivia Newton John at the local talent show (very passionate for her), Gary's actions are contrary to her conservative social environment. As a result, people have various reasons for their actions that people will not really think of a transvestite or any other social aggression. In the second part, Harris uses the struggle between Gary and Beaver to make a comment from the original documentary. The third and last charge of the Trinity is really nice to be extremely sensitive to Harris's theme. Unlike the second part, "The Orkly Kid" shows Gary as a really disturbed character. He struggles unsuccessfully to accept his / her community. Olivia Newton John, his secret passion for stripping him away, removes him from those who now consider social isolation. The film, in fact, describes itself as a reality, as well as many reactions. Certainly, Gary can see it as a ridiculous tragedy, but it can identify it as an isolation.
