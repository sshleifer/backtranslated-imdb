William H. Macy regrets that he is a humble parent like a parent who wants to get out of the family business with a most affectionate and attractive businessman and lover. From the point of view of the medium-term crisis in the subject of crime (which is also related to a narrowing), it runs in the same area as the TV's "The Sopranos", but still worth the look of Brommel's direction from a number of origins. this guy directs the next), a perfect script and all the great demonstrations around. Macy is always as good as it is. This is the best role since "Fargo". Donald Sutherland is like the best creepy father. Tracy Ullman gives Macy's wife a striking catchy dramatic turn. Young David Dorfman is very good as Macy's bright and sensual son (most of his lines are noisy and beautiful). Even Neve Campell (I usually hate me) is obliged as a young woman who is concerned about Macy's eyes. All of this is a mere calculation and at a precise pace, so it is expected, but still strong, and leads to meaningful and discreet results. This film is worthy of greater freedom because I suspect it will be related to the audience.
