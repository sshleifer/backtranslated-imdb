Not just for kids but a very heartwarming movie. John Thaw is always as bright (without giving any clue about Inspector Morse). The guy playing William did a good job, although I did not find it convincing in every scene. I like all the feelings of the small village and the slower lifestyle in those times. <br /> <br /> Just a few years ago, I saw the Scandinavian film "My Mom" ​​and reminded me that I felt scenes in London. A film showing a child evacuated from Finland to Sweden during WW II was screened. The spouse of the family took her and asked for her daughter because she had lost her daughter. Instead of a boy, he does not see it completely. In Finland, where the child is spoken, issues are even more complicated. The film Goodnight advises everyone who loves Mr. Tom, it feels the same.
