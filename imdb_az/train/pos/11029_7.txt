I'm just an admirer of Sylvester Stallone and I guess it was just the French movie Taxi 3 playing a little role, though its appearance really is not available. <br /> <br /> If Gabala (Stallone) does not rescue her friend's daughter and looks like her death, I must admit that this film is not really bad. At the top of the mountain, at a height of 4,000 feet, he can not force a mountain to work as a savior. For a year, he does not have a meal in reserve, but he returns. After returning from a snowstorm, a group of trapped crew is an extraordinary call. At least, it is believed by the inspectors. In fact, a gangster who crashed into the mountains with a plane crashed after a courageous plan to steal events from a flying government plane. The events have spread all over the reserve and need professional mountaineers to get them ... <br /> <br /> This is, of course, not just one of the smartest movies, but something unpleasant in their genre. one. Especially, I'm glad to be Lord Lithgow as the leader of the evil minds and robbers. I know him well from the "Solar Third Gaya" TV series, but I also enjoyed his work in this movie. Generally, the player is complete, offers a lot of moves and, of course, a few liners but offers a very nice d√©cor. This film was shot in a magnificent natural setting. I liked the snowy mountains and valleys, mountain rivers and forests ... Perhaps I can give this movie a higher score than I did in this type of action / adventure. I give it 6.5 / 10. If you're sorry, it's a nice movie.
