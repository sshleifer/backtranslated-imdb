"Twelve Monkeys" are both strangely and unkind to be smart and intelligent at the same time. Between the future and the past, the story goes back to the planet in 1996, a man named James Coul, who was sent back to the past to gather information about a human-like virus that destroyed the population of 5 billion people. Cole was originally sent back to 1990 by a crash and was taken to a psychiatric institution where he was attempting to explain the cause of failure. Kathryn met with Railly. He is a sick man named Jeffrey Goine, a crazy son of a famous scientist. <br /> <br /> Life is not just fantastic. <br /> <br /> <strong> After the past, the film's real and madness is a certain piece of film in the history of science-fiction films. It's original and very entertaining. The scenario written by David and Janet Peoples is inspired by a film called La Jetée (1962), but thanks to the inspiration for the director and writer of the film, Chris Marker, "The Twelve Monkeys". I've read a little about La Jetée, this is not the same story, it's the same idea, so it's not just a copy. The people of David and Janet have turned this great inspiration into an up-to-date story that tells about this urgent need to find a solution to the preservation of human existence, and this is a wonderful and exciting journey of excitement, from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> The music used in the film is not alone and somewhat exciting and exciting, but when you realize that it is so attractive to Paul Buckmaster, until you actually get it. <br /> <br /> Gilliam, who remembers Terry Monty Python, was a surprise for me as director of the film, because I really did not think of him as the director of a person. I know it was a movie before, but I really could not believe it could do anything spectacular. He should not be surprised, though, as an incredible job. You can still feel the same strangeness as in Python, but the guidance for me is pretty flawless, though it is the only one that describes something strange in some of the images. Yes, it's weird, weird, strange and uncomfortable, so the film is a bit heavy, and it's hard for a poor-minded audience to watch the movie all the way. It is not as hard as you can imagine, but there are certain things that are extremely difficult to watch sometimes for their own purposes. Nevertheless, it keeps a clean intelligence inside the movie and blends the flashbacks, dreams, past and future, mixing the whole story intelligently and even though it does not prove any part of it. <br /> <br /> What is the actor, The movie is not wrong either. James Coul's role is played by the mighty Bruce Willis, who is still the best actor ever. Now people can be happy with me because he has done a great job at Sixth Sense, but James Cole's role for me was ideal for Willis, and he's incredibly good. Character is very well written, yet well-executed. Cole begins questioning his existence and strives to live, trying to survive, finding the missing part of the cloud. Hardly, he begins to lose faith, even questioning whether he can trust or rely on himself. Other speeches are Madeleine Stone and Brad Pitt's performances. Stow plays the role of Kathryn Railly, psychiatrist James Cole, who sees something strange in Cole and decides to help her deal with madness. He begins to believe in the story of Cole, but as a scientist he tries to find a solution in this way, and when it comes to incredible things, he is clever. Brad Pitt is very good at Jeffrey Goines, and he is one of the best performing performances so far. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> Generally, "Twelve Monkeys" will be a great science fiction experience and, of course, a recommendation for all scientists. Especially includes Willis and Pitt, an original and entertaining story, featuring brilliant characters and super role performances and a very clever and intelligent plot. But what we have to say about strange and disturbing is that it is interesting and vigilant, paying attention to the audience. This is an explosive tension, and it's also romantic, so it's all in the same package, and it turns it into one of the best movie I've ever seen. Thanks to Terri Gilliam's stunning and frightening vision, he keeps balance even though he is somewhat bumpy, though steady in a way. It's hard to tell the truth, but it's like on the horizon.
