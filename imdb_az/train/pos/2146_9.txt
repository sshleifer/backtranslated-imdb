<br /> <br /> I saw this beautiful Japanese film at the 5th Annual Roger Ebert Film Festival in the historic Virginia Theater in Illinois, USA. <br /> <br /> This film in English <br /> <br /> Writer / director Suo Masauki [I am imitating Japan's presentation.] Family name and last name (last) To show the public of Japan uses the very popular theme of honey dance. <br /> <br /> [Also, if I can not get to know Japanese official names that may be amazed by world readers, I will not use the names of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < dancer Kusakari Tamiyo is the first and only film to date. She is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio. However, his real longing is to compete again in the disqualified International Dance Competition. No, I will say "why". Watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the main star of the film. Since 1979, an employee of about 25 films, a 40-year-old girl, has a product of a company that owns a lover's only a company that owns a home <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And yet, something missing from your own inner happiness. Check out this movie to see how it has come to dance with little dance, and go confidently to the lesson. Most dancing characters are freed from the Japanese social hierarchy of the traditional social structure. They are friendly and warm and inviting. Of course, this is a clear indication of how the Japanese society will be built on the philosophy of "everyone for and for everyone". <br /> <br /> The film has many funny moments. In many comedy moments, nearly 1,500 theater actors spontaneously laugh. This proves that the comedy does not have any foreign language. <br /> <br /> Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is funny and brilliant, as well as Watanabe Eriko. <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> <span style = "color: red;"> < br /> Japanese people are growing in a tough social structure. "Is not it a dance?" <br /> <br /> It is a quick dip to learn later and to show other Japanese movies. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone. It's funny, it's a little charming, a little bit of crying and warming your heart. <br /> <br />
