Scott is the only actor in this version of the ACC without English accent, Ebenezer Scrooge's top- more and more with the definition of his life. Especially effective when Bob Cratchit faces the office at the end of the movie. When Scott stands before a big window, the sunlight shines on it a bright mantle; All you see is silhouette. Scottin's voice has grown, grows immense, as if it were ... Marlon Brando's first scene at APOCALYPSE. "Hero", really! <br /> <br /> However, as they say, what works for you can work against you. Because Scott shows such a creepy ferocity in the film, proving it is infectious. To put it another way, Scrooge is "charismatic", though not really "later". <br /> <br /> Actually, I did not even know myself, as Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach when playing this role and many others. Scott's strange anger is considered a commitment. But other "Christmas Carol" can be mashed. Watch the movie and judge for yourself.
