A special day (Ettore Scola - Italy / Canada 1977). <br /> <br /> For a while, every time a movie about a nervous event is encountered. It offers a very simple point in almost every single way that is perfectly executed and incredibly moving simultaneously. Surprisingly, Ettore Scola's "Una giornate particulare" is relatively unheralded, even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it 'garbage' and Leonard Maltin is a bit gentle, 'pleasant, but trifling'. Not just because of this movie's action, but more of the movies I see in a simple story, it shows more insights on the daily life of fascist Italy. Cinematography is clearly understood by the slightly bland and storyline that can explain the relative uncertainty of the film. Given the audience of the late 70s, it was not limited to large Italian films, even though it was not true with critics. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a 10-minute archive of images on May 8, 1938, with Hitler's visit to Italy. The first novel to resist this sequence is to meet a single lover, Antonietta (Loren), who has six children in a building building. One day, when Beo escapes, his guests meet with Gabriele (Mastroianni). It looks like only one person in the building participating in the ceremonies. She behaved well, became a cultural and soon attracted to her. During the whole film, we hear from the radio of the concierge radio that goes through the fascist rally height. Scola plays the camera to make us part of the process. After the opening scene, the camera seems to be looking for the unknown main characters on the edge of a modernist (hypermodern) apartment bloc. <br /> <br /> Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in two of their leading roles. Canadian-born John Vernon Loren's husband plays, but on the first and last stage is just the screen. I did not know his voice, and I did not know that he never lived in Italy, so I did not think he was talking to Italy. If his voice was dubbed, I did not feel it. On the contrary, he is totally convincing in Italy, and more is the rest. The story is simple, but extremely effective, speeches are striking, the end is just perfect, and the frame work is quite ambitious, but it works perfectly. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
