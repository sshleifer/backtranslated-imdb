Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is bad on earth as everyone else. Irish, Gypo and Irish colleagues who lived in the 1920s were part of an underground rebellion against the British. Any accuser in the murder of the British is secretly back to the city. His friend thinks he can trust Gypso, but the award of $ 20 is very attractive. Gypo kills his wife, and despair and drunkenness fall into a pit. Meanwhile, other Irish rebels are looking for information. Immediately, Cipo, burning a hole in his pocket, is undoubtedly theirs, but they are his friends, they do not want to believe it. The story of The Informer is simple on its surface, but it is a complex of moral and emotional issues. This is one of John Ford's most emotional films. What Gypo was doing was wrong, but we can understand his motives. We also understand his sad character and have many sincerity for him. The scenario is also very sharp. Once we have been convinced that we know how to deal with everything, we have to break our teeth and carry it with it. The player is striking. Victor McLaglen, a performer of many Ford performances, gave his best performance here (and won the Oscars for it). Every actress in the film deserves its power. Along with a magnificent script and player, The Informer is one of John Ford's most staging movies. I love Ford's dark side. The Informer reminds me of my favorite philosophy, including my favorite Ford films, Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948) in my favorite spirit, From this point of view, it is a bit similar to the Body Vintage (1940). 10/10.
