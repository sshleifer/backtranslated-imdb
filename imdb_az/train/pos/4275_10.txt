In fact, I was surprised that there were many comments about this movie. I saw him at a large American university within the Slavic film festival. But no one in the US has heard of it, it's a shame! Dynamism among people is also funny and sad. Together we were stuck together on a long bus journey - we were the ones most of us! But this was not the case! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where it stands for the funeral. Then men and women leak to some lovemaking in the woods, but watch them all to watch without knowing them! He adjusts his eyebrows and goes all the way - it starts with exhaustion and everyone is watching! Talk about what they are surprised! But ... even if hilarious is funny, you really need to feel for them! At the end, they are so happy! Just humor is good!
