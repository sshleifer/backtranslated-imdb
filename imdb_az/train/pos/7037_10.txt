This is a brilliant political satire. <br /> <br /> Another good movie, starting with this period, showed that Rendition simply showed that it did not ignore much in the United States. <br /> <br /> He said that the United States is a fun war machine for torture, murder and prosecution of wanted citizens for the common world domination. <br /> <br /> A clever area, some of the great stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, who is Marisa Tomei) who are well-operated, and some delusional scenes make a hit on this movie. Unfortunately, Americans do not like to hear the truth about themselves, especially when they have been charged with mass murder.
