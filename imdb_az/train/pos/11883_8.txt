I saw this movie a week ago and still think. I'm very happy with this movie. I found the characters very convincing and about a mistake. As with real life, sometimes people are disappointed, like Leo, I love her character, but even if I have full awareness of the status of HIV, I will not be disappointed when it comes to unprotected sexual intercourse. I was disappointed with Leo to immediately stop her medication and in a terrible way she was treated when Marcel decided to return her on the plane. In my opinion, this film is quite realistic why HIV shows in young gay men. It was not meant to wear gays (my gay) in any way and it could have been a very good movie about a young plain who made bad choices and seemed unaware of the consequences for herself and others. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> This movie The biggest message is that there is no gay or straightforward SEX!
