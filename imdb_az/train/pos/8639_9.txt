I thought the first 75-80% of this movie was fun, because you have to start apologizing. Mostly Brad Pittin's performance. Not at all. <br /> <br /> The performance of all the actors was pretty good, but Brad stole the feature film. The atmosphere was perfect in all respects. <br /> <br /> I'm not a Pittin giant, but it should be one of her best roles. <br /> <br /> Desirable, Honest, Gritty. <br /> <br /> All good words to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> I was reading from a previous look and said that the man was not justified by the early violence. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < / STRONG> I think humor in the first half is ideal for this movie. They got it.
