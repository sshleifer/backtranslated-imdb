Although this movie is pretty old, it still makes me laugh, no matter how many times I look. <br /> <br /> The film has a special quote. <br /> <br /> Danny's partner, Danny's (Joe Piscopo), goes back to a disability office and parks, "can not park here, with disabilities." <br /> <br /> Danny replied, "I'm disabled, I'm psychotic." <br /> <br /> Regardless of how many times you watch the film, Johnny Dangerously stands in the best 5 comedy / spoof movies of all time. <br /> <br /> In addition bonus, he is also cast poster actor Peter Boyle. So, watch this movie, and you'll be hooked, like many others watching myself and her.
