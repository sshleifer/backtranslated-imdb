Surely, it was the worst movie I've ever seen. The first part of the film, though strange, has a light and amusing quality. Travel begins with such a peaceful celebration that praises and emphasizes the beauty of the Appalachian hills. But that does not come from the faith. Significant social problems (inbreeding) and deformation of the rural population are the first concern of the film. I still do not hear Bobby's pain and I'm shaking. Lewis's foot made me feel elegant. However, although the film is very heartwarming and exciting, it has created some interesting questions. When is the life of another man moral or right? How can anxious temper or unkindness make us different in some circumstances? Does life have a more important and ethical integrity than itself? If the film does not produce any results, it really is a success (although it is really vital and terrible, in spite of certain aspects).
