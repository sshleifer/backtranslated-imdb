What a strange surprise to find in the past television. If I had just prepared a short story on the television list before I saw the movie, I would. Hit-man-seeing - the idea of ​​a movie that leaves a diminished-wanting-job-love ... sounds. But the movie works. From the beginning of the film it is clear that the person is weighted on his shoulders even before making a statement. The look and feel of the film is perfect. <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "text-align: justify;"> Macy is a repressed She shows sadness and her bedtime meetings with her young son are incredible. This young boy shows his ability to move well beyond the years and his father and son are very natural, individual and loving. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best films I have ever seen. I do not believe that yesterday's night television was accidentally encountered.
