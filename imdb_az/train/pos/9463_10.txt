I like "Dan in Real Life". There is a wonderful journey-to-love story, but laughs, or ridiculous gags and rude jokes are not romantic when you're in your bed or lying, you want to throw. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) Coming to a family gathering / trip to a day, she connects with Marie (always beautiful Juliette Binoche) and links her with a brilliant example of a woman drawn to a flawless filter returning to the start of the classic cinema. Chemistry is a cup of tea and scrubbing, but Marie should be extinguished for the previous engagement and they should take their path. <br /> <br /> Later, we are being treated for Dan's tight braided, entertaining lover, but when combined with a great deal, they also use intelligent and sweet Dorky as a gateway to many bachelor jokes. Although the characteristics of the family seem to be indifferent to some, I really liked that it was a great parody of a large family that was not paradoxically or very exaggerated. The Burns family is simply a very close-knit group that is interested in the best of Dan. There are unusual unusual moments in the family. Family is strange, but never meaningless or gossip; <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> And so it started with a sad sadness and entertaining lover. <br /> <br /> I can continue but I thought this movie was just awesome. In contemporary comedies as it is in modern cinema, this is not particularly "hip" or "smart", it's never too wordy, and it's just about the word of dry humor or foolish minds. The story has a beautiful balance of visual and funny but real dialogue. In fact, at the early stage of the film, the initial spark of love starts with confused debates in the classic Hollywood-style conversation, which says that characters are thought to be loud. <br /> <br /> Probably, I'm rambled and repeats myself, but I recommend Dan in Real Life. This is a great history film, you trust, laugh, and when you're like a geek like me, you'll look a little teary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <span style = "font-family: Level: A
