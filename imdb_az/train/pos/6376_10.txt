If you have children or daughters who love action, adventure, fantasy and imagination without the need of every twelve minutes, this is the Disney movie for you! My sons loved every minute of this movie and I often sounded in the movie. There is no unpleasant song to be in the form of a magnificent story, and all the characters themselves are lovely and identifiable. It should become one of Disney's "classics" for this beautiful-looking scenery and non-stop excitement!
