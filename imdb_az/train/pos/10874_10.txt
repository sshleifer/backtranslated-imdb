<br /> <br /> Last night, I was expecting something different from the first sight of Cut, though it was unexpectedly happy with the fearsome Australian ship. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> I'm like the real terrific fan came and just found ' Cut is not the best genre in Australia, but great parody / My only concern is that mainstream audiences will not be able to get many comedy elements - they are not smart enough to apply the film, but I can say that the horror genre, they tried to come. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm sure it's meant to be humor. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was dark. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Spring scissors were glowing - apart from the expected sticks and sticks. In short, there were plenty of diversity and creativity in sufficiently severe deaths to judge the skepticism of films. <br /> <br /> Both were Kylie Minogue's appearance (whose appearance was short) and Molly Ringwald's film for another reason - both speeches were fantastic, as well as a brilliant jockey technique by Simon Bossell ('The Castle') played a role. <br /> <br /> Generally, this movie is one of the best terrifying products of the last couple or year, as well as a beautiful satirical / parody toungue of the latter. <br /> <br /> Loved it. Go, look!
