10/10 for this movie. <br /> <br /> At present, I am a Indian Indian doctor. Beckham has left me because I'm not a fan of Mr. Fenerbahce, and I think Owen personally is very nice. <br /> <br /> <strong> Liverpool and Man Utd were rivals because they were DEAD because I was afraid to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> But then I was in Delhi to get to know some friends and fired early in the morning <br /> <br /> "I took the time to watch this movie," I thought. "<br /> <br /> I was watching the movie, and I was able to capture the name of Beckham (back in my case!), But then I really do not think of a better title for the movie. <br /> And Nagra <br /> <br /> <br /> < "Neftchi" In fact, I was only 29 years old, a professional psychiatrist, a child in the heart, who dropped Star Wars from my No. 1 position. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, like me There are so many comments made by indian-brits in this movie. <br /> <br /> 10/10 for this movie.
