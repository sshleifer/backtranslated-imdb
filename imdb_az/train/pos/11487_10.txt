As always, controversial films have mixed visions. You either love it or hate it, and everyone will not love it. This shows that the killers' perspective is something I personally should consider. You can hate them, you can understand them and feel like you can, but regardless of the film, you think of school shots from a different perspective. <br /> <br /> The film is completely handheld, I think that something works better, because it is more realistic. From the point of view of the killings, they are told that they will go from their "missions" to families, all of which hold a great day of "Zero Day" at school. Zero does not answer the day, but just gives a glimpse of the life of a two-year-old boy, and the viewer decides for themselves. Our feelings against boys are mixed up in sympathy and hatred, but we still doubt what the two young boys do. They are just as ordinary, normal life-style young people, and if we do not know what they are planning, we will not expect anything (they clarify throughout the film that no one's their plan) <br /> <br /> The two actors are full is unknown. We can only hope to do more in the future. Although it was a fictional film, Columbine did not understand the similarities. Calvin and Andre have seen similarities to someone who looks strange like Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold (who is not very visible, but somehow) who has studied Columbine very much, and this has almost been taken as a basis. <br /> <br /> The real massacre is demonstrated at school by surveillance cameras and it's one of the hottest things I've ever seen. When I saw it, I was completely shocked and feeling a little over a period of time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the past, we merely stated that the killings were "psychopaths" branded, or we were thinking of biodiversity-related or affected by the media, but sometimes Zero Day shows that motifs are even deeper, and how much we have to do with school tragedy, up to the moment you see it.
