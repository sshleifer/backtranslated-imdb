I'm lucky to get a free shift to Scoop before scanning last night. Spontaneous applause happened at the theater at the full house and at the end of the movie. The two teenagers sitting next to me were worried for most of the film, and though scandalous, Scoop did not like it. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is the fastest growing crime. A young female journalist student is hindering by unclean forces. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is not a bad addition to Woody Allen's filmography. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is similar to that of the film. It is not a good thing, it is a very pleasant and light hearted thing. Almost in the midst of packages, it is easy for me to be an average Woody Allen movie. If you are a fan of Woody Allen, you will likely enjoy it. If you are indifferent to his work, 'Scoop' is enough to show more interest. I do not think anyone who does not like the style and function of the film will change their minds. Woody, though inevitably approaching in a forced and dangerous way in this film, has the same kind of neurotic character that we are accustomed to. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, in my opinion, very good speeches are very important in my opinion. Missing Ian McShane is not enough with the perfect camera. Hugh Jackman is as charming noble and I think Woody Allen has found a new regular star to work with Scarlett Johansson. I think it's just magic with 'Match Point' and their second pairing with Woody's material. May be the beginning of a beautiful relationship! I saw the movie and I'm glad I absolutely recommend it. Scary Movie 4 is more complicated than movies, so if your comedy brand is better than ever, "Scoop" is not for you. On the other hand, "Scoop" is for you, touching class, elegance and entertainment. Probably, I will introduce myself to Woody Allen, but all others should test it.
