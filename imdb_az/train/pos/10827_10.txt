Still has been compared to Crazy Spinal Tap because both are comedy about rhythm R & R groups. In fact, the similarity ends because Still Crazy is better written and implemented, but the Spinal Tap scripts are reduced to the first 10 minutes of soft entertaining to create an enhanced look compared to Beavis and Butthead. Still is Crazy, but the unexpected high quality of the characters and some musical numbers for me has been able to pay for the predictability of the movie. People who were waiting for a spinal tap on Satire were disappointed by the light hearted nature of the movie, but I would have a Still Crazy's laughing mock form, with a sweet yet unsuccessful shot on the satirical Spinal Tap.
