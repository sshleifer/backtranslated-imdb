I remember the first thing that was seen in early childhood, I did not read the subtitles and thought Sonny Chiba was Sean Connery. But I liked the concept very much. If you can not at least partially stop your juvenile suspension and you are not able to close your age to seven, you may want to avoid this movie. That is, since I watched the 137-minute version on DVD, I ate that as I did when I was seven years old, I really liked it (I figured it). <br /> <br /> There are aspects that are worthy of criticism for the movie, the first 15 minutes and the last 15 minutes are both really funny moments, the most controversy among the scenes played in the last 10 minutes, and supportive music support (listen to the lyrics). <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad because they are tense in time. <br /> <br /> With the end of the movie, I decided that this was a good thing, and seven of it was a bad thing despite the 'wrestling' wrestling. <br /> <br /> There is also a very pleasing strange act for a motion picture, especially a few of the epic battle scenes among the armies and armies of the Shogun era. The creators of the film have ensured that as many deaths are bloody and that it can be met, it is humorous. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a beautiful form and I said it was a kid. <br /> <br /> I actually have to spend the film on the egg shells trying to change the durability of space time, heavy-caliber machine guns, mortar balls, rocket launchers, tanks and helicopters, and hell to establish feudal Japan. <br /> <br /> In short, the movies that are watching are sorry that there is no more movie at a moment like the audience, and I do not want to think about doing so with a similar IMDb user. , but also offers a number of heavy instructions on what a movie like GI is. Samurai is very unique.
