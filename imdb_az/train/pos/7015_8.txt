Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS Agent who practically stores everyone for the surprise. <br /> <br /> Many of us have heard a line from the IRS agent saying, "Hello, I'm from the IRS, I'm here to help." <br /> <br /> You will not be able to name this boy when you get closer to this story. It's easy for those audited. What is his motive? From another planet, from an angel, to a rich man who wants to do good? Of course, we need to control the audit as much as we need. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (cheating, just a joke) <br /> <br /> The film's pace is perfect, and so did not see the clues really tell me what was happening. Heavy, recurring intense attention and remained there. The whole movie works only because we can see it, and I have not seen any clues (what you say, Willis?). Not reading the box after watching a DVD movie is a great way to go here. Until the end of the movie we finally put together all of them. Yes, it was clear at that time. And yes, it's more, but still a great story, on the contrary, Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith should be nominated for the best actor award. The remainder of the rest was also very good. <br /> <br /> Well, in spite of the above and the big legend, and you finally get all the answers, you have to understand that the movie's message is wrong. What is the message? Believe me, you will not need a lot of tips to figure it out. I did not do that. <br /> <br /> Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but nothing to excite. Mild. Nudity: No.
