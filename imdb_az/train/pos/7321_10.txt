Halloween is one of the best examples of an independent film. It is very well prepared and has more psychological features than you can do at first glance. A simple film was described very well. Music is perfect and one of the most striking results ... If you have not yet seen this movie, you have to check it out. The cast is amazing. I wish they did not continue after they continued. The first one was the best, and it ended up uninterrupted. It was nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. He was not old enough (he was beautiful today, without hairstyle and seventy dresses). Scenes through the mask are one of the most terrible things ever!
