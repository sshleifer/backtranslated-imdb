Jack Cassidy, like Ken Frankin, was brilliant. Cassidy has arrogance, confidence, charm, and mind-personalizing - each with a sense of humility, a bad deception. In my opinion, Jack Cassidy is the best killer in the Columbo series (appeared three times). This particular (and first) performance is my favorite Columbo episode - hands down. Steven Spielberg has done a beautiful camera work (which has been a shadow of camera actors several times), with a new tragedy, a distinctive and exciting moment between Simum and Franklin. <br /> <br /> If you have not yet seen this episode, you owe it to yourself - the big brigade, CA (Franklin's cabin house) <br /> <br /> < strong> Jackie Jackson was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic identity was highly contagious. In 1976, his 49-year-old death was very sad and really tragic - of course, his best years had passed before him. Rest in peace, you will live for eternity with great works.
