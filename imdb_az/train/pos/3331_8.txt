Lindsey is in the form of a corporate, career-oriented girl, but Ben is a fragile one she finds wholesome. <br /> <br /> <strong> Lindsey does not immediately see that Ben is not a potential partner. <br /> <br /> When the first date is a disastrous start when Lindsey's food poisoning shakes with a fierce situation? and his resonant retching gives us the first clue, in fact, watching Farrelly's brother movie. Instead of accepting Lindsey - very urgent - requirement for re-planning, Ben's nurse, plays regularly and plays. <br /> <br /> When Lindsey wakes up in the morning and lying on his couch, she begins.

Will Lindsey agree with the unfaithfulness of boys during the summer months to keep up the summer? Can he really care about Ben's sport? Is the Red Sox fan's death hard and nerdy able to find all the true love? Of course, Lindsey and Ben come with a colorful, colorful friend. Lindsey's most brutal, bloody, blond and blonde Robin (KaDee Strickland) insists he should be wrong with the boy if he was still 30 years old.
