What can I say about such a beautiful movie? I saw this in Dragoncon, Georgia, in Atlanta, Georgia, this is my main city. I'm a very philosophical curious person and I enjoy the type of action movie. All night long I can say one day when I see this movie in the morning. This is not a fantastic or action movie. Let me start by telling me that I was not a fan of Witchblade and Eric Etebari, watching a little episode (it looked old and robotic). But with this performance, I really managed to win. That is, it really means winning me. After seeing the cell, I did not think there was much in this person's work. But Kasadia's performances were simply stunning. He was quite as convincing as the devil. But I was very surprised to see this character since I looked in detail. Then I looked at the internet and found that Eric won the best actor award, and he respected me in the best of his career. Now I read about this fx and I continue to produce this project, and I just did not pay attention to (Brian Mercy). They did a great job, but the story I thought to be the most intriguing was more impressive (like Godzilla, I really enjoyed watching movies). I did not sleep after thinking of this movie again and again. The situation of a protected family is not easy. I showed my trailer to my comrade and he almost cried. This is a movie that I think constantly and I would highly recommend.
