I was amazed at the fact that the film can be both cheesy and excellent. Frisbee flying saucer was at the edge of the concept, especially during the opening, but the special effect on the Krell attack was awesome for a movie made half a century ago! When JJ Adams, a Middle East resident, offered Alta a more modest dress, I saw the shamelessness of Islam shatter and, as an engineer, was surprised by the imaginations used for "futuristic" gadgets and fell asleep by the gizmos. All this, an entertaining half hour, for the first time, I saw the chance to see Walter Pidgeon and Leslie Neilsen as a 'young' man
