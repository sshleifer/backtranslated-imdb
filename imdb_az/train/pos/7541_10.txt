This Showtime movie really deserves a viewer rating of more than 4.5; I gave it a 10 story based on the story and two stars. After reading the audience comments, I was surprised to see how this film was a comedy. Yes, I'm listed as Comedy / Dram under IMDb-i Janr. This is not exactly misleading, is not it? Fortunately, I saw the movie before entering this webpage, so you did not have that expectation. In fact, I was expecting a full Drama to be heard. <br /> <br /> This is another factor that can lead to very few voices, which is based on many characters. 'Missing Daisy's Missing' is another example of a movie that comes to mind. The previous one complained about a boring test. Tom's (Danny Glover) work scenes seemed to drift from the actual scene of the film. That is, if he had prepared his social uprising or his personal armies. <br /> <br /> <strong> Professor of Qafqaz University </ font> <br /> <br /> He proved that nothing would stop him from joining the white neighborhood. When another black man moved to the next door, his scar does not have the skin color. Because everything represents 'interloper'; Everything left behind by Tom. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of this movie (by Whoopi Goldberg) is one of the strongest written, directed and active. I'm glad to be a witness. I realized that the film was not nearby (I do not want to give it). Whispers verbally and Whoopi gives it. At the moment, Tom does not yet disclose to Tom whether he is talking to Tom when he wakes up in the middle of the night, when he or she delayed it. However, the penalty is great. <br /> <br /> My favorite type of squabbling is that people suffer from problems, some pains, dances, grow up, change and live. is going. As a spectator as a member, I can learn something or inspire it.
