First things first! Although this is a lot of action, this is not a motion picture! I can compare it with American sports movies! A team of very bad players can not imagine winning a game or tournament without waiting This is not a football or baseball, but Taekwondo! In the beginning, these street thieves do not look good for anything! But soon we know that we do not want to be murderers and have achieved something in life! It's nice to see them fight and exercise! I was surprised at how funny this movie was! You laugh your pants from beginning to end! Young Korean actors are very convincing! Go to this beautiful movie you see a good movie!
