The best show since Seinfeld. She is really laughable. She does not generally show herself, she's going to go for gay neighbors, songs or cartoons, to make the most fresh show on this TV. At least I give a point to watch. The scene with a smart old black lady in the drugstore ("wait for you to be close", with a finger and lol), an overdose of cough syrup, when you are lying with God, is so funny or so foolish. The weak points indicate that your sister and the police are just pretty darn! I really do not expect something that I did not feel for any show for a long time until the next show.
