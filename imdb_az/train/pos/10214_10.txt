For me, this review may be spoiler, but I want to watch movies that have no idea what's going to happen, so most of the other analyzes we see in this movie are in spoilers! <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie again and should repeat that it's the best ending for any movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. The original translation of the "butterfly's wings" is not used as the name translated. In my opinion, the majority of Americans think they do not know what the Chaos theory is (except for those who see or read Jurassic Park). Based on film chaos theory, a small event can have an effect on the outcome of events that do not result in an event. The film is a miraculous reason and a hurricane of effects, as we follow a chain of chaos similar to a few characters (about 20). Nevertheless, despite this end, the latter seems inevitable, but if you think about it, this is a perfect ending. Think about yourself, "Do you need anything else"? At the same time a very daring end. Too bad we have to go abroad for a stone like this, but it never comes out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
