On the opening night, Vanity's play with an unwitting audience. <br /> <br /> Gertrude Michael has a magnificent role playing a strange act of hate to end a marriage. The show's stars play a major role in Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as in the 'sweet marihuana' number in Bette Midler in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> We almost know that the girl loves Dorothy Stickney from Brisson. far away, the wardrobe woman (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and the scene manager (Jack Oakie) comes to everything. A large number of musical numbers are twisted. The show is the most famous song "Cocktails Two". Kitty Carlisle also says, "Where do they come from?" And Duke Ellington has a strange rhapsody that entered the Harlem specialty number! <br /> <br /> Some horrible moves, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is also very good. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton Homer, Toby Wing, Nancy, Donald Meek, a doctor, and you can see that she can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the daughters of the king.
