<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" neo-Shaw Brothers action and Ringo Lam combination of urban cynicism. Watching a movie, the battle scenes in nature may feel that not only fair, but it does not matter, the attitude and atmosphere of the counts. This is a great movie! I always try to be different from his contemporaries, Lam our traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Chi-Kwan), and the "Raiders of the Lost Arkin" setting puts up with. However, they can see a Jet Li movie is obviously heartfelt comedy art. Instead of the fatal consequences of these guys are fighting with death. Further improves the film that anyone can die at any time, return. Too bad, they do not shoot movies like this one often.
