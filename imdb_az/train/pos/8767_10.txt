I had a new admiration for Bill Pullman and I saw this movie as a success because we wanted to see all his films and entered a stage where we were thankful to God! This movie has been compressed with me since then and it has been my favorite! <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene wanted to strike just before going to college. but their visit resulted in a more complicated story. They carry out the fight they are being held in Thailand and they are being jailed very intensively and intensively. Imagine, incredible drawings, noisy fantasy, and accurate and definitely transmitted messages for movies. I really can not find the right words to describe how this movie feels when I look at me every time. I would like to know that some people did not rate me much at the film's rating, but probably see it! I will promise you to stay with you!
