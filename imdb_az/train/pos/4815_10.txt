This is my favorite list of all time! It's a fantastic and deep movie. Historically interesting and nice to watch! I thought the player from Emily Blunt was fantastic and Rupert was a fantastic Albert who was voted the best actor for Albert. The costumes were brilliant, and the settings and scenes such as the opera house were beautiful and detailed. I just loved it all! I liked childhood scenes, was 'harassed' by Con Conroy. According to her mother, she should go through the stairs with adults. Once again writers did it! They made this fantastic post! <br /> <br /> This is worthy of awards. (Oscar and BAFTA for Sandy Powell, for costume design), BAFTA for the best makeup and hair, Best Performance in Artistic Management, Best Suit Design, Best Costume Design for Best Success in Makeup, and Best Actress Emily Blunt CDM's Movie-Making Costume Design Excellence. What is PFCS.Sudbury Cinefest for Best Costume Design for the Best Feature Film Award for Hampton Film Awards? Best Actress, VFCC for Emily Blunt.) Totally 10 wins and 11 nominations! This is pretty good! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/awards Wait for yourself, it is really interesting! Personally, Rupert had to get a Friend Award.
