Dahl is under the influence of Wenders' "American Friend". Innocent Nick Cage is hired for a hit. Dennis Hopper plays real Hit Man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The hero tried to save himself more. And the smaller city is safer than America's big city. Like the predecessor we have mentioned above, this film has many corners and incredible revolutions, but all this leads to the discovery of cathartic self.
