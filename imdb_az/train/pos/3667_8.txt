The Canadian movie reviews a satirical view of Hollywood North, Canadian movie history, when the Canadian government offers great tax concessions for the movies produced in Canada. It was often regarded as a cheap taxpayer or a cheap way to buy American movies. For example, Porki came out. Anyway, Matthew Modine plays an inexperienced producer who wants to adapt a favorite Canadian novel. But to get the money, he needs a star of the American name. He takes a soft ball and learns that the film must first come to the point that it resembles his book. Can be played in Canada, but the Great White can not be understood beyond the North. We think Americans sell ourselves, but we miss the point where we are really satirizing. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
