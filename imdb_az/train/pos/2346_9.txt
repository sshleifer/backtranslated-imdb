Very cute pilot. Show of Tim Burton's best films - Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie and Chocolate Factory. Tim Burton cries for cinematography, story, music, foreign sounds. <br /> <br /> As I have seen in the forums, yes, Anna Friel plays a poor man's role. Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see on the screen I see Zooey. Do not take me wrong, Anna Friel does a great job. Her character is very sweet and cute and easily added to her. <br /> <br /> The Prophet (saas) said: "O believers, I was trying to remember where I knew and just looked Wonderfalls !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Swoosie Kurtz (Garp by the World) and Ellen Greene (The Horrors' Little Store) are no two underrated character actresses failing to bring their performances.
