Ok, here's a ton of appreciation, maybe what can I add? <br /> <br /> I will try it anyway. <br /> <br /> The reason I'm my favorite Scrooge is the cause of everything. Sets, open spaces, clothes are very beautiful and original. Music is very cute. Support is very powerful. One of my favorites is the narrator and nephew of Roger Rees. His neat sincerity touches and her voice is Milad's voice for me. David Warner is also absolutely convincing Bob Cratchit. He has a difficult life, but he is positive and worthy. Of course, of course, the best part is George C. Scott, Ebenezer Scrooge. It was terrible because someone described it. More satisfied. Whether it is cold or tough, its exchange at the beginning is not characteristic. He is a man who has a heart that is stubborn by his grace for life and wealth. <br /> <br /> During prisons, he is not all fleshly. We see hope here. If it were to disappear completely, Marley did not come first. And we did not hope for all of us. I think Dickens is a big part of what he wants to say. When Scrooge looks at the employer's dance with Belle, you see his beloved smile as he says he will pass Belle in his life "with a ghost". Clive Donner was quite smart enough to film these moments as director. Sometimes they remain in the regulatory room. <br /> <br /> And finally, his transformation is full of joy that every time I cry tears of joy. His brother Fred's apology is so sincere and moving, not just Christmas, but the essence of man. The joy that Freed has brought to his spouse is very clear. And every time the line goes to me, "Forgive me when I wasted God." <br /> <br /> Bravi tutti!
