It is a terrible horror that long played by Sidney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. Finding a copy of this movie is sometimes difficult, but it's worth it. This movie is both creepy and at the same time cheesy. Apparently, three teenage dresses (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) went to a small town in Solavang, where a confusion occurred, and Earnest Keller (Lassick) and her bizarre Virginia. Vickie goes behind, feels ill, and others shoot 2 films. Soon it is strangled at home by an influential person hiding in the ventilation system (he is covered with a lid on his mouth because he pours it into the basement and enters the basement). Soon Caren returns and is severely killed by removing her face from the ventilation coat. Jennifer struggles with a pretty dull plot with her lover and, when returning home, her homeowners (now they are brothers and sisters) are also a means to try to kill her. Virgina is not completely happy with Earnest's plans to kill Jennifer, but she entered the basement she met with Junior. Here, the film is a motionless and mentally barbarian Junior, hysterically described by Steven Furst, because the actions and actions are frightening, causing a few stumps. It's where the movie takes its speed and ends in a good way. Actors / actresses do terrible things, especially with Lassick, Furst and Bach, and it's a very funny thing, though not the least weird!
