I was really jumped (or angry) because I was a sufficiently deep fan of horror films. <br /> <br /> When it comes to the DVD you will get a better hell than a ring. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> /> <br /> <strong> </ strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Indeed, there was very little bloody mess in this movie ... maybe the studio writers you draw and everyone will realize that you do not need to squeeze red things on the set to frighten.
