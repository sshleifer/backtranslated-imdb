Good movie. He explains a childhood fantasy story, tells us how we are trapped in a social situation and what kind of actions should be different. Or at least feeling: you have to break every rule to break. If you want to express your love to someone you do not know, how would you do it without creating a social situation that you are fed up with? Also, to decide on the cultural life of others is fascism, about the culture that squeezes our throats. Disney or FOX or suicide bomber gives you the right to decide what we have chosen. It is not allowed to drink coffee in the morning. Even if we have coffee tomorrow, are we supposed to listen to NRJ shouting, foolish tabloid headlines and street ads?
