I recently watched the movie and really liked it. I surprised myself and cried. The film manages the entire aging theme with incredible originality, not the same niche as "Far From" or "Bucket List". It is indeed difficult to have the main character, as in the case of Hagar. The director is a master of the problem. Hagar is hard to understand. <br /> <br /> Hagar (Ellen Burnstyn) is taken to the nursing home by her son and mother-in-law. She figures out the most-route and freaks out. Its edges are really hard. That means. He is modest and selfish. She dropped. <br /> <br /> We are thinking about the film's course. Why do not we love Petunias, why he chases one child over others, how his loss is characteristic ... I started seeing an angel ... and I began to love him. In particular, she liked the mystery when she transferred her to the boy. Ellen Burnstyn, you're a brilliant player. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. What a scene! <br /> <br /> This is not a "good feeling" movie, but a movie that empathizes the audience. <br /> <br /> Hagar is not my mother but even my mother-in-law, in the real sense, the law or the neighbor ... but most of my life is present in many women (and men) in my life. The current parts give me more meaning, and now I have watched the Stone Angel.
