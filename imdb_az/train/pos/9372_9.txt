Red Rock West is one of the rare films you'll ever imagine what will happen in the future. Nicolas Cage is wrong for contract killer when entering a small town to find work. Dennis Hopper is a bad guy, and nobody plays them better. Look for a brief look at Dwight Yoakam, country-famous. This is often a serious drama, but there are some light moments. You will benefit from this low budget but high quality effort!
