I've seen this movie for the first time yesterday and I'm very glad. I'm a screen writer and I liked the way the little characters interrupted when something pivotal / climate was happening on the scene. <br /> <br /> I thought the dialogue was very sharp, and the story was so shocking - at a certain point, Barbara Stanwyck explicitly flirting with her daughter; And awaken a little passion for her husband for over ten years; And with an armed signal, "two shots and then one" closes with the old shag mate Dutch (with the reason he left primarily the city) ALL the same time! <br /> <br /> <strong > Caucasian <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best films I have ever seen.
