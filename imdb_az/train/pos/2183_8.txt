Billy Wilder is a trade union for the story, and his extraordinary touch is reflected in this pretty tale of writers working for Oliver Courtney, a legend of music. Crosby's most charming, big turn is a clever and brilliant mix with the legend of Broadway, Maryam Martin, with many beautiful songs (and more memorable ones). and Basil Rathbone and the Oscar Levant provide most of the gravel huts (Levant is rarely and has never written her quips). It is a surprise for all fans of the genre.
