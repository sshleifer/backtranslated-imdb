I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival, and this is not a film, but sometimes it is sometimes shot by HBO, which is sometimes shown on the cables network this year. This film presents a captivating and disciplined fetish pinup, which is a B & D stag movie actress with enough talent to become a true actress. The page was a bit more and touched part of the other role models in the modeling, but the 50's pinup symbol is not enough to balance his career. This film is probably based on Richard Better's Bettye Page book. It was black and white for the nostalgia feelings of the 1950s. I have a book called "The Legend of Bettie Page Pinup", which contains many beautiful photographs of the page, and I have to say that it reflects the film with Gretchen Mol. with precision. Bettie Page is Bettie Page with black wig and brown contact lenses. There is only Bettye Page view, but it has the smile and features of the camera's perfectly low personality. His body is close to one possible copy. Awesome casting. The story is thin and it's a tabloid type and, of course, it would be better. But this is a pretty good television movie. I rate it from 10 to 7.0 degrees and I suggest that it be reviewed when it appears on TV.
