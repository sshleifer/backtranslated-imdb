This interesting documentary tells a remarkable story about an expedition for Tibetan children who are trekking in the Himalayas; but also a personality deficiency between two beautiful people. On the one hand, Eric Weihenmeyer, the first blind man to climb Everest, and a group of climbers (directors) who direct children. On the other hand, Sabri Tenberken, a woman who performs a first-class Tibetan school, has doubts about how she has admitted this expedition but has subsequently been advancing. On some levels, Sabine simply does not understand the mountaineer's philosophy (with an emphasis on the peak); it may be right for mountaineers to identify inconsistencies between the targets and the wishes of the children, but because of its accuracy, especially because it is an effective veto, it lends itself to a difficult human being. In the aftermath of this (cleverly well-behaved) conflict, we focus on the lives of children. Although I love the film, though it is a message that is intended to be attractive, despite the fact that the film is somewhat ruthlessly similar to all of them. Although it is difficult to argue with this assessment, although the audience is presented a bit rigidly.
