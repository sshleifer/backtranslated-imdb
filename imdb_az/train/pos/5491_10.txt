Although we know how the story is going, this is a fly-on-the-wall movie that plays almost as a political tension. While calming down to the storm, Hugo Chavez is seen as a bigger, more sensitive person, but with a mysterious relationship with 80% of the population, deprived of Venezuela's political process and oil richness. It looks like it's dedicated to them. He sends the country to the campusinos at a heavy pace, appealing to a great crowd, kissing ordinary people, receiving letters on paper pieces, and listening to petitions for help. People were thrilled that they had come to the highest position in the land. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A parliamentarian living in the Caucasus, One of the most talented moments in the film, Ann Coulter's appearance, in a community of indigenous people, complains of mestiza, "there is no struggle or sacrifice." Later on, one speaker said "pull away from home workers": they may be Chavez's supporters. Duh! Of course, they are. <br /> <br /> In the past interview with the film teacher alone, while telling his father's story, the Chavez reveals something of the spirit. <br /> <br /> Then it starts to storm. <br /> <br /> Therefore, it can be a sensitive and poetic person. The organizers of the coup urges mass protests, and in recent days they manipulate their supporters to change the route and know that they are surrounded by Chavez supporters in the presidential palace and violence is inevitable. <br /> <br /> When shepherds start shooting at Chavez's supporters, some of them fall into the ground because of the fire. The local equivalent of Fox News shows the fire of this boat and claims that Chavez's supporters have killed the protesters. Then the camera draws and indicates that there is no protestor - the street is empty! Protestors made a different route. Chavez's special television stations (released by Chavez's Fidel Castro, the propagandist propagandist whose mental illness and sexually isolated propaganda) attacked the empty street in a fierce way. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers and their media propagandists are similar to how the situation is managed without betraying the life of open-minded fans and opponents on television. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers are a rapidly changing situation that covers this chaotic, military coup palace and threatens the bomb. Chavez finally succumbed to the bloodshed, but refused to resign and was driven to a sea island where an aircraft waited to take it - where? USA? How do the rest of the cabin members handle these massive assassinations of right-wing generals and ultra-rich businessmen closely related to the Bush administration? <br /> <br /> If you only get information about Hugo Chavez and Venezuela from the US media, you will not know anything. He is not "unlucky oppressor" and "does not rule with decree" - he was selected and re-elected by more than 60% of voters (George Bush Junior has done nothing) and loyalty <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary is an unusual movie about an unusual man in a situation. The skills of cinematographers have never been fuzzy, and they are massive and moving, with the Venezuelan voices at every level, from barracks to the presidential palace, with stunning scenes, chaos and confusion. Not to be missed!
