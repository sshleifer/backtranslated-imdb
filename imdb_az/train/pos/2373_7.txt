The new film Pendragon Pictures's "War of the Worlds", the first true adaptation of the original novel, is developing for about 5 years. The freedom of theater was planned earlier this year (March 2005), but never happened. <br /> <br /> I liked this movie on certain terms. <br /> <br /> How loyal is adaptation? ? Wells is 100% loyal to the book, but 90-95% loyal to me is good. At least a few scenes were completely new, for example, Ogilvie drank tea with a farmer's confrontation with a farmer and an unnamed writer / son of his uncle's cousin. But all this film is closely following this book - of course, more than the classic version of George Palin in 1953. <br /> <br /> His biggest mistake is that it's a very cheap budget. Most of these appear to be composed of blue-drawn and digitized archives. Most of the shootings and scenes on the streets of the packed city are particularly disturbing scenes. Summaries in London in 1898 are like a video game. There were many scenes in the horse carts - maybe the horse was unable to rent it. <br /> <br /> Only scenes for Real are seen in open spaces or in the woods. <br /> <br /> However, they have done quite a bit of work under budget restrictions. With art, the movie looks right. Martians and their tripods are pretty good and Wells' drawings are very accurate. Especially affected by heat rays. Despite the sequence of Thunder Child that should be one of the main features of the movie, it is very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Movement and direction can not win any Oscars. In most cases, they are not authorized, not bad, not prominent. <br /> <br /> Although some Hollywood composers have nothing to do, the music is very good. <br /> <br /> If I get budget restrictions on this, look worse on a big screen. Some scenes are presented with different color filters (mostly red). Several nitopics: Many scenes are presented with different color filters (mostly red). It could have been an artistic choice, but it is very inappropriate and looks more like a DVD mastering business. <br /> <br /> The following line is worth seeing? The writer / narrator becomes a scene from a fake mustache scene. If you continue to look at technical and budget constraints and go into the story, I think you can really do this if you really read HG Wells. However, when you extinguish the cheap production values ​​with ease, you do it well (if you are not a MST3K fan). <br /> <br /> BTRW: A completely different version of the World War II (aka "INVASION"), but, in the same month, DVD came to Spielberg's theaters: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. It was built on a budget, but as Spielberg's movie is up-to-date - but better! Moreover, Jeff Wayne is an animated film of the best-selling album since 1978, but it will not be until 2007.
