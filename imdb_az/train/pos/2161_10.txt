As long as we want to get away from social and cultural commitments and to be free? Most of us, I doubt. We dance? is not a movie about dance. It is to learn about ourselves, to know what we are looking for in life, and to have the courage to look for it. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where honey dance is regarded as useless behavior. <br /> <br /> One day Mr Sugiyama sees a beautiful girl who goes beyond the dance academy window. she is amazed at her and eventually becomes remarkable for dance lessons. He was afraid of dancing and fear. <div> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> <div style = "text-align: justify;"> dance steps. <br /> <br /> There are some comic and warm-hearted scenes. <br /> <br /> The latter is not a fairytale, it makes the audience feel good. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit better than the Japanese people. It's a warm and very valuable movie to see.
