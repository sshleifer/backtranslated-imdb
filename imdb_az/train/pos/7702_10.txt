The Forbidden Planet represents a kind of science fiction, especially in the cinema since the 1950s. There was Life in the World and World War II, but not to forget this story, telling a story about a story that has a doctor to tell a story from one of the Shakespeare's "The Tempest" astronauts. This is not an incredible thing (though it is not surprising to look at a part of these sets and the actual machine created by physicians for 1956), but with emphasis on the symbols and its subject. <br /> <br /> On the surface - the first ten minutes -standard, if it seems to be normal, it is a technology that is far removed from the primitive side of human nature. less professionalism and better skill than B-films of the time. A ship of astronauts makes a mission to the Altair-4 planet to bring back a missing expedition ten years ago. But only one man, Dr. Morbis (Walter Pidgeon), and his daughter, who is immune to the assassination of everybody. Morbius appears to be a sincere and highly intelligent man, and his technology is so impressive that the astronauts under the direction of Gosser (Leslie Nielsen) are the only ones telling them on Earth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, there is a romanticism between Captain and Alraira and there is more aggressive vibe than a doctor: you did not come to the planet to get started, and now you have to go. What started with it is a completely intellectual level, but the Prohibited Planet should have fun with the audience when it comes to any useful idea. Everyone remembers Robbie Robot and, for the best possible reason, maybe the most memorable thing for me is the monster, which creates no benefit for the crew, is revived by the red power and looks like life from Fantasia. br> <br /> Pidon's movement is thin: you do not expect it to be betrayal, though it's something that has something to say and will eventually wait a whole lot more complex in the end. And other demonstrations, as well as Nielsen as a leader in Hollimana, have helped many in a comic relief like Cook (who should add one of the most exciting scenes in the film). And the effects of the time are remarkable (in today's nostalgic pulp way) and electronics are beautiful in its "tones". But in the end it is a scenario from Hilcox and a careful one. It hooks over the rest of the B-movie. This is intentional and it works if it is funny. When it's dramatic, it's pretty good in the tough times of players. When we begin to think about a terrible situation, it comes slowly, does not face us, or does not hit me with a mega-action. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An inspiration for many other fantastic movies,
