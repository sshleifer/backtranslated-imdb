I'm ashamed to say that I missed "Mom" when I was in the theater. I saw it tonight on the DVD. I gave 10 votes, one of the few people I gave here. This English independent was drawn with great care and quality. It bravely drew me. Thanks to the actions of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw, the story of a dishonest and completely human being is honestly and completely absorbed in honesty. Cinematography is very striking. The score has been toughened by the scheme. This story is epic, brightly decorated in the secular life of writer Hanif Kureshi. This story touches on the great issues of an impressionist picture. And some of these big issues are very controversial, which, in spite of many nominations, discloses the lack of awards they earn. It's just one of my favorite movies of all time.
