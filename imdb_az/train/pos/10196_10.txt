Kudos to Cesar Montano to revive Cebuano! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Panaghoy sa Suba is very good, The story is not that original (like a triangle of love - an occupation in Japan, a rebellion, like a lord of the Americas), the presentation is especially used in Filipino for Japanese and English, and in American for nipongo. <br /> This movie will be one of the best Pinoy movies of this year. <br /> <br /> Go ahead and follow this!
