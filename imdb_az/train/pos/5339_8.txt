Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington) and Lillian and Gabe Harris, </ div> <div style = "color: red;"> (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian appears to be a housewife, James, the attorney's office, Lillian, works in real estate and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. Do all this? <br /> <br /> <strong> Enter Abby, starred by porn star Chelsea Blue. She rents a house from the Fenways street and lives with her. At the beginning of the movie, James watches the window and Abby begins to play with his girlfriend Gigi (played by Monique Alexander) and begins to wonder what he can do with it secretly. The next day, Abby gets acquainted with the fourth and looks just like a beautiful woman living an alternative lifestyle. He is in shock in Vivian and tells him, "Oh ... I'm not that much." Everything seems to be right ... before the plan goes off <br /> <br /> First, Abby Gabe asks if she needs to fulfill the needs of the Nude, Gobain. <br /> <br /> "Talk to me about pregnancy". "What do you want to know?" "Pregnant is married happy?" "I'm married." "There are some problems ..... let me guess, your spouse is staying at home and doing everything you ask, but a good girl." "Yes." "He's not a bad girl?" "No." <br /> <br /> Abby enters the exam room, not Gabe. After that, he puts a small show on the window for James, with whom he never comes in and sexually assaulted. Jacob does not know that the toy in the piano with a red eye is actually a camera that touches all the festivals (though it is so clear). Abby then had sex with Gabe, and this time Gigi went in three ways. Now Abby has something in both men, and he needs $ 100,000 each to get the rest. <br /> <br /> When fighting against Gabala and James, Abby finds time to deceive Lillie - she "tested" with women at college. <br /> <br /> At a time when she meets with her husband and relatives, she is a girlfriend of Sex a while ago. "It's just a job," says Abby. Confessions and apologies are doing the same thing to different men in different places, if there are some strange facts about Abby's true identity. Gabe and James use this information to fight Abe's blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now for sex. Sex scenes were pretty good, and except for Julia Kruis, all the women in this movie had a long porno look, and I would not expect less. Four scenes from Nicole Sheridan were the best in the film, and the three-sided approach to the second second. Monique Alexander just once was naked, but he was a relatively small character. Julia Kruis was the main character and was naked at the same time. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ STRONG> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> your movie. Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good at this movie - better than Fred Olsen Rey's comedies later.) At least she can do drama. <br /> <br /> Sex: B (Heavy, Heavy, Heavy, Heavy, many free sex scenes, Nicole Sheridan's appearances were almost weighty), Chelsea Blue also appeared good on their scene, the two girl-girls suggestions were not burning but feverishly <br /> <br /> "Yes, I also treat this issue <br /> "B" (it was a nice soft nudity), I do not want Chelsea Blue to do more, e Nicole also goes for Sheridan - even though it is better to play comedy. I do not care about hardcore girls who can deal with softcore movies.)
