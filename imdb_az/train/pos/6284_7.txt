This film is about a thief, who is confused by Kip (Giovanni Ribsi), a large (about 50 pieces) stolen cars to shorten and break everything. Therefore, it is threatened to be killed by the commander. Now Randall (Nicolas Cage), a retired supplier, is also kidnapped with 50 cars in 3 days with the help of Kip's brother and several old friend Randall. As you can see, it's the same old, big brother 'lil' broke day worry, and of course, Randall was the best thief, of course, as in all other films there are some flaws and surprises that you never thought, but sometimes it is predictable <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> Well, this is another hot item in this film Sway (Angelina Jolie (great STAR (reassure me))) She is not very convincing in the role of car theft, but she is very hot. He's pretty hot in this role, probably he's in a real life (he does not believe me, read his biography) is a kind of wild woman, and he's just about himself for the sexual part I just know that this is a girl I love in this movie because it's not very basic but comes with a slightly different look and even a tattoo. <br /> <br /> Okay, watching this movie is a very unusual scene where there is not much, the story is just OK and there is no shock. Hey after seeing the movie: WHO CARES. Why am I still good at saying good things; There were a few cool car drivers; good music; some Bruckheimer scenes (music combination and actor lines moisturize your eyes); the best actors who do all their work; pretty car; a cool, wild, sexy lady (say, Mrs. Jolie) and last but not least to enhance your car with a very nice and cool vehicle. So some downsides are still a pretty good and entertaining movie here. Is this the coolest overall OK movie in the best way to describe this movie? <br /> <br /> As for Nicolas Cage, it would be good. She's really one of my favorite actors in the genre of action right now, after Rock, Con Air, Face / Off, Snake Eyes and finally some of these good movies. What actors have been in very good movement / tension in recent years and are such lucky? Well no one! Maybe Jackie Chan, but one of my favorites too. Although Mr. Cages is related to Bruckheimer's films, something continues to deteriorate. The rock was clear, 9, John's weather was nice 8 and this is a clear 7th. This brand is not bad. Does Bruckheimer's films show further deterioration and maybe Cage have to think before accepting his role in the movie, and perhaps he should make a little less movie? No, it does not show us, because cage films have been successful in the past few years, but exclude 8 mm and the Dead. 8mm is not big, I admit, but it was not Cage's fault and the story looked good to me. I can not say anything about the last movie because I have not seen it yet. Although I do not know if Bruckheimer asked me for these three films, I would call them all YES. Maybe I would say "The Rock" because the story was great and wanted to play with Sean Connery and Ed Harris. I declare to John Air because it would be great, because it was necessary to move with John Malkovich and Ving Rhames. And if I had a big paycheque, I would play one of these, I could drive some cool and fast cars, and I'll be able to kiss Angelina Jolie (I will not wait to see her in Lara Croft). <br /> <br /> This was Mr. Cage's good choice, and it was worth it to look at in the theater. <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7
