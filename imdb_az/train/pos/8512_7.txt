I can tell you how bad this film is. I'm in the movie and I have not seen it yet, but in fact I tolerate the idea of ​​everyone who paid for me to be drunk. Especially considering what we did that year. Undoubtedly, they have edited it. In particular, the scene where my roommate coked a Mexican prostitute (likely to follow her around). We've come a bit and we'll go, but I'm not going to forget anything. I was MC on several occasions (what I said). I can tell you that everybody wants to be remembered as a girl who does not want to be taken to the camera or puts his beaters around the world. (or the lost virginity of the missing girl). In general, the ride itself was crazy, but people were different when they were on the camera.
