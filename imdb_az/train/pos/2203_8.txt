I liked this series very much when I was a kid. In 1952 I was 5 years old, and my family always watched this show. My favorite character was played by Marion Lorne as a very strange, bumbling and very cute "aunt" type. We can still recall the "ubba bubba um um" comments so that he can tell and say something important. And then came back and played Clara Cullen Bewitched became a huge cast! <br /> <br /> For the first time, when I see Walter Mathauu, I remember his career as a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> Can someone approve it? What is Hugo Alfven's "Swedish Rhapsody" or last credit? Every time I hear playing in a classic radio station in Southern California, Mr. Peepler brings back the look of the camera with his back. I do not know whether this image is correct in the eyes of the mind.
