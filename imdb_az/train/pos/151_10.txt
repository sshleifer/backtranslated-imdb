The film was designed to impress the viewers and this movie was silent to me. Gorgeously captured pictures, hate, crime, aggression, theft and deception, that is a good picture and good performance that is associated with a dialogue. This is an intense web texture that lets me go out of the screen until I close my eyesight credits. The story is sweeping. The audience is taken to the remains of the survivors of the Spanish Civil War. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who command the screen. Supporting players make a perfect cast and a real sense of reality. Sets, lighting, decor and cinematography are great. I absolutely love the photographer.
