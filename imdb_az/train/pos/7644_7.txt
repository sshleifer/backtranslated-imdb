Jim Belushi is astonishing in the "Twilight Zone", which takes 15 minutes. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Mike Cane, not just listening to Belushi's "story", Belushi's a mysterious stick tone, "treat" for middle-class problems: magic potion to create a change in Belushi's life. <br /> Flashbacks showed the 15-year-old respectful shame that led to the defeat of the Baseball Team Championship in Lice. Belushi continues with "unpleasant life", but looks happy but always wondered what "what?" Belushi is experiencing a "different" life for something that has been seen for a few days, but a great success, admired and hated others <br /> <br /> It's not quite a "Wonderful Life", but some elements are similar and very pleasing. "Ending" can be predicted, but still satisfactory. Just look at the other woman as a very small part of the "deadly charm" for the young Cortney Cox. Very nice movie!
