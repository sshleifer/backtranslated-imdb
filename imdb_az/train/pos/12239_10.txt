Excellent fancy! Of course, all of this is supposed to happen. Unfortunately, there is no social or political message, nor is it a small attempt in this direction. Indeed, can the plot actually fall to the ground at the right time or place? It's very difficult, it's just a movie, movies and writings are not real, but imagination. The only purpose of this film is to indulge, of course, not to entertain and entertain, but to be thrown into the wind with truth, sincerely and sincerely. I look forward to clarity and originality from documentary films. But for entertainment, I would like the "Mating Game" to be described as "no-brainer" from every point of view. Now and then a few giggle and an open laugh for this imaginary fantasy fantasy.
