Many features of this movie show it instantly. The sound is very sounds and understands what great steps have been taken to eliminate noise over the years to come. Dialogue language is incredibly strange and unnatural, and reminds players to go through stage techniques. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bette Davis is always a very successful career in all his films, as he did at this time. But I also feel that the rooster's emphasis does not match the face testimony. <br /> <br /> Somerset Maughan likes to use human relationships with great dramatic intensity that will appeal to all filmmakers. Bette Davis, like many of her characteristic roles, can pass a viper full of fiery hatred from beautiful charming women. <br /> <br /> The young doctor faces true love towards the end of the film. <br /> <br /> For the end of the film, Leslie Howard is a busy street looking for a good partner and a bad choice. They go through all the traffic that is unnecessary to scream at them with many horns and spells. This scene is likely to be funny, but it is very funny in a very serious film. Perhaps you are sorry to be sent home with a smile on your face. And a happy end to what we have seen (and hopefully).
