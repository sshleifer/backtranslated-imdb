I've seen this movie many times and I do not understand why some people compare it with BABE for my life. This film is not about the secret life of ALL animals that can talk in secret. Instead, a little girl who is a serious fraud about a Parrot who is learning to speak to help the owner, to leave the stage at an early heartbeat just to overcome his speech barrier. Then begins a great journey. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paulie Parrot set out to try and find Marie, a great friend. <br /> <br /> On the way, he meets some nice people and many bad guys. She falls in love with the girl keeper and loses her. <br /> <br /> He has become a criminal offense taken by an evil scientist seeking his own resignation. <br /> Marie. <br /> <br /> Tony Shalub shines like a good-hearted Janitor, who has an open mind and great heart, and, despite the risks, helps little Paulie. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> Jay Mohr Parrotun plays one of the liveliest characters in his voice and its sequence. <br /> <br /> There is a little entertaining language, entertaining and watching. This is a story of a clever, clever, epic animal adventure and ultimately a great love story about a bird and a little girl. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < He realizes that the birds, especially the parrots, are not one-off pets. <br /> <br /> Some children see that they have created the deep gardens of their pets and that the dog or the parrot's love and devotion are a valuable gift. <br /> <br /> BABE is an incredible journey twist here. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and do not try to fall in the sad part.
