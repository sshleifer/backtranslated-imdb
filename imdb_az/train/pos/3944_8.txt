This little movie was on my "goalkeeper" list for a long time. How have people actually cured by the medical profession in the centuries-old menopause, emotional abuse women (how mentally weakened) have exited? All the devout Christian behavior of that era was fatal to investigate TRUE emotional perceptions, which allowed them to embrace the troubled spirits, to investigate what our surroundings cover. Can you imagine Walt Whitman's books (according to today's standards) forbidding women to perceive women's feelings and feelings as women? Think of it! The sensitivity of this film still takes me and I give it credit for the director's eyes.
