Zombie 3 has an interesting date. First of all, Fulci's continuation of Hit Zombi 2, and Zombi 2 itself, of course, continued with George A. Romero's Dead aka Zombi's Dawn, for it was a marketing affair to deceive these guys. Is it mixed enough? Basically, none of the movies are interrelated, but who cares when earning money. I guess Fulca will start to think about half of the production when it decides to go out of Zombi 3. <br /> <br /> Zombie 3's plan is a typical zombie recipe. Bruno Mattei, Scientists are developing a serum on an island in the Philippines, the terrorists are stealing a plague and zombie amnesty. Scientists want to create an antidote, and the military collapses without betraying anyone. Radio DJ is also an addition to how the planet is treated. <br /> <br /> Generally, I really liked this movie. I heard terrible things, but we found the dialogue of the dialogue very enjoyable. Film, pollution, broken military, a man playing God and so on. It seems like an attempt to increase awareness. It feels like a serious movie at one point, but it's pretty fun in the coming of Mattei <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < strong> You heard Radio DJ breaking good news: "When you see men in white clothes and gas masks, run them for help." This, of course, appealed to the appearance of men in white collection of zombies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> According to Crazies, how cool is it? Allow me to count paths. Zombie Birth 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Birds. 4. The zombie who does not have feet in the pool. My favorite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac on the petrol station. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If a sergeant insists on making a zombie cream, scientists ask, "When the ash remains in the air, Will it fall and pollute everything? " Since Sargeant responded with boldness, "Now you speak science fiction." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <strong> <strong> <strong> </ p> <p style = "text-align: justify;" <strong>
