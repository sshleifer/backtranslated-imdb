Deatthrap is a whodunit. Who will do it first to whom? It is very difficult to describe this movie without giving anything, so I will not say anything about the area. Cris Reeves is a young play writer, Clifford, who plays the best role. Indeed, you see it as a terrifying way to "pull out the flower burgers" from the ability to act in this movie. Clifford plays such a tough role, and I have never seen Clifford playing on both sides of the spectacle playing scene. The actor plays him as a small slave or plays as a deadly mania. Reeves is the only person I have ever seen. When it comes to Michael Caine ..... he is Michael Cain. One of the best players in the last 50 years and this movie is as good as ever.
