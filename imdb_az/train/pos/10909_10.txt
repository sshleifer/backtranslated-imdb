As with all Angelopoulos films, Stork's step-by-step approach requires a close and intimate presence of the audience, which, of course, led to a limited popularity of his work. Dialogs are kept without monologues or substitutions that dispel internal conflicts, doubts or emotions of heroes. The filmmaker prefers viewers to keep away from their emotional reactions and, instead, force them to investigate and learn the characters themselves. As a result, the player is open and clear, and is indispensable and covered. Movement scenes are defined between the longest distance to which the viewer wants to participate, and an actor to explore his own psyche. As in a novel, the drama provides a template to the reader and / or past experiences developed in the writer's footwriting, Angelopoulos's drama is in his drawings: long use of long drawings, pacing, audiovisual dialogues transformed into a trademark, invites viewers to watch the film from personal view. <br /> <br /> Angelopoulos uses the silence to think of high violent moments, reverberating gestures, eyes, sounds, and music when he thinks it only believes he can take us today. <br /> <br /> Music is more than just a discreet backdrop of Anelopoulos's long-running Eleni Karaindrou, but it's a dramatic piece of story. Most of the film is made up of exquisite, shaded colors and exterior views highlighted in intoxicated winter light. Angelopoulos introduces us to "another Greece", and these tourists drowned the infinite sun with blue sky and emerald seas that differed from Greek brochures. Here, the sky is covered and gray, the weather is cold and smoky, and the modest beaches have been replaced by trampled, dirty snow in the streets of the sandy streets. <br /> <br /> Angelopoulos's genius movie is displayed across the screen through the Arvanitis Camera. <br /> <br /> "Stork's dismissal step" is a political commentary that focuses on the socio-political situation of the Balkans, the 20th century. It is deeply troubled by the meaning of the "frontier" and the victims of the disorder among peoples. Waiting for refugees, political or others left in the "waiting room" facing the Albanian border. They can escape from a political frontier but, unfortunately, they are still working with them and depend on their deeper fatherland borders: languages, customs, and races. Although Angelopoulos's political views are well-known, the film is far from any political discussion on the obvious reasons for refugees. In this process, Angelopoulos forces us to think of geographical, cultural, political, and personal "boundaries". <br /> <br /> Angelopoulos sees himself as a historian of Greece in the 20th century and forces him to discuss his Greek myths. In this film, he crosses himself between the Yunus and Italian cultures and carries out some of the boundaries of the Homeric and Dantesque traditions of the Odysseus journey. Iskender is a Telemachus calling a story about an old Greek politician / Odysseus lost and not heard again. This political man was unable to live in a refugee camp at the bottom of a low-dripping, unexpected and clear bourgeois existence, the comfort of his wife and his brilliant career. He was a poet in the exile, wondering how to change the world. Of course, the "politician" is not Alexander's father, but the "politician" stands as Alexander's former father / Odysseus. <br /> <br /> Dear Mrs, like Homer, Telemachus, Alexander grows up as a man in odyssey. <br /> <br /> Certainly, in a modern context, it's a mistake to try and see an example of Homer Odyssey. Angelopoulos draws on Odysseus's journeys as only film-making and thematic elements. With the end of Angelopoulos, "Odysseus" is more dependent on Dante's Odysseus: It does not go to Ithaca, "it holds a bag." Iskender / Telemachus was "stopped" when returning to his home or career or traveling elsewhere. Dante's "Inferno," a voice in the beginning of the film, "Do not forget that the time has come for a trip again, the wind away from your eyes." "<br /> <br /> Finally, if Angelopoulos is not a religious person, there is also a Greek Orthodox religious topic in the film, which is in the form of errors in the form of communications, reconstruction of communications, as well as a figure of the "politician" of the Christ, on the final stage, these yellow men once again influenced the influence of the Byzantine iconography in the work of Angelopoulos <br /> <br /> Religious leaders belonging to Pozdruda tradition appear to be stylites like soloists and hot men who place their columns on the columns. <br /> <br /> The film ends without a solution The Mastroianni Angelopoulos does not give us any clues and humor t wife, "This is not" is convincing and fairly uncertain: The important issue of the film is whether it is her, whether politically and politically. But the movie ends with an optimistic note yet. Whereas the poles only escape from the pole along the pole, and communication across the border is not yet possible, and we note that the last scene was taken from one point across the river: the camera crossed the border and the rear watch shot invited Aleksandr and the spectator to take the border aside. According to this account, Angelopoulos hopes somehow, some borders will end.
