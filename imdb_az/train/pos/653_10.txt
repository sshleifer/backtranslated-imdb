"La Maman et la putain" is the most beautiful film of all time. <br /> <br /> Proust can be a link between the reality and art that he has inspired directly from the "A la Recherche du temps perdu". <br /> <br /> Explain the same story with the look of "La Maman et la putain" and "Looking for lost time": One of the failures of love is repeatedly repeated: the first woman's name is always Gilberte and the second woman Gilberte's twisted and deformed it looks like a pair: Veronica is like a beautiful "whore Gilberte" in the night, whereas Gilberte is clean and "beautiful in the daytime." After a first love failure, a second love begins, but it is already the first one, Veronica, in the life of Alexandre and in the film Gilberte replaced by Alexandre Veronica, Gilberte, in the first place, is a complete story that repeats himself, like Alexandre's infinite appearance and "Proust" loyal to a higher point in love, but at the same time he said "a fraudulent woman." but it also emphasizes misinterpretations. /> <br /> Transitions between art and the illusion of love cause those who are in the truth and study this truth. For example, when Veronica saw that she was in a strange way, she said that after she found the answers she had seen in a film, she was a film for "how to live and how to bed." Alexander wants to live as if in a movie, he wants his life to be art. <br /> <br /> This art concept comes from Proust, who shares Eustache with the same "political art" and realism in art. "La Maman et la putain" fights "the main political" against the art concept - for example, the revolt of a political film by Alexander. Like Proust, he says, "Art does not care about all this news and it is only in silence." First, art is a peculiarity. Therefore, realism and naturalism are rejected: art must change the existence of truth. Proust writes: "I find the misguidance of the lie that lies." For this reason, La Maman et la putain hides its pseudonym, the text of the actors is "Eustache," emphasizing the "more artificial, the higher you are". <br /> Eustache and Proust think that the artist is a translator of the inner truth. However, Alexandre failed Eustache's success. La Maman et la putain proves what a character actually is. You can feel the tragedy when going on the film. You can see it in front of the more visible Alexandre as dead and dead. As you can see, the scenes take longer and, after some time, are beyond anything. At the end of the film, when you see Alexander and Veronica ask him whether he wrote his own life, he can not even say that the literature is unsuccessful. The end of the film shows the symbolic death of Iskender, who collapsed under the weight of truth. It looks like Albertine more than Alexandre Marceld in the little nursing room. <br /> <br /> In order to explain this failure, we can say Alexandre Balzac is a reader. In Forme et signification, Jean Rousseau Proust, Swan and Balzac's readers, explains that they can not do any artistic creation, because they are actually compressed with art. They see the truth in art and are "unaware of the changes between the artist and his work, the truth, and the art." And exactly Alexandre. He, for example, "loves a woman for parallel reasons, because she has played in Bresson's example." <br /> <br /> "Perhaps he is his wife". This idea is by Eustache, who actually committed suicide even though it was called by Alexander. But there is a difference between Alexandre and Eustache: if Eustache is totally Alexandre, Alexandre is like a dreadful art, a terrifying vision that frightens the artist's fears. <br /> <br /> Veronica At the end of the film, Alexandre is convicted of illusions. The last frame of the film is death in front of Jean-Pierre Léud and reminiscent of Veronica's infinite source. Or maybe it's not the hell of Sarten's description of the end of Huit-Clot, and it's not exactly like Le Temps retrouvé. When he read Eustache Proust, Alexander did not finish his book, and always tried his life and life by Veronica in his apartment or cafe. "La Maman et la Putain", "A la Recherche du temps perdu", "Looking for missing times" that Marcel is a writer (Genette), explaining that Alexander will not be an artist <br /> <br /> If Baudelaire says , an artist explains the reality of "the light of the dream," Eustache tells us that La Maman et la Putain is his nightmare.
