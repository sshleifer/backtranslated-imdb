There is an inevitable hunger for "some training" films, and it is surprising that they are aware of this when released for the first time. Tigerland is somewhat unusually great in some ways, with some terrifying symbols (especially the images of NGOs, 'Ermey' for the return of Lee 'Full Metal Jacket for a long time) but Colin Farrell's lead performance is instantaneous stardom products. He would kill the incense and kill any actor.
