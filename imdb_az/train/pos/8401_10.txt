The love trap should "see" an independent film. When I sat down to watch the movie, I came down with low expectations, but I was blessed. The story is poetic, substantial, and creative. The writer extends you to every scene and connects you with the real features that can be determined by each scene. The film allowed me to think about my life and my love. The film really does not show emotion, it's not emotion. I was impressed by the quality of cinematography and movie. The whole presentation was superior to my expectations. I give the film two big heads and I advise everyone from all ages and roots.
