Almost every theory of this film I saw was pretty bad. It's not pretty bad, though it's really good, it's not good. Judy Garland's character could have fooled him, but he did not. I've come across a trench, at least in the '40s I fell in love with Van Heflin and envied him. Judy is great to read, but the movie misses a great chance not to show more of their relationships. I gave him 7.
