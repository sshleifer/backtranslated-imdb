I agree that he wrote "vein" about the "Ahhhh" feeling you got at the end of this movie. I really liked the place where they chose the film, the songs were well written and interesting, especially when Hans Matheson read the psychedelic soundtrack. This trippy. Nighy was fab in his role, Nail "nailed", Beano was a typical drummer and Rea was kept together. Bruce Robinson was awesome. Helena was a pretty girl. But I felt that Juliet Aubrey's performance was fine. The scenes between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! We played perfectly and the music behind the scene was spot on! Too bad, more musicians have checked this movie! I told all my musician friends. A beautiful offer from Jimmy Nail's character: "It's not rock and roll, but it's gonna be Phantom!"
