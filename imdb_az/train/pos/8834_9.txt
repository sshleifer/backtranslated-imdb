A very well-prepared movie for the communist Yugoslavia in the early 60's. The five young actors, who are in the center of the story, are strong, sincere, and emotionally profound. Clearly describe how teenagers can easily manipulate natural beliefs and naivets and affect the rest of their lives. Be advised.
