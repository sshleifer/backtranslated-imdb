This film is carried out at a very high level so it's scared that my score is so low (5.9 / 10 (576 votes)). This film has incredible special effects, a true epic story, a complex, great character interaction and mind-blowing horizons - they must be believed! The only complaint I receive is the subtitle of the HK DVD I received (some lines have not been translated). <br /> <br /> When I read and hear from different sources, I do not understand: "There is a bewilderment ...", "I could not follow the story ..." or "The characters came from nowhere ...". For the first time, I watched this movie, understood, watched it, I knew why it was, and I absolutely loved it! I watched it about 8 times, and every time it is a pleasure. Oh, and that's not just my idea, because I gave this movie to many Americans (the same people who did not look at the previous HK movie) in the same way. None of them succeeded in watching the story, and each man declared his love for this movie. O man, why can not we have such things from Hollywood? At least the Lord of the Rings had a wonderful marriage with special effects, character development, and story line. <br /> This is also the story of Asian girlfriend lover. I have a large public library of Asian films and this movie is one of the biggest DVDs. When you watch it, you will be blown up with beautiful special effects and epic feel of this movie. You will be drawn to this fantasy world and you will not want to leave! </ strong> </ strong> <p> <p> <p style = "text-align: justify;"> I have an additional complaint about this movie I did not want to end it ... I beg you, Mr. Hark - can we ask for a later?
