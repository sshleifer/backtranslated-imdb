I can get myself ahead of myself, but even though it's a technical work for the film itself, I explained to MTM yesterday evening that I was wondering: Why did they do it? they risked their lives, many died on the track, why did they travel to such a life-threatening journey to find their food (!) after they reached the "milk and honeycomb"? Do they stay there? Are you endangering your life and the safety of your entire congregation to find food for the flock of animals alone? As it is dangerous to carry out this purpose alone, it shows the perfect simplicity of such people. Risk of death for a cow? Better than they are!
