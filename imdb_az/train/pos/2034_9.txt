I did not have a great time in IMAX movies. They are cool, but once "It's like flying!" The films themselves are quite mixed and ordinary. <br /> <br /> Exceptions are strong, "Everest", exciting "Wild California" and the body's "Human Body" body, which is a large-sized appearance. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are complexity machines, and this is simply impossible. This 50-minute movie could have been 10 hours long and I still do not go to all systems running in tandem as I have written this review and listen to radioumu, and most of it takes it to accept all of it. <br /> <br /> Here, in the heart of a single heartbeat (like a foreign spaceship), in your lungs, in the thirst, the small hairs in the thirst, the bone process, the development of a baby inside the mother, and, surprisingly, I thought it was far away from less attractive functions (acne, decay of acne in the stomach ...), unlike other IMAX documentary films, it has a very strange style. For example, we all found sperm on the egg, but did you find Marvin Geyan's "Get It On On" melody? The "human body" is not just a health lesson, but also fun recreational moments.
