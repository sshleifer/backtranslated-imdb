Personally, this is one of the favorites of all time! No, I'm not 10 ... I'm 30 years old! I'm an old, original VHS I've got from a rental store. <br /> <br /> Although fun for kids, it's an adult movie. I once saw this movie ... I'm not sober. my eyes were opened to what I had never seen before. I've seen how strong morality has been promoted, both in an open and subliminal way. I remember everything I was particularly proud of, but it has been a long time since then. We can be assured that there are tons of things he says throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> <br /> <strong> strong> nice!
