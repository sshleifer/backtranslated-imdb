This is one of the best films I've ever seen. Film shooting is unusual, sometimes enthusiastic. She also won the Oscars for the best photography, and it was worth it. <br /> <br /> There are many films in my movie collection, and many have seen them. Many of them are beautifully or equally beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's a unique and generally great movie. Casting is terrible and it does a great job of describing their characters. We remain committed to their dedication and are very emotionally involved. On the way, we learn about ourselves and our lives. I think it represents the majority of this movie and how it is presented. I recommend it warmly
