Saving Grace is a great movie to watch in the afternoon, when you are looking for something different from regular scripts and want to have some fun. I would like to say that the whole idea of ​​this movie and all the secrets of this film is such a madness! This was the first movie I really watched on this subject, which I did not criticize (dermatological / marijuana), just joking about it. Grace Trevethyn is a widow who lives in a small city in England and has many financial problems because of her deceased child who committed suicide because of her debt. The point is that Grace should pay all her pays to her debts in order not to lose everything she does, especially her favorite home, thinking that she has earned money for her. He had never worked and decided to partner with him, who sold large quantities of cannabis as much as the gambler Matthew.
