Since this movie is entirely in the Swiss dialect, most German speakers are really hard to watch this movie. I'm not from Switzerland, but I've been there for several years and have found the opportunity to understand this great parody of the Lord of the Rings. I've seen such kinematic films (for example Scary Movie, Scifi spoofs, etc.) but this is one of the best I've ever seen. I'll give you 10. The only reason they can not get 10 is because there are some small things that can be done better and have no subtitles in any language on DVD, so there's almost no chance. non-Switzerland should understand.
