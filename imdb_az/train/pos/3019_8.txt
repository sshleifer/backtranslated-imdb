First of all, I liked the canal 1, there were many classic jokes, including always falling into the wrong place and still failing in the canoe, acting as the same guy on the canopy 2. film, but in my opinion, the performance of the HEP is not as fun as it was in the first movie, but you will not really feel it. What makes me worry about this movie is the choice of boats, there are only racing boats in this movie, they are pretty fast, but there are no waves like the big floating flats used in the first movie, the better ones and these new boats, the man in one of the last scenes, It may seem ridiculous when jumping suddenly to avoid "big waves" from small speed boats. Really a negative. You must admit that we did not live in the same Sweden as in 1974. This film is less violent than the first one. Although the film is all amazing. I just had some donations, but the rest of the film was for my expectations! That's worth the money.
