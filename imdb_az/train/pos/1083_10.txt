An example of Cary Grant's unique talents. An Academy Award-winning performance, once again prevented by the Academy. Mr. Grant slipped out of this beautiful comedy about a man who decided to leave the city. <br /> <br /> The danger of building a home is a good chronicle and has become the basis for the "Money Pie" for a more modern Tom Hanks tool. <br /> <br /> If you want a good old comedy without curse, you need to see this movie, a self-love relationship.
