It should be noted that Ford is less well-known and more star players than Young's supporters. In addition to ensuring that the film focuses on the central character of Lincol, as well as its place and time as a person, Lincolna gives a stunning insight into the issues of insult, the feelings of his time and the way to solve them. It's not Ford's words and actions, but Ford's younger appearance on the face, the presence of space in the public and politics, and the reactions of Ford's supporters to how the people respond. <br /> <br /> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <br /> < </ STRONG> Mr Lincoln addresses the characters that support you - I expect you to be rewarded with a deeper appreciation of both Lincoln and Ford. I doubt that Ford is suspected of writing stories through the reactions of Fonda's supporters to Lincoln, when he directs Ojar Sharif to Dr. Zhivago, he is the reaction of the characters who really support Zhivago.
