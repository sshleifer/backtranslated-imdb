The last time I saw the film was seven years, so my thoughts can be over. At that time, I liked to shoot a film between cartoon and live action. At that time I was sorry for the blue camel and her sad life. After I missed the Captain Contagious hero (a princess or toy shepherd), I also shouted at the tables. Unfortunately, the producers decided to transfer this movie to VHS, so I have 20 years of memories. I'm sure that if you've seen the movie again, I would say it's sad and glad, but I really enjoyed this movie.
