This movie is about reconstructing two of the better ones. Lastly, hell can wait, it was great, I suggest to see it again. It's not that great. The last three of the film was not bad, and Chris Rock is starting to show some funny entertainment when he's in the area. But I do not know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. They play some really bad "B" movies. Situations are forced and they try to get the story because they can only start a real movie. All appear to be false, and correction is only bad. I do not know how they left this movie. In any case, the last part is not bad, so wait and watch the video.
