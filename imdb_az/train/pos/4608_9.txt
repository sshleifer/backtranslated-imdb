Jackie Chan, the Police Story, one of the greatest actors in the glimpse of silver screen, is known as the heir to the late great Bruce Lee. If the dragon were to go into the knife of Lee in the 1970s, then we can tell about the story of Police Story and Jackie Chan in the 1980s. Do not forget the Rush Hour trilogy, or one of the US efforts - is truly a movie that impresses Chan's perfection, its a high level, the kung-fu tilt of the bumps, and its kino-career, not the Police Story <br /> <br /> Rush Hour, operating in the United States, The Rumble of Bronx, The Medalian and The Tuxedo, and obviously many have become inadequate compared to Police Story . In these films we saw Jackie's less "beaten" version. We noticed that they did not get the opportunity to maximize their combat capabilities and that the battlefields were not as good as anywhere. The Drunken Master will name the Police Story. <br /> <br /> The stunts in this movie are extraordinary and are the best in any action movie. The view of the shopping center is a type of word and must be believed: glass flying balloons, just bare a barefoot driver on the streets of the city, smoking bells outside the bus, and Chan succeeds in successfully using all kinds of lifeless objects as weapons to fight the stairs. <br /> <br /> Taking into consideration that Jackie is capable of hurt every bone and hurt himself, his persistence in showing himself as a stuntman is a bit convincing to Jackie's reputation as a kung fu expert. Especially as it's the hinges she showed. <br /> <br /> A spouse that is nothing. <br /> There are shortcomings in the narrative, which ends with the final actions and sequences. As for the dialogue, the film is not really a big deal. That's why Jackie and most fans of martial arts are interested in more activities. <br /> <br /> Does not have a matrix, no wire or CGI or computerized plot. You see what you're doing and what you get with the Police Story is a great Jackie Chan epic, full of action and pulsator. This is better than the Bronx, Rush Hour and all other American efforts. /> <br /> The Police Story is a great movie, and I strongly recommend anyone to novice Jackie Chan, but I'm not sure who should watch first.
