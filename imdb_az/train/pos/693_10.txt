It is something that can not be explained by the sudden, useless, dead friends, out of the building, and from the hallucination to reality. br> <br /> Dominic Monaghan, like Jack, is really convincing. <br /> <br /> If you introduce a dog in a conversation, we can make those who see what's happening and suddenly see how they look in Jack's bathroom and bedroom (more hallucinations), and an exciting, minute children and shower scene is enough to come back to any Dom fan.
