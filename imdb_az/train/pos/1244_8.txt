I first saw this movie a few years ago on television and liked it very clearly. Charles Dance is one of the most horrible people anyone can imagine. His sophistication is a perfect difference for this wonderful good hero. Not many of Eddie Murphy's fans, but here I found a strange, strangely illustrated description of Axel Foley Looking Glass. Charlotte Lewis, is a hackneyed word, but one is to use a clear, brilliant one. Some scenes have been created in a beautiful way: sleep sequence, bird, terrifying scenes of fight and bilateral conflict. All this Murphy modern human suddenly fell into a surprising and calm version of Kurt Russell in an oriental myth, Oriental fantasy romp. As in that film, we also have James Hong, the scenes, but short, Derek even enhances the quality of the unique actor. Since 1955, Hong has appointed an actor who is a great supporter of his "class action". The Golden Child is stupid; not perfect; but it has many rescue features that are a welcome and entertaining fantasy that is worth the wait. Four years later I saw the Golden Child again; I liked it more! It is really entertaining.
