Paul Greengrass has definitely been saved for the best Bourne! I heard many people complaining about this movie, and some of them compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. I have to say all this ... you cheated on me? The bride was not that bad. I think it helps feel more sense of action scenes, and I will give preference over highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the film, I did not really notice it. <br /> <br /> Damon can actually say that she has the comfort of Jason Bourne's role. Sometimes it may be a bad thing, but in this case it's really a good thing. She is really Jason Bourne in this section. Damon also plays a major role in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the game, adding more depth to the CIA. <br /> <br /> Although the film is full of great car drives and enduring moves, it has managed to survive a fair amount of character development along with all that. This film stands on the other two Bourne films and is definitely one of the best in the 2007 spring season!
