"Foxes" is a film that describes adolescents in the late 1970s. I contacted this movie because I was exactly the age of Jodie Foster. He deals with revolts, wishes, relationships and youth revolts. Soundtrack is great, for example, with inspirational rock. Sad numbers like "Feeling More" by Boston and "About Radio" by Donna Summer. Music of late youth. Yep, even if it's not big, I'll always remember.
