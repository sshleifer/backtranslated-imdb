Old People Show ???? I am 15 years old and I've been watching the show since I was 12, writing Hallmark and BBC 1 everyday in my Sky + box. Indeed, although they did not cancel, they did not receive a good farewell. <br /> <br /> For some of my films, it's great for me. <br /> <br /> - Murder and 'Criminal O He Written' - I have never watched it and did not intend. In any case, he is so deep in the Diagnosis Hero's heroes and the chemistry of the actors is incredible. It was really a sad day when the show was canceled ........
