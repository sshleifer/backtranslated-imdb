The best-remembered 30th fear movies always love Dracula and Frankenstein; There is a good reason for this, but there are some small but still excellent products, and The Invisible Ray is certainly one of them. The area was repeatedly seen (even in 1936) before the original and similar areas, but it is, of course, very creative, as everything is put together, and director Lambert Hillyer has created a very small original fear film. Area is about good hearted Dr. Janos Rukh; A man who found a way to re-create the history of the earth. His discovery finds him to be an unknown radioactive substance in Africa, and he leaves with a group of distinguished colleagues to find him. However, expeditions are subject to tragic strikes and good physician elements; <br /> <br /> The greatest filming of the film is undoubtedly the two most terrifying stars of the day, Boris Carloff and Bela Lugosi, and both give excellent speeches. Karloff really is a good actor and shows that Carloff has a lot of impressions. Bela Lugosi has a very different role than we used to see it, and that's a great performance; It's nice to see some of the directions from Lugocia. The film goes to a very slow start; but things get started soon. The second half of the film is the best, and it is a fact that the film is excited and a chance for Carloff to shine. The film does not pay special attention to the great impacts and is basically based on the actions of the central character to keep things interesting; and works very well. The film is entirely interesting and boils up to a decent summit that completes everything in a beautiful way. Generally, Invisible Rails can not be one of the best films of the 30s; but it is very good and recommended.
