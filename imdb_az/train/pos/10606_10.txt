I just finished watching this movie and I really enjoyed it. It's a quiet little movie that does not show you with special effects or "great" performances. It simply leads to the lives of people living in a small area in North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas gives a good performance like Raymond Toker, a young, young boy who has an abandoned baby in the woods. Toker's search for the baby's parents takes him on a journey that will have a profound impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester. And David plays the perfect man. <br /> <br /> This film has more than it has been for the first time. It's worth watching the movie taken in the state of North Carolina and with beautiful sounds of traditional music.
