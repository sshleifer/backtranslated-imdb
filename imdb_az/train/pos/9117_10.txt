This film gives us an interesting warning about how easy it is to deal with many untrained jobs. As a group of African people, we owe it to ourselves to make a change in this "whole talk and action" cycle, and start to make changes, talk less and act more. This is a powerful expression of the division of our people on small issues and our mistakes need to be combined to create a greater picture and difference ... Despite the Black community appeal, all viewers can learn something from the message that you want to describe in this film.
