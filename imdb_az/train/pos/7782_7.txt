photography was nice, but it was hard to understand what was happening ... are there many symbolisms? ... 2 roses - something in Thai culture? There is not much, there is not much and only goes somewhere. no real start, no real average and no real ending. <br /> <br /> <strong> <br /> Movement is chaotic and disjointed. I do not know what our brothers who did not know would wait for. Perhaps it would be more meaningful if it were in Thailand ...
