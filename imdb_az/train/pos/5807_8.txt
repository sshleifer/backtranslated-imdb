This is a very good movie, in my opinion, especially for Michael Jackson lovers. <br /> <br /> The main film is centered around the song Smooth Criminal and the music video. Unlike four-minute music videos, this is a normal speed, and in my opinion, it's easier to watch. <br /> <br /> Along with this, the plot is very strange. Michael Jackson plays a magic "gangster", when he sees a shooting star, turns into a machine machine. Throughout the film is a race car, a huge robot and a space ship. <br /> <br /> Especially the robot scene is a little drawn and strange. I got a little up compared to the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> A kid kidnapped, Michael is trying to save him, tortured and beaten, and suddenly becomes a giant robot, causing all the bad guys. A little strange? Yes. <br /> <br /> Along with a strange robot scene, this is a very good movie, and any Michael Jackson admirer Ham Smooth Criminal will enjoy music videos and movies.
