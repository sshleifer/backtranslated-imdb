In the 1930s, studios used some short films, such as test yards for new actors, given the relative ease of production compared to long-term feature films, and that's why Shirley Temple, long established, is the most famous child of all time. . Later, he was probably not a tested person, Frank Coghlan Jr, who played the role of Charlie's son Sonny in the film and was less influential in comparison. Later, the 9-year-old Shirley Temple is probably not an easy action to accompany. <br /> <br /> The film opens with an unimpressive look that covers a leaking ceiling. I think, Shirley Temple <br /> <br /> I do not doubt that, despite the sweetness of the movie, it is to show the working class status of the family and to provide a clean passage to the next show. y is a birthday and his father is accidentally trying to hide the fact that he wants to give his son the dog he wants, but because Sonny is afraid of the dog because he embraced it once. His father is interested in accusing him of taking a dog, so Sonny decides to escape more than a dog in the house and he is interested in seeing the movie as if he did not run anywhere in the eye <br /> <br /> Sonny, an iron on the edge of the train tracks On a skillet, a man carries a cooking pastry (after fleeing a train), taking into account how close he is to his ways, he has misled the boy, but at least). After Sonny's unpleasant smile has been shared by the boy, he continues, and the homeless man disappears from the movie. <br /> <br /> In some of the movies, there's some information about the shootings of this movie. It throws down to find a dog covered with burrs. When he left the house for fear of the dogs, he immediately took it and accepted it, but it turned out to me that he was not aware of the power of the dogs, but that they were not missing. <br /> <br /> No, if you need anything, find all the helpless spiders I need and I have determined! <br /> <br /> This is a very comfortable movie that's exactly as it is intended, but it is sufficiently good enough and yet enough (and short enough) to be a fun movie yet. We do not expect an epic plot in a 19-minute movie, but Pardon My Pups is still packing a substantial amount of stories and character development in a short time. And also, Charlie Chaplin has a battle scene at the end of the film giving pride. I'm not an expert on Sherley Temple, but it's hard to see how he is the most famous baby star of all time.
