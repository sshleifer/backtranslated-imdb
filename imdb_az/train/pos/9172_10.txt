I studied Charlotte Bronte in the high school and left me with a stunning impression. There was a beautiful novel about Victorian England's struggle for a young woman to love and admit in dark times. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and plain character with a strong mind and will. Bronte Jane's story with his own eyes was both sad and inspirational. <br /> <br /> As part of our study, we adapted the 1983 story. The Mini-series worked hard to match Bronte's original text and essence, but the characters who described the characters were simply great. Both Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's beloved boy, Rochester) brilliantly captured the essence of their characters. I can not imagine anyone other than their role. Other versions of Rochester do not have the passion, energy and sensitivity needed to accurately describe Rochester's other speeches. I say that it has all these features in the description of Rochester, because Timothy Dalton overcomes. Clarke is not just like Jane Eyre, but Jane's quiet but firm and passionate nature, and she keeps her emotions as Jane in her book, but Jane's description of Jane's Clark and Dalton's scenes and he believes Rochester's respectful relationship and is true). In addition, supporting actors perform their roles perfectly, and the sets fit the story's Gothic nature. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this version of the Classic Bronte tale. If you do not read books before, you can watch this product as a loyal ad for this beautiful story.
