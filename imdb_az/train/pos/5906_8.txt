Doghi is a beautiful film and Renuka Daftardar is great. Perhaps Uttara Baokar is very good in most of his roles. In addition to Kairee, she is the best in Marathi cinema. Both Didactic films have certain parts - it would have probably improved the film so that there were not a few scenes in which social messages were shot. These scenes are likely to arise from the political problems of the filmmaker, but the film is realistic and does not need enough effort. But in addition to such small squares, I come to a movie that's going to be more and more violent. Sumitra shines through Bhave's illness and humanism.
