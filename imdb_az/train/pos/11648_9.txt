It's another people who claim to be a "bad language" ultra violent Mexican film. They are right, but this is a challenge to be aware of that. The terrible truth emerges, or when you perceive the paradigm of the third world as only a possible purpose. One of the most important things of "Cero yi van cuatro" is an invitation to deep reflexion from our existing identity. Is this all this? All this we want to be? As I was abroad I realized how Mexican society was spoiled when the Tlahuac event was lit up. I still do not understand the audience who witnessed mass murder. When I saw some of the images, I nearly dropped the puck. The leadership was a small village near Mexico, not just Iraq and Rwanda, when the media and the government were restrained. It was a shock to me in a similar situation. Other stories best describe other cases of corruption, disorder, betrayal and violence, but I think Tames de Chivo is good. <br /> <br /> Some of the movie screams "cabr√≥n" and "pendejo". Compared with the actions of these people is meaningless. Except for a few exceptions, they are perfect examples of all human waste. Just like in real life, honesty is more exception than the rule in our country. Moreover, honesty is rewarded miraculously.
