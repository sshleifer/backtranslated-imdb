Why do you need to study the documentary "Art" on Earth? How much time is there on earth? Can you explain it to me? Okay, I'm not going to extend my exploration intelligence in Earth, but it's my idea to say that you do not see it. The documentary is making a wild trip on the migration route on three animal families: a female polar bear and her real life's lower body and lap daddy dare to hunt for isolated food; Baby vintage with small children (perhaps not small, elephants) who immigrated to Africa, taking an elephant and a whale. Directors Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield worked from "this place" to capture the healing capabilities of many animal species except for three family-owned magnet shots. Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer are filmmakers capable of capturing animals in nature's wildlife and animal instinctive behavior; slo-mo animal predator shoots to avoid being watched. "Earth" is a student on the effects of global warming on animals; In papal polar bear in doc, this is the poster animal. So, it's time to visit fellow earthlings, documentary travel today "Earth"! **** Good
