<br /> <br /> What will you get if you pass The Matrix to Truman Show? <br /> <br /> So far, I'm sure you've seen Matrix. The Matrix creators say that "anime inspired". <br /> <br /> This film was originally built in Japan in the 1980s and actually shows it. Costumes, music, and words (the latest English version by AD Vision) have all been raised directly from the era. I believe it was done at that time, but because of certain points, the film will not come today! <br /> <br /> Perhaps, as I said, referring to Matrix, the world is not real. Indeed, it's not 1980's. In fact, it's more like 2480s. After the war, the Earth (or the "Biosphere Head") ecosystem was destroyed. We are left to survive the conflict. After the planets (or "Biospheres") were all abandoned, people began to live in the MegaZones-space cities, where they believed that we were on the earth with the methods of hypnosis and the Truman Show-esque illusion, the most peaceful time in the 1980s. When the young Shogo acquires a mysteriously-developed-looking motorcycle, he goes out to find out more than he needs to know ... A weapon from the 2400's, Garland (a cyclone-cycling), helps Shogo out of his running . more and more about military MegaZone, the war is approaching home, and the war comes at MegaZone for conflicts between military and computer ... I apologize for these points appear to be spoilers. <br /> <br /> /> As a result of the vote, you really believe the war is continuing, and Shogo is afraid of the things he really discovers. What started as a Uber-happy cool 80's sliding is a tragic story of war and inequality. These heroes are real people, not the pieces of paper that we returned in the Matrix. People are the means of suffering and war that can go after such a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> According to some reports, a few days ago, a few days ago, Art style is beautiful and traditional anime, very cultural reminiscent. Get ready for much violence and blood, there is also an erotic sex scene. <br /> <br /> It may be a "end to end" matrix, or maybe, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is one of the best animes I've ever seen, <br /> <strong> <strong> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> < <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> Generally, MegaZone 23 is an incredible movie and deserves to be worth it. held at a high level and important in the collection of any anime fan. Heck, my mom enjoyed it.
