So we insulted. It was a very charming movie, I liked the direction of art (most of the children's films I felt "real"), and the costumes were not so brave. It was not bad for kids to watch the players (cheese-prone adolescents). <br /> <br /> I do not know how small children want to see for themselves, but that's a great thing. A movie to take a child. And because "Barnyard" probably attended 100+ children at the same time, I'm really glad to have chosen to take a less sparse part instead of "worms".
