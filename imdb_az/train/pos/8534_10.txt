Eric Stoltz presents an extraordinary performance as a young romantic Joel Garcia, a successful young romantic returning to the grave in a catastrophic and private hospital for people with disabilities after breaking his neck as a result of a traffic accident. Joel, a slippery, fast-talking, seductive woman Raymond (incredible Wesley Snipes) and a frightening, booming, surprise, racist biker Bloss (terrific William Forsythe), many ethnic minorities with various lawmakers, learned to pay and adjust the severity of his new, had to share a room by the groups. Joel is a loyal and loving, but gets great support from his married wife, Anna (starring Helen Hunt). <br /> <br /> Certainly, he links himself with people with disabilities. <br /> <br /> The main achievement of this remarkable film is a stubborn rejection of how men have been sanitizing or feeling emotionally transparent. Directors Neil Jimenez and Micheal Steinberg co-ordinate this story with exceptional taste, mentality, and warmth, in particular about how the exertion and the disability are a way of life, including sexual life (this point is Joel and Anna try and when a motel room fails to make love in the stunning sequence is the most powerful). In addition to the anticipated poignancy of the movie, a bad comic raw, highlighted by a contradictory sequence with Joel and Bloss, provides a surprising advantage of the earth's humor. Stoltz, Snipes, Forsythe and Hunt, Grace Zabriskie, Bloss' doting, kind mom and Elisabeth Pena, and William Allen Young, as supportive hospital nurses. In spite of a sad issue, the film proves that it is a very moving, positive, and uplifting cinematography to the surprising power and durability of the human soul. Drama is just a nice little gem.
