At first it seemed like a dull comedy like Odd Couple, but when it came to me it turned out to be a really funny movie. Most of the forgetful comedians were Willy Clark (Golden Globe Winner, Oscar and BAFTA nominee Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar winner and Golden Glove nominee George Burns) were a great comedy duo and brought together their TV show to revive their hospitalized sketches. Willy's nephew Ben Klark (Golden Globe Winner Richard Benjamin) can be sure to come together again with the wrong feelings against each other. They can not always get it, especially when they are chatting, but eventually they do it. Also starring Lee Meredith Sketch (Miss McIntosh) as muppets from the Nurses, Carol DeLuise, Doris Green, Al's daughter, Rosetta LeNoire Odessa, Willy's nurse and Mechanical from Space F. Murray Abraham. Burns says the best line of the film is that Matthau tells him "the son of the fasting whistle." The BAFTA nomination for the Best Screenplay was awarded and awarded the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy Award and nominated for this award. The Best Scenario. Very Good!
