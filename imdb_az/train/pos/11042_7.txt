There are four prisoners in a prison: Carrère (Gérald Laroche), who is fraudulent and betrayed by his wife; his six-month-old brother, Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protégée, delayed Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud); and the intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac) who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an ancient magazine hidden in a hole in the cell wall. They are written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) in the beginning of the last century and are black magic. They decide to read and use content to escape prison when they find the truth about Danvers fate. "Maléfique", the original, interesting and claustrophobic French budget is a terrific movie. The story practically does not have the same place, no cliché, and focuses on the audience until the final stage. I'm a great fan of French cinema, usually romans, dramas and police stories, but recently I've seen good French horror films such as "Un Jeu d 'Enfants", "Belphegor" and "Dead End." <br /> <br /> <span style = "color: red;"> "Sinais Mal"
