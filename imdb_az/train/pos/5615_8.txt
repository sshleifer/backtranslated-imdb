A Jewish and paranoid Caucasian regret. We did a lot of work and worked hard to adapt to Polanski's bad beds and hospitality. Apparently, he is frightened by the habit of showing himself and admired himself, and is terrified by his subsequent advances in his defense against him. Personally, I could do without the cross-dressing element, but I would accept the Psycho-node, and there was a logic given this story. Nevertheless, it could have worked and did not produce a little theater, but then perhaps it was intended that the yard would, in the end, be similar to the appearance of a theater. I can not help but feel the author's feelings that he is not a 'real' Frenchman and a Jew. Still there's plenty to enjoy here, including a beautiful look like Isabelle Adjani and a beautiful performance like the beautiful old Shelly Winters.
