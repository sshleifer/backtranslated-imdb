I want to say that Grand Canyon is one of the most influential films I've ever seen. I've looked at it a few times now and feel like it's the first time; This film can form a whole curriculum for a post-graduate course. <br /> <br /> Long ago, filmmaking was used to promise: "It will make you laugh, and you will be crying." This is a very strange and shorthand method of explaining what the Grand Canyon is. He leads you to the best places in human experience and leads you to the gates of Hell. <br /> <br /> Most of the film will go on to progress among people close to happiness and horror. It's always a short step. <br /> <br /> It is simply to swing with grace and manipulate it with no false or exaggerated appearance. <br /> Spoiler (species) comes. Having gained the audience back and forth through the emotional spectrum, the film creates a curve with a good and irreversible sequence, but instead may require sewing for an earthquake with an ordinary marriage, accidentally stabbing with a knife, unwanted wound. The comfort cut off the forgotten, forgotten finger, the earthquake survived, and a neighbor woman said that her old husband had collapsed. The couple runs to help. I cried when I saw this sequence. Every time I saw, I cried. Now I'm crying. It does not make me sad. This is not a particularly sad part. What's tearful is that the few minutes of this movie were PERFECT. This is perfect! Astounding. (end of spoiler) <br /> <br /> There is much talk about the Great Canyon. These epiphanies describe relatively ordinary people living and allow viewers to vicariously practice them. They are not long-suffering or beaten, and there is no long break to consider the moment. The film is moving in the speed of life. Although the heroes were trying to understand what was happening, they did not know what to do with their experiences. <br /> <br /> The Grand Canyon is a very human film.
