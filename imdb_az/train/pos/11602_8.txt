Now, when I was shown on TV in December 2000, I enjoyed watching the Contaminated Man for the first time. An infectious disease specialist (William Hurt) loses his family when he enters an unknown illness and kills them. Now a few years now in Russia or somewhere. I do not know, I'm not sure where exactly it is, it's going to be somewhere in this area. In any case, due to budget deficits in an infectious disease laboratory, they have to take most of their employees. One of them is a magnificent security force, named Mr. Joseph Muller (named after Peter Weller), who wants to have a robocop, and wants him back to work. She is divorced and needs this job as she needs to pay her child support. So, going there, the battle is over, and some things are thrown on dangerous things. Soon, Muller discovered he was infected with a deadly pathogen. In fact, this is a deadly thing, a drop of blood will kill a person in seconds. Coming soon, Hurt was called to investigate and then merged with an American reporter. Muller now decides to visit his wife and son to go home, and can not stand anything even if he needs to be infected with the entire Russian population. <br /> <br /> Now this movie is Falling Down. Although we have to kill a few people in this process, we have an uneasy concern that we can not cope with anything to achieve our goal (Weller, Michael Douglas). <br /> <br /> <strong > <br /> <br /> 8/10
