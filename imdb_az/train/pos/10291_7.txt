After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny movie that says something positive. Jim Carreyin was one of his best performances, but still OK. Morgan Freeman was just like God. Jennifer Aniston had a good moments. Steve Correll's "DAILY PICTURE!" Missing <br /> <br /> I love the director Tom Shadyac's movie choices. He was also LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS and NUTTY PROFESSOR. All three of these, James Bruce, also receives a big comedian star and explains a human story with him. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they do not use the Bible references more often. <br /> <br /> A comedian director can take his talent and can say a meaningful and intelligent story. I only remember the reference to three special bibliography, and they were the three most exciting parts of the whole film. I guess the first few scenarios of the script were more references to the Bible, but they were cut off because they were afraid of insulting people. <br /> <br /> My price: <br /> <br /> From 10 to 7
