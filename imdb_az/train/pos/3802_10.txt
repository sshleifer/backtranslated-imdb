Dragon Hunters must be the best-looking cartoon I've ever seen. It was a jaw. The film is about looking at a girl who is dreaming about being a strange furry blue dog and a knight in search of a few coins, and several rogues are sent to a quest to go to the end of the world to kill them. Secular welders, an incredibly large dragon. But honestly, it does not matter what the movie is. Because it is beautiful jacket. In this fantasy world, weight is different, so the architectural blocks and land plots change the same way between cathedrals and fortresses and villages, and have drifting lilac woods. The world is so creative, so look at the rare, beautiful, kind of silent story book. It resembles many beautiful works in the world. Monsters are also surprised by their ability to visualize, as a dragonfly of a bunch of evil red bats. Some of the sites are not so original, like heroes, they turn their farm into one of the Mice and men and never make it in the world; but the perfect graphics, some serious mistakes and emotion-winning dialogue make this movie spectacular.
