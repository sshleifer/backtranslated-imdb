This film was a brilliant concept. In fact, it is not our "conformist" filmmakers, but our foolish, written and high-end charm. Do not get me wrong - there are some great movies with great appeal, but when you go to a movie based on "everyone is watching it" - or you're from or really thought. Most people, apparently, were apparently fine, although it was clear. The actors described their heroes with aplomb and thought that this film was more "personal". Children apply for adults as well. Esp. it's best to find a good movie that is not packed with sex references and drugs! A great movie should not be ignored under public consumption. You need to buy this one.
