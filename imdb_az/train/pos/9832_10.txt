Wow was a great Italian "ZOMBIE" film by two major directors Luci Fulci ("ZOMBIE") and Bruno Mattie ("LIFE DEATH HELL") Lucio took the film and was sick, took over the great Bruno and led by Bruno Mattie If you see the movie "ZOMBIE" under the direction of Lucio Fulci, you see the movie "HELLI OF LIFE" and if you like both or both, this is a movie you need. "ZOMBIE" looks at the great look of makeup witch "ZOMBIES" has a funny "ZOMBIE" flying head! "ZOMBIE" is a spicy spit for you and your "ZOMBIE" (Happed To Two People), but it is basically just like the "ZOMBIES", which is just like Bruno Matties, "Living HELL" .However, ZOMBIE ", Italian" ZOMBIE "movie!
