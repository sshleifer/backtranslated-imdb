Why was not this released? I do not think it should be a little trash, because it did not happen. How a girl can be wrong! This movie is, in a word, a thrilling thing. <br /> <br /> You will envy. <br /> <br /> The last part of the film is inevitable, as is the "episode" (without what you see on the trader as well). You choose the one you love, you're shocked, and you can prepare a cup of coffee for what you can do. Adrenaline rises and you can not watch. Slandering the actors is very convincing. <br /> <br /> This also raises the question of watching the truth of television. And how far from it, really? Endemol (his older brother) last year made a television program offering a kidney to a woman who died in a transplant in the Netherlands. At the end of the presentation, it turned out to be a visible betrayal for increasing body consciousness, but are we too close to comfort?
