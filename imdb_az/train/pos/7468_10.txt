As I said in a line summary, when I left the theater, two films left a comment with me. <br /> <br /> Together with Kevin Bacon, the "Blaze of Light" and the second was Vanilla Sky. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sit down deep in the theater, stop wondering what will happen to the end of the film, One of these films, I do not feel you're a guy with you and that you're moving around something other than what's in the movie. <br /> <br /> One thing is certain. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's one of the best films I've ever seen and the best and most shocking movie about the movie. My life and purpose in this world.
