I'm a great admirer of Stephen King's work, and this movie made me a big fan of the King. Pet Sematary, about the Creed family. They have moved to a new home and look happy. There is a cat cemetery behind their houses. Creed's new neighbor Jud (explains by Fred Gwyne) explains the place of the grave behind the pet cemetery. These graveyard places are clean. Judge Louis tells Kredis that when a person (or any animal) pushes them to the grave, they will return to their lives. The only problem is when they come back, they are not the same person, they are bad. Soon, when everything about the Pet Sematare is explained, everything begins to go to hell. I do not already explain because I do not want to give one of the main parts of the film. Pet Sematari's operation was pretty good, but a little work was needed. The story was one of the main parts of this movie, mainly, it was original and gloomy. The film has a lot of makeup effects that make the movie even deeper and frightening. One of the main reasons why this film was not retracted was actually the makeup effect. This movie is really a pitying character. This character is "Zelda". This special character emerges in the film exactly three times. Zelda, sister of Rachel Creed, died a few years ago, but Rachel was still angry by her. Zelda was not afraid for the first time she was seen in the film because she did not speak or speak, but the second time she was the worst and the second time she was scared of me to be honest. There is nothing wrong with this movie, it is almost perfect. Pet Sematary gives great fears, some pretty good moves, first-rate structure and make-up makeup. This is really one of the most popular movies of all time. From 10 to 10.
