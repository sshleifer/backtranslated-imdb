"Pecker" proves that Waters does not think of changing his sticky ways in his old age. Waters changed a lot after starting filming in the 1960s, but after 40 years, he still does what he wants. Over the years, the Waters movies have grown dramatically. This is one of his latest productions, but I was surprised that Waters still had a "trailer park" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, who is cautious with photography. Baltimore, MD, lives with her friends and her family. But Pecker is attracting the attention of a New York art agent (Lily Taylor, who always waits) and his life varies according to his worst. Once again, Waters is entertaining with art, fame and heterosexuality. Not among the best films, but here's the big belly laughter (Memima has the best lines in the film!). Consistently smart and funny, and I have "queer" sensitivity as I come to Warder movies.
