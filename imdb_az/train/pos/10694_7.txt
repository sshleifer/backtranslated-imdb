I've had many experiences with women in Russia, and this movie, unfortunately, describes most of them. They are very cunning, merciless, greedy, and very unfair. <br /> <br /> I have lived in the Caucasus for all those who live in the Caucasus, disrespect, craftiness and betrayal, robotic sex. <br /> <br /> I know what I'm talking about. And here are my features: Here are my three trips to Russia, where I'm going to look for a bride. <br /> <br /> Many hot girls I meet with, the black comedy, the trickery that interests me, and the story of my theft and appearance on the Russian national TV channel contain thousands of peaks. <br /> <br /> http://www.happierabroad.com This is like Reality TV. You will love it. I spent a couple of times together. Check for that. Nicole Kidman's Russian woman, like my photojournalist Julia and Katya. <br /> <br /> 3 bridges for a trip to Russia are very interesting and sell, so why is a movie from my bride looking for adventure in Russia? However, there is a real impossibility in this film, and the boy has ordered a bride from a catalog to bring it to an airport. It does not work in any way, so I do not understand why the media did not want to continue with it. There is no single Russian bridal dating site that works in this way, and I challenge everybody to get acquainted with it. In fact, you can only order Russian Woman's CONTACT INFO (email, address, phone number, etc.). If you meet and visit it and want to bring it to your country, start the immigration process in your INS office and wait a few months later. How is it in real life? You will not only order an airport shuttle. <br /> <br /> <strong> Immigration in the United States will never allow such a thing to happen. <br /> <br /> - I went abroad and bought everything I wanted! You can do that too! http://www.happierabroad.com
