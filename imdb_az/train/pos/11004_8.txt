In the near future, the ordinary man, who surpasses the suspects around Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), is put on a large company by Digicorp, and their rivals are kept secret by Sunways. Morgan's brain was washed in training, Jack accepted Thursby's new identity and traveled to dull lectures. In one of them, beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu) approaches her. She advised her not to see anything. <br /> <br /> Morgan accepts a new truth, does not know who can trust. </ Font> </ font> This movie has not been featured in Brazil, but an interesting and exciting story is very typical and very complicated with many scenarios, trends and performances. Most recently, I recalled Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall". This film deserves to be watched more than once and I really did not like the last field when I kept the controversial disks on the sea. Only the fantastic "Cube" is directed by Vicenzo Natali, and I see this second job as stunning. I have eight voices. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
