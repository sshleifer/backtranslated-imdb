Why, the stupid, awesome, terrifying overrated movie series like Star Wars takes all the amazement, and a really nice movie like this is going to be totally un-memorized ... beyond me ... This movie is really dark, disturbing, sad, The world we are scared of ... <br /> <br /> Unlike the "Elephant" that is brittle, this movie is not one of "one of the typical day until somebody pulls the trigger". This film focuses more on what happens after the incident. <br /> <br /> Deana is a happy and healthy companion who has been hailed by Erika Christensen, who is very hot and very talented, with a great life ... she is shot ... on the day of shooting. She is happily killed, seriously injured and to be in hospital for a while, <br /> <br /> Alicia is also a bad, cold, rebellious, played by very brilliant and talented Busy Phillips, an anti-social goth girl who did not have a positive quality, and she was thirsty when the shooting was happening ... ... she was friends with the shooter and knew what to do ... she was brought to her police station and asked some questions If he knew that shooting would take place, when he refused to inform the police, they were always trying to persuade him to speak to the house ... and he is still there, so the school principal returns to the funeral of one of the dead students ... and when it comes to the principle ... and decides to go to Deana in the hospital ... Of course, she declines it, but the author says that if Alicia does not do so, the police will continue to try to tell him something ... because he really does. see ... <br /> <br /> Single, trauma and physical and emotional wounded Deana h Alicia is happy to see her  xt bir şeydir, amma əlbəttə ki, onu görməkdən xoşbəxt bir şeydir .. Deana ona xoş bir xoşbəxtlik verməyə çalışır, əlbəttə ki, Alicia heç bir şeylə cavab vermir, lakin sərt və zərərli şərhlər və onun necə olduğu barədə sərt bir bəyanat verir. he has no intention of being alone and being friends with him. But sooner or later this intention will change ... (and all I have to say): This is one of the most moving films, as well as one of the darkest and worrying ones. In fact, in my opinion, many graphic scenes and images there is! Perfect and Unforgettable Movies! I'm so ashamed that I know so much about it!
