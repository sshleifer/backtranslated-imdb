For the first time, I saw this movie on a local station in the horror show on Sunday afternoon in 1969 or 1970. We were a little kid at that time, but I liked it and I was really scared. I thought it was such a cool and very original story. Think back, I was still amazed that T.V. Since this movie I have called this movie, I have seen it again and always loved it. In a film, John Waters would have thought he would worship this movie. It's not just a scary movie, but it's also one of the simplest, most terrifying movies ever made. And, surprisingly, you do not hear this movie as soon as you get a movie like "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes". This is a follow-up of the culprit, but in my opinion, it's really a classic classic. As we know, Blood Festival appeared shortly before it was released, and it really became one of the first truly "black" films. In fact, this film has elements Hershell Gordon Lewis and a little Russ Meyer thrown out for a good measure. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend this for anyone who loves bare, sleazy, black and white horror movies. Early in the 1960s (I consider the date of 1960).
