As the story is sweet, it is a dream singularity (and what a masterpiece) of the film, as it dances and sings in the main part of the film. This is really the highest form of American music (Gershwin), an attractive beauty of French impressionist art, no color palette for Kelly's charming choreography (including its genuine "pas de de amour", really a separate genre) did not prepare. A masterpiece of the rich music and visual explosion with dances was a true masterpiece of a great genius and great artist.
