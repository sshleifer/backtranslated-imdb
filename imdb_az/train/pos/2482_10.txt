Actors, especially Kenneth Branaq, are playing well. It is good that Robin Williams won Osiric's role as a comedian, but it may be a bit strange to see him in such a production. When Kenneth decides to use the full version of the text, it is really good that it is not always a matter of time ... So, he sees the audience as a part of the director, not the choice. Thanks to God who gave the film a classic shape; NO for SIrealist fanfaberies! Although Tytus Andronicus is impressive, Hamlet is still a different story, at least this is my idea.
