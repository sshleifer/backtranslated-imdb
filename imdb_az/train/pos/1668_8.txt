Artimisia was late at night. At first I did not think I wanted to do that, but I did not feel like a dream yet, and watched that I was looking at something else and felt that I was interested in a young, clean, passionate young Artimisia. Famous romantic feelings acquainted with old Tassi. Although the film is based on a very romanticized level and reality, I liked it more than ordinary biographies and costumes. Great game, great cameras, great music and texts. I like it and want more than that! :-)
